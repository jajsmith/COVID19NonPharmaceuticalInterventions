Four new cases of COVID-19 have now been confirmed in Alberta, bringing the total number in the province to 23, all travel-related. One patient continues to recover in hospital, while all others are in isolation at home. “We are doing everything possible to limit the spread of COVID-19 in our province. The virus is spreading rapidly and is now a global threat. We are implementing these new measures to slow its spread and limit the risks in the weeks ahead. Protecting the health of Albertans is, and always will be, our top priority.” Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Chief Medical Officer of Health. “The coming weeks are vital in our fight to protect Alberta from COVID-19. These are serious steps, and ones we do not take lightly. I am calling on every Albertan and organization to assist our public health efforts and do their very best to comply with the public health guidance. It is critical that Albertans come together to do our part in keeping Albertans healthy and safe.” Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health. New public health restrictions. Alberta is asking organizers to cancel any events that have more than 250 attendees. This includes large sporting events, conferences and community events. It does not extend to places of worship, grocery stores, airports or shopping centres. Any event that has more than 50 attendees and expects to have international participants, or involves critical infrastructure staff, seniors, or other high-risk populations should also be cancelled.Events that do not meet these criteria can proceed, but risk mitigation must be in place, such as sanitizer stations and distancing between attendees. At this time, schools and daycares can remain open but steps should be taken to ensure that no more than 250 individuals are in the same room at any given time. Effective March 12, all Albertans who are currently outside the country should self-isolate on their return for 14 days, independent of the country they were visiting.

Public Health resident Dr. Richelle Schindler has been working on the province's response to COVID-19 since January.  She said in mid-March there was a surge in COVID-19 cases and it became clear that the work they'd been doing on increasing Alberta's contact-tracing capacity needed to be enacted immediately.  Medical students mobilized ""Within the first 24 hours of having those discussions we had already mobilized our first groups of medical students,"" she said. ""Five days later we had trained 150 of them to be ready to go."" Schindler said these U of C medical students are playing a vital role in contacting Albertans who have come in contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. ""It means that for every case, we identify everyone they have been in contact with while they were able to spread the illness, and connect with them,"" she said. ""This has allowed us to identify people who were sick and get them rapid access to medical care, keep people with less serious symptoms safely at home, and help people take action to protect their friends and family from becoming ill too."" Schindler said countries that have done this thoroughly and well, including South Korea, Japan, and Singapore, have been able to slow the spread in their communities.  Resources being shared nationwide Dr. Jasmine Pawa with Public Health Physicians of Canada (PHPC) said this is a great example of using available resources in the most appropriate ways support the system. ""I think that there's lots of learning for medical students and being a part of this and in the value of public health and public health responses to this kind of work,"" she said. ""I think it's important for us to always balance making the best use of our capacity with appropriate training and direction and that's something that's really happening with an example like this."" Pawa said PHPC is now sharing the resources developed in Calgary — including training materials and an overview of the process —with members throughout Canada. ""There are many places across the country looking at doing things like this,"" she said. ""They've shared that they appreciated the resources."" Pawa said it's possible that nurses and other health-care workers could also be brought into the fold and trained to do contact tracing. 'It's excellent' Dru Marshall, provost for the University of Calgary, said this is a good chance for students to learn, and be of good use. ""It's a fantastic opportunity for medical or nursing students to be doing that from an epidemiological understanding of disease and how disease can be transmitted rapidly in the population. I think it's excellent,"" she said. ""It's also of course most importantly supporting the health-care system at a time that we need it most."" Marshall said it's just one example of how the U of C is supporting the fight against COVID-19. ""We have a really interesting connection happening between social work, nursing, and medicine to provide a supportive environment for students both on our campus and in the community,"" she said.""We also have some of our great researchers on the front line doing COVID-19 research and looking at policies around COVID, and some wonderful researchers helping the province map out the time course of what's happening in Alberta.""

Steps you can take To protect yourself and others: practice physical distancing wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your elbow avoid touching your face with unwashed hands avoid travel outside Canada watch for COVID-19 symptoms: cough, fever, shortness of breath, runny nose or sore throat Follow mandatory self-isolation requirements: 14 days if you recently returned from travel outside of Canada or are a close contact of someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, plus an additional 10 days from the onset of symptoms, should they occur, whichever is longer 10 days minimum if you develop any COVID-19 symptoms, or until the symptoms resolve, whichever is longer If you have concerns about your health: take the COVID-19 self-assessment call Health Link 811 for further instructions if directed by the self-assessment tool do not go to an ER or clinic – if you need immediate medical attention, call 911 and inform them you may have COVID-19 Practice physical distancing Physical distancing involves taking steps to limit the number of people you come into close contact with. It can help you reduce the risk of getting sick. This is not the same as self-isolation. You do not need to remain indoors, but you do need to avoid being in close contact with people. We are asking all Albertans to practice physical distancing to help protect themselves and limit the spread of COVID-19. To protect yourself and others: keep at least 6 feet (about the length of a hockey stick) from others when going out for groceries, medical trips and other essential needs limit the number of times you leave your home for errands try to shop at less busy times order online to have groceries or other items delivered if possiblego for a walk in your neighbourhood or park while maintaining distance from others avoid overcrowding in elevators or other enclosed spaces follow Alberta’s mandatory restrictions on mass gatherings wash or sanitize your hands after touching communal surfaces Medical masks Medical masks include N95 masks and surgical or procedure masks. N95 masks protect from exposure to biological aerosols that may contain viruses or bacteria. They are generally only required during specific, high-risk medical procedures. Surgical or procedure masks provide a barrier to splashes, droplets, saliva or spit. They are not designed to fit tightly against the face. Medical masks must be kept for health care workers and others providing direct care to COVID-19 patients and will not beiverted away from these groups. Non-medical masks Wearing a non-medical mask, such as a homemade cloth mask, has not been proven to protect the person wearing it. However, it may be helpful in protecting others around you. Face coverings should only be used in addition to other steps to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. Face coverings are another way to cover your mouth and nose to prevent respiratory droplets from contaminating other people or surfaces. Additionally, wearing a mask may stop you from touching your nose and mouth. If you choose to use a non-medical face mask: you must wash your hands immediately before putting it on and immediately after taking it off (in addition to practicing good hand hygiene while wearing it) it should fit well (non-gaping) you should not share it with others Face masks can become contaminated on the outside, or when touched by your hands. When wearing a mask, take the following precautions to protect yourself: avoid touching your face mask while using it change a cloth mask as soon as it gets damp or soiled put it directly into the washing machine or a bag that can be emptied into the washing machine and then disposed of cloth masks can be laundered with other items using a hot cycle, and then dried thoroughly. non-medical masks that cannot be washed should be discarded and replaced as soon as they get damp, soiled or crumpled dispose of masks properly in a lined garbage bin don't leave discarded masks in shopping carts, on the ground, etc. The most important steps you can take to prevent the spread of infection are: consistent adherence to good hygiene such as proper hand washing following all public health orders staying home whenever possible and practicing physical distancing when you need to go out This is why people who have a cough or respiratory symptoms must wear masks and wash their hands when visiting an emergency department or clinic. Enforcement On March 25, Alberta’s Chief Medical Officer of Health issued orders under the Public Health Act to legally require returning international travellers, close contact of confirmed cases, and people exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms to self-isolate. Law enforcement agencies have been granted full authority to enforce public health orders and issue fines: Through amendments to the Public Health Act, community peace officers and police will be able to issue tickets to enforce COVID-19 public health orders. Fines administered through tickets for violating an order have increased from up to $100 per day to a prescribed fine of $1,000 per occurrence. Courts will also have increased powers to administer fines of up to $100,000 for a first offence and up to $500,000 for a subsequent offence for more serious violations.

Under the new setup, the general population and people who returned to Alberta in March after travelling abroad are encouraged to stay at home for a period of 14 days, physically distancing themselves from others, instead of seeking testing. Prioritized testing is in place for the following groups if symptoms appear.  People who are hospitalized with respiratory illness. Residents of continuing care and other similar facilities. People who returned from travelling abroad between March 8 and March 12 (before the self-isolation protocols were in place. Healthcare workers with respiratory symptoms ""Changing our testing protocols will allow us to focus Alberta’s testing capacity on those most at risk,"" said Dr. Deena Hinshaw, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, in a statement released Monday morning. ""This is consistent with the approach happening across Canada. It will enable us to strategically use our testing resources. Our new approach reflects the fact that the most important thing anyone can do if they have mild symptoms isn’t to get tested – it’s to stay home and self-isolate.""As of Sunday, there were 259 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Alberta — 164 in the Calgary Zone — and 16 of the cases were contracted through community transmission. According to the province, Alberta Health Services is working to ensure travellers receive proper advice on self-isolation and monitoring symptoms upon their return to Alberta. The testing policy change goes into effect immediately but tests will be conducted on anyone who has been previously told by Health Link that they will be tested. Correction: The original version of this story indicated the self-isolation period for people returning to Alberta after international travel was 10 days. The self-isolation period remains 14 days for travellers",Government of Alberta,,"High risk cases, not travellers, focus of Alberta's new COVID-19 testing policy",https://calgary.ctvnews.ca/high-risk-cases-not-travellers-focus-of-alberta-s-new-covid-19-testing-policy-1.4864148,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Everyone, regardless of whether they’re exhibiting symptoms, would be tested. “This expanded testing does not replace or change any of our outbreak measures,” she stressed. This would not be daily testing; but “a sweep” of tests, Hinshaw added. It is most useful at the beginning of an outbreak and repeat testing would not typically be done, she said. As of Friday, there were 34 long-term care sites with at least one confirmed case of the novel coronavirus. Kenney said 1,124 people have recovered. He said Alberta has a consistently low rate of hospitalizations and ICU admissions. On Friday, 60 people were in hospital; 13 of which had been admitted to intensive care units.

Reporting outbreaks Hinshaw acknowledged that some Albertans were disappointed they didn’t hear about the seven confirmed cases at Calgary’s Foothills Hospital maternity ward before Thursday. In response, Hinshaw said Alberta Health would include all confirmed COVID-19 outbreaks on its website “to support my commitment to be as transparent with Albertans as possible.

2020-03-18,Canada,Alberta,Calgary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,1.0,,Government Website,"TA has implemented a two passenger limit only across all vehicles as an added measure of protection for the safety of our customers and our operators. About half of our seats on our buses will be blocked off with signage to promote physical distancing. Please practice the same etiquette on CTrains and keep two metres distance from fellow passengers.

With far fewer customers during the COVID-19 outbreak, we don’t expect these changes will impact travel times on most of our bus routes. If a bus does reach capacity, please wait for the next bus. Thank you for your patience, as we try to keep our city safe. If you are traveling during peak hours, please allow yourself extra time to get to your destination.

We’ve also closed off the front seats of shuttle buses and the jump seats directly behind the operator on NOVA buses, to further keep physical distance between operators and customers.

2020-04-16,Canada,Alberta,Calgary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,0.0,,Accredited News Agency,"The Calgary Board of Education has officially cancelled its graduation ceremonies this spring, leaving hundreds of Grade 12 students without the iconic rite of passage — a chance to walk the stage and receive their high school diploma in cap and gown.

In conjunction with the City of Calgary’s decision to cancel all public gatherings up until June 30, CBE superintendent Christopher Usih sent a letter confirming the cancellation Thursday. “This decision was not taken lightly,” Usih said.

“We know graduation is an important and meaningful milestone for students, families and friends. It is an irreplaceable event that marks many years of hard work, sacrifice and support.

“We feel your sadness in having to cancel graduations and empathize with students not being able to walk across the stage to celebrate their academic achievement.”

Usih said schools are considering different opportunities for graduates to receive yearbooks and certificates and potential video tributes in June.

The CBE will communicate specific plans related to picking up graduation material and other personal belongings in the coming weeks.

Individual high schools will also share information regarding graduation refunds as it becomes available.

Usih added that given the uncertainty of COVID-19, the CBE is still unable to communicate plans for fall and whether schools will reopen then.

“We want to thank all of our students and their families for your understanding and co-operation. We will all get through this together.”

Officials with the Calgary Catholic School District say they will communicate with their students about graduation when Easter break is over next week.",Calgary Herald,,Graduation ceremonies cancelled for CBE students,https://calgaryherald.com/news/graduation-ceremonies-cancelled-for-cbe-students/wcm/fe1f3666-7689-499b-949b-ec3b21c2290f/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2020-03-24,Canada,Alberta,Edmonton,,,,,,,,,,2.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,1.0,,Government Website,"ETS has made adjustments to the Saturday schedule, adding more buses, where possible, during the AM and PM peak times on busy routes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 15, 17, and 112.  Extra peak service schedule is available. Buses were added on ten routes that have weekday service but do not have service on Saturdays. This improves service for passengers on routes 16 Express, 80, 83, 84, 92, 95, 122, 137, 182 and 331. In a continued effort to protect the health and safety of our Transit Operators and customers, ETS has replaced the current 30’ buses on community routes with 40’ buses with shields, when possible, to encourage physical distancing. As such, ETS has made some minor route adjustments to allow larger buses to serve some community routes. Notable changes include: Route 302 detouring away from Henwood Treatment Centre Route 303 detouring away from private property, resulting in stop closures at Northgate Centre, Shepherd’s Care Centre, Mary A Finlay Manor, Salvation Army Grace Manor, Casa Romana and Safeway Palisades Square/White Oaks Square Route 305 Will no longer travel onto Westmount Centre property. Instead, the route will travel east on 114 Avenue then south on Groat Road.  Also, the route will no longer travel onto Jasper Gates Square property. Please use Bus Stop 5495 (Stony Plain Road eastbound and 150 Street) or Bus Stop 5437 (149 Street Northbound and 100 Avenue) to access Jasper Gates Square.  Route 306 detouring to follow the path of Route 83 through Maple Ridge Route 307 detouring from Gateway Manor, 104 Avenue and 65 Street (Fulton Place) and 94 Avenue and 82 Street (Holyrood). Route 312 maintains current routing, but no longer goes into parking lots of Millennium Pavilion Seniors Lodge, St Michael's Long Term Care, and Londonderry Mall. Londonderry Village will need to use bus stop 7650 on 74 Street northbound at 138 Avenue Route 322 Will no longer travel onto Bonnie Doon Mall property. Instead customers can use existing bus stops along 83 Street. In addition, the existing bus stop at Montgomery Place will be closed and residents will need to use Bus Stop 2585 on 95 Avenue and Donnell Road. Route 340 Will no longer travel directly onto Millwoods Recreation Centre property. The nearest bus stops are now along 28 Avenue. For travel to or from South East Edmonton Seniors Association, Extendicare Holyrood or Golden Home, residents can use the bus stops on 85 Street between 93 Avenue and 98 Avenue.  Routes 126, 317, 318, 319 and 325 will not require a detour to operate with a larger bus.  No ETS transit fare payment required for bus, LRT, or DATS until further notice. Any customer not requiring the use of the ramp or the bus to kneel is asked to use the rear door. Route 747 suspended for all travellers Effective March 25, ETS Route 747 will be suspended for use by all travellers. This includes travellers who have landed at Edmonton International Airport (EIA), as well as travellers heading from Century Park Transit Centre to EIA. However, Route 747 will remain operational as a charter service for regional workers and those travelling locally for essential purposes. This adjustment is aligned with protecting the public and Operators, while supporting regional workers who may require transit service. How to Plan your Trip Customers can view scheduled and real-time trip information in the ETS trip planning tools and third-party tools. They reflect the enhanced Saturday service on weekdays and regular Saturday service on weekends.  For customers who do not have access to online trip planning tools, you can find Saturday schedules in route brochures on buses. Route brochures are also available online. For enhanced Saturday service offered on weekdays during morning and afternoon peak periods, see the frequency table.   Weekdays: Saturday service enhanced during AM (6-9 am) and PM (3-6 pm) peak only. Includes routes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 15, 16 (express), 17, 80, 83, 84, 92, 95, 112, 122, 137, 182 and 331. Saturdays: Normal Saturday service Sunday: Normal Saturday schedules  Regional: Regular weekday schedules until further notice, operating on weekdays only Route 747: use regular schedule (no change) When possible, buses will also be put on standby, for quick response to overcrowding or if there is unanticipated demand at various locations throughout the city. This gives ETS more flexibility, and more opportunity to address issues as they arise. Reducing service now gives transit the assurance we have the healthy staff needed to consistently and reliably run service across the city in the uncertain weeks ahead so most Edmontonians who need transit still have access to it. It also enables efficient use of resources given the significantly reduced demand due to school/post secondary closures and work from home provisions. Cleaning and disinfection Be assured all buses and LRT cars are being thoroughly cleaned and disinfected when they are taken out of service. Additional resources are being used, where possible, to enhance the cleaning of our vehicles and facilities. Customers are reminded to: Follow the protocols of Alberta Health Services Use discretion - please only use public transit if feeling well Continue to practice social distancing, washing hands, covering cough, etc",Edmonton Transit Service,,Reduced Transit Service,https://www.edmonton.ca/ets/reduced-transit-service.aspx,2.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,Government Website,"Edmontonians are reminded to use caution and follow physical distancing guidelines and practical recommendations when interacting in public spaces. Please keep your physical distance; at least 2 metres from others, whether it's on trails, in parks, on stairs, or buying groceries. It’s important to follow physical distancing practices as outlined by Alberta Health Services.

Today, the Honourable Patty Hajdu issued the following statement:

“The Province of Ontario informed the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) earlier this afternoon that they have a presumptive confirmed travel-related case of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The patient, who recently returned from Wuhan, China, is isolated and under care in hospital. All necessary precautions are being taken to prevent the spread of infection. This makes it the first case in Canada, pending confirmation of the result by PHAC’s National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.

The Government of Canada has been working closely with provincial and territorial counterparts, and international partners, since China first reported 2019-nCoV cases to ensure that our country is prepared to limit the spread of 2019-nCoV in Canada. Canadian hospitals have strong infection control systems and procedures in place to limit the spread of infection and protect health care workers.

Measures to mitigate the risk of introduction and spread of diseases like the new coronavirus in Canada are in place, including messaging on arrival screens at the Toronto, Montréal and Vancouver international airports reminding travellers to inform a Border Services Officer if they are experiencing flu-like symptoms, and an additional health screening question on electronic kiosks used by international travellers.

While the risk of an outbreak of novel coronavirus in Canada remains low, I encourage Canadians to tell your health care professional if you have travelled to an affected area of China, and develop flu-like symptoms. You can find more information about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus online at Canada.ca/coronavirus.”

The Honourable François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Foreign Affairs, today issued the following statement:

“The safety and security of Canadians abroad is our top priority. Since January 22, Chinese authorities have restricted non-essential travel to and from the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province in China as a result of the spread of coronavirus.

“We understand the concerns of Canadians in the region and those of their families and loved ones. We are in contact with and providing assistance to Canadians currently on the ground.

“Canadian consular officials are closely monitoring the situation and are in contact with local authorities and our international partners to gather more information and provide support to the extent possible. Canada does not have a consular presence in Wuhan.

“We continue to advise Canadians to avoid non-essential travel to the province of Hubei, China, including the cities of Wuhan, Huanggang and Ezhou, due to the heavy travel restrictions that have been imposed. Canadians should check the Government of Canada’s Travel Advice and Advisories for China before travelling.

“Canadians in the region are encouraged to sign up with the Registration of Canadians Abroad service at travel.gc.ca/registration. This will allow them to receive the latest updates from the Government of Canada.

“Canadians in need of emergency consular assistance can contact the Embassy of Canada to China in Beijing at 86 (10) 5139-4000. Canadians can also call Global Affairs Canada’s 24/7 Emergency Watch and Response Centre in Ottawa at +1 613 996 8885 or email sos@international.gc.ca.”",Government of Canada,,Statement by Foreign Affairs Minister on travel to Hubei Province in China,https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2020/01/statement-by-foreign-affairs-minister-on-travel-to-hubei-province-in-china.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The government remains fully engaged on the issue, and will do all that is necessary to ensure the safety of Canadians, both at home and abroad. Ministers and Government of Canada officials at all levels have been in close contact with our international partners including Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and the World Health Organization to share information on responses to the novel coronavirus outbreak.

Minister of Foreign Affairs François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Health Patty Hajdu, Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan, and Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Bill Blair provided an overview of discussions Canada has had with its international partners on the coronavirus response. They also updated the group on actions being taken to bring Canadians home from the affected areas and prevent and limit the spread of the virus. The Government of Canada has chartered a plane that will fly to Wuhan, and is in the process of finalizing the necessary authorizations to land in China and facilitate Canadians’ departure.

The group discussed actions that will be taken once the Canadians on board arrive from China at the Canadian Forces Base in Trenton, Ontario. These actions include thorough health screenings and a period of observation at the base in order to protect the health and safety of Canadians. They highlighted work being done with provincial, territorial, and local health services to support Canadians upon their arrival and to arrange for further care if the need arises.

The Prime Minister remarked on his visit yesterday to Toronto where he celebrated the Lunar New Year with Chinese Canadians and again underlined the importance of Canadians’ support for each other, and of combatting fear, stigma, and racism.",Office of the Prime Minister of Canada,,Prime Minister Justin Trudeau convenes the Incident Response Group for an update on the coronavirus situation,https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/readouts/2020/02/02/prime-minister-justin-trudeau-convenes-incident-response-group-update,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At this time, there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in our institutions.

We remain in contact with public health authorities. We will reassess this situation on an ongoing basis and provide updates as the situation evolves.

CSC has dedicated health care services in its institutions that have the knowledge and experience to handle cases of infectious diseases and respiratory illnesses, such as COVID‑19. We have an Emergency Preparedness and Response Framework to address planning for an outbreak, which includes contingency plans, medical responses, equipment requirements, and protocols.

We continue to be in close contact with local public health departments across the country so we can stay up-to-date on issues and responses.

The Honourable François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Foreign Affairs, today announced that Canada has issued an official global travel advisory to avoid non-essential travel abroad.

In an attempt to limit the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19), many governments have implemented special entry and exit and movement restrictions for their territories. New restrictions could be imposed, and could severely disrupt Canadians’ travel plans.

As a result, the Government of Canada is advising Canadians to avoid non-essential travel outside of Canada until further notice.

Canadians currently outside the country should find out what commercial options are still available and consider returning to Canada earlier than planned if these options are becoming more limited.

We encourage Canadians abroad to register with the Registration of Canadians Abroad service.

Canadians abroad in need of emergency consular assistance can call Global Affairs Canada’s 24/7 Emergency Watch and Response Centre in Ottawa at +1 613-996-8885 (collect calls are accepted where available) or email sos@international.gc.ca.

Managers to consider telework for all employees, at all work sites, while ensuring continued critical government operations and services to Canadians

The Government of Canada is doing everything it can to protect the health and safety of all Canadians as the country responds to the COVID-19 Pandemic, and that includes its own workforce.

Yesterday, the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat (TBS) provided additional guidance to departments and agencies with the expectation that managers will consider telework for all their employees, at all work sites, while ensuring continued critical government operations and services to Canadians.

The Government will continue to support federal employees from coast to coast to coast, who are now working around the clock – many of them on the front line-- to deliver programs and services and provide guidance based on sound public policy and science.

We are focused on ensuring federal organizations have the guidance they need and plans in place to be ready for all eventualities.

Advice and guidance on human resources, and occupational health and safety is based on science-based health advice from the Public Health Agency of Canada and occupational health advice from Health Canada, informed by guidance from provincial, territorial and local health authorities across the country.

""The health and safety of all Canadians is an absolute priority for our government. Guidelines and directives were sent to all departments and agencies by the Office of the Chief Human Resources Officer.

We are constantly re-assessing the situation and striving to balance both our duty to Canadians and the health and safety of all public servants.""

The health and safety of Canadians, visitors, and Parks Canada team members is of the utmost importance to the Agency. Parks Canada is following the advice of public health experts and taking steps to support the Government of Canada’s efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 and reduce risks to visitors, employees, and other users of Parks Canada spaces.



Effective at 12:01 a.m. on Thursday, March 19, 2020, Parks Canada is temporarily suspending all visitor services in all national parks, national historic sites and national marine conservation areas across the country until further notice. The Agency will be monitoring the situation and will communicate regularly.



Parks Canada will limit its activities to basic critical operations and many staff will work from home. Visitor facilities will be closed temporarily, including washrooms and day use facilities. Some conservation activities will also be temporarily suspended, including projects with external researchers.



While visitor services are temporarily suspended, Parks Canada will continue to deliver a number of critical functions, including highway management and snow removal, fire response, dam operations and water management on historic waterways, as well as avalanche forecasting and control, among others.


Visitors may use front country and backcountry areas as well as accessible green spaces. Should Canadians decide to visit, they should remember that they are always responsible for their own safety. They should consult Parks Canada’s website to be prepared for their visit and be aware of any area closures. Search and rescue services may be limited. Visitors should exercise additional caution at this time and avoid activities with safety risks.


There are a number of tourism businesses and operations within Parks Canada places. These operators are valued partners and provide important services to visitors. They may continue to operate and clients should check with them before visiting to ensure that there has been no change to their services.

Parks Canada will cease taking new reservations until April 30, 2020. All existing reservations for this period will be refunded in full. In addition, the Agency is currently developing an approach to honour passes, in light of travel restrictions and closures related to COVID-19. Details will be communicated in due course.


A complete list of Parks Canada places that are closed and the parameters of these closures will be available on the Parks Canada website soon. Please visit pc.gc.ca regularly for updates.

Parks Canada is committed to protecting the health and safety of Canadians, visitors, and employees. Despite the suspension of visitor services and closure of facilities on March 19, 2020, high visitation levels have occurred in a number of parks leading to public safety and health concerns, as well as increased risk of transmission of the COVID-19 virus. As a result, the Agency is implementing additional measures to support the Government of Canada’s efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 and reduce risks to all users of Parks Canada places.



To reduce the number of visitors at Parks Canada places and to minimize risks to visitors and employees, Parks Canada is building on actions taken last week and is now temporarily suspending all motor vehicle access by visitors at all national parks, national historic sites, and national marine conservation areas effective 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, March 25, 2020 until further notice. This action is intended to significantly reduce visitation and respects the advice of public health experts to stay home and avoid public gatherings.



These measures are additional to steps taken last week and mean that all visitor parking facilities and associated services at Parks Canada places are closed until further notice. Highways and roadways which pass through Parks Canada places will remain open. Commercial and through traffic is permitted on these corridors. Please note that parking is not permitted on highways and roadways. We are asking all Canadians to respect these restrictions.



Parks Canada will continue to deliver services critical for Canadians, including highway maintenance and snow removal, fire response, dam operations and water management on historic waterways, as well as avalanche forecasting and control, among others.



Indigenous traditional activities in Parks Canada locations will continue, but all users are asked to follow the advice of public health experts on social distancing. Local services are limited. Residents of townsites will still be permitted vehicular access, but those with recreational properties within national parks are strongly encouraged to stay home. Please respect all travel advisories.



To be clear, Parks Canada is asking Canadians to stay home. Anyone considering a visit to a Parks Canada location, including those in urban areas, should cancel their plans as vehicle access for the purposes of visitor use will be suspended until further notice.



We ask that visitors support Canada’s efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 and cancel any non-essential travel. Detailed information on Parks Canada places and the measures the Agency is taking to limit the spread of COVID-19 can be found at pc.gc.ca. Please check regularly for updates.




Quotes
“The government’s top priority remains the health and safety of Canadians. The window to contain the spread of COVID-19 is short and we must all change our behaviours now to flatten the curve and reduce the burden on our health care system. I am asking all Canadians to follow the advice of public health experts, stay home, and undertake essential travel only. At this time, we are also asking Canadians not to visit Canada’s national parks, national historic sites, and national marine conservation areas. We must all work together to limit the spread of COVID-19.”

“In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, workplaces thrust into unfamiliar circumstances and facing the challenges that come with managing a remote workforce are turning to CCOHS for guidance. In addition to having contingency plans in place to help them function, we can’t stress enough the importance of maintaining close communication within the organization. Reach out frequently to employees who become ill or are in quarantine. Have regular contact with those who are working from home to monitor their well-being, let them know you care and help with any feelings of isolation they made have. If you have the technology, video chats are a great way to keep an active connection going.”

Today, the Honourable Patty Hajdu, Minister of Health, announced an Emergency Order under the Quarantine Act that requires any person entering Canada by air, sea or land to self-isolate for 14 days whether or not they have symptoms of COVID-19.

The order will be fully implemented by the Canada Border Services Agency at points of entry by midnight tonight. The Government of Canada will use its authority under the Quarantine Act to ensure compliance with the order. Failure to comply with this Order is an offense under the Quarantine Act. Maximum penalties include a fine of up to $750,000 and/or imprisonment for six months. Further, a person who causes a risk of imminent death or serious bodily harm to another person while wilfully or recklessly contravening this Act or the regulations could be liable for a fine of up to $1,000,000 or to imprisonment of up to three years, or to both. Spot checks will be conducted by the Government of Canada to verify compliance.

All individuals permitted to enter Canada are subject to this Order, with the exception of certain persons who cross the border regularly to ensure the continued flow of goods and services, and those who provide essential services. Individuals exempt from the Order will still need to practice social distancing and self monitoring and contact their local public health authority if they feel sick.

Individuals displaying symptoms of COVID-19 after arriving in Canada may not use public transportation to travel to their place of isolation. They also may not isolate in a place where they will be in contact with vulnerable people, such as seniors and individuals with underlying health conditions.

Quotes
“The number of cases of COVID-19 is increasing daily—both at home and globally. Earlier this month, we asked travellers entering Canada to self-isolate for 14 days to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Canada. To protect the health and safety of returning Canadians and those who are around them, we are strengthening our measures at the border. Travellers returning to Canada will be subject to a mandatory 14-day self-isolation under the Quarantine Act.”

Governments at all levels and the private sector need clear advice when it comes to determining the services and functions that are essential in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Today, the Honourable Bill Blair, Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, has released the “Guidance on Essential Services and Functions in Canada During the COVID-19 Pandemic” to assist various jurisdictions and businesses in their decision-making around the types of employees considered essential to maintain the health, safety, security and economic well-being of Canadians throughout this health crisis.

The guidance document provides a list of services and functions across Canada’s 10 critical infrastructure sectors: Energy and Utilities, Information and Communication Technologies, Finance, Health, Food, Water, Transportation, Safety, Government and Manufacturing.

The guidance will support critical infrastructure employers in identifying and managing their workforce, while fostering alignment and harmonization across sectors.

The guidance is non-binding and advisory in nature, and should not be considered to be a federal directive or standard.

Ensuring the safety and security of Canadians is the Government of Canada’s top priority. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, Transport Canada is working with the Public Health Agency of Canada, other levels of government, transportation industry stakeholders, and Indigenous peoples to help limit the spread of COVID-19.

The Minister of Transport, the Honourable Marc Garneau, today announced new measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission on commercial passenger vessels and ferries.

As of April 6, the new measures with mandatory requirements:

Prohibit all commercial marine vessels with a capacity of more than 12 passengers from engaging in non-essential activities, such as tourism or recreation.
These measures will remain in place until at least June 30.
Prevent any Canadian cruise ship from mooring, navigating, or transiting in Canadian Arctic waters (including Nunatsiavut, Nunavik and the Labrador Coast).
Should any foreign passenger vessel seek to enter Arctic waters, they would need to give the Minister of Transport 60 days’ notice and be subject to any conditions the Minister determines necessary to ensure the protection of marine personnel and local communities.
These measures will remain in place until October 31, 2020.
Require ferries and essential passenger vessel operators to:
Immediately reduce by 50% the maximum number of passengers that may be carried on board (conduct half-load voyages) to support the two-metre physical distancing rule; or
Implement alternative practices to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 (consistent with Public Health Agency of Canada guidelines) among passengers on board their vessels, such as keeping people in their vehicles, when feasible or enhanced cleaning and hygiene measures.
In addition to these measures, Transport Canada is issuing guidelines to ferry operators respecting health screening for all passengers before boarding to better protect their employees and passengers. These guidelines are based on advice from the Public Health Agency of Canada.

The new measures preventing vessel activity do not apply to:

essential passenger vessels such as ferries, water taxis, and medical-use vessels;
cargo vessels, barges, work boats, fishing vessels and other commercial vessels who operate to support resupply operations and the movement of goods through Canada’s supply chain;
Canadian commercial passenger vessels, without passengers, moving for repairs or repositioning;
Canadian commercial passenger vessels that are not in service; and
pleasure craft (e.g. non-commercial vessels).

Canadian public health guidance related to COVID-19 has been changing as the evidence base and our understanding of COVID-19 is rapidly evolving. We are continually looking at the evidence as it is being produced and working with our partners across the country and around the world to learn more.

Now that more countries have had large numbers of cases and have analysed transmission patterns, recent studies provide evidence that transmission of the virus can happen from infected people—before they develop symptoms. We refer to this as pre-symptomatic transmission. 

There is also evidence that some infected people who never develop symptoms are also able to transmit the virus. This is called asymptomatic transmission. We do not know how much of a role pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission play in driving this epidemic at this time―but we know that it is occurring among those with close contact or in close physical settings.

While the  primary driver of the global pandemic of COVID-19 has been individuals with visible symptoms (coughing and respiratory droplets are key ways the virus is spread), evidence of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission points to the importance of everyone, even those who feel fine, following the proven methods of preventing transmission.

To prevent transmission of COVID-19 here is what we know is proven:

Staying home as much as possible
Physical distancing
Washing your hands
Protecting the most vulnerable from infection and exposure to others
Covering your cough with tissues or your sleeve
It is critical that these measures continue.

Healthcare workers need medical masks, including surgical, medical procedure masks and respirators such as N95 masks. It is extremely important that we keep the supply of medical masks for healthcare workers where it is urgently needed for medical procedures and to care for individuals who have COVID-19.

Wearing a non-medical mask (e.g., homemade cloth mask) in the community has not been proven to protect the person wearing it. However, the use of a non-medical mask or facial covering can be an additional measure you can take to protect others around you.

Wearing a non-medical mask is another way of covering your mouth and nose to prevent your respiratory droplets from contaminating others or landing on surfaces. A cloth mask or face covering can reduce the chance that others are coming into contact with your respiratory droplets, in the same way that our recommendation to cover your cough with tissues or your sleeve can reduce that chance. 

For short periods of time when physical distancing is not possible in public settings (e.g., grocery shopping, in close settings such as public transit), wearing a non-medical mask is one way to protect those around you.

Non-medical masks or facial coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

With the emerging information regarding pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission, and our goal to stop the spread of COVID-19 by all means possible, wearing a non-medical mask—even if you have no symptoms―is an additional measure you can take to try to protect others around you.

If wearing a non-medical mask makes you feel safer and stops you from touching your nose and mouth, that is also good. Remember not to touch or rub your eyes as that is another route of infection.

Wearing a non-medical mask when in public or other settings is not a replacement for following proven measures such as hand washing and physical distancing.

Canadians need to understand exactly what wearing a mask will achieve, and that if they choose to wear non-medical masks they need to be used safely. The website Canada.ca/coronavirus is updated with information on the measures you should take, such as hand washing, when putting a mask on or taking it off. There is also information on how to wash cloth masks or safely dispose of other non-medical masks (such as dust masks).

If you choose to use a non-medical mask, it should be well-fitted (non-gaping). People should also be aware that masks can become contaminated on the outside or when touched by hands.  Avoid moving the mask around or adjusting it often. Also, masks should not be shared with others. 

The bottom line is that medical masks must be preserved for healthcare workers.

Please remember that non-medical masks will not prevent COVID-19 spread without consistent and strict adherence to good hygiene and public health measures, including frequent handwashing and physical distancing. Wearing a non-medical mask in the community does not mean you can back off the public health measures that we know work to protect you; no mask will ever replace physical distancing. We want to emphasize that all of the recommendations regarding staying home, physical distancing, and hand hygiene are based on what we know will work best to protect you and your family from infection.

All Canadians have a role to play in helping to protect seniors and medically vulnerable people, who are at greatest risk of severe health complications from COVID-19. Unfortunately, many long-term care homes in Canada have been experiencing outbreaks of COVID-19 and, sadly, numerous deaths.

This weekend, the Public Health Agency of Canada released evidence-informed guidelines to help residents, seniors and health care workers in long-term care homes remain safe and healthy. The Infection Prevention and Control for COVID-19: Interim Guidance for Long-Term Care Homes provides recommendations that complement provincial and territorial public health efforts to prevent and control health care-associated infections. Recommendations include: 

Restricting visitors and volunteers to only those essential for basic personal, medical or compassionate resident care.
Screenings for COVID-19 before every staff shift or essential visitor entry, and daily for residents. Workers should not go to work if they are ill.
Requiring staff, essential volunteers and visitors to wear a mask throughout their shift or visit.
Providing training on infection control measures such as proper hand hygiene and use of PPE. 
Practising physical distancing (keeping a minimum distance of 2 metres between residents) to the greatest extent possible, including during group activities and meal times. All non-essential outings should be cancelled.
Routine additional cleaning, especially for high-touch, high-risk surfaces.
Identifying staff who work in more than one location, and making efforts to prevent this where possible.
These guidelines may be adapted to other settings such as retirement homes and residential homes for those with developmental disabilities.

We understand that the efforts of Canadians to stop the spread of COVID-19 and to protect our most vulnerable involves difficult decisions and personal sacrifices. We all need to do our part to help stop the spread of the virus among the residents of long-term care homes, as well as the workers who care for them.

Quotes

“I have seen the heartbreaking stories of outbreaks in long-term care homes. We know seniors and people with pre-existing medical conditions are currently more vulnerable. This is why the Public Health Agency of Canada released recommendations that will better protect residents, seniors and health care workers in long-term care homes and ensure they remain safe and healthy.”

The Honourable Patty Hajdu

Minister of Health

“Seniors are more at risk of developing severe complications from COVID-19 because of their age and underlying medical conditions. For seniors living together in facilities, there is an even greater risk of infection and transmission due to proximity. Providing consistent guidance for long-term care homes across the country will save lives by protecting seniors and those dedicated to caring for them.”

The Honourable Deb Schulte

Minister of Seniors

“Many of the deaths across Canada are linked to long-term care facilities and these devastating events have underscored the need for stringent infection prevention and control measures. This guidance was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and the National Advisory Committee on Infection Prevention and Control, in collaboration with the provinces and territories, to prevent COVID-19 transmission and infections among residents, health care workers and other essential staff in long-term care facilities.”

2020-01-21,Canada,British Columbia,All,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,,,Government Website,"Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in British Columbia:

“Today, we are announcing the first individual confirmed to have COVID-19 in B.C. has recovered. This is indicated by the resolution of symptoms, followed by two successive negative test results 24 hours apart.

“The four remaining B.C. patients with COVID-19 are recovering in isolation at home with support and monitoring from public-health teams. The fifth case identified on Friday, Feb. 14, 2020, was confirmed by the National Microbiology Laboratory on Saturday, Feb. 15.

“Over the next few days, Health Canada will begin releasing repatriated Canadians from 14 days of quarantine in Trenton, Ont. Fourteen days is believed to be the longest incubation period for COVID-19. These individuals will no longer be required to self-isolate or take any additional precautionary measures, beyond those measures that help protect us from other respiratory illnesses at this time of year. 

“We are working closely with our federal and global health partners to monitor the developing situations related to Canadians aboard the Westerdam and Diamond Princess cruise ships. Those people returning to Canada on a repatriation flight from Japan will be quarantined in Cornwall, Ont., for 14 days.

“Public-health teams in B.C. have connected with other returning travellers to assess and monitor them for symptoms. At this time, Westerdam travellers require 14 days of self-isolation at home.

“Public-health teams continue to be active in the community, supporting those who have self-isolated, or may be concerned about symptoms to ensure they are being assessed, tested and cared for. These teams also undertake the important tasks of monitoring the four confirmed cases and providing daily symptom checks for close contacts who are self-isolating.

“In addition, public-health teams actively investigate the travel history of confirmed cases and contact people at risk of exposure to ensure they are isolated, if needed, and monitored for symptoms.

“The risk of this virus spreading within British Columbia remains low at this time. We are closely monitoring the situation as it evolves and will notify the public if the measures in B.C. change.”

“Late yesterday, our BC Centre for Disease Control public health lab confirmed a positive test for 2019-nCoV.

“The person is a male in his forties and a resident in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. He travels regularly to China for work and was in Wuhan city on his most recent trip. He returned to Vancouver last week and had an onset of symptoms after his return.

“On Sunday, Jan. 26, he followed public health messaging, contacted a primary health-care provider to notify them that he had travelled to Wuhan city, was experiencing symptoms and would be coming for assessment and care.

“Following established protocols, the primary-care provider notified the Vancouver Coastal Health medical health officer and administered the diagnostic test.

“Late last night, the test came back positive.

“Public health officials are in regular contact with the individual and a small number of close contacts. He is in isolation at home.

“The risk of spread of this virus within British Columbia remains low at this time. All necessary precautions are being taken to prevent the spread of infection. We have multiple systems in place to prepare for, detect and respond, in order to prevent the spread of serious infectious diseases in the province.

“The BC Centre for Disease Control has a team of experts that support the Province’s operations in monitoring and controlling communicable and vaccine-preventable diseases. The team has developed a diagnostic test for this new coronavirus and is co-ordinating staff and supplies to ensure potential cases can be detected quickly and accurately.

“The PHO is responsible for monitoring and assessing the health status of the population, making recommendations for strategies to address health issues and implementing immediate actions when necessary to protect the health of the public. The PHO has directed health-care workers to be vigilant and to take a travel history for anyone reporting respiratory symptoms.

“It is not necessary for the general public to take special precautions beyond the usual measures recommended to prevent other common respiratory viruses during the winter period. Regular handwashing, coughing or sneezing into your elbow sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately and avoiding contact with sick people are important ways to prevent the spread of respiratory illness generally. 

“Anyone who is concerned they may have been exposed to, or are experiencing symptoms of the coronavirus should contact their primary-care provider, local public health office or call 811.”

“The federal government announced its plans to bring Canadians home from Hubei, China. In the near future, a repatriation flight will bring Canadians from Hubei province, including Wuhan city, to Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Trenton near Toronto. Each of these returning Canadians, including staff and flight crew, will remain at CFB Trenton for 14 days to receive the necessary social and medical support they may need.

“We have been working closely with the federal government to ensure the repatriation process is smooth and conducted in a way that best protects the returning Canadians and the public here at home. It is expected that B.C. will be the final destination for some of the returning Canadians, and we will continue liaising with the federal government as it identifies passengers for the repatriation flight.

“The returning Canadians will spend 14 days at CFB Trenton, which is the 2019 novel coronavirus maximum incubation period, so they can be assessed and monitored, and to support their transition back to Canada.

“In B.C., we have chosen testing criteria with an intentionally low threshold to purposely ensure a wide range of people are eligible for novel coronavirus testing. On Friday, Jan. 31, we reported testing 114 samples and one confirmed case. Updates will be published each Friday at: www.bccdc.ca

“There continues to be one confirmed case in B.C.

“We want to reassure people that the risk of this virus spreading within British Columbia remains low at this time. We are watching the evolution of the outbreak in China very closely and will notify the public if the measures we need to take in B.C. change.

“All necessary precautions are being taken to prevent the spread of infection. We have multiple systems in place to prepare for, detect and respond in order to prevent the spread of serious infectious diseases in the province.

“The most important measures to prevent all respiratory illnesses, including this novel coronavirus, remain cleaning your hands regularly, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately and staying home and away from others if you become sick.

“We are announcing a second presumptive positive case of novel coronavirus in B.C.

“The second person who tested positive is a woman in her 50s who resides in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. Laboratory testing results returned positive from the BC Centre for Disease Control late Monday, Feb. 3, and samples have been sent to the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg for confirmation. Vancouver Coastal Health is undertaking a detailed case investigation and will follow up with each of her close contacts. The individual had close contact with family visitors from Wuhan city and is in isolation at home.

“Our knowledge of 2019-nCoV continues to grow as new information becomes available. Across the country, federal, provincial and territorial governments are using this new evidence to inform and adjust our public health actions as circumstances develop globally.

“As the federal government works to bring returning Canadians home from Wuhan, the decision was made to quarantine passengers from the special charter flight for 14 days. These individuals are returning from the most intensely affected areas of China, and they will receive psychosocial and medical support upon their return, as well as consular services.

“We are working closely with public health officials across Canada. Our focus is on people in British Columbia. Given the changing dynamics of the outbreak in China and globally, and recognizing we are in the midst of influenza season, we ask anyone here in B.C. who has been in Hubei province to consider staying home and keeping their children home until 14 days have passed from their last visit to Hubei. Monitor yourself and your children closely for symptoms, and if any symptoms arise, connect with your primary care provider, local public health office or call 811. This is an important way to reduce the possibility of transmission of illness to others.

“We want to reassure people that the risk of this virus spreading within British Columbia remains low at this time. We are watching the evolution of the outbreak in China very closely and will notify the public if the measures we need to take in B.C. change.

“We are announcing a seventh case of COVID-19 in B.C. The person affected was in close contact with the previously reported sixth case announced on Feb. 20, 2020. Both cases remain in isolation at home with support and monitoring from public health teams.

“The individual has been confirmed positive based on BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) testing. The individual is male, in his 40s and lives in the Fraser Health region.

“The BCCDC is now officially authorized for COVID-19 testing by the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) and therefore samples no longer require further confirmation by the NML in Winnipeg.

“Fraser Health is actively investigating and close contacts have been identified and contacted by public health officials. Those who may be at risk are now in isolation for 14 days and are being actively monitored for symptoms daily.

“Of these seven cases, the first case has recovered, as indicated by the resolution of symptoms, followed by two successive negative test results 24 hours apart. The other six B.C. patients with COVID-19 remain in self-isolation at home and under care by public-health teams.  

“The risk of spread of this virus within British Columbia continues to remain low at this time. We are watching recent global developments very closely and will continue to adapt our response to developing evidence and ongoing assessment of COVID-19 should it be required. We will notify the public if the measures in B.C. change.

“Given the changing dynamics of the outbreak in China and globally, and recognizing we are in the midst of influenza season, we ask all travellers who are returning to B.C. — no matter where they were in the world — to monitor themselves and their children closely for symptoms. If any symptoms arise, limit their contact with others and contact their primary care provider, local public health office or call 811. This is an important way to reduce the possibility of transmission of illness to others.

“People who have recently travelled through the Hubei province of China or are returning from quarantined cruise ships are being contacted by public health officials and are self-isolating for 14 days upon arriving in B.C. after leaving the area of potential exposure.

""If people have travelled to mainland China in the past 14 days, they are advised to monitor themselves and their children closely for symptoms (fever, shortness of breath, cough and breathing difficulties), and to contact their public health office if they have any concerns.

“The most important measures people in B.C. can take to prevent respiratory illnesses including COVID-19 are cleaning your hands regularly, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately and staying home and away from others if you are sick.

state, especially to the families who have lost loved ones. We have 
offered our support to Washington state’s public health officials as we 
co-ordinate our response to COVID-19.“While the risk of COVID-19 
spreading within British Columbia remains low at this time, we continue 
our widespread testing by screening British Columbians, as well as 
travellers with symptoms and their close contacts, to identify cases of 
COVID-19 early.“Quarantine officers are always available to 
support the Canadian Border Services Agency's screening conducted at 
land entries and airports.“Given the intensity of the outbreak 
globally, we ask all travellers returning from Iran and China to 
self-isolate for 14 days upon their arrival in Canada. We ask all other 
travellers who are returning to, or visiting, B.C. from outside Canada 
to monitor themselves and their children closely for symptoms, and if 
any arise, to limit their contact with others and call 811.“The 
most important measure anyone can take is preventing the transmission of
 respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. This includes cleaning your 
hands regularly, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into 
your elbow sleeve, and disposing of tissues appropriately.“It is 
also very important to stay home and away from others if you or members 
of your family are sick. This includes staying home from work or school,
 and postponing visits to long-term care facilities.“Similar to 
how you may need to care for someone with influenza, you will want to 
ensure you have sufficient food, medications and support in place for

2020-03-03,Canada,British Columbia,All,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,Government Website,"Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in British Columbia:

“We are announcing one new case of COVID-19 in B.C., for a total of nine cases in British Columbia. The individual affected is a resident of the Fraser Health region, unrelated to any previously announced case. The patient is in isolation at home with support and monitoring from public health teams.

“The patient has been confirmed positive based on BC Centre for Disease Control testing. The individual is male, in his 50s and recently returned to Canada from Iran.

“Fraser Health is actively investigating; close contacts have been identified and contacted by public health officials. Those who may be at risk are in self-isolation for 14 days and being actively monitored for symptoms.

“While the risk of spread of COVID-19 within British Columbia remains low at this time, we continue widespread testing by screening British Columbians and travellers with symptoms, along with their close contacts, to identify cases of COVID-19 early.

“The most important measures people can take today are to proactively prevent the transmission of respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19.

“We ask all British Columbians to stay home and away from others if you or your family are sick. We recommend cleaning your hands regularly, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow sleeve and disposing of tissues appropriately. To further contain transmission, we also recommend suspending usual greetings such as handshakes, hugs and kisses.

“For you and your family, similar to how you may need to care for someone with influenza, you want to ensure you have sufficient food, medications and support in place to stay home for a number of days. These are normal preparations when someone in your family is ill – there is no requirement for British Columbians to stockpile supplies.

“For employers, we recommend increasing cleaning and hand hygiene availability, in addition to thinking about how to manage absenteeism through steps such as remote working or virtual meetings.

“Schools should be increasing cleaning and hand hygiene, educating students on respiratory etiquette, in addition to putting mechanisms in place to support students who may be away for extended periods.

“Gathering large numbers of people together can increase the risk of transmission. Event organizers should ask all participants to stay away if they are sick, returning from affected areas or have underlying health conditions that may be impacted by respiratory illness. Organizers should also complete a risk assessment considering what is happening in the local community and who may attend the event. Local public health teams can assist with this assessment.

“British Columbians with upcoming travel plans should continue to monitor the Government of Canada travel site for the latest travel advisories: www.travel.gc.ca/travelling/advisories

“Travellers should understand that as global efforts to contain COVID-19 continue, the availability of health care services in some areas may be limited and travel restrictions may be put in place suddenly.

“We are asking all travellers returning from Iran and China to self-isolate for 14 days upon their return home to Canada. All other travellers who are returning to, or visiting, B.C. from outside Canada should monitor themselves and their children closely for symptoms and if any arise, limit their contact with others and call 811. This is an important way to reduce the possibility of transmission of illness to others.”",BC Ministry of Health,,Joint statement on one new case of COVID-19 in B.C.,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020HLTH0056-000365,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,,,Government Website,"Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in British Columbia:

“We are announcing three new cases of COVID-19 in B.C, for a total of 12 cases in British Columbia. All of these new cases reside in the Vancouver Coastal Health region and have recently returned from travel to Iran.

“Case 10 is a man and in his 60s and case 11 is a woman. They have no connection to previous confirmed cases. Case 12 is a woman in her 30s and a close contact of the eighth case, previously reported on Feb. 29.

“These new cases have been confirmed positive based on BC Centre for Disease Control testing. Four B.C. patients have now fully recovered, and the other individuals with COVID-19 are in isolation at home with support and monitoring from public health teams. 

“Vancouver Coastal Health continues to actively investigate these new cases. Close contacts are being identified and contacted by public health officials. Those who may be at risk are requested to self-isolate for 14 days and are being actively monitored for symptoms.

“While the risk of spread of COVID-19 within British Columbia remains low at this time, we continue widespread testing by screening British Columbians and travellers with symptoms, along with their close contacts, to identify cases of COVID-19 early.

“Starting today, Canada Border Services Agency officers are taking contact information from all travellers arriving from Iran, requiring them to self-isolate for 14 days and to contact public health officials. This process is already in place for people arriving from Hubei, China.

“When a traveller shows signs of a potential infectious disease upon arrival in Canada, border services officers contact quarantine officers, who are always available to provide health screening.

“We are asking all other travellers who are returning to or visiting B.C. from outside Canada to monitor themselves and their children closely for symptoms and if any arise, to limit their contact with others and call 811.

They are a man and woman, both in their 60s, and are receiving care in 
hospital in the Fraser Health region.“Cases 26 and 27 are 
residents of a long-term care facility, the Lynn Valley Care Centre in 
North Vancouver. These cases were identified as part of an outbreak 
assessment at the facility in response to a staff member testing 
positive for COVID-19. The staff member is Case 21, a woman in her 50s,

COVID-19 at events, such as religious gatherings. As a result, we 
recommend social distancing and forgoing usual greetings. As an 
alternative, we recommend considering virtual online gatherings.“Cruise
 ships continue to be a high-risk environment for transmission. As

“Case 40 is a male in 20s living in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, and case 45 is a woman in her 50s living in the Fraser Health region. Both work at the Lynn Valley Care Centre. There are no new resident cases.

“Case 43 is a male in his 70s living in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. Case 46 is a man in his 60s living in the Island Health region. Both cases 43 and 46 have returned from travelling in Egypt. 

“Case 42 is a man in his 70s from Egypt, who is visiting family in the Fraser Health region.

“Case 41 is a woman in her 60s, currently in hospital. Case 44 is a man in his 60s. Both are new community cases, who were identified through laboratory surveillance, and both reside in the Fraser Health region.

“Three patients have been discharged from hospital and are now recovering at home. One person is in hospital. All other patients with COVID-19 remain in isolation at home with care and support from public health teams.

“We have seen an increase in community cases in the Lower Mainland and Fraser Valley in recent days, where the source of the virus infection is not yet known. Public health teams are actively investigating, as we continue work to limit the spread of transmission in B.C.

“Today, we are asking British Columbians to take additional care of seniors and people with compromised immune systems. Do not visit them if you are sick. If they are living at home and are sick, consider how you may support them with food and other necessities. If you need to visit a long-term care home or other health-care facility, go one person at a time and limit your visit to the person you know.

“We are working with all long-term care and assisted living facilities to implement enhanced prevention measures to further protect all residents.

“If any British Columbian has been notified by event organizers that they may have been exposed to COVID-19, such as the recent Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada conference in Toronto, we are strongly recommending social distancing in the workplace and at home, especially from those most vulnerable, in addition to closely monitoring for symptoms.

“Today, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. As part of the British Columbia Pandemic Provincial Co-ordination Plan, we continue to focus on containment to break the chains of transmission, and we are using all the tools in our toolbox required at this time.

“We made this decision after careful deliberation with local public health officials and the event organizers. We understand what the championship means to the athletes who have trained hard to compete, but the health of British Columbians is our first priority.

“We are announcing seven new cases of COVID-19 for a total of 53 cases in British Columbia. The individuals are in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser health regions and were confirmed positive, based on BC Centre for Disease Control testing.

“Three cases are connected to the Hollyburn House Retirement Residence, three cases are travel-related and one is a community case.

“The three individuals are connected to the Hollyburn House Retirement Residence in West Vancouver include case 48, a male in his 40s and case 49, a female in her 40s, both of whom are health-care workers at Hollyburn. Case 47 is a man in his 90s, a resident. Public health teams are on site and actively working to investigate and contain potential transmission to other residents and workers. The outbreak at this facility is linked to the outbreak at Lynn Valley Care Centre.

“Case 50 is a man in his 40s who returned from travel in the United Kingdom and lives in the Vancouver Coastal Health region.

“Case 51 is a man in his 40s. Case 52 is a woman in her 40s. Both cases 51 and 52 live in the Vancouver Coastal Health region and are returning from a group trip to Egypt.

“Case 53 is a man in his 50s and is a community case identified through laboratory surveillance. He is self-isolating at his home in the Vancouver Coastal Health region.

Of B.C.’s 53 COVID-19 cases, four people have fully recovered and one woman in her 60s remains in in hospital in the Fraser Health region in stable condition. All other individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19 are in isolation at home with care and support from public health teams.

“With the increasing transmission of COVID-19 at mass gatherings and events, in addition to the escalating risk of community transmission, we must do our best to slow transmission of COVID-19 and protect our communities.

“Our schools and our workplaces are operating safely, and we want to keep it that way.

“We are recommending against all non-essential travel outside of Canada, including to the United States. Effective today, anyone who chooses to travel outside of Canada will be asked to stay away from work or school for 14 days upon their return. We know that this is a voluntary measure, but it is our expectation that people will follow this direction as part of their civic duty. 

“Effective today, we also directing all event organizers to cancel any gathering larger than 250 people. This includes indoor and outdoor sporting events, conferences, meetings, religious gatherings or other similar events. This threshold has been selected, as it is much easier to maintain important social distancing to prevent transmission of COVID-19.

“Some post-secondary institutions have classes with more than 250 students, and we are working with them to take measures to address this situation.

“Over spring break the B.C. government will also work with school districts to develop procedures to be implemented with students and staff when classes resume.

“We are asking employers to excuse staff for sick leave without requiring a doctor’s note, if their employees are ill or required to self-isolate. We are also reinforcing that if you have symptoms and may have been exposed to COVID-19, you must call your local primary care provider, or 811, to arrange for safe testing.

“We have heard reports of employers requiring all their staff to get tested. Only a health-care professional can determine whether you require a test – and employers should not require employees to have a test if a health-care provider has recommended against it.

“We recognize this will have a significant economic and social impact, and want to reassure British Columbians that these are temporary measures required to protect the health of the public at this critical time of pandemic. We will be reassessing these conditions on an ongoing basis as the pandemic evolves.

“Our 811 navigators and nurses are doing an incredible job with record high call volumes - providing support to 3,291 callers yesterday, March 11, 2020. We are adding more staff and more phone lines to resolve the intermittent busy signals some people have experienced.

""We are deeply saddened to announce that three people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recently passed away, all of whom were residents of the Lynn Valley Care Home. We offer our heartfelt condolences to their loved ones and the staff who cared for them during this difficult time.

“We are also announcing 30 new cases of COVID-19 for a total of 103 cases in British Columbia. The individuals are in the Vancouver Coastal, Fraser, Interior and Island health regions and were confirmed positive, based on BC Centre for Disease Control testing.

“Six people confirmed positive are in acute care, five have fully recovered and all others are self-isolating at home.

“A significant number of new cases are related to the Pacific Dental Conference 2020 held at the Vancouver Convention Centre on March 6 and 7, 2020. We are asking anyone who attended to self-isolate until March 22, 2020.

“Today, we are taking a number of additional steps to address the changing situation in B.C. and ensure our health-care system is best positioned to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“British Columbia’s health authorities are directed to immediately move all hospitals in the province to Outbreak Response Phase 2. This means hospitals will undertake only urgent and emergency procedures and will postpone all non-urgent scheduled surgeries. Hospitals will review operating-room capacity daily to prioritize urgent and emergency cases. 

“Lions Gate Hospital in the Vancouver Coastal Health region is directed to move to Outbreak Response Phase 3. This means the hospital will accept only emergency patients. Lions Gate Hospital is also preparing to open a dedicated COVID-19 unit to provide care to those with the virus.

“These measures will assist hospitals to redeploy and train essential service health-care providers on critical care related to COVID-19 to ensure sufficient medical supplies for patients and staff who need them most, and to further increase capacity to respond to the potential for a surge of COVID-19 patients requiring acute care.

“We have worked with the College of Pharmacists to advise pharmacies to provide patients with a prescription refill or an emergency supply of their medications if needed. This will give physicians more time to care for patients with acute care needs. British Columbians are asked to respect this temporary arrangement and are reminded that there is no need to stockpile medication.

“To further enhance the availability of physicians for all British Columbians, the Province will provide physicians compensation for providing virtual-care services. We have also requested all health regulators to begin emergency registration of non-practising or retired health-care professionals, including professionals from other jurisdictions and the armed forces.

“Further, we are moving to restrict visitors in long-term care to essential visits only. Essential visits include compassionate visits for end-of-life care and visits that support care plans for residents based on resident and family needs, for example, families who routinely visit to provide assistance with feeding or mobility.

“In an effort to allow 811 health-care professionals to support more people who are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms or who require assistance with other health issues, the Province has created a dedicated phone service to provide British Columbians non-medical information about COVID-19. This includes the latest information on travel recommendations and social distancing, as well as access to support and resources from the provincial and federal governments.

“British Columbians can reach service representatives seven days a week, from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m., by calling 1 888 COVID19. Information is available in more than 110 languages.

“We have also taken additional action to enhance social distancing and limit transmission. These efforts are not forever, but they are important for now.

“We are issuing a new order prohibiting all public gatherings of more than 50 people. This includes indoor and outdoor sporting events, conferences, meetings, religious gatherings and other similar events. 

“On the recommendation of the provincial health officer, the attorney general, minister responsible for the British Columbia Lottery Corporation, has ordered all casinos to close until further notice to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. This order came into effect 11:59 a.m. today.

2020-03-17,Canada,British Columbia,All,0.0,1.0,,,,,,,,2.0,0.0,,Government Website,"Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:

""We are deeply saddened to announce that a further three people who tested positive for COVID-19 have recently passed away. Two were residents of the Lynn Valley Care Centre and one was a man in his 80s from the Fraser Health region. We offer our heartfelt condolences to their loved ones and the staff who cared for them.

“We are also announcing 83 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 186 cases in British Columbia. Of the new cases, seven are currently hospitalized, four are in intensive care, five have recovered and the remaining patients are at home in isolation.

“Of the total cases, 116 are in Vancouver Coastal, 47 are in Fraser, 12 are on Vancouver Island, seven are in Interior and four are in Northern health regions.

“This steep increase in the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases in B.C. is in large part a result of consolidating data this week as our reporting process aligns with the increase in the number of tests that is now taking place in five sites around the province. We anticipate this will level off.  

“The provincial health officer has declared a public health emergency. This is an additional step to ensure our province has more tools available to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

“This declaration enables the provincial health officer to facilitate an even faster response to the rapidly changing situation and enact further measures to protect British Columbians, such as enforcement of orders limiting public gatherings of 50 people or more.

“Effective immediately, businesses with liquor primary licences, such as bars, pubs and night clubs, must close as they are unable to adequately meet the requirements of social distancing. Restaurants and cafes that cannot maintain social distancing of one to two meters between patrons will need to move to take-out and delivery models.

“We also remind British Columbians that public gatherings of more than 50 people – indoors or outdoors – must be cancelled.

“This is the second time the provincial health officer has served notice under the Public Health Act to exercise emergency powers. The first declaration was in 2016, in response to the overdose crisis.

“We would like to remind people that tests are available for all those who need them, but not everyone requires a test.

“To further support people who are wondering if they should be tested, a new self-assessment tool is now available. Before calling 811, we recommend completing the self-assessment at: http://covid-19.bccdc.ca/

“We continue to remind people to please use hand hygiene, maintain social or physical distancing, and to stay at home if you are sick or at high risk for serious illness. That includes the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions.

“Sufficient physical distancing of one to two meters should be incorporated for workers and customers for businesses and services that will remain open to provide transportation, keep our communities safe and provide essential goods and services.

“For those who have recently travelled outside of Canada and are currently self-isolating for 14 days: leaving your home, hotel or a similar place should only be done for essential errands, such as obtaining medication or food, and with a mask or tissues.

“This is a time to support our friends, family and communities. Purchasing groceries for those isolating or donating blood to support our health-care system are some of the ways you can help. Canada Blood Services has added additional screening measures for increased vigilance to enable the continued supply of blood products for surgery, cancer treatments and emergencies.”

TRAVELLED OUTSIDE CANADA ON OR SINCE MARCH 12, 2020 AND HAS
RETURNED OR WHO HAS TRAVELLED TO CANADA FROM ANOTHER
COUNTRY SINCE MARCH 12, 2020

WHEREAS:
A. There are outbreaks of COVID-19 in many parts of the world and on March 11, 2020 the World
Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic;
B. COVID-19 is caused by the infectious agent SARS-CoV-2 and is a reportable communicable
disease under the Public Health Act, S.B.C. 2008, c28;
C. A person who travelled outside Canada and returned on or after March 12, 2020, or who has
travelled outside Canada on or after March 12, 2020 and has returned, is at risk of having been or
having likely been infected with SARS-CoV-2;
D. A person who is infected with SARS-CoV-2 can infect other people with whom the infected
person is in contact;
E. You belong to the class of people who travelled outside Canada and returned on or after March 12,

travelled to Canada from another country, including the United States of America, since March 12,
2020;
…\2
2
F. Because the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks extends beyond the authority of one or more medical
health officers and coordinated action is needed to respond to the risk, it is in the public interest for
me to exercise the powers in sections 27, 28 and 29 of the Public Health Act;

Appendix A – Essential Workers
Essential workers are people who provide services that are considered critical to preserving life, health,
public safety and basic societal functioning and who have been determined by the leadership of their
organization, on an individual basis, to be critical to delivering these essential services according to the
following principles:
• Preventing new introductions of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, into British
Columbia is of paramount importance to limiting the spread of the virus.
• As a baseline, ALL travelers from outside Canada are considered potential carriers of the virus
and should self-isolate at home or a similar place in which to stay.
• To preserve essential services, it is key to consider the risk that a returning worker could pose by
endangering the health of multiple other essential service workers, which could jeopardize an
organization’s ability to provide essential services.
Leadership of organizations providing essential service should require their workers to follow the
required 14-day self-isolation protocol after returning to Canada. Leadership should establish thresholds
beyond which the delivery of essential services becomes impossible and should only relieve a worker
from the requirement to self-isolate if this threshold has been reached. The decision to relieve a worker
must be based on an overall risk assessment which takes into consideration:
o Where the person travelled, recognizing that many countries in the world are
experiencing significant community transmission of the virus
o Duration and type of activity while away (family visit rather than attending an event
involving a large gathering of people)
o Whether the worker or any member of the worker’s household is displaying symptoms of
illness. If a worker or any member of the worker’s household is displaying symptoms of
illness, the worker or member of the household must be assessed by a health professional,
and infection with SARS-CoV-2 ruled out before the worker may be considered for
return to work.
o The work environment of the individual e.g. whether they work independently, outside or
in a group setting, and the risk of the worker transmitting infection to co-workers
Leadership of organizations providing essential services must establish protocols to:
• prevent the risk of transmission of infection to co-workers by a worker with a history of travel
outside Canada
• provide for a rapid response if a worker develops symptoms of illness while at work, and
• maintain high levels of workplace and worker hygiene.
Essential Workers must follow those protocols.

PHO - CLASS Order (travellers) (COVID-19) 2020.03.17",Office of the Provincial Health Officer,,ORDER OF THE PROVINCIAL HEALTH OFFICER,https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/reports-publications/covid-19-pho-class-order-travellers.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,Government Website,"Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:

""We are deeply saddened to announce that a further three people who tested positive for COVID-19 have recently passed away. Two were residents of the Lynn Valley Care Centre and one was a man in his 80s from the Fraser Health region. We offer our heartfelt condolences to their loved ones and the staff who cared for them.

“We are also announcing 83 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 186 cases in British Columbia. Of the new cases, seven are currently hospitalized, four are in intensive care, five have recovered and the remaining patients are at home in isolation.

“Of the total cases, 116 are in Vancouver Coastal, 47 are in Fraser, 12 are on Vancouver Island, seven are in Interior and four are in Northern health regions.

“This steep increase in the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases in B.C. is in large part a result of consolidating data this week as our reporting process aligns with the increase in the number of tests that is now taking place in five sites around the province. We anticipate this will level off.  

“The provincial health officer has declared a public health emergency. This is an additional step to ensure our province has more tools available to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

“This declaration enables the provincial health officer to facilitate an even faster response to the rapidly changing situation and enact further measures to protect British Columbians, such as enforcement of orders limiting public gatherings of 50 people or more.

“Effective immediately, businesses with liquor primary licences, such as bars, pubs and night clubs, must close as they are unable to adequately meet the requirements of social distancing. Restaurants and cafes that cannot maintain social distancing of one to two meters between patrons will need to move to take-out and delivery models.

“We also remind British Columbians that public gatherings of more than 50 people – indoors or outdoors – must be cancelled.

“This is the second time the provincial health officer has served notice under the Public Health Act to exercise emergency powers. The first declaration was in 2016, in response to the overdose crisis.

“We would like to remind people that tests are available for all those who need them, but not everyone requires a test.

“To further support people who are wondering if they should be tested, a new self-assessment tool is now available. Before calling 811, we recommend completing the self-assessment at: http://covid-19.bccdc.ca/

“We continue to remind people to please use hand hygiene, maintain social or physical distancing, and to stay at home if you are sick or at high risk for serious illness. That includes the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions.

“Sufficient physical distancing of one to two meters should be incorporated for workers and customers for businesses and services that will remain open to provide transportation, keep our communities safe and provide essential goods and services.

“For those who have recently travelled outside of Canada and are currently self-isolating for 14 days: leaving your home, hotel or a similar place should only be done for essential errands, such as obtaining medication or food, and with a mask or tissues.

“This is a time to support our friends, family and communities. Purchasing groceries for those isolating or donating blood to support our health-care system are some of the ways you can help. Canada Blood Services has added additional screening measures for increased vigilance to enable the continued supply of blood products for surgery, cancer treatments and emergencies.”

During the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, insurance brokers will be able to conduct ICBC business, such as vehicle insurance renewals, by phone and email.  

“ICBC’s top priority is the health and safety of its customers, partners and employees, and that’s why we are moving forward with emergency protocols to allow brokers to conduct ICBC business over the phone during this difficult time,” said Nicolas Jimenez, president and CEO, ICBC.   

These new procedures will temporarily allow brokers to conduct ICBC insurance business by phone and email. Many brokers remain open for business for people who want to visit in person or for transactions that cannot be done over the phone, such as vehicle registrations and new policies.

ICBC customers will be able to receive the following services from participating brokers:

vehicle insurance renewal, cancellation and policy changes by phone
changes to storage policies (APV345) and temporary operating permits (APV16)
receive transactions by email
submit signatures electronically
submit payments by phone
receive policy documents by email
“With the COVID-19 outbreak impacting brokers’ offices and customers, these provisional changes are the right move to help protect the health and wellness of everyone, while continuing to meet British Columbians’ insurance needs,” said Chuck Byrne, executive director, Insurance Brokers Association of B.C. 

ICBC customers are advised to give themselves ample time for renewals, as the transaction may take longer than usual. Those customers who have questions should contact ICBC at 250 978-8300 or toll-free at 1 800 950-1498.

At this time, there are no changes to driver’s licence renewal protocols, but ICBC is working actively on further options across the board to support customers and employees. ICBC also continues to work closely with brokers through a joint task force on additional online services, including a more permanent process for insurance renewals.

This action, requested by both public health officials and local government members, will help ensure residents are not required to gather in polling stations and will free up local government resources to focus on dealing with the impact of COVID-19.

“I know that local governments are working hard to keep their communities safe and protected during this pandemic,” Robinson said. “Our government is working closely with our partners to help marshal all resources to protect those most vulnerable and ‘flattening the curve’ of the spread of COVID-19. After consulting with our public health officials and local governments, I have signed a ministerial order postponing byelections and referendums in these communities so they can focus on protecting their residents.”

In 2020, Victoria and Rossland had byelections set for April 4, and Lytton had a byelection set for April 25. Kamloops had a referendum scheduled for April 4, 2020.

Decisions to reschedule the byelections and referendum will be made by local governments in conjunction with public health officials and Elections BC. Meanwhile, the ministry will continue to work with local governments that are considering byelections or referendums to ensure plans take into consideration the need to protect community residents during this emergency situation.

While BC Parks is bringing in some new novel coronavirus (COVID-19) protocols, people throughout B.C. will still be able to enjoy day-use parks as a positive way to connect to nature.

Some day-use services and facilities are currently available at the following provincial parks:

Mount Seymour Provincial Park – access restricted to some lower-elevation trails. Parking and road access are closed.
Cypress Provincial Park – access restricted to some lower-elevation trails. Parking and road access are closed.
Goldstream Provincial Park
Rathtrevor Beach Provincial Park
Miracle Beach Provincial Park
Wells Gray Provincial Park
“Nature provides the perfect environment to promote health and well-being,"" said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “We are following the advice of the provincial health officer to help people get outside, while ensuring they are following the PHO’s direction and guidance to stay healthy. Our government is taking every necessary step to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We look forward to a time when we can return to full operations at our provincial parks.”

People will continue to be able to day hike and recreate in most all other provincial parks. However, there will be a temporary suspension of services and facility closures as a result of the ongoing provincial response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Campgrounds and camping opportunities will be closed and existing reservations will be automatically refunded.

The temporary measures include the suspension of services at marine parks, visitor centres, nature houses, washrooms and day-use facilities. Provincial park visitors may continue to use trails and areas where accessible. Visitors should be aware parking lots in some parks may be closed and gated where necessary.

Provincial parks can attract large numbers, particularly those parks close to urban centres. Visitors should keep this in mind when choosing which park to visit. People are also reminded to keep at least two metres apart from each other during this time. In addition to social distancing, people may need to be extra patient and aware of their impact on the environment. 

Full provincial park closures are also being implemented on a case-by-case basis, where required, to address concerns regarding health and safety. Visitors should be mindful that they are responsible for their own safety and that washroom facilities may not be available in most parks. They are asked to check the BC Parks website for any updates before heading out. Any changes to services at provincial parks will be posted to the BC Parks website: http://bcparks.ca

In alignment with Parks Canada, all campgrounds, camping opportunities and accommodations will be closed until at least April 30, 2020. Refunds will be provided to those with existing reservations during this time.

The Discover Camping reservation system has been suspended for all new reservations. No action is required for people with reservations to receive a refund. Refunds will be done automatically and are expected to take seven to 10 business days. A public notice will be issued once facilities are reopened and the system is able to accept new reservations.

Many tourism operators and other businesses have permits to offer services and trips within BC Parks. This closure may affect the availability of services provided by commercial operators permitted to operate in BC Parks. Park visitors are advised to check with them directly before visiting to determine if there have been any changes to their services.

BC Parks continues to monitor the COVID-19 outbreak closely and is following recommendations set out by the provincial health officer and minister of health to assess when to reopen facilities and services and return to full operations.

2020-03-21,Canada,British Columbia,All,0.0,1.0,,,,,,,,2.0,0.0,,Government Website,"Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:

“We are announcing 76 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 424 cases in British Columbia.

“It is with sadness that we share the news that another Lynn Valley resident who previously tested positive for COVID-19 has passed away. We offer our deepest condolences to their loved ones and the staff who cared for them.

“Every health region in British Columbia has people with COVID-19: 230 are in Vancouver Coastal Health Authority, 126 are in Fraser Health Authority, 37 are in Vancouver Island Health Authority, 27 are in Interior Health Authority and four are in Northern Heath Authority.

“Additionally, of the total COVID-19 cases: 27 individuals are currently hospitalized, of which 12 are in intensive care, six individuals have recovered and the remaining patients are at home in isolation.

“Until further notice, personal service establishments – like barbershops, salons, nail estheticians, health spas, massage parlours, tattoo shops and others – are ordered to close.

“As part of our COVID-19 response strategy, our B.C. team has been tracking the epidemiology of the virus. Epidemiology looks at the who, what, where and when of disease outbreaks – to better understand their sources and effectively combat them. That is how we were able to determine the initial cases in B.C. were travel-related.

“Because we now know a lot more about COVID-19, our testing strategy has evolved to focus on clusters and outbreaks, patients in hospital and health-care workers.

“Here in B.C., 55% of all positive cases are female. This is because we have seen younger, female health-care workers with the virus – mainly related to the Lynn Valley Care Centre and other long-term care outbreaks.

“As part of the virus tracking, we look at two curves: the total number positive test results and the date of symptom onset, as determined by the public health investigation of each case.

“We pay attention to the onset curve, because we know that the time from the onset of symptoms to when someone is tested can sometimes several days. This is because people’s initial symptoms may be too mild to consider speaking to their doctor or going for testing.

“As we get more information about the onset of symptoms from patients, the onset curve is updated to reflect this new information.

“To most effectively flatten the curve, and break the chain of transmission, we need everyone to take action at the onset stage. That is why we have put public gathering orders and social distancing measures in place now – to protect us in the weeks ahead.

“Now is the time to stay home as much as possible, and to keep a safe distance from others when outside. We are reminding British Columbians that their actions today will determine the impact of the virus in coming weeks.”

“In these extraordinary times, more British Columbians are relying on delivery services during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “Permitting licensed restaurants to hire their out of work servers to deliver liquor products as part of their food-delivery service allows the public to continue to observe social distancing measures and also offers much-needed support to these workers and businesses.”

These changes will be made available to customers who purchase a meal and the sealed, packaged liquor product for pick up from the restaurant’s premises or for delivery at home. Previously, these licensees were only permitted to sell liquor for consumption in their establishment, unless they had a special endorsement on their licence.  

Existing safeguards for safe consumption continue to be in place, such as verifying identification. The individuals delivering the liquor products will also be required to be certified with Serving It Right, which government hopes will help encourage businesses to use currently laid-off serving staff to make these deliveries. Staff in licensed establishments are already required to hold this certification.

These changes come as the restaurant and hospitality industry have been deeply impacted by COVID-19. The Business Technical Advisory Panel, which consists of representatives of the liquor and hospitality industry, provided this recommendation to help support struggling hospitality workers and businesses during this time.

“A special thank you to the members of the Business Technical Advisory Panel for their recommendations during this public health emergency that has had such a terrible impact on workers in our favourite bars and restaurants,” Eby added. “Government is committed to working with hospitality workers and businesses to identify ways to reduce the impact of this crisis.”

The changes take effect immediately and expire July 15, 2020. The timeline can be amended by government through a regulation change.

“These changes not only help restaurant operators through a very tough time, but also could support the many British Columbians working in our breweries, wineries and distilleries,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “Supporting local businesses and choosing to Buy BC makes a real difference in our communities, especially at a time like this.”

Parks throughout British Columbia are seeing an increase in visitors, but many people are not complying with the provincial health officer’s (PHO) requirement for families and individuals to stay at least two metres away from others. This puts the most vulnerable populations at risk. BC Parks has heard concerns from the public, RCMP and First Nations, as well as regional and municipal governments about the increase in visitors and is implementing full closures of certain parks throughout the province.

“The mental and physical wellness benefit of being outside during the COVID-19 pandemic response is important, but keeping people safe right now is the most important thing we can be doing,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “Until we flatten the transmission curve of COVID-19 and people strictly comply with the PHO physical distancing requirement, provincial park access will be restricted.”

These closures are in addition to a previous suspension of services and facilities in provincial parks, including visitor centres, nature houses, washrooms and day-use areas. In alignment with Parks Canada, all campgrounds are closed until April 30, 2020.  

BC Parks will continue to monitor the COVID-19 outbreak closely and follow the direction and advice set out by the PHO and the Ministry of Health. Additional provincial park closures may be implemented on a case-by-case basis where and when required. People who still choose to visit provincial parks should be mindful that they are responsible for their own safety and that washroom facilities will not be available.

In addition to the BC Parks closures, the Recreation Sites and Trails BC (RSTBC) branch of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development is closing its campgrounds and amenities in response to the COVID-19 situation.

“We want to do whatever we can to make sure British Columbians have access to this province’s great outdoor recreation opportunities, but this is an unprecedented situation and we need to protect everyone’s health,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development.

RSTBC campgrounds are generally located in remote areas and provide basic facilities. Potable water and electricity are not provided. The temporary closure includes RSTBC campgrounds where there is an increased likelihood of close contact with frequently touched surfaces, including toilets, kiosks, ticket booths, overnight shelters and day-use shelters. Day-use shelters, backcountry cabins, warming huts, ticket booths at snowmobile areas and other built facilities will be closed.

Backcountry trails will remain open, but maintenance services, including grooming, have been suspended. Trail users are encouraged to use local facilities and not travel for recreation purposes. The facilities accessed by these groups will also remain closed.

For Immediate Release
Mar. 25, 2020

VICTORIA – To reduce the spread of COVID-19 and protect the health of British Columbians, the 2020 BC Summer Games that were scheduled for July 23-26 in Maple Ridge have been cancelled.

“Keeping British Columbians safe and healthy is our top priority. Through conversations with leadership at the BC Games Society, it became clear that there was no viable path forward to host the Games this year and that they must now be cancelled,” said Lisa Beare, Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture. “I’m so thrilled that the Maple Ridge Council, BC Games Society, School District 42 and the local organizing committee were able to respond quickly, and that we can now all look forward to the 2024 BC Summer Games in Maple Ridge.”

While the full extent and impact felt from the COVID-19 outbreak remains unknown, B.C.’s Health Minister Adrian Dix and Chief Provincial Health Officer Bonnie Henry have advised to restrict large gatherings, travel and physical interaction. Cancelling the 2020 Games supports efforts to contain the spread of the virus and focus available resources and public attention on overcoming the pandemic.

“It is very unfortunate for athletes and coaches across the province who will not have a BC Games experience this summer, but this is bigger than all of us,” said Alison Noble, President and CEO of the BC Games Society. “We need to respect this issue and take socially responsible action. We look forward to the Games resuming in the future.”

The BC Games are held every two years. Greater Vernon will host the 2022 BC Winter Games and the 2022 BC Summer Games will be in Prince George. The City of Maple Ridge was given the opportunity to host the 2024 Summer Games and on March 24 council unanimously voted in favour of hosting.

“This is the right decision. We stand in solidarity with Minister Beare and the BC Games Society leadership team in putting the health and safety of citizens as the first priority,” said Maple Ridge Mayor Mike Morden. “Working with Minister Beare, the BC Games Society, School District 42 and the local organizing committee we have reached an agreement to have Maple Ridge be the host city for the 2024 BC Summer Games. Our community will be ready to welcome the athletes, coaches and their families for an outstanding Summer Games competition.”

The BC Games brings valuable competitive opportunities for British Columbia’s best young athletes and developing coaches and officials, help volunteers gain skills and experiences and attract local tourism and direct economic benefits to the host community. The BC Games Society will maintain a dialogue with the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture on how best to support Games participants and recognize the volunteers.

Quick Facts:

The Province invests close to $50 million in sport annually, including $2 million to the BC Games Society to support the biennial BC Summer and Winter Games, and prepare future Team BC athletes for the Canada Games.         
Each edition of the BC Games has a direct economic impact valued at $1.6 to $2.0 million.

2020-03-26,Canada,British Columbia,All,0.0,1.0,,,,,,,,2.0,0.0,,Government Website,"Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, is using extraordinary powers under a state of provincial emergency to keep British Columbians safe, maintain essential goods and services, and support the Province’s ongoing response to novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

“B.C. is in a strong position to effectively respond to and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Farnworth. “Informed by the direction of the provincial health officer, we’re taking these critical steps to keep our communities safe, goods moving and essential service workers supported.”

Using the extraordinary powers under the Emergency Program Act, the minister is issuing a series of ministerial orders to ensure a co-ordinated response to COVID-19 across all levels of government for the duration of the provincial emergency. These include:

Supply chain: Establishing a new Provincial Supply Chain Coordination Unit to co-ordinate goods and services distribution; taking a more active role in co-ordinating essential goods and services movement by land, air, marine and rail; and suspending any bylaws that restrict goods delivery at any time of day.
Protecting consumers: Banning the secondary resale of food, medical supplies, personal protective equipment, cleaning and other essential supplies; and restricting quantities of items purchased at point of sale. 
Enforcement: Enabling municipal bylaw officers to support enforcement of the provincial health officer’s orders for business closures and gatherings, in line with offences under the Public Health Act.
Travel: Ensuring all passenger and car-ferry services provide minimum service levels and priority access for residents, and essential goods and workers.
Protecting B.C.’s most vulnerable: Making it easier to support critical services for vulnerable people, like food banks and shelters.
Co-ordination: Suspending local states of emergency specific to the COVID-19 pandemic, except for the City of Vancouver; giving municipal councils the ability to hold more flexible meetings to expedite decisions; and co-ordinating potential use of local publicly owned facilities, like community centres, for self-isolation, testing, medical care, warehousing and distribution.
These unprecedented steps, made based on the recommendation of B.C.’s health and emergency management officials and invoked for the first time under a provincial state of emergency, will support the provincial health officer and minister of health in a co-ordinated cross-government approach to COVID-19 response and recovery.

Farnworth added, “Many local governments, First Nations and partners have stepped up to make sure they have prepared to protect their communities from the impacts of COVID-19. Today’s measures will make sure communities are taking necessary steps, in co-ordination with the Province, to get ready should more action be required to combat COVID-19.”

The Province, in consultation with the Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, has defined essential services British Columbians rely on in their daily lives in the context of COVID-19 response and recovery. This is distinct from essential service designations under the Province's Labour Relations Code.

In consultation with the provincial health officer, any business or service that has not been ordered to close, and is also not identified on the essential service list, may stay open if it can adapt its services and workplace to the orders and recommendations of the PHO.

“In these new and challenging times we are facing, we’re asking British Columbians to stay strong as a community, and together we can get through this,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “I’m proud of the strategic measures we have enacted government-wide to help our families and health-care workers, to keep them safe and supported. By issuing a series of ministerial orders, we recognize that this is not forever, but it is for now. With everyone stepping in and respecting the extraordinary means we have to take, we will overcome this.”

Farnworth declared a provincial state of emergency on March 18, 2020, after the provincial health officer declared a public health emergency on March 17. The Province previously declared states of emergency in 1998, 2003, 2017 and 2018 – all related to wildfires. In each of those previous declarations, necessary actions were able to be taken without issuing minister’s orders under the Emergency Program Act.

Quick Facts:

Declarations of provincial states of emergency may be issued by the minister responsible under the Emergency Program Act.
The provincial government can extend the period of a declaration made by the minister responsible for further periods of time.
During the 2017 wildfire season, the Province was in a provincial state of emergency for 10 weeks from July 7 to Sept. 15.

2020-03-27,Canada,British Columbia,All,0.0,1.0,,,,,,,,2.0,0.0,,Government Website,"Limitation periods to commence court proceedings in British Columbia have been suspended, and statutory decision-makers have been provided discretion to waive, suspend or extend time periods related to their powers. 

At the request of the Attorney General, the Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General has made the order under the Emergency Program Act to protect public health and to recognize that during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, British Columbians involved in legal or administrative proceedings may be unable to take steps required by legislation. 

The order provides that mandatory limitation periods, and other mandatory time periods established in an enactment or law of British Columbia, within which a civil or family action, proceeding, claim or appeal must be commenced in the provincial court, Supreme Court or Court of Appeal are suspended. It also provides that a person, tribunal or other body that has a statutory power of decision may waive, suspend or extend a mandatory time period relating to the exercise of that power.

The order applies during the current state of emergency, including any extension of the state of emergency. ",Attorney General,,Province suspends legal time limitations due to COVID-19,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020AG0028-000578,1.0,1.0,,Government Website,"Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:

“We are announcing 67 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 792 cases in British Columbia.

“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 391 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 262 are in the Fraser Health region, 57 are in the Island Health region, 70 are in the Interior Health region and 12 are in the Northern Heath region.

“We are saddened to report two more deaths as a result of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal health region. Our condolences to their loved ones during this difficult time.

“Two additional long-term care homes in the Fraser Health region have staff with confirmed cases of COVID-19, The Harrison at Elim Village and Chartwell Independent Living at Langley Gardens. In total, 11 long-term care homes in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser Health regions have confirmed cases of COVID-19. Public health officials are providing support to implement outbreak protocols.

“Two hundred and seventy-five patients with COVID-19 have recovered and no longer have isolation requirements.

“Additionally, of the total COVID-19 cases, 73 individuals are currently hospitalized, and the remaining people who have tested positive for COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.

“We are tracking the epidemic curve closely here in B.C. We are also monitoring outbreaks in other nations to guide our health system preparations and public health response.

“In the past few days, our upward path has been less severe than other places, but we continue to see steady increases in community transmission cases and continue to be concerned about outbreaks, which could quickly grow and challenge our pandemic response.

“The evidence is clear: with every person in British Columbia 100% committed to physical distancing, we can flatten the curve. Over the next two weeks we must be united in this one goal.

“We strongly discourage any in-person gathering of any size at this time, but rather encourage using the many online options we have available today to stay connected to friends, family, customers and clients.

“We know that our community and farmers markets are an important source of fresh food. We are heartened that, with the support of funding from the provincial government, many markets are shifting to an online model. We remind market organizers that a public gathering order is in place and physical distancing measures must be followed.

“Further, to reduce the potential for transmission and ensure local, B.C.-grown food can continue to reach customers, a provincial health officer order has been issued, effective immediately.

“All occasional/recurring/weekly events where food and other merchandise is sold (e.g., markets, street markets, night markets, Saturday markets or community markets) must only allow vendors that sell food to be at these events. Vendors of non-food items and all other merchandise are prohibited to sell at these events.

“Every day that we stay home and stay apart will bolster our COVID-19 response. This is how we will protect our health-care workers, whose job it is to care for us, our loved ones and ourselves.”

For a Chinese translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.03.27_New_ExistingCasesCOVID-19_CN.pdf",BC Ministry of Health,,"Joint statement on Province of B.C.’s COVID-19 response, latest updates",https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020HLTH0113-000581,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,Government Website,"New guidelines for school leaders and a new website are being introduced to support B.C.’s K-12 students while in-class education is suspended to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

“This is a challenging time for families in B.C. as we work together to stop the spread of COVID-19, but it is vital students have a sense of routine and continued opportunities to learn while they are at home,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “These guidelines will ensure the needs, health and safety of students are put first as school leaders actively plan to serve the unique needs of their communities.”

While in-person classes are suspended, the B.C. school system remains open to continue to support students and families in a variety of ways. Note that parents should not bring their children to school on Monday, March 30, 2020, as they usually would after spring break.

However, essential frontline health-care workers, like those directly involved in patient care, who need urgent care for their school-aged child the week of March 30 are advised to contact their school principal as soon as possible to discuss care arrangements available during the first week back after spring break. Other parents who are deemed an essential service worker and who may need child care for their school-age children can expect to hear from their school regarding care options by Friday, April 3, 2020. Schools will be doing their best to accommodate urgent child care needs while meeting the guidelines and directives of the provincial health officer.

Since there are many students who will have challenges working online, schools have been directed to look at alternative approaches for continued learning that will fit with the individual needs and circumstances of their communities. School leaders are actively working on these plans, and families will hear from their school superintendent and/or school principal in the coming week with an update on their timelines.

Government is working with all 60 school boards, independent school authorities, First Nations schools, teachers, school leaders, support staff, public health officials and all education partners on a co-ordinated approach. Guidelines for developing education plans for students will follow these principles:

Maintain a healthy and safe environment for all students, families and employees.
Provide the services needed to support children of essential workers.
Support vulnerable students who may need special assistance.
Provide continuity of educational opportunities for all students.
These principles will also guide planning and support for students who need extra learning support or those with disabilities, important services like meal programs and child care services operating on school grounds.

“Boards of education across the province are working on ways to ensure continuity of learning in their communities,” said Stephanie Higginson, president, BC School Trustees Association. “Local boards of education understand the unique needs in each community. That local connection will be key as boards roll out plans tailored to each school district in the province.”

While teachers and schools will have primary responsibility for continuous learning, government has launched Keep Learning BC. This is a central place where families can find ideas for everyday educational activities, annotated links to free learning resources, as well as how to help children learn and how to ensure their well-being while they are at home. Keep Learning BC is available at: www.openschool.bc.ca/keeplearning/

The Keep Learning BC website will have helpful guides to maintain routines and stay safe online, giving parents information about how talk to their children about COVID-19, along with other mental health resources to manage stress or anxiety. A comprehensive set of frequently asked questions is also available, with continuous updates about school services and programs as things progress: www.gov.bc.ca/safeschools/

Fleming added, “While it’s important for kids to keep learning, there is no expectation that we can duplicate a normal school day at home, and every family will need to figure out what works best for them, in discussion with their children’s teachers. I understand that many children are experiencing anxiety, while also missing their teachers and friends, and that’s why it’s important they know the actions we’re taking are designed to keep everyone safe, and we will return to regular school life down the road. By working together and supporting each other, we will get through this.”

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, said, “We are proud of the parents, families and school communities who are working together to keep their children safely at home, and recognize how important it is for children to have continued learning opportunities in these challenging times. Parents who are health-care workers are also eagerly waiting for support, and it’s our job to work as a team to make sure they can continue their essential services.”

Quote:

Andrea Sinclair, president, BC Confederation of Parent Advisory Councils —

“The BC Confederation of Parent Advisory Councils is truly appreciative of the united effort that is being undertaken across the education sector resulting in the continuity of an educational program while our children are at home. Parents understand that alternative instruction plans are being created to best meet the needs of children and that learning will vary by grade, district and region. As we try to maintain a daily routine in our homes, including academics and recreation, parents acknowledge that educators play a critical role supporting our children during this extraordinary time.”

Quick Facts:

On March 17, 2020, under the direction of the provincial health officer, all schools were ordered to immediately suspend in-class instruction until further notice. 
Every student in K-12 will receive a final mark for the 2019-20 school year, and all students who are on track to move to the next grade will do so in the fall. Every student eligible to graduate from Grade 12 this school year will also graduate. On average, about 45,000 students graduate every year.
The Ministry of Education is also working across government to ensure all students graduating high school will have a smooth transition to post-secondary education.

This process will match parents, who are working on the front lines of B.C.’s COVID-19 response and have children up to five years of age, with child care in their communities.

Starting today, essential workers can fill out a new “parent” form to identify their need for urgent child care. Forms can be accessed by calling 1 888 338-6622 and selecting Option 4, or online:
www.gov.bc.ca/essential-service-child-care

Child Care Resource Referral (CCRR) centres in 38 communities will act as community-based hubs. The CCRRs will reach out to essential-service workers in their area who filled in the form to connect them with available licensed child care spaces.

Applicants will be asked:

which category of essential worker they are;
their child’s age; and
in which community they need child care.
Child care spaces will be prioritized for children whose parents work in public health and health services, social services, law enforcement, first responders and emergency response sectors. Additional spaces will then be given to families working in other crucial roles, defined as essential service workers.

The number of spaces available for essential service workers will be up to each child care operator, based on its licensed capacity and following any additional health requirements established by the provincial health officer.

Hours of operation for spaces will vary by facility. While many centres are open Monday to Friday, others may offer care on the weekends and outside the hours of 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Government is monitoring whether the needs of essential service workers for care outside of regular hours are being met.  

Child care centres, which are open, are required to follow the child care licensing regulation and guidelines on how to prevent the spread of and protect children and staff from COVID-19. This includes proper handwashing, regular cleaning and disinfecting, as well as identifying children who are sick. Families who want to access child care services must also continue to ensure their children are practising physical distancing with anyone outside of their immediate family circle.

To help the child care sector through this pandemic, the Ministry of Children and Family Development is providing temporary emergency funding to support providers and ensure access to child care is maintained for essential service workers.

Licensed providers that are open and operating are eligible to receive emergency funding at a rate of seven times their average monthly child care operating base funding. Centres will continue to be eligible for the Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative and the Early Childhood Educator Wage Enhancement. In addition, families accessing care from these providers may be eligible for the Affordable Child Care Benefit.

The form and matching process are temporary. They will remain in place for as long as the provincial health officer advises that all parents who can, should care for their children at home and that child care services can and must be provided for those families whose parents work in critical roles.  

The Ministry of Education has been working closely with school districts and independent schools to identify and support children, aged five to 12 years (kindergarten to Grade 6), whose parents are essential service workers, with a focus on public health and health services, social services, law enforcement, first responders and emergency response sectors. School districts and independent school authorities have been asked to ensure students whose parents work in these fields have access to care during regular before-, during- and after-school hours.

Hours of care will vary by school district and independent school. If essential service workers who have school-aged children need before-, during- and after-hours care for their children, they are asked to contact their school district directly. Most school districts have already reached out directly to families through surveys to gather information on urgent child care needs.

As British Columbians navigate these uncertain times together, parents who can are asked to care for their children at home. All children and staff who are ill with fever, have cold, influenza or infectious respiratory symptoms of any kind must stay home. If they are unsure of their status, BCCOVID-19 BC Support App and Self-Assessment Tool and the BC Centre for Disease Control’s online assessment tool can help assess whether or not they can return to child care.

“We are announcing 25 new cases, for a total of 1,291 cases in British Columbia.

“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 603 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 458 are in the Fraser Health region, 79 are in the Island Health region, 128 are in the Interior Health region and 23 are in the Northern Health region.

“We are saddened to report a further four COVID-19 related deaths in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser health regions for a total of 43 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.

“There have been no new long-term care facility outbreaks in the last day. Vancouver Coastal and Fraser health teams continue to provide support to the affected long-term care and assisted-living facilities, which have a combined 213 cases of COVID-19.

“To date, 805 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation.

“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 138 individuals are hospitalized, and 66 of those are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.

“Starting tomorrow and over the coming days, British Columbians of many faiths, along with millions around the world, will be celebrating major religious holidays in ways that many have never experienced before.

“B.C.’s faith leaders have taken the challenge of maintaining physical distance to heart and are using these holidays as an opportunity to reinforce our commitment to showing kindness and care for our communities.

“We call on faith leaders, followers and congregations to pay special attention to our Elders and seniors to ensure we protect them by connecting safely from a distance.

“We know many people must manage chronic diseases and other health issues. We encourage people to continue to connect with their primary care provider or family physician for ongoing care. Phone and virtual resources are available for everyone.

“This long weekend, we need to stay home, to stay in our communities and to stay at a safe physical distance from others when outside. Avoiding unnecessary travel, particularly to smaller communities, where they may be unable to support you if you get sick and where they have fewer resources, is an important way we can protect ourselves and our loved ones.

“Let’s continue to stand united, to stay strong and do all we can to flatten the curve.”

A backgrounder follows.",BC Ministry of Health,,"Joint statement on Province of B.C.'s COVID-19 response, latest updates",https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020HLTH0019-000649,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020-04-08,Canada,British Columbia,All,0.0,1.0,,,,,,,,2.0,0.0,,Government Website,"BC Parks is immediately closing all provincial parks in response to the widespread call for increased action to address COVID-19.

The closure responds to both the federal and provincial directives that people should stay close to home to reduce COVID-19 transmission risk. This temporary measure means people should not be going to provincial parks until further notice.

“Because physical distancing works, it is critical that we take every action needed to restrict the spread of COVID-19. This applies to British Columbians and out-of-province visitors who were planning to visit or stay at our provincial parks. The message is clear: stay home, avoid travel, do not put yourself or others at risk,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy.

“I understand and share the love people in British Columbia have for the outdoors and the connection between health and proximity to nature. We tried to provide safe space for people to get some exercise and fresh air in our beautiful parks. But it has proven too challenging to maintain safe distance between visitors. This action is difficult but necessary. We look forward to the day we can welcome people back to our wonderful parks.”

The decision to close the park system is informed by continued feedback from RCMP, local government, First Nations, local search-and-rescue organizations and the general public. While many people are observing the physical distancing requirements set by the provincial health officer (PHO), some continue to ignore the order, making enforcement in a wilderness setting challenging.

The timing of this decision is important given the upcoming long weekend and the beginning of the busy season for outdoor recreation and camping. BC Parks is also extending the ban on all camping in provincial parks until May 31, 2020, in alignment with neighbouring jurisdictions and the temporary closure of Canada’s national parks. Refunds for bookings up to May 31 will be sent automatically.

As previously announced, the Recreation Sites and Trails BC (RSTBC) branch of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development has also closed its campgrounds and amenities in response to the COVID-19 situation.

BC Parks has taken a scaled and phased in approach to limiting park access following PHO requirements and the latest COVID-19 transmission data. BC Parks recognizes the value of nature in contributing to public health and wellness and will expand access to the park system as soon as the PHO indicates it can be done without increasing the risk of COVID-19 transmission.

The measures, which include a new legal requirement to provide a self-isolation plan, support the provincial health officer’s travel orders and reinforce the federal emergency order under the Quarantine Act requiring people entering Canada to self-isolate for 14 days.

“As we welcome British Columbians back home, we must stay vigilant and do everything we can to stop the spread of COVID-19,” said Premier John Horgan. “As we follow the advice and guidance of our provincial health officer, it’s also important to take care of one another. By supporting people through a self-isolation plan after international travel, we will keep people safe and help flatten the curve.”

Effective immediately, international travellers (including from the United States) coming to the province are required to provide a self-isolation plan before or upon arrival to B.C., regardless of their point of entry to Canada.

This document, which can be submitted online or completed in person on arrival, must show that returning travellers have supports in place to safely self-isolate for 14 days.

Beginning Friday, April 10, 2020, provincial officials will be on hand at the Vancouver International Airport and major land border crossings to make sure self-isolation plans are complete and to assist those who need it.

Upon border arrival, self-isolation plans will be reviewed by officials, and travellers will be supported as follows:

If a self-isolation plan is submitted and approved, travellers will receive a confirmation. This confirmation can be shown on arrival. Travellers with approved plans will proceed to their home residence (or another identified accommodation) to self-isolate.
If an airline traveller arrives and an adequate self-isolation plan is proposed but needs additional support to execute safely (e.g., enlist volunteers to deliver groceries or fill prescriptions once at home), travellers may be taken or directed to an accommodation site provided in collaboration with the provincial and federal governments to begin self-isolation, while outstanding details of their plan are put in place. With an approved self-isolation plan, they may return home. Without an approved plan, they will remain at an accommodation site for 14 days.
If a traveller arrives at a major land border crossing and needs additional supports to execute a self-isolation plan, they will be sent directly home to start self-isolating and will be followed up with by officials for additional support.
If a traveller does not have a self-isolation plan or is unable to safely carry one out as determined by officials, they may be transported or sent to an accommodation provided by government where they can safely complete their 14-day self-isolation.
Emergency Management BC, through a network of community supports and volunteer organizations, will help travellers with necessary food deliveries, prescription drugs and other supplies so people can safely self-isolate for 14 days.

The Province, through Service BC, will follow up with travellers in self-isolation with telephone calls and text messages to make sure people have the support they need to complete their mandatory self-isolation. If required, the Province will work with travellers to modify self-isolation plans to ensure public safety.

The federal government will continue to use its authority under the Quarantine Act to ensure compliance with the emergency order requiring individuals entering Canada to self-isolate for 14 days, enforceable by the RCMP. Maximum penalties for breaking the federal emergency order include fines of up to $750,000 and/or imprisonment for six months, or up to $1 million and/or imprisonment up to three years for a person who causes a risk of imminent death or serious bodily harm.

Quick Facts:

Self-isolation plans can be submitted at: www.gov.bc.ca/returningtravellers
Self-isolation plans can also be submitted via the BC COVID-19 Support App and Self-Assessment Tool under “travellers.”
24/7 land crossing borders are the Douglas (Peace Arch), Pacific, Osoyoos and Boundary Bay.
Essential service workers who must travel across the border for work must still create a self-isolation plan and self-monitor. However, they are only expected to implement their plan if they develop symptoms. These essential workers include health-care workers, critical infrastructure, trade and transportation workers, airline crews and people making medical deliveries.

“While people across the province are staying home to stem the spread of COVID-19 and protect us all, for some, home is not a safe place. We know that social isolation is making life harder for women and children who live in unstable or violent situations.

“If you reach out for help, we will make sure there is a safe space during this emergency – no matter where you live in B.C.

“BC Housing is already working with our partner organizations to support women and children who would otherwise be trapped at home in dangerous situations.

“I want to thank all of our partners and the front-line workers who are there for women and children now, and every day. We could not do this work without you. I also want to thank Minister Selina Robinson, BC Housing and Premier Horgan for their leadership on providing supports for people who need them most during this time of crisis.

“If you or someone you know is experiencing violence or abuse, please contact VictimLinkBC at 1 800 563-0808 or by email at: VictimLinkBC@bc211.ca

“They can connect you to these supports and are available to help 24/7 with service in multiple languages.

“Violent and unstable homes are still an unacceptable reality for many people, and during times of crisis, levels of violence can increase.

“We may be distanced, but we are united in our work to help keep British Columbians safe. We are in this together, and together, we will get through this.”

Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer (PHO), has indicated that the next few weeks are critical in managing this pandemic, so it’s more important than ever to continue to follow public health guidelines and practise physical distancing to prevent further spread. Though the long weekend is normally a time when people go out for recreation, celebration and connection, the provincial health officer is urging British Columbians to stay home to help flatten the curve.

Here is some important information and tips that can help British Columbians ensure that everyone can enjoy the long weekend, while following the public safety guidelines set by the provincial health officer.

Follow public health orders and guidelines

British Columbians are asked to continue to maintain physical distancing, as well as take these other important measures to limit the spread of COVID-19:

Stay home for at least 10 days if you have any symptoms of illness. After 10 days, if your temperature is normal and you feel better, you can return to your routine activities. Coughing may persist for several weeks, so a cough alone does not mean you need to continue to self-isolate for more than 10 days.
Stay at least two metres (over six feet) away from other people outside your household.
Wash your hands frequently with soap and water, for at least 20 seconds.
Avoid touching your face.
British Columbians who are returning from abroad need to prepare a self-isolation plan before returning to the country to keep our communities safe. Guidance for those returning from international destinations is available here: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Factsheet_Returning_Travelers.pdf
Anyone who has friends or family members who are coming home from abroad are encouraged to help them understand the new rules related to COVID-19. Guidance for families of those returning home is available here: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Factsheet_Returning_Family.pdf
 More information for returning travellers is available here: www.gov.bc.ca/returningtravellers
Safely mark holidays and religious observances

At this time, the PHO is reminding everyone to continue practising physical distancing, avoid large gatherings and stay away from others if ill. That includes religious and other celebratory gatherings that typical take place during this long weekend for Easter, Passover and Vaisakhi.

Many faith-based organizations are finding ways to virtually connect to continue to observe occasions in a safe way. Or, look for creative and innovative ways to safely observe the holiday by attending virtual services or using FaceTime, Zoom or Skype to stay in touch with other members of your community.

Guidelines for faith-based gatherings are available here: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/covid-19/covid-19-pho-guidance-faith-based-organizations.pdf

Avoid non-essential travel and recreation

The transportation network is essential for maintaining the critical supply chain for food, goods and medicine, and ensuring people have access to essential goods and services. There are currently no plans to shut down any of B.C.’s public roads, but now is not the time to travel for tourism or recreation. By temporarily avoiding non-essential travel, British Columbians can do their part to protect vulnerable people in communities from COVID-19.

Things to keep in mind over this long weekend include:

Don’t visit vacation properties

This is not the time to travel to secondary homes or vacation properties in other communities. It’s not only important stay home and maintain physical distancing, but access to resources and health care may be more challenging in smaller communities if someone should become ill or if there’s a community outbreak. By staying home, British Columbians can take pressure off the already strained resources in these smaller areas.
BC Parks are closed

Finding ways to maintain safe distances has been an ongoing challenge in some of B.C.’s more popular parks and recreation sites. This is why BC Parks has announced an immediate closure of all provincial parks. Also closed are all federal parks, as well as campgrounds and amenities run by B.C.’s Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. Parks will reopen as soon as the provincial health officer indicates it’s safe to do so. 

Keep search and rescue volunteers safe

With the COVID-19 pandemic, there is higher risk for B.C.’s 2,500 search-and-rescue volunteers, as there is a risk of virus transmission during a call to help those who have been lost, stranded or injured in B.C.’s outdoors. With more people staying home, search and rescue calls have dropped by 50%. However, British Columbians are asked to do their part and not to venture into the wilderness at this time.

Things you can do close to home

Virtual visits

Instead of visiting families and friends in person, look for creative and innovative ways to safely connect with friends and family, such as virtual coffee dates and using FaceTime, Zoom or Skype to stay in touch.
Safe recreation

Getting outside for fresh air and exercise is important – so long as family can keep a safe distance of at least two metres from others outside their household.
Some parks and beaches have closed because they’re too busy. There are many other quieter outdoor spaces to enjoy, so long as everyone can keep a safe physical distance.
Being outdoors, walking pets and physical activities, such as going for a bike ride are all safe, so long as a safe physical distance is maintained.
Help elderly or vulnerable neighbours

The PHO is encouraging people to be kind and support each other as much as possible.
Elderly or vulnerable people may need assistance collecting groceries or prescriptions.
Need help? Call 211, a B.C. service that matches seniors with volunteers during the pandemic.
Spring clean but keep donations for now

With everyone staying at home, it’s a great time to do some spring cleaning.
However, with the current physical distancing orders in place, most charities are not currently picking up goods from their donation bins right now.
For now, hold onto your donations. Please don’t leave them around the donation bins.
Protect your home from floods and wildfire

British Columbians should make sure they are prepared for all emergencies, and this time at home is a good opportunity to reduce flood and wildfire risks.
Take time to clean gutters, maintain perimeter drains, clear storm drains of debris, ensure waterspouts are away from residences, and complete some simple landscaping to manage run-off.
Make sure to thin and trim trees, shrubs and other vegetation, and remove dead brush and other flammable material from the property. Also, make sure to use fire-resistant building and landscaping materials.

2020-04-10,Canada,British Columbia,All,0.0,1.0,,,,,,,,2.0,0.0,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,Government Website,"From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have regularly seen people choose to wear a variety of masks, from medical masks to cloth face coverings, in grocery stores and parks, on buses and sidewalks.

As we all look to protect our loved ones and ourselves, many have asked if this is the right thing to do.

What we know about the virus that causes COVID-19 is that it spreads from droplets when people who are infected with the virus cough, sneeze or expel droplets when they are in close contact (within one to two metres) with others. This is why physical distancing is so important and why self-isolation is necessary when we are ill or have recently travelled. This is also why washing our hands, covering our mouths when we cough, and not touching our face or eyes are the best actions we, as individuals, can take during the pandemic.

Equally important is the need to reserve medical masks and N95 respirators for our health-care-workers. It is their job to care for us when we are ill and having the correct protective equipment to do that is crucial for them and for all of us.

So how do non-medical cloth masks fit in? The Canadian public health special advisory committee has closely reviewed evidence from around the world to answer this question. We now know that some people can spread the virus when they have very mild symptoms or may be unaware they are infected.

As Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer, has explained, a non-medical cloth mask or face covering can help you keep your own droplets out of the air and off surfaces. Choosing to wear such a face covering is like coughing or sneezing into a tissue or your sleeve.

A non-medical cloth mask or face covering, while helpful in containing your own droplets, will not protect you from COVID-19, nor is wearing one required of you if you can keep your safe distance from others. Moreover, using a cloth mask does not give you permission to disregard physical distancing and self-isolation orders. Indeed, these, along with respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene, remain the key proven measures to stop transmission.

Wearing a cloth mask or face covering is a matter of personal choice. It is another tool you can choose, particularly when maintaining that important safe distance can be a challenge.

Our most important advice remains the same: if you are sick, you should stay home. Wearing a cloth mask may contain your virus droplets, but it does not make it okay to go out. Maintain a safe distance from others when you are out, clean your hands regularly and avoid touching your face.

I applaud the creativity and ingenuity of many who have taken the time to make these cloth masks and it is encouraging to see the social connections that have been made by sharing patterns and creative ideas online.

If you choose to wear a non-medical cloth mask or face covering, I remind you of the importance of continuing to not touch your face when wearing it. This is often challenging especially for small children, and of course, be cautious when removing the cloth mask. Wash it regularly and do not share it with others.

We want everyone to stand united and stay strong. Every British Columbian has a part to play in flattening the curve. Let’s all be safe, be calm, be kind and do the right thing.

“Through this challenging time, British Columbians are leading the way in our efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19,” said Premier John Horgan. “We are starting to see the results of our sacrifice, dedication and hard work, and we must continue to be steadfast in our commitment to keep our communities safe – for ourselves, our loved ones and our workers on the front lines.”

The state of emergency is extended through the end of the day on April 28, 2020, allowing government to continue to take the necessary steps to keep British Columbians safe.

“British Columbians should be proud of the way we have responded to this crisis. But the work is not over,” Farnworth said. “We must hold our ground and take all the steps needed to make sure our communities remain safe and our essential service workers are supported in our ongoing efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19.”

Actions taken in the previous two weeks to support British Columbians include:

introducing a new legal requirement to provide a self-isolation plan to support the federal Quarantine Act, and making sure British Columbians returning home from international destinations have the support they need to self-isolate and keep their communities safe from COVID-19;
partnering with the Digital Technology Supercluster and the Business Council of British Columbia to create the COVID-19 Supply Hub, a made-in-B.C. online platform to co-ordinate, find and speed up the delivery of medical supplies and personal protective equipment for provincial health authorities to support front-line health workers fighting COVID-19;
opening applications for the Province’s new temporary rental supplement, supporting renters who are experiencing a loss of income during the COVID-19 pandemic;
announcing $5 million to expand existing mental-health programs and services and launch new services to ensure British Columbians have increased access to vital mental-health supports during the COVID-19 pandemic;
implementing a series of temporary supports and supplements to ensure B.C.’s most vulnerable – including people on income or disability assistance and low-income seniors – do not encounter additional barriers during the COVID-19 crisis;
establishing an Emergency Relief Support Fund for children and youth with special needs and their families that will provide a direct payment of $225 per month to eligible families over the next three months;
issuing new provincial health officer (PHO) guidelines for municipal bylaw officers and other compliance officers to make sure there is compliance with the PHO’s orders and, if necessary, they are enforced consistently throughout B.C. communities; and
partnering with local governments, non-profits and the hotel industry to support British Columbians who need a place to self-isolate and to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including people experiencing homelessness, people without safe spaces to self-isolate and youth.
Actions taken to date build on supports already in place as part of government’s COVID-19 Action Plan, which includes $5 billion in income supports, tax relief and direct funding for people, businesses and services.

The extension of the provincial state of emergency is based on recommendations from B.C.’s health and emergency management officials. Farnworth made the original declaration on March 18, 2020, after Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, declared a public health emergency the previous day.

The Province has created 1 888 COVID-19 to connect British Columbians needing non-medical information about COVID-19. This includes the latest information on travel recommendations and physical distancing, as well as access to support and resources from the provincial and federal governments. The call line is available seven days a week, from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. (Pacific time), in 110 languages. People with questions related to their health and COVID-19 should call 811.

Quick Facts:

Declarations of provincial states of emergency may be issued by the minister responsible under the Emergency Program Act.
The provincial government can extend the period of a declaration made by the minister responsible for further periods of time for up to 14 days at a time.
During the 2017 wildfire season, the province was in a provincial state of emergency for 10 weeks from July 7 to Sept. 15.

Business COVID-19 Support Service will serve as a single point of contact for businesses throughout the province looking for information on resources available during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The B.C. Business COVID-19 Support Service will be operated by Small Business BC (SBBC), a non-profit organization that is well known and respected by the business community. The service will act as a one-stop resource to answer questions about supports available to businesses from the provincial and federal governments, industry and community partners. 

“We know that business owners are worried about paying their bills and covering their payrolls, and our government is doing everything we can to help,” said Michelle Mungall, B.C.’s Minister of Jobs, Economic Development and Competitiveness. “There are multiple programs available, including the B.C. government’s COVID-19 Action Plan, to support businesses through these challenging times. I encourage people in the business community to reach out to Small Business BC to learn more.”

Throughout B.C. there are over 500,000 small businesses that contribute significantly to B.C.’s communities and economy. To respond to the needs of these small businesses, and all other businesses around the province, SBBC will offer expanded services.

Starting on Thursday, April 16, 2020, advisors are available Monday to Friday, from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Pacific time) and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at 1 833 254-4357. Inquiries can also be emailed to covid@smallbusinessbc.ca, or raised on the live-chat feature available on SBBC’s dedicated website: https://covid.smallbusinessbc.ca

Support is available in multiple languages and a call-back feature will be in place to help manage high call volumes.

“The immediate impacts of COVID-19 are being felt by businesses across the province,” said Tom Conway, CEO, Small Business BC. “This new support service will help businesses connect quickly with our existing programs and services, and also learn about the supports being provided by the federal and provincial governments.”

SBBC’s dedicated website will include announcements from industry and community partners, as well as a variety of resources, including webinars and practical tools. In addition, SBBC will continue to provide its usual service, like access to expert business advisors, educational services, and free resources in the context of COVID-19.

“We’re working closely with businesses and workers across the country to assess and address the impact of COVID-19,” said Melanie Joly, federal Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages, and Minister responsible for Western Economic Diversification Canada. “Our message to them is clear: we’re here for you now with concrete measures, like the B.C. Business COVID-19 Support Service, we’ll be here for you in the days and weeks to come and we’ll get through this together.”

Support for businesses and their employees is a top priority for both governments. The support service will provide employers with information on resources available that they can share with their staff.

“We know that B.C.’s usually thriving tourism industry has been hit hard by COVID-19,” said Lisa Beare, B.C.’s Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture. “This support service will help B.C.’s tourism sector manage the impacts of this virus and be ready to welcome visitors back to our province, when it is safe to explore B.C. again.”

The B.C. Business Covid-19 Support Service is supported by the B.C. government and the Government of Canada through Western Economic Diversification Canada. As the situation evolves, both governments will continue to support businesses and take further action as needed.

Council will consider deferring the property tax penalty date from July 2 to September 1, 2020 for those who really need to do that. Otherwise, if you can pay please do so, as it will help the City maintain essential services.  

Other financial practice changes will include temporarily waiving interest charges on utilities and accounts receivables; 

suspending collection agency efforts on all receivables; and waiving NSF charges until August 31, 2020. 

We encourage citizens to look into the province’s current property tax deferment program offering low-interest loans for those who qualify. You may qualify if you are 55 or older during the current year, a surviving spouse of any age, a person with disabilities or if you are a parent, step-parent or financially supporting a child.  

For the final budget, our immediate focus is on cost reductions. Details of those decisions will be available when the final budget is presented the end of April or early May. 

I want to thank everyone who is abiding by Dr. Bonnie Henry’s orders to wash your hands often, keep a physical distance, stay home if you can, and limit your trips in public places.   

Unfortunately, we are still receiving concerns about the lack of physical distancing in some of our more popular areas like Knox Mountain Park and the waterfront promenade. If we want to to keep these community jewels open, everyone must practice physical distancing or we’ll have no choice but to close these areas.  

Bylaw Officers and RCMP are not empowered to enforce physical distancing, since it’s not an order from the Medical Health Officer, but they will continue to educate residents and businesses as part of our day-to-day interactions with people. 

Bylaw Enforcement Officers are fully engaged in monitoring and reacting to complaints about non-compliance with public health orders.  

They can issue warnings to those who continue to defy public health orders, and they will report repeated cases on non-compliance to Interior Health for follow-up. 

Today is the first Council meeting we are broadcasting live on the City website at kelowna.ca/council. Castanet and Shaw Cable will now use this stream for broadcasts. 

This system also includes an option effective March 27 to choose individual items on past agendas to watch, in case, for some strange reason, you don’t want to watch the entire Council meeting… Just click on the agenda item from past meetings and you can watch the presentation and discussion on that one item. 

This system will help us move to meetings that are closed to the public physically, but still open for viewing by the public, in accordance with the special considerations granted under the provincial state of emergency. 

We want to make Council decisions as transparent as we can for citizens in the middle of all this disruption, particularly as decisions are made about the City budget and service levels. 

Finally, I want to once again thank everyone working on the frontlines to keep essential service and supply chains going. Council and our citizens really do appreciate your work, as we can see from the growing displays of appreciation with messages in our windows and friendly (and sometimes noisy) drive-by visits to healthcare workers and first responders.   

Together we will get through this and emerge stronger and more resilient than ever.""",The City of Kelowna,,City of Kelowna - COVID-19 (Coronavirus) response,https://www.kelowna.ca/our-community/covid-19/covid-19-response,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These measures are intended to further mitigate the spread of COVID-19 while ensuring essential services are maintained.

Closures and service modifications starting today
Included in the list of closures and service modifications effective today are:

Public access to the Services Centre, Revenue Services, and Engineering Services at Crossroads will be limited to appointments and we are working to implement digital solutions such as video conferencing and greater use of phone and email.
Council-appointed advisory meetings, open houses, workshops, pop-up and street activities, along with rezoning open houses are suspended until further notice.
All boards and commissions are suspended until further notice.
Event permits will be limited to the maximum guidelines set out by the provincial health officer as of the day of the event, with any current permits for gatherings of 50 or more people to be revoked.
The Park Board has cancelled all permits for special events at all of its facilities, effective immediately and until May 30. Permit holders will be issued a refund and will receive priority booking once special events resume.
The Park Board is working toward full closure of children’s day camps at its community centres by the end of the day on Friday, March 20.
Operating hours at Carnegie and Evelyne Saller Community Centres are being reduced to 9am - 8pm. Food services at Gathering Place and shower and laundry services at Evelyne Saller will continue to ensure that people have access to these meals. These centres will take a room-by-room approach to reducing group size to less than 50 people.
The Homelessness Services Outreach team continues to operate as an essential service and their office at 392 Powell Street remains open from 9am to 4pm.
Eleven handwashing stations have been deployed in the Downtown Eastside to increase access to hand-washing facilities.
We are no longer taking bookings for memorial services at Mountain View Cemetery Celebration Hall but casket burials and interments will continue.
Services that remain open
These services remain unaffected:

Inspections and enforcement, such as fire, development, building, and licensing, will continue as-is.
The Vancouver Transfer Station and Landfill, as well the Manitoba and National Works Yard will continue to operate as-is.
Task force created to help Downtown Eastside residents
We have partnered with Vancouver Coastal Health and BC Housing on a multi-agency public partner task force to identify and implement measures to help protect people who are experiencing homelessness, living in SROs, and in the Downtown Eastside (DTES). The task force is working to:

Improve communications with DTES residents and service providers
Secure additional locations where people who need to self-isolate but are experiencing homelessness can go
Consider other basic needs issues such as food security and access to medication and safe supply
The task force is connecting with community networks and organizations to support in the response design and delivery.

2020-03-19,Canada,British Columbia,Vancouver,2.0,0.0,,,,,,,,2.0,1.0,,Government Website,"Vancouver City Council declares local state of emergency
March 19 2020 – Vancouver City Council voted today to declare a local state of emergency as a result of COVID-19. 
Declaring a local state of emergency allows us to take additional measures to ensure we have the resources needed to maintain essential services and meet the demands of other agencies, including Vancouver Coastal Health.

These measures include:

Acquiring or using land or personal property to prevent, respond to, or alleviate the effects of the emergency, including the use of buildings to assist with the increased demands for healthcare, shelter, and childcare
Procuring on a first-priority basis any clothing, equipment, medical supplies, or other essential supplies required to cope with the emergency, for the duration of the emergency
Restricting the use or occupancy of any premises within the City of Vancouver
Grants amended to help social service agencies respond to the emergency
Council also voted to amend the 2020 Community Service Grants and Renter Service Grants approvals to encompass the COVID-19 response. 

Social services agencies in Vancouver are working very hard to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the people they support. This change will allow the community to respond to COVID-19 as quickly as possible. These organizations can now use the grant streams to:

Support work within the community to mitigate or prevent the transmission of COVID-19
Assist any service recipients who contract COVID-19
Protect the health of the employees and volunteers of these agencies
Task force working to improve communication and find more places for people to self-isolate
We have partnered with Vancouver Coastal Health and BC Housing on a multi-agency public partner task force to identify and implement measures to help protect people who are experiencing homelessness, living in single room occupancy housing units (SROs), and in the Downtown Eastside (DTES).

The task force is working to:

Improve communications with DTES residents and service providers
Secure additional locations where people who need to self-isolate but are experiencing homelessness can go
Consider other basic needs such as food security and access to medication and safe supply
Connect with community networks and organizations to support in the response design and delivery
Park washrooms remain open and serviced
This week, we deployed 11 handwashing stations in the Downtown Eastside and the Park Board deployed one station in Oppenheimer Park. Four were stolen and three of those have since been recovered. Please help ensure these essential services remain intact. We are all in this together and need to ensure everyone has access to proper handwashing stations. All washrooms in parks remain open and are being serviced. 

Public access to City buildings is now limited, yet many services are available online, by phone, or by appointment
To curb the potential spread of COVID-19, we are now limiting public access to many City buildings. This includes:

City Hall
Development and Building Services Centre
Engineering Services Client Services Counter
Many services will continue to be available online, by phone or by appointment.

All Vancouver Park Board, Vancouver Public Library and Vancouver Civic Theatre sites remain closed.

We have announced several closures and service impacts as a result of COVID-19.

We continue to work with public health officials and multiple partners on the COVID-19 response. There is the potential for even further service closures in the days to come as we make every effort to ensure essential services are maintained to the highest level.

Quotes
Mayor Kennedy Stewart
""Today, with the advice of our senior staff and emergency management team, Council took swift action to ensure our City has all the tools it needs to keep Vancouver residents safe. By declaring a local state of emergency in the City of Vancouver, we are ensuring we have the tools we need to protect and house vulnerable residents, deploy medical supplies and equipment, and restrict the operations of any property in Vancouver. This will help our staff, many of whom are essential front-line workers, do their jobs safely. But we all need to do our part to help essential staff do their jobs: stay home if you can, avoid close contact with others in public, and obey the directives of the City and public health officials."" 

City Manager Sadhu Johnston
“Declaring a local state of emergency means our dedicated teams can now take the appropriate next steps as we work around the clock to combat the impacts of COVID-19. We know this is a difficult situation for many, but we will get through this together and this declaration provides additional tools for staff in addressing this rapidly evolving situation.” 

Councillor Christine Boyle
“This pandemic is making clear what was always the case: We are interdependent. We are safer and healthier when everyone is safe and healthy. Strong and well-funded public services, public health systems, social safety nets, make everyone better off. 

Today’s decision to declare a local state of Emergency is a reflection of the urgency and seriousness with which Vancouver City Staff, Mayor and Council are approaching the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation. Residents can do their part by taking it seriously too. Wash your hands. Cancel your plans. Reach out from a distance to support one another. We’re all in this together.”

Councillor Jean Swanson
”I’m happy that the City will now be able to acquire buildings and supplies that we need and I hope that, if the province doesn’t bring in an eviction moratorium before April 1st, that the City will seek to expand our own powers to do this. Take care out there everyone!”

Councillor Pete Fry
On the Emergency Declaration: ""Vancouverites should feel secure knowing that today's decision to declare a local state of emergency is not something to fear, but a tool that we are deploying to make rapid decisions in order to keep residents safe where and as we need to.""

On grants: ""The COVID-19 crisis has brought out the kindness, compassion and some of the very best of Vancouver. Through rapid deployment of our already-approved direct social service grants, we are ensuring  that we are getting resources to communities supporting communities in this time of need.""",City of Vancouver,,Vancouver City Council declares local state of emergency,https://vancouver.ca/news-calendar/vancouver-city-council-declares-local-state-of-emergency.aspx,2.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Protect yourself and others
People not in self-isolation do not need to remain indoors. However, everyone needs to avoid being in close contact with people in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. To protect yourself and others:

Keep at least 2 metres (6 feet) from others 
Visit parks and beaches during less busy times
Limit the number of visits to parks and beaches to provide opportunities for others to access
Avoid gathering in groups
Limit high-touch recreational activities such as volleyball or frisbee
Wash or sanitize hands after touching communal surfaces
Anyone feeling sick, especially if coughing or experiencing a fever, please stay at home

March 22 2020 – Effective immediately, the Vancouver Park Board is prohibiting parking at its most high-traffic parks and beaches across the city, including:
Kitsilano Beach
English Bay
Queen Elizabeth Park
Stanley Park
VanDusen Botanical Garden
The closures will be phased in throughout today and many will be in full effect by Monday morning. The closures will remain in place indefinitely.

We're taking this measure as a result of insufficient public compliance with social distancing protocol at many parks and beaches.

We look to everyone to comply with the parking lot closures beginning Monday morning as we work to implement barriers and additional signage throughout the day. 

High-priority parking lots will close first
We're closing lots that are considered high priority first, and will then extend closures to additional sites that are considered lower priority.

High-priority parking lots include:

Kitsilano Beach
Queen Elizabeth Park
English Bay
Jericho Beach
Locarno Beach
The Seawall
Stanley Park
VanDusen Botanical Gardens
Visit parks and beaches during off-peak hours and keep two metres apart from others
Currently Vancouver’s beaches and parks remain open. However, we strongly urge you to visit during off-peak hours and to always maintain a safe distance from others of at least two meters.

Recent Park Board closures due to the coronavirus

April 7 2020 – The Vancouver Park Board will be closing Stanley Park to all vehicles starting Wednesday, April 8 in an effort to reduce the number of people in the park and to enable physical distancing. It is the latest in a series of measures the Park Board has taken in recent weeks to reduce the risk of the COVID-19 pandemic to the public.
Causeway will remain open
The closure will be carried out Wednesday morning and will remain in place indefinitely. It will be implemented via physical barriers and signage at key access points to the park, supported by Park Rangers and the VPD. Digital traffic signs on Georgia St, English Bay, and the Stanley Park Causeway will alert motorists to the closure. The Causeway will remain open.

Reducing the number of visitors to the park
Despite the closure of all parking lots in Stanley Park more than a week ago, visitors have still been observed travelling by car to the park, particularly on sunny days, and parking illegally on the road.

Closing Stanley Park’s roads will reduce the daily number of people in the park and open up space for cyclists and pedestrians from the neighbourhood.

Once the closure is implemented, the Park Board will be encouraging cyclists to keep a safe physical distance from pedestrians by moving off the seawall and using the adjacent Stanley Park Drive, which will be free of traffic. 

Access available to emergency services, #19 bus, and staff
Emergency services, the #19 bus, and Park Board and City service vehicles will still be able to access the park.

There will also be limited access for key tenants and leaseholders via checkpoints at the Georgia St roundabout, facilitated by Rangers and Park Board staff.

Access will be provided to staff of the Rowing Club, Yacht Club, HMCS Discovery, Prospect Point, and Stanley Park Ecological Society. 

Protect yourself and others
Vancouver is among cities with the densest neighbourhood populations in Canada, and residents rely on park spaces for fresh air, much like a backyard. It is paramount that everyone shares the spaces and uses them safely.

Always maintain a safe physical distance of a least two metres
Use parks and beaches for a short break to exercise, not to socialize
Visit during less busy times (mornings, late evenings, or when it’s cloudy or damp outside)
Access neighbourhood or community parks and do not drive to destination parks and beaches
Keep dogs on leash when walking, unless using an official off-leash park
Refrain from touching shared surfaces and be vigilant about hand-washing
Consider wearing a cloth (non-medical) face mask when exercising vigorously or accessing public spaces

Closure to help local residents
We heard concerns about the inability for residents to practice physical distancing while exercising or getting fresh air, particularly in denser parts of the city like the West End. As a result, we are temporarily closing eastbound lanes of Beach Avenue to vehicles between Hornby Street and Stanley Park, so local residents can use the lanes for walking and biking while keeping two metres apart.

The goal of this partial closure is not to encourage large gatherings, but to give nearby residents more room to move while also being able to practice physical distancing. This is a responsive measure and not intended as an invitation to gather. 

Using local streets in your own neighbourhood
The Stanley Park Seawall and English Bay areas are already very crowded. Residents are encouraged to get exercise and fresh air in their own neighbourhoods while maintaining two-metre spacing from others. Many of Vancouver’s local streets are excellent for walking, running, and biking. 

What drivers can expect
While this temporary closure is in effect:

All eastbound traffic, including the 23 bus, will be diverted to Davie Street 
Motorists can still access their residences from the westbound lane 
Drivers travelling westward who need to access Beach Avenue west of Denman Street will be diverted briefly onto Denman and then onto Morton Avenue before rejoining Beach Avenue 
Residential parking will be maintained on the north side of Beach Ave where possible 
Staff will monitor the situation and adjust if needed.

This includes all permit parking west of Burrard Street.
As people from other parts of the city continue to travel by car, particularly during nice weather, to enjoy the Stanley Park Seawall, English Bay beaches, and Stanley Park, we are taking additional steps to deter people from driving to the West End.

Keep active and stay safe
The goal is to enable physical distancing and reduce the number of people congregating on the area's beaches, the Seawall, and Stanley Park. This measure is in addition to the Park Board's closure on Wednesday, April 8, 20202, of Stanley Park to vehicles.

We ask that people stay in their own neighbourhoods and take advantage of local parks and green space to exercise and get fresh air rather than converging on popular trails and beaches.

Enforcement and signage
Parking enforcement officers will begin ticketing cars parked in permit parking zones in the West End on Thursday afternoon. Large signs will be placed at access points to the West End, so that drivers are aware parking enforcement has resumed.

We are committed to ensuring healthcare workers can continue to park for free during the COVID-19 crisis. We are working directly with healthcare facilities in the area to ensure parking remains available and accessible.

Actions you can take
The Stay Home, Stay Put public campaign reminds people of the five main actions they can take to help limit the spread of the virus, including:

Maintaining physical distance of at least 2 metres with others outside your home
Avoiding any gatherings of people on private property, at work, or in parks
Working from home if possible
Only go out for essential activities such as shopping for groceries, picking up prescriptions, and exercising alone or with members of your household
Staying home if you are sick or showing symptoms
These steps will help keep us, our loved ones, neighbours, and colleagues safe, and means we will be in a much stronger position to recover and rebuild when this pandemic is over.",City of Vancouver,,City resumes enforcement of permit parking zones in West End,https://vancouver.ca/news-calendar/city-resumes-enforcement-of-permit-parking-zones-in-west-end.aspx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additional measures are also being taken in partnership with Vancouver Coastal Health to support enhanced access to critical information and services, including the opening of a community information and service point. The service point will start initially with overdose prevention services as of today and then other components will be added, including real time-information for community members, access to peer work, and other services as next steps.

We're funding several peer work programs to upscale efforts to inform and distribute critical information. Karen Ward, our advisor for COVID-19 response and drug policy is on the ground in the DTES. Karen reminds residents to: “Wash your hands and stop touching your beautiful face. Go home if you have one.”

Sex workers in Vancouver have experienced significant hardship in the context of the pandemic. We liaise directly with partners such as the Transitions Consortium and WISH Drop-In Centre to increase access to critical information, funding, and resources, including cell phone donations from TELUS. Our staff are also working with partners to align additional food program initiatives for sex workers and scope out an emergency relief fund for workers in Vancouver.

We provided $200,000 towards upscaling peer work and connecting non-profit organizations in new ways under the leadership of the Community Impact Real Estate Enhanced (CIRES) Community Stewardship Program. In the first week of operation, the CIRES program funded ten Sex Worker Peer positions, as well as an additional 62 peers who spend more than 1,100 hours per week on outreach and meeting the basic needs of people who identify as women, people experiencing homelessness, urban Indigenous residents, and undocumented immigrants who are highly impacted by COVID-19. 

Ingrid Mendez de Cruz, Executive Director of Watari which has received funding from CIRES, said: “These funds are much appreciated by the community. It’s provided the ability for peer workers provide translated information and support to individuals who are undocumented and experiencing other challenges such as loss of income.” ",City of Vancouver,,City introduces new proactive measures in the Downtown Eastside,https://vancouver.ca/news-calendar/city-introduces-new-proactive-measures-in-the-downtown-eastside.aspx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two more of the new cases were identified in the Fraser Health region through surveillance screening of people being tested for seasonal influenza. They are a man and woman, both in their 60s, who are in isolation at home as their recent contacts are investigated.

be Vancouver Island’s front line hospitals in the battle
against COVID-19, with other hospitals being used in a

“Island Health’s pandemic plan is to cohort COVID-19
patients requiring a higher level of care to Nanaimo Regional
General Hospital and Royal Jubilee Hospital as primary
COVID hospitals, with local sites used to support,” reads a
prepared statement from Island Health.
/
“There are also plans in place to move additional patients
currently in hospital to alternative sites, if required, based on
the level of need in our acute care system. These plans
include using the recently completed Summit long-term care
facility in Victoria, if needed, for patients currently in
hospital.”
Island hospitals have been preparing for a surge in COVID19 cases in much the same fashion as hospitals across the
province — opening as many beds as possible, and having
contingency plans in place for the most serious cases.
Health Minister Adrian Dix said today (April 6) B.C.’s hospital
occupancy rate is at 58 per cent for regular beds and 53 per
cent for critical care beds. As of April 5, Island Health
reported the average occupancy at hospitals throughout the
Island is “around 70 per cent.”
As of today, there have been 79 confirmed cases of COVID19 within the Island Health region. As of 9 a.m., 11 of those
cases were hospitalized, including three in critical care. The
Island’s first two deaths were reported Thursday.

There are 178 ventilators available on Vancouver Island,
including 86 critical care ventilators, 22 transport ventilators,
and 70 anesthetic machines.
“It’s important to remember that ventilators and patients can
be moved to where they need to be,” Island Health said in its
statement, adding that both the provincial ministry and
Island Health are actively working to acquire additional
ventilators.
/
While Island Health does not confirm specific locations of
confirmed cases, as is consistent with the direction and
approach of the Provincial Health Officer, local hospitals will
be admitting COVID-19 patients.
Sources have told Black Press Media that the North Island
Hospital Comox Valley campus has elevated its protocol to
“Stage 2,” meaning there are hospitalized COVID-19 patients
at that location.
Dr. Adam Thompson, the COVID-19 physician lead for the
Comox Valley Division of Family Practice, said his group has
every confidence in the preparation that has been ongoing.
“The level of planning at the hospital to prepare for COVID19 has been professional, expert and comprehensive,” he
said. “We are very grateful to all the physicians, ER doctors,
specialists and family doctors who have spent many hours
working alongside our nursing, allied health and
administrative staff to deliver a hospital ready to cope with
the changes now and ahead.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The City is making it easier for people to maintain physical distance in Beacon Hill Park and along Dallas Road by restricting vehicle access and realigning parking.

Starting Friday, April 10, primary roads within Beacon Hill Park will only be accessible to service and first responder vehicles on weekends.

Parking along Douglas Street and on Nursery Road will remain open with an increased number of accessible stalls.

Along Dallas Road, parking near the multi-use pathway construction between Dock Street and Lewis Street will be suspended over the holiday weekend (April 10 - 13) as changes to allow parallel parking are completed. These interventions will free up space inside Beacon Hill Park and in constricted areas along Dallas Road so local residents can stay active, while also maintaining physical distance. 



Practise Physical Distancing in Public Spaces
In addition to vehicle access and parking restrictions, City staff will be out in public spaces to engage with residents about playground and recreation facility closures and to encourage physical distancing.

“I look forward to seeing our parks bustling with playdates and picnics again one day, but right now we are following Dr. Bonnie Henry’s advice to limit the spread of COVID-19,” said Mayor Lisa Helps.  “Now is the time for people to remain in their home municipalities and to use the parks and trail systems nearby. So if you do go out for exercise and fresh air, a walk close to home is your best option.”

CRD and City parks are staying open at this time as the risk of transmission outdoors is much less than the risk indoors. As directed by B.C. Public Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, if you are going for a walk, don’t congregate or gather in groups.

2020-03-13,Canada,Manitoba,All,2.0,1.0,,Government Website,"Public health officials advise a fourth person has tested positive for COVID-19 in Manitoba.

        

        Case four, a man in his 40s, lives in Winnipeg. At this time, it 
appears the individual was exposed to the virus through recent travel to
 South Korea, the Philippines and Japan. Public health investigations 
are ongoing.

        

        In total, there has been one confirmed COVID-19 case in Manitoba and three presumptive positive cases.

        

        In keeping with social distancing strategies outlined to Manitobans and
 in consultation with key stakeholders, public health officials have 
advised suspending classes in Manitoba K-12 schools effective March 23 
to April 10. This is being done to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in
 Manitoba.

        

        Public health officials are also advising schools and educational institutions to:

        •    ensure ill staff and students stay home from school, and support 
those who are self-isolating at home to ensure they do not fall behind 
in their studies;

        •    reduce activities in large groups or crowds;

        •    increase desk distance between students; and

        •    consider implementing virtual or online classrooms, to reduce the 
number of people in classrooms and increase distance between staff and 
students.

        

        Public health officials continue to recommend social distancing measures for all Manitobans, including:

        •    cancelling or postponing any large-scale events with more than 250 attendees;

        •    minimizing prolonged (more than 10 minutes), close (less than two metres) contact between individuals in public;

        •    avoiding greetings that involve touching such as handshakes;

        •    disinfecting frequently used surfaces;

        •    following public health advice related to self-monitoring and 
self-isolation if you have travelled or have been exposed to someone ill
 with the virus; and

        •    avoiding all non-essential travel, as well as crowded places and events.

        

        Employers should review their business continuity plans and take steps 
to ensure employees can stay home when ill, without facing barriers such
 as the requirement for sick notes, and work from home if possible. 
Employers should also discontinue non-essential, work-related travel 
outside of Manitoba and encourage virtual meetings to reduce prolonged, 
close contact between individuals.

        

        Being prepared also means using official sources for the most 
up-to-date and accurate information. The Manitoba government is also 
urging media to exercise caution in reporting information related to the
 evolving COVID-19 situation and to avoid hearsay or speculation, as 
this can spread misinformation.

2020-03-17,Canada,Manitoba,All,2.0,1.0,,,,,,,,2.0,1.0,,Government Website,"The Manitoba government is taking additional proactive measures to help reduce the impact of COVID-19.  This includes:

        •    suspending services at licensed child-care centres, effective end-of-day Friday, March 20;

        •    recommending parents with children in these centres begin to make 
alternate arrangements as soon as possible, even though centres will 
remain open for the remainder of the week;

        •    continuing to allow home-based child-care providers to operate; and

        •    creating dedicated child-care options for front-line and essential services staff who need them.

        

        Parents who will be providing front-line health care or are a member of
 a fire, police or paramedic service and will not be able to find 
alternative child care while services are suspended are asked to contact
 204-945-0776 or 1-888-213-4754 (toll-free).

        

        Parents are asked to keep all children and youth home if they have a 
fever or other respiratory illness symptoms.  Schools will be notifying 
parents that students will be sent home if they have any of these 
symptoms.

        

        The province is also advising that:

        •    teachers will continue to be on the job, either in schools or at 
home, to create learning plans and continue teaching using the distance 
learning options available; and

        •    all casinos will close effective midnight tonight.

        

        Public health officials are recommending the immediate suspension of 
visitors in long-term care facilities across Manitoba.  Exceptions for 
compassionate reasons or end of life will be made on a case-by-case 
basis at the discretion of individual facility managers.

        

        In addition, public health officials are recommending the cancellation 
of gatherings of more than 50 people, consistent with the announcement 
made by the federal government.

        

        Public health officials are strongly advising all Manitobans, including
 health-care providers, to cancel or postpone any non-essential 
international travel.  In addition, public health officials are 
recommending all international travellers should self-isolate and 
self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days after returning to Canada.

        

        Health officials are reminding physicians, health-care providers and 
support staff returning from international travel that they MUST 
self-identify to their organization/site’s occupational health services.

        

        To support social distancing efforts, Manitoba Health, Seniors and 
Active Living’s registration and client services office at 300 Carlton 
St. will be temporarily closed to the public.  Staff will continue to 
register people for Manitoba health coverage and Manitoba Pharmacare 
benefits through email, phone, fax and mail.  Forms and contact 
information can be found at www.gov.mb.ca/health/mhsip/forms.html.

        

        Yesterday, Manitoba’s Provincial Court, Court of Queen’s Bench and 
Court of Appeals all introduced new provisions to restrict or reschedule
 matters over the next several weeks.  For more information, visit www.manitobacourts.mb.ca/news/covid-19-update-march-16-2020/.

        

        A new self-assessment tool is now online to help Manitobans determine 
whether they need to call Health Links–Info Santé to possibly get a 
referral or to self-isolate.  The tool provides interactive advice to 
users concerned about whether they have contracted COVID-19.  It is 
expected the tool will help with call volumes.  For more information, 
visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

        

        Additionally, people calling Health Links–Info Santé can soon expect to
 hear a new interactive voice response system (IVR).  The IVR will allow
 COVID-19 screening questions to be answered prior to users being 
connected to operators, which should shorten the length of calls.  This 
technology is anticipated to be up and running as soon as this 
afternoon.

        

        Any person concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19
 should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 
1-888-315-9257 before arriving at a testing site.  Nearly 1,700 patients
 have visited dedicated testing sites in Winnipeg and Thompson in the 
past five days including 481 yesterday.

        

        New dedicated testing sites for COVID-19 opened today at the following locations:

        •    suspending services at licensed child-care centres, effective end-of-day Friday, March 20;

        •    recommending parents with children in these centres begin to make 
alternate arrangements as soon as possible, even though centres will 
remain open for the remainder of the week;

        •    continuing to allow home-based child-care providers to operate; and

        •    creating dedicated child-care options for front-line and essential services staff who need them.

        

        Parents who will be providing front-line health care or are a member of
 a fire, police or paramedic service and will not be able to find 
alternative child care while services are suspended are asked to contact
 204-945-0776 or 1-888-213-4754 (toll-free).

        

        Parents are asked to keep all children and youth home if they have a 
fever or other respiratory illness symptoms.  Schools will be notifying 
parents that students will be sent home if they have any of these 
symptoms.

        

        The province is also advising that:

        •    teachers will continue to be on the job, either in schools or at 
home, to create learning plans and continue teaching using the distance 
learning options available; and

        •    all casinos will close effective midnight tonight.

        

        Public health officials are recommending the immediate suspension of 
visitors in long-term care facilities across Manitoba.  Exceptions for 
compassionate reasons or end of life will be made on a case-by-case 
basis at the discretion of individual facility managers.

        

        In addition, public health officials are recommending the cancellation 
of gatherings of more than 50 people, consistent with the announcement 
made by the federal government.

        

        Public health officials are strongly advising all Manitobans, including
 health-care providers, to cancel or postpone any non-essential 
international travel.  In addition, public health officials are 
recommending all international travellers should self-isolate and 
self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days after returning to Canada.

        

        Health officials are reminding physicians, health-care providers and 
support staff returning from international travel that they MUST 
self-identify to their organization/site’s occupational health services.

        

        To support social distancing efforts, Manitoba Health, Seniors and 
Active Living’s registration and client services office at 300 Carlton 
St. will be temporarily closed to the public.  Staff will continue to 
register people for Manitoba health coverage and Manitoba Pharmacare 
benefits through email, phone, fax and mail.  Forms and contact 
information can be found at www.gov.mb.ca/health/mhsip/forms.html.

        

        Yesterday, Manitoba’s Provincial Court, Court of Queen’s Bench and 
Court of Appeals all introduced new provisions to restrict or reschedule
 matters over the next several weeks.  For more information, visit www.manitobacourts.mb.ca/news/covid-19-update-march-16-2020/.

        

        A new self-assessment tool is now online to help Manitobans determine 
whether they need to call Health Links–Info Santé to possibly get a 
referral or to self-isolate.  The tool provides interactive advice to 
users concerned about whether they have contracted COVID-19.  It is 
expected the tool will help with call volumes.  For more information, 
visit www.manitoba.ca/covid19.

        

        Additionally, people calling Health Links–Info Santé can soon expect to
 hear a new interactive voice response system (IVR).  The IVR will allow
 COVID-19 screening questions to be answered prior to users being 
connected to operators, which should shorten the length of calls.  This 
technology is anticipated to be up and running as soon as this 
afternoon.

        

        Any person concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19
 should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or toll-free at 
1-888-315-9257 before arriving at a testing site.  Nearly 1,700 patients
 have visited dedicated testing sites in Winnipeg and Thompson in the 
past five days including 481 yesterday.

        

        New dedicated testing sites for COVID-19 opened today at the following locations:

        •    Channing Auditorium in the Flin Flon Community Hall, 2 North Ave., Flin Flon; and

        •    Guy Hall, 28 First St. West, The Pas.

under The Emergency Measures Act to protect the health and safety of all
 Manitobans and reduce the spread of COVID-19, Premier Brian Pallister 
announced today.

        

        “This decision was not made lightly.  However, we must continue to use 
every tool available to ‘flatten the curve’ and reduce the spread of 
COVID-19 on our communities and our health-care system,” said 
Pallister.  “Our government is focused solely on the health and safety 
of all Manitobans.  This move will enable us to react more quickly on a 
broad range of supportive measures to stop the spread for COVID-19 and 
ensure that essential services are available for all Manitobans during 
this global health pandemic.”

        

        A state of emergency has been declared by the powers set out in Section
 10(1) and 10(2) of The Emergency Measures Act to enable the province to
 respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.  In addition, the chief provincial 
public health officer is issuing orders under The Public Health Act as 
approved by the minister of health, seniors and active living.

        

        “With this declaration, the biggest roles for all Manitobans to play 
right now, is to protect yourself, your family, your friends and your 
community,"" said Dr. Brent Roussin, chief provincial public health 
officer.  “I cannot emphasize this enough – this is the time for 
action.  We must change our day-to-day lives, and think about your role 
in protecting ourselves and all Manitobans.”

        

        As authorized under The Public Health Act, the following measures will 
be in place, effective immediately, for a period of 30 days:

        1.    Limiting public gatherings of more than 50 people at any indoor 
or outdoor place or premises.  This includes places of worship, 
gatherings and family events such as weddings and funerals.  This does 
not apply to a facility where health care or social services are 
provided.  Retail businesses including grocery or food stores, shopping 
centres, pharmacies or gas stations must ensure separation of one to two
 metres between patrons assembling in the business.  Public 
transportation facilities must also ensure that people assembling at the
 facility are reasonably able to maintain a separation of one to two 
metres from others assembling at the facility.

        2.    Limiting hospitality premises where food or alcohol is served or 
any theatres offering live performances of music, dance and other art 
forms as movies theatres to 50 people or 50 per cent of the capacity of 
the premises, whichever is lesser.  These establishments must be able to
 ensure social distance of one to two metres between customers.

        3.    Immediate closures of all bingo and gaming events.

        4.    Immediate closure of all wellness centres offering physical 
activities, gyms, fitness centres and athletic clubs and training 
facilities

        

        “This is a time to support our friends, families and communities,” said
 Pallister.  “The situation is constantly evolving and changing 
rapidly.  Enacting a state of emergency will further our province’s 
ability to be nimble, act swiftly and support Manitobans when they need 
it most.”","Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living",,"MANITOBA GOVERNMENT DECLARES STATE OF EMERGENCY TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC, REDUCE SPREAD OF COVID-19",https://news.gov.mb.ca/news/?archive=&item=47137,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 health-care providers, to cancel or postpone any non-essential travel. 
 This includes international travel and travel within Canada.  There 
should be no recreational, tourist or non-essential personal travel.  In
 addition, public health officials recommended that effective March 23, 
anyone who returns from international or domestic travel should 
self-isolate and self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days following their 
return.

        

        This recommendation does not include:

        •    the commercial transportation of goods and services;

        •    workers who live in a neighbouring jurisdiction and travel to Manitoba for work;

        •    health care workers who travel to work from outside the province;

        •    normal personal travel in border communities, including visits to a cottage.

 should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or (toll-free) at 
1-888-315-9257 to be screened to see if a test is required.

walk-in clinics.  Information on locations and hours of operation are 
available at www.gov.mb.ca/covid19/locations.html.

        

        Moving forward, the province will continue to share updates on the 
total number of cases but additional patient information such as gender,
 age, and the regional health authority where they reside will be 
provided online once it is confirmed through public health 
investigation.  The province is also working to provide an additional 
breakdown of information online including the number of 
hospitalizations, home recovery and cases that are resolved.  This 
reporting is in line with reporting in other jurisdictions and ensures 
consistent, accurate data is available to the public.

the spread of COVID-19 and protect the health and safety of all 
Manitobans, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.

        

        “These decisions are not easy ones, but they must be made during this 
global pandemic to protect the health and safety of all Manitobans,” 
said Pallister.  “These new orders will ensure critical services are 
available while taking steps to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in our 
communities.”

        

        The chief provincial public health officer is issuing orders under The 
Public Health Act as approved by the minister of health, seniors and 
active living.  The following measures will be in place as of 12:01 a.m.
 on Wednesday, April 1:

        •    Public gatherings are limited to no more than 10 people at any 
indoor or outdoor place or premises.  This includes places of worship, 
gatherings and family events such as weddings and funerals.  This does 
not apply to a facility where health care or social services are 
provided including child-care centres and homeless shelters.  This 
remains in effect at this time under the previous health order issued on
 March 27, and will continue when this order comes into effect on April 
1.

        •    All restaurants and other commercial facilities that serve food 
are prohibited from serving food to customers in their premises.  This 
prevents eat-in dining at all facilities.  However, restaurants and 
other commercial facilities can prepare and serve food for delivery or 
takeout.  If this takes place, the operator of the restaurant must 
ensure that all people maintain the appropriate social distancing from 
other customers when picking up food.

        •    All businesses that are not listed in the schedule of critical 
services that accompanies the order must close between April 1 and April
 14.

            - This closure order does not prevent these businesses from operating on a remote basis.

            - A business may accept orders on the Internet, or over the phone 
for delivery or pickup, as long as the employees are not working at the 
place of business.

            - The order does not prevent employees or others from coming into 
the business to perform repairs, to provide security services or to take
 out items from the business premises if the business is going to 
operate on a remote basis.

            - Nothing in the order restricts the operations of delivery of 
services by the federal or provincial governments or a municipality.

            - Nothing in the order restricts any activities of a publicly 
funded agency, organization or authority that delivers or supports 
government operations or services including health-care services.  This 
means the order does not affect institutions, agencies and other service
 providers who provide health-care services such as hospitals, regional 
health authorities and private agencies who provide a range of health 
services.

        •    All businesses listed in the schedule of critical services that 
accompanies the order may continue to operate.  If these business allow 
members of the public to attend the place of business, the operator of 
the business must put in place measures to ensure that appropriate 
social distancing rules are followed.

        •    The order does not affect how members of the College of Physicians
 and Surgeons of Manitoba, the College of Registered Nurses of Manitoba,
 the College of Licensed Practical Nurses of Manitoba or the College of 
Midwives of Manitoba provide health-care services under the order.  Any 
other health professionals may continue to practice if they are 
providing services for a publicly funded agency, such as a government or
 a regional health authority, or a business listed under the schedule.  
In addition, health-care providers can continue to provide emergent or 
urgent care such as dental surgery.  

        •    Municipal transit services, taxis and other private vehicles for 
hire can continue to operate.  The operator of the vehicle must take 
measures to ensure there is a reasonable separation of people in a 
vehicle.  This order does not contain specific distance restrictions 
because it is hard to impose a limit in small vehicles.  The goal is to 
ensure a reasonable level of spacing between people.

        

        The order also repeals previous orders as of 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, 
April 1 so there is only one public health order in effect at a time.

        

        “We are seeing what is happening in other jurisdictions, and the time 
to act is now.  We must continue to adapt to the situation and change 
our day-to-day lives to prevent unnecessary illness and further 
tragedies in Manitoba,” said Dr. Brent Roussin, chief provincial public 
health officer.  “These measures will help us reduce the risk and 
protect all Manitobans during the ongoing pandemic.”

        

        The premier noted that a state of emergency declared by the powers set 
out in Section 10(1) and 10(2) of The Emergency Measures Act to enable 
the province to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic remains in effect.

        

        “Manitobans have always pulled together in a time of crisis and this is
 no different,” said Pallister.  “We must continue to do whatever we can
 to support each other.”

        

        The list of public health orders and the schedule of critical services can be found online at www.manitoba.ca/covid19/soe.html.  Businesses with questions about how the order and schedule of critical services apply to their operations can visit http://engagemb.ca/covid19-csp for up-to-date information, and to ask questions that will be answered by government officials.

2020-03-31,Canada,Manitoba,All,2.0,1.0,,Government Website,"At the advice of the chief provincial public health officer, Manitoba 
is suspending classroom learning for kindergarten to Grade 12 students 
indefinitely for this school year to help ‘flatten the curve’ and reduce
 the impact of COVID-19 throughout the province, Premier Brian Pallister
 and Education Minister Kelvin Goertzen announced today.

        

        “We must do everything we can to flatten the COVID curve and protect 
the health and well-being of all Manitobans,” said Pallister.  “The 
decision to suspend classroom learning in school indefinitely for this 
school year is the easiest decision to make because it protects our 
children and their education – it is the right thing to do.” 

        

        The suspension of in-school classes follows the province’s announcement
 on March 13 that they would be suspended at all kindergarten to Grade 
12 schools through April 10.  This new step to extend the suspension is 
being taken with the interests of students, educators and all Manitobans
 in mind, the premier noted.

        

        No student will be held back due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but students
 must actively engage in learning.  All students on track to graduate 
will do so.  Teachers will teach remotely, assign work, conduct 
assessments and prepare final report cards.  For students in Grade 12, 
provincial exams will be cancelled, but teacher assessments will be 
implemented.  For students in early and middle years, provincial 
assessments are complete for the current school year, but other 
assessments will continue.

        

        “The efforts and success Manitoba teachers and educators have displayed
 during this public health pandemic have been inspiring,” said 
Goertzen.  “I join all Manitobans in asking educators to continue doing 
all they can to use remote and innovative methods to teach students 
through the remainder of this school year.  Our government is asking for
 an all-hands-on-deck approach, with their assistance and with that of 
parents, caregivers, principals, trustees and superintendents for the 
benefit of all students.”

        

        Child-care centres located in schools will continue to operate under 
the current conditions set out by the chief provincial public health 
officer.  The overall plan is oriented toward the future and we will 
learn how to modernize education through our response to this situation,
 Goertzen said.  The combined efforts are geared toward the reopening of
 classrooms, as well as toward multifaceted ways to teach and to learn 
after COVID-19, he added.

        

        The province continues to rely on the recommendations of the chief 
provincial public health officer and encourages all Manitobans to engage
 in good social distancing protocols, including practising the 3Ps – 
protect yourself, protect your loved ones and protect your community.

The data also shows:
•    11 individuals are currently hospitalized including seven in intensive care,
•    17 individuals have recovered from COVID-19, and
•    the total number of deaths reported in Manitoba is two.

Cadham Provincial Laboratory performed 488 tests Saturday.  As of April 5, a total of 12,998 tests have been performed.

Isolation centres will be established to meet the need of Manitobans who may require some additional support as they self-isolate.  This support will be offered as part of the public health investigation process to individuals who are COVID-19 positive or who have been exposed to a COVID-19 positive case and require a dedicated space where they can self-isolate.  The first centre has been set up in a Winnipeg hotel and began accepting individuals this weekend.

These centres will adhere to the public health guidelines and guests will be required to self-isolate in their rooms at all times.  Isolation centres will use enhanced cleaning and disinfecting practices.  All social and physical distancing practices will be adhered to and centres will practice zero contact services wherever possible.

Public health is also advising people to remain within or close to their home communities.  This includes limiting travel, even within Manitoba, to essential trips only.  Services at smaller health centres could be strained if seasonal visitors become ill.

Any person concerned about their exposure to or risk of having COVID-19 should call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or (toll-free) at 1-888-315-9257 to be screened to see if a test is required.

2020-04-09,Canada,Manitoba,All,2.0,1.0,,,,,,,,2.0,1.0,,Government Website,"The Manitoba government and the City of Winnipeg are working in collaboration for an ‘Operation Safe Apart’ pandemic public health enforcement strategy, including new pre-set fines for individuals or business owners who disregard public health orders, to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, Premier Brian Pallister and Winnipeg Mayor Brian Bowman announced today.

“Everyone has a role to play in reducing the spread of COVID-19, and the majority of Manitobans are adhering to good social distancing practices and changing how they operate at home, in their community and within their business,” said Pallister.  “Unfortunately, there is still a need to have additional measures in place to address situations where people are ignoring the advice of our health experts.  These changes will give enforcement officers more tools to help curb the spread of the virus.”

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the province declared a state of emergency on
March 20, which included orders under The Public Health Act to help reduce the spread of the virus including:
•    restrictions on public gatherings to 10 or fewer people,
•    require the closure of non-essential businesses, and
•    enforcement of social distancing measures by businesses and services that remain open including ensuring a two-metre distance is kept between people in the facility or premises.

Effective immediately, fine amounts for breaching these emergency orders will be set at $486 for individuals and $2,542 for businesses.

Manitoba will be implementing a multi-tiered enforcement approach to enforcing orders, which will include public education, written warning or ultimately, enforcement actions such as ticketing or arrest if necessary, the premier said.

In Winnipeg, the province is working in close collaboration with the City of Winnipeg, which will utilize Community Service Ambassadors to participate in public education and awareness, with bylaw officer and support from the Winnipeg Police Service (WPS) where required.

“I want to thank all those who are doing their part by staying home, practising physical distancing and respecting the measures put in place by the Manitoba government,” said Bowman.  “While most in our community are doing their part, there are some who are not getting the message.  I hope education and awareness will be sufficient and enforcement won’t be required but in the event it is, these measures will help protect the safety of Winnipeggers.”

To support these efforts, Manitoba Justice is partnering with City of Winnipeg to create enforcement units, with WPS acting in an assistance role, in ‘Operation Safe Apart’.  These units will be dedicated to enforcing orders along with providing awareness and prevention, responding to complaints and supporting bylaw enforcement officers.

In Winnipeg, reports of non-compliance can be made by calling: 311 or by email at 311@winnipeg.ca, or Twitter: @cityofwinnipeg.

Measures involving public health officers working in conjunction with local police services, First Nation police services and the RCMP are also in place for municipalities outside of Winnipeg.  Plans are underway to expand these and adopt measures similar to those announced today for Winnipeg.  These include engaging municipal bylaw officers, community and First Nation safety officers, community volunteer groups such as Citizens on Patrol, and Manitoba Conservation officers who will work with respective police services.

Outside of Winnipeg, reports of non-compliance can be made to the Manitoba Government Inquiry (MGI) inquiry line at 204-945-3744, (toll-free) at 1-866-626-4862 or by email at mgi@gov.mb.ca.

“We must to everything we can to protect our most valuable service – our health-care system –and our most vulnerable citizens,” said Pallister.  “These orders will help save lives and changing how we ensure compliance will help us flatten the COVID curve.”

The chief provincial public health officer will be extending the public health orders issued on March 30 for two weeks. The orders that were to expire on April 14 are now extended to April 28, 2020, with the following measures remaining in effect:
•    Public gatherings are limited to no more than 10 people at any indoor or outdoor place or premises. This includes places of worship, gatherings and family events such as weddings and funerals. This does not apply to a facility where health-care or social services are provided including child-care centres and homeless shelters.
•    All restaurants and other commercial facilities that serve food are prohibited from serving food to customers in their premises. This prevents eat-in dining at all facilities. However, restaurants and other commercial facilities can prepare and serve food for delivery or takeout. If this takes place, the operator of the restaurant must ensure that all people maintain the appropriate social distancing from other customers when picking up food.
•    All businesses that are not listed in the schedule of critical services that accompanies the order must remain closed.
-    This closure order does not prevent these businesses from operating on a remote basis.
-    A business may accept orders on the Internet, or over the phone for delivery or pickup, as long as the employees are not working at the place of business.
-    The order does not prevent employees or others from coming into the business to perform repairs, to provide security services or to take out items from the business premises if the business is going to operate on a remote basis.
-    Nothing in the order restricts the operations of delivery of services by the federal or provincial governments or a municipality.
-    Nothing in the order restricts any activities of a publicly funded agency, organization or authority that delivers or supports government operations or services, including health-care services. This means the order does not affect institutions, agencies and other service providers who provide health-care services such as hospitals, regional health authorities and private agencies who provide a range of health services.

Manitobans should not interpret current case numbers to mean the risk of COVID-19 is reduced. The current statistics may be a reflection of the effect strict social distancing measures have had and reaffirms that these measures must be continued. Manitobans are reminded this is not the time to let their guard down.

In addition, travel to northern Manitoba (north of the 53rd parallel of latitude) is prohibited with some exceptions including:
•    residents of northern and remote communities may continue to move within the north;
•    delivery of goods and services may continue; and
•    exceptions include those who travel to the north for employment, medical treatment or to facilitate child-custody agreements.

The new orders build on the current orders, and maintain the gathering size of no more than 10 people at any indoor or outdoor premises. Additional updates include:
•    a clarification that businesses not listed as critical may operate, and have customers attend to pick up ordered items, providing social distancing measures are in place;
•    a provision to allow farmers markets to operate, providing social distancing measures are in place;
•    hotels may operate, but must close common areas such as pools, hot tubs and game rooms;

In addition, public health officials are expanding testing criteria to include:
•    all symptomatic workers or volunteers at workplaces that have been identified as essential services; and
•    any symptomatic person who lives with a health-care worker, first responder or worker in a congregate setting such as a correctional facility, shelter, long-term care or residential facility.

Current testing parameters include people with symptoms who have travelled outside Manitoba in the past 14 days, close contacts of a confirmed case, health-care workers, all patients admitted to hospital with respiratory symptoms, lab workers who have worked with COVID-19 tests, first responders and individuals who live/work in the north, a remote or isolated community, or congregate setting.

 PROVINCE INCREASES COVID-19 TESTING CRITERIA AND CAPACITY
       A Crucial Step in the Process to Restart the Economy: Pallister
 

 Watch news conference
 

 

 

 

 

  The province is expanding COVID-19 testing criteria while also ramping up its testing capacity, a crucial step before beginning to loosen public health measures and safely restarting Manitoba’s economy, Premier Brian Pallister announced today.
 

  “Through good planning, Manitoba has been able to get ahead of COVID-19 and flatten the curve,” said Pallister. “We want to stay ahead of this virus and not chase it. With increased levels of tracking, testing and isolation, we will have a better understanding of how we are doing as a province in flattening the COVID curve. This is crucial as we carefully and slowly work toward expanding services safely in the coming weeks and months.”
 

  Effective immediately, the province is expanding testing criteria to any Manitoban with symptoms of COVID-19, even mild symptoms including a cough, runny nose, sore throat and/or fever, to be tested to better determine the spread of the virus in Manitoba, the premier noted.
 

  In order to facilitate enhanced testing provincewide, Dynacare will begin significantly increasing COVID-19 testing alongside Manitoba’s primary public health lab, Cadham Provincial Lab (CPL).
 

  Dynacare has been performing COVID-19 tests since early April out of its Ontario-based laboratory to supplement the capacity of CPL and, as of April 27, has completed 557 tests. The Manitoba government and Dynacare have entered into a partnership that will see up to 2,000 tests a day before the end of summer.
 

  With CPL’s capacity at over 1,000 tests daily, the province expects to have testing capacity of well over 3,000 tests a day, tripling the provinces current testing capacity, the premier noted. In addition, Dynacare will work toward establishing a second COVID testing lab in Winnipeg, assisting the province with faster processing times.
 

  Shared Health’s diagnostic services is also supporting the province’s enhanced testing capacity, performing some COVID-19 testing for patients at HSC Winnipeg prior to surgery and producing quantities of the viral medium needed to transport testing swabs to laboratories. 
 

  In addition to testing, Dynacare call centre staff have been communicating negative test results to Manitobans and delivering COVID-19 test specimens from screening and assessment centres to CPL. They have also established specimen collection centres for patients with compromised immune systems.
   
  Manitobans are reminded that if they are showing symptoms of COVID-19 and meet testing criteria, they can call Health Links–Info Santé at 204-788-8200 or (toll-free) at 1-888-315-9257 for more information.

Released: 11:33 a.m.

Winnipeg, MB – Statement from Mayor Bowman in response to the first presumptive positive case of COVID-19 in Winnipeg:

“Today, Manitoba Health has confirmed the first presumptive positive case of COVID-19 in Winnipeg. Manitoba Health is now recommending that social distancing strategies be implemented to limit the spread of COVID-19. Public health officials are also reminding all Manitobans to frequently wash their hands, cough and sneeze into their sleeves and to stay home when sick.

While reducing the risk of infection is a focus, it is important to note that the Public Health Agency of Canada says the risk of Canadians contracting the virus remains low.

Community health and well-being is our top priority. While the news of Winnipeg’s first presumptive positive case of COVID-19 may be unsettling, citizens should rest assured that all necessary steps are being taken to protect the health and safety of our citizens. The Office of Emergency Management is the lead for the City of Winnipeg and is collaborating with its counterparts from the Province of Manitoba and actively monitoring the situation. ”

Manitoba Health advises that symptoms of COVID-19 range from mild (fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat) to severe (shortness of breath and breathing difficulties). Elderly people and those living with chronic health conditions appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill.

Manitoba Health advises the following are precautions you can take:

Practice good handwashing hygiene and wash your hands for at least 20 seconds and dry them thoroughly – if you are unable to wash your hands, use an alcohol-based hand cleanser
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, or cough or sneeze into your sleeve – throw used tissues in the garbage and immediately wash your hands, or use an alcohol-based hand cleanser
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth
Avoid close contact (within 2 meters) with anyone showing symptoms of a respiratory illness, such as coughing or sneezing
Avoid sharing cups, glasses, dishes or cutlery, and ensure cups/glasses/dishes/cutlery are thoroughly cleaned using soap and warm water after each use, or placed in the dishwasher for cleaning
Regularly clean workstations and objects with disinfectants that are touched frequently, such as doorknobs, handles and railings

Winnipeg, MB – The City of Winnipeg remains committed to maintaining essential services for our residents, while balancing the health, safety, and well-being of our employees and residents. In response to this week’s confirmed arrival of COVID-19 in Winnipeg, the City has instituted a number of changes to programs and services.

Recreation & Leisure
Residents are advised that all City-owned and operated recreation centres, pools, and libraries will be closed to the public effective Monday, March 16, 2020, until further notice. More information is available online, including listings of City-owned and operated recreation centres, pools, and libraries.

We will also be using our service to communicate public health messages and are in the process of installing interior ads advising members of the public of proper handwashing procedures.

Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service responds to house fire on Manitoba Avenue
Released: 11:54 a.m.

Winnipeg, MB – At 7:53 p.m. on March 13, 2020, the Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service (WFPS) responded to reports of a fire in a one-and-a-half-storey home in the 200 block of Manitoba Avenue. Once on scene, crews found heavy smoke coming from the structure and launched an interior offensive attack. The fire was declared under control at 8:30 p.m. The home suffered considerable smoke, fire and water damage.

All occupants of the house self-evacuated prior to the arrival of crews after being alerted to the fire by a working smoke alarm. Paramedics assessed and transported eight individuals to hospital – three in unstable condition and five in stable condition.

Preliminary observations by WFPS Fire Investigators suggest the fire was accidental, caused by curtains coming into contact with a light bulb. All residents are reminded to always keep combustibles away from heat sources.

Winnipeggers are also reminded that smoke alarms save lives. Homeowners whose homes do not have a working smoke alarms can apply to the S.A.F.E. Family program to receive an alarm, free of charge, installed by members of the WFPS. For more information, or to apply to have a free alarm installed, contact 311 or visit Winnipeg.ca/safefamily.

Fire Prevention By-Law 35-2017 requires the installation of a by-law compliant smoke alarm in all residential rental properties. Smoke alarms will not be installed in residential rental properties as part of the S.A.F.E. Family program.

City Hall – Council Building
Effective, Friday, April 3, 2020 the Council Building of City Hall will be temporarily closed to the public. The Susan A. Thompson Building will remain open to facilitate access to the 311 Front Counter.

A special meeting of City Council has been convened for tomorrow to deal with a number of urgent matters in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including a report from the Public Service on options for the deferral of property and business taxes, a motion to declare a State of Local Emergency for the City of Winnipeg, and a motion to hold meeting of Council through means other than face-to-face for the next 120 days.

At this time, City Council is required to meet face-to-face to conduct official business of Council. In discussions with our Emergency Operations Centre and Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living, the City has determined that a meeting of Council is allowed under the current public health order, as the order states that it does not apply to the operations of federal, provincial, or municipal governments. The City has put measures in place to minimize the size of the gathering, and to ensure physical distancing recommendations are being followed.

Residents will continue to be allowed to register as delegations to speak at the Council meeting; however, only those registered to speak will be allowed to enter City Hall. The public can view all meetings of City Council online through winnipeg.ca. For those who wish to register as a delegate, they can contact City Clerks via 311 or cityclerks@winnipeg.ca and must register by 4:30 p.m. today.

Everyone attending the meeting are reminded to not enter City Hall if they are experiencing flu-like symptoms or have travelled internationally or domestically within the last 14 days.",City of Winnipeg,,Winnipeg City Hall closed to the public,https://winnipeg.ca/cao/media/news/nr_2020/nr_20200402.stm#1,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,1.0,,Government Website,"Released: 10:53 a.m.

Winnipeg, MB – At a Special Meeting of Council today, efforts to ease the financial burden of COVID-19 on Winnipeg homeowners and businesses were approved by Council.

On March 20, Mayor Brian Bowman and Councillor Scott Gillingham introduced an amending motion to the 2020-2023 Multi-Year Balanced Budgets for Council’s consideration to look at ways the City could provide financial relief for property and business taxpayers. City Council voted 11-3 in favour of the Budgets which gave the public service the authority to develop the plan.

“This plan to provide financial relief for property and business taxpayers is unprecedented in our city’s history,” said Mayor Brian Bowman. “As Winnipeggers, we will get through the global COVID-19 pandemic by supporting each other. Providing immediate relief to Winnipeg homeowners and businesses who are not currently able to pay their taxes is one of the ways the City of Winnipeg can support our community.”

Cities across Canada have either implemented or are in the process of implementing similar tax deferrals for property owners and business owners. This includes Toronto, Ottawa, Saskatoon and Edmonton.

“I have heard from residents and business owners that have already been financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and they are concerned about their ability to pay their bills on time,” said Councillor Gillingham. “On March 15, I asked City staff to begin preparing a plan to offer property and business owners relief by giving them more time to pay their taxes. The City of Winnipeg needs to continue to be sensitive on how COVID-19 is impacting household incomes and Winnipeg’s economy.”

For those who need it, the City will waive penalties for unpaid property and business taxes for up to three months following their due date. Property taxes that are due on June 30, 2020 will have fees waived until October 1, 2020. Business taxes that are due on May 29, 2020 will have fees waived until September 1, 2020.

The City will also waive Tax Instalment Payment Plan (TIPP) program fees on both property and business taxes until October 1, 2020. This means no enrolment fee for the TIPP program and no penalty fee as a result of non-sufficient funds during that time. Residents will be allowed to remain enrolled in the program and make delayed TIPP payments without any late payment fees.

Taxes will still be owed and tax due dates have not changed. Those who are able to meet those due dates are encouraged to do so.

The City encourages Winnipeggers to consider the benefits of enrolling in the TIPP program. If residents are currently not enrolled, it allows residents to make regular monthly payments and avoid having to pay entire tax bills three months further down the road. Residents are encouraged to contact 311 to inquire about enrolment.

Winnipeg declares state of local emergency
Released: 2:02 p.m.

Winnipeg, MB – Today, Council voted unanimously to declare a state of local emergency for Winnipeg in response to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. Along with its existing powers, the City of Winnipeg will be able to use the authority under the state of local emergency to acquire additional resources to deal with the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic as required.

“We are navigating a truly unprecedented time in our city’s history,” said Mayor Brian Bowman. “The declaration of today’s state of local emergency will enable access to the tools needed to respond to challenges in a timely fashion.”

The City remains committed to maintaining essential services while balancing the health, safety, and well-being of our employees and residents. We are acting on the advice of experts and taking their instructions seriously.

The Emergency Operations Centre is actively engaged in the City’s response to COVID-19, including coordinating response efforts, and ensuring the appropriate policies and procedures are in place to support the continuity of essential services and the ongoing maintenance of the City’s critical infrastructure.

Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service responds to hotel fire on Wellington Avenue
Released: 7:48 p.m.

Winnipeg, MB – At 3:19 p.m. on Friday, April 3, 2020, the Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service (WFPS) responded to an automatic fire alarm at a hotel in the 1800 block of Wellington Avenue. While responding, further 911 reports were received indicating fire in one of the suites. A second alarm was called, increasing the number of apparatus and WFPS crew members on the scene, due to the potential for a high number of occupants in the building.

Upon arrival on scene, crews found smoke in the first floor hallway of the hotel. An offensive attack was launched and the fire was very quickly brought under control. The automatic fire sprinkler system had activated and kept the fire from extending beyond the room of origin. Crews then worked to ventilate smoke from the building.

All occupants self-evacuated from the building. One patient was assessed on scene by paramedics but did not require transport to hospital. No other injuries were reported.

Fire damage was contained to the suite where the fire originated. Other areas of the hotel suffered minor smoke and water damage. No damage estimates are available at this time.  

The cause of the fire is considered incendiary. The incident is being investigated by the Winnipeg Police Service.

Winnipeg, MB – The City of Winnipeg has developed its first analysis of the potential economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on Winnipeg. The analysis is publicly available through the Decision Making Information System (DMIS) and is being presented at the meeting of the Standing Policy Committee on Finance (SPC-Finance) on April 27, 2020.

“A Crisis Cash Flow Management Plan has been developed in an effort to navigate the City’s finances through the economic storm created by COVID-19,” said Councillor Scott Gillingham, Chairperson of the Standing Policy Committee on Finance. “The Plan is informed by economic information, analysis and projections and may need to be adjusted in the future as the financial impact of the pandemic is constantly evolving.”

Anticipating a range of plausible outcomes for the course of the pandemic, the City used basic economic markers to estimate three levels of impact to the economy and the resulting implications on unemployment and gross domestic product (GDP). The calculations in the analysis do not account for new government policies or employment supports. 

“The economic landscape is constantly changing during the pandemic and the data in the analysis may change in the coming weeks and months,” said Tyler Markowsky, City Economist. “In our analysis, we found that the financial impact of COVID-19 on Winnipeg is real and likely quite substantial. Once economic data is released from Statistics Canada and other official outlets, we can begin to assess the various impacts COVID-19 has had on Winnipeg’s economy in greater detail.”

With the recent passage of the 2020-23 multi-year balanced budget, the City’s financial future is better planned than most jurisdictions. Additionally, in the short term, the Financial Stabilization Reserve is giving the Public Service the financial capacity to deliver all primary City services while strategies are developed to manage reduced revenues, which are estimated at $12 million per month.

In the short term, recommendations for the role of municipal governments in economic recovery include sustaining employment, and working in partnership with federal and provincial governments to coordinate the gradual re-opening of closed sectors in the local economy. In the longer term, capital investment programs are an important part of economic recovery and all levels of government have a role to play with those investments.

“The Crisis Cash Flow Management Plan maintains the City’s recently adopted 2020 capital program which is set to invest $369 million in important capital projects,” said Councillor Gillingham. “This investment will assist to stimulate the struggling local economy and is estimated to provide over 2,300 jobs. To make significant cuts to the 2020 capital budget would further exacerbate the challenges our local economy is currently facing.”",City of Winnipeg,,City releases economic analysis and cash flow plan for the COVID-19 pandemic,https://winnipeg.ca/cao/media/news/nr_2020/nr_20200421.stm#1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Winnipeg, MB – The City of Winnipeg remains committed to maintaining essential services while balancing the health, safety, and well-being of our employees and residents; however, the City also needs to be a responsible trustee of public funds and ensure prudent spending of taxpayers’ money. Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, Winnipeg Transit has experienced a 72% reduction in ridership, over this same time in 2019. This has resulted in an estimated 74% reduction in revenue over the same timeframe which equals an average of approximately $6 million monthly.

To help offset these losses, Winnipeg Transit will be reducing Transit service across Winnipeg, in a phased in approach, over the next two weeks.

Effective immediately, Winnipeg Transit will no longer be offering overtime to bus operators, which means that daily service may be impacted. To date, Winnipeg Transit has been using overtime to ensure service was maintained as close to schedule as possible; however, with continual declining ridership numbers and a corresponding decline in revenue, this practice will no longer continue.

Effective Monday, May 4, 2020, Winnipeg Transit will be adjusting their weekday schedule to an “enhanced Saturday schedule.” The bus schedule for Saturdays and Sundays will not change.

The adjusted weekday schedule will include all bus routes that operate on Saturdays, plus a number of additional bus routes that do not normally run on weekends, such as express buses, and buses that serve industrial parks. In addition, Winnipeg Transit made certain that service around health care facilities was a factor during the service review, and we will continue to monitor service to hospitals for healthcare workers. Due to their location along major roadways, all hospitals are served by transit seven days a week, and in order to ensure better service for our healthcare workers, any hospital normally served by an express route on weekdays will have that additional service added to it over and above what would regularly be provided on a Saturday.

It is important to note that these additional buses will operate with less frequency than the regular weekday service. Transit passengers are encouraged to check the Winnipeg Transit website daily for schedule changes. A full-schedule of the adjusted weekday service will be displayed on the Winnipeg Transit website beginning Thursday, April 23.

This adjusted schedule requires 221 fewer buses than the regular weekday schedule.

While maintaining the regular weekday schedule to date has allowed passengers the ability to practice social distancing on buses, Winnipeg Transit expects the reduced schedule, combined with current ridership levels, will continue to allow for proper social distancing on the buses; however, this is something that will be monitored closely.

As a result of this service reduction, 229 permanent bus operators and 24 non-permanent bus operators will be temporarily laid off. Permanent bus operators will be laid off effective May 3, 2020, and non-permanent operators in training will be laid off as training programs finish on May 1 and May 22, 2020. Employees who are temporarily laid off will have access to mental health supports, and will continue to be included in communications from the City of Winnipeg. For those employees who are in receipt of regular Employment Insurance (EI) benefits, the City has registered a Supplementary Unemployment Benefit Plan (SUBP) with the Government of Canada. The SUBP will provide a top-up to 75% of their regular gross weekly salary, for a period of eight weeks for permanent staff and four weeks for non-permanent staff, while they are on temporary lay-off. 

Winnipeg Transit will continue to monitor ridership levels, and will resume regular bus service throughout the City once it makes sense to do so. Once regular service resumes, the City will welcome all Winnipeg Transit employees back to work.

At this time, passengers are reminded to only use Winnipeg Transit for essential trips and to continue practicing social and physical distancing on the bus and at bus stops. Passengers are also encouraged to ride in off-peak hours whenever possible, keep two metres of distance between themselves and other passengers, use the rear door when exiting if they are able, and avoid using Winnipeg Transit if they are experiencing flu-like symptoms.",City of Winnipeg,,Winnipeg Transit announces service reductions,https://winnipeg.ca/cao/media/news/nr_2020/nr_20200422.stm#2,2.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Winnipeg, MB – In an effort to assist with social distancing requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic, the City is further extending its annual bicycle and active transportation route schedule and expanding the temporary routes to include five new streets.

“As the global pandemic continues to have an effect on our residents, I’m pleased to see an expansion of active transportation routes that can better facilitate physical distancing,” said Mayor Brian Bowman. “With ever-evolving circumstances related to COVID-19, the City is once again demonstrating its willingness and ability to innovate.”

“It’s important that we provide Winnipeggers with safe spaces they can use to keep active while practicing social distancing,” said Councillor Matt Allard, Chairperson of the Standing Policy Committee on Infrastructure Renewal and Public Works. “I’m pleased that we were able to expand upon active transportation routes to give residents even more options to enjoy the outdoors as the weather begins to warm up this spring.”

The following four streets in Winnipeg are currently designated as bicycle/active transportation routes, and will be extended until Friday, May 29, 2020:

Lyndale Drive - Cromwell Street to Gauvin Street
Scotia Street - Anderson Avenue (at St. Cross Street) to Armstrong Avenue

Winnipeg, MB – In an effort to promote the health and safety of its employees, Winnipeg Transit is providing all of its operators and inspectors with reusable, washable protective masks to use while on shift.

Canadian public health officials recently began advising members of the public to wear non-medical masks as an additional measure to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, while emphasizing medical-grade masks should only be used by health care workers.

Transit operators and inspectors who work in public settings where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, will be provided masks from a Winnipeg-based apparel manufacturer for additional measure.

These masks are also being made available at cost to Winnipeg Transit Plus contractors.

Manitoba public health officials have emphasized that while non-medical masks can help keep your face covered and prevent the spread of respiratory droplets, frequent hand washing and social and physical distance are still the best preventative measures. Anyone who chooses to wear a non-medical mask must wash their hands immediately before and after putting it on and taking it off, practice good hand hygiene while it’s on, ensure the mask fits well, and refrain from sharing it.

Winnipeg Transit continues to take measures to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, including encouraging all passengers follow social distancing measures such as maintaining two metres distance from others, only taking Transit for essential trips, riding during non-peak hours whenever possible and exiting via the rear door to prevent crowding.

Winnipeg, MB – The City of Winnipeg is announcing the resumption of some services, in response to the Province of Manitoba’s Restoring Safe Services plan which was released yesterday.

“The City of Winnipeg began reviewing the Restoring Safe Services plan after it was released by the Province of Manitoba yesterday,” said Mayor Brian Bowman. “We ask for patience from businesses and citizens as we move as quickly as possible to meet a very short timeline.”

“Organizational recovery operations will not just be the simple reversal of steps taken during the response phase,” said Jason Shaw, Manager of the City’s Emergency Operations Centre. “Resumption of a closed program, process, or work function needs to be assessed and planned out. We are embarking on a ‘new normal’ where the way we were before COVID-19 may never be quite the same again. While we are beginning to move into recovery operations, we will also need to be ready to respond quickly to any subsequent waves of COVID-19.”

Community Services
All City-owned and operated recreation centres, pools, arenas, and libraries will remain closed until further notice. We are looking at options for re-opening City libraries, as per the Province’s plan; however, we do not have an opening date at this time. We are carefully weighing options that balance the health and safety of our staff and our patrons within these facilities.

Golf Services
Effective Monday, May 4, Kildonan Park, Crescent Drive, and Harbour View golf courses will open and will follow the provincial guidelines, including pre-screening golfers by phone, limiting golfers to one per motorized cart or two per household, and closing ball-washing stations, among other measures.

To reserve a tee time, please phone the golf course directly. Kildonan Park, Crescent Drive, and Harbour View golf courses will begin accepting tee-time bookings at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

The opening of the Windsor Park Golf Course is delayed due to high water levels on the Seine River.

Planning, Property & Development
The City will be posting guidelines for restaurants that wish to establish temporary patio space, as per the Province’s plan. These guidelines, along with online registration form, will be posted on the City’s website tomorrow. City staff will work through the weekend to process registrations, to ensure restaurants are able open their temporary spaces as soon as possible. Temporary patios will be allowed until May 31, and will be re-evaluated at that time to ensure they continue to align with the Province’s plan.

Once the Province enacts Phase 2 of their Restoring Services plan, these temporary patios will no longer be allowed, and an application will need to be submitted for a permanent patio space.

Public Works
Effective Monday, May 4, all City-owned play structures and picnic shelters will open as per the Province’s plan. We will also be opening skate parks, tennis courts, basketball courts, and athletic fields (soccer, baseball, football, etc.); however, members of the public are reminded that these are to be used only for non-contact sports, and that users must adhere to social distancing and cannot gather in groups of more than 10.

The City is still not accepting any park bookings at this time.

Winnipeg Transit
Winnipeg Transit will continue to move to a reduced schedule effective Monday, May 4; however, it will be monitoring passenger levels and will increase the number of buses in service if social distancing cannot be appropriately observed.

We will continue to analyze City services based on the Province’s plan and under the guidance of the Chief Provincial Public Health Officer.",City of Winnipeg,,City of Winnipeg to resume some services,https://winnipeg.ca/cao/media/news/nr_2020/nr_20200430.stm#3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Winnipeg, MB – The City of Winnipeg has released details of a temporary patio approval process available for local restaurants in response to the Province of Manitoba’s Restoring Safe Services plan. Guidelines and registration for the new temporary approvals are available through 311 and on the City of Winnipeg website.

The Province’s Restoring Safe Services plan released on April 29, 2020, will allow for eligible businesses to operate patio service while recognizing current public health requirements as of Monday, May 4, 2020. In order for businesses that do not currently hold an existing patio permit to participate during the first phase of the Province’s plan, they will be required to register with the City under the new temporary approval process.

Temporary patios must comply with the general safety requirements outlined in the Temporary Patio Registration Form and will be allowed to operate with a temporary approval until May 31, 2020, unless otherwise extended by the City as a result of the Province’s plan. Registration Forms can be submitted by email to ppd-permit@winnipeg.ca. Registrations submitted before 3 p.m. on Sunday, May 3, 2020 will be processed in time for start of business on Monday, May 4, 2020.

In addition to recognizing the public health guidelines on social distancing, all temporary patios must comply with the following general safety guidelines, which can also be found on the Temporary Patio Registration Form:

In an emergency maintenance or repair situation, the patio elements will be removed by others to allow for these activities. In a non-emergency maintenance or repair situation, notice will be provided to the applicant to have the patio elements removed to allow for these activities.
City officials will evaluate the temporary patio program over the next 30 days to the end of May to ensure the approvals continue to align with the Province’s Restoring Safe Services plan. The approval date of temporary patios may be extended at this time to suit the plan. If a business would like to operate their patio longer, they will need to apply for a permit and regular processing times will apply.

Winnipeg, MB – The City of Winnipeg is announcing the resumption of some services, in response to the Province of Manitoba’s Restoring Safe Services plan which was released yesterday.

“The City of Winnipeg began reviewing the Restoring Safe Services plan after it was released by the Province of Manitoba yesterday,” said Mayor Brian Bowman. “We ask for patience from businesses and citizens as we move as quickly as possible to meet a very short timeline.”

“Organizational recovery operations will not just be the simple reversal of steps taken during the response phase,” said Jason Shaw, Manager of the City’s Emergency Operations Centre. “Resumption of a closed program, process, or work function needs to be assessed and planned out. We are embarking on a ‘new normal’ where the way we were before COVID-19 may never be quite the same again. While we are beginning to move into recovery operations, we will also need to be ready to respond quickly to any subsequent waves of COVID-19.”

Community Services
All City-owned and operated recreation centres, pools, arenas, and libraries will remain closed until further notice. We are looking at options for re-opening City libraries, as per the Province’s plan; however, we do not have an opening date at this time. We are carefully weighing options that balance the health and safety of our staff and our patrons within these facilities.

Golf Services
Effective Monday, May 4, Kildonan Park, Crescent Drive, and Harbour View golf courses will open and will follow the provincial guidelines, including pre-screening golfers by phone, limiting golfers to one per motorized cart or two per household, and closing ball-washing stations, among other measures.

To reserve a tee time, please phone the golf course directly. Kildonan Park, Crescent Drive, and Harbour View golf courses will begin accepting tee-time bookings at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

The opening of the Windsor Park Golf Course is delayed due to high water levels on the Seine River.

Planning, Property & Development
The City will be posting guidelines for restaurants that wish to establish temporary patio space, as per the Province’s plan. These guidelines, along with online registration form, will be posted on the City’s website tomorrow. City staff will work through the weekend to process registrations, to ensure restaurants are able open their temporary spaces as soon as possible. Temporary patios will be allowed until May 31, and will be re-evaluated at that time to ensure they continue to align with the Province’s plan.

Once the Province enacts Phase 2 of their Restoring Services plan, these temporary patios will no longer be allowed, and an application will need to be submitted for a permanent patio space.

Public Works
Effective Monday, May 4, all City-owned play structures and picnic shelters will open as per the Province’s plan. We will also be opening skate parks, tennis courts, basketball courts, and athletic fields (soccer, baseball, football, etc.); however, members of the public are reminded that these are to be used only for non-contact sports, and that users must adhere to social distancing and cannot gather in groups of more than 10.

The City is still not accepting any park bookings at this time.

Winnipeg Transit
Winnipeg Transit will continue to move to a reduced schedule effective Monday, May 4; however, it will be monitoring passenger levels and will increase the number of buses in service if social distancing cannot be appropriately observed.

We will continue to analyze City services based on the Province’s plan and under the guidance of the Chief Provincial Public Health Officer.",City of Winnipeg,,City of Winnipeg to resume some services,https://winnipeg.ca/cao/media/news/nr_2020/nr_20200430.stm#3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An outbreak of COVID-19, novel coronavirus disease, a respiratory illness, first identified in Wuhan, province of Hubei, China continues to spread to other countries, including Canada and the United States. As of today, New Brunswick continues to have no confirmed cases, but we cannot be complacent. We need to take the appropriate precautions to lower the risk to all of us.

I know many people have already left or will be travelling outside of New Brunswick for the March break. For those travelling, the Public Health Agency of Canada is regularly posting travel notices. In addition, all travellers who are returning to New Brunswick, no matter where they were in the world, need to monitor themselves and their loved ones closely for symptoms, which include a fever, a cough and difficulty breathing. Anyone with those symptoms should call Tele-Care at 8-1-1 before going to a hospital or doctor’s office so that the proper precautions can be taken to reduce further spread of the disease.

All of us can also take simple actions that can help stop the spread of any type of communicable disease. Regular hand washing, coughing or sneezing into your elbow, avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth, and staying home when you are sick can greatly reduce the risk of infection spreading.

I want to assure New Brunswickers that our government officials are conducting emergency planning so that we are communicating, planning and co-ordinating with first responders, our communities and individual New Brunswickers to ensure we are ready.

I am personally having daily briefings with Public Health and Emergency Measures Organization leaders to receive any pertinent updates on the situation and our preparedness plans. Recognizing that this disease knows no borders, I have also written to Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe, the chair of the Council of the Federation which represents all premiers across the country. The goal is to ensure that good information is shared nationally about how our response plans will work, and what Canadians need to do to be ready.

I know that information has and will continue to come from a number of sources. It is important that people only count on the information from trusted sources to direct what they should do. In that regard, as the situation continues to evolve, information will be continuously provided and updated at gnb.ca/coronavirus, on the Government of New Brunswick social media channels, through traditional media and other methods as required.

We all need to heed the advice of our professionals who are working diligently to ensure we are prepared and any impact is minimal. I thank them for their efforts and I have let them know that I will provide whatever support is required.",Government of New Brunswick,,News Release: Premier’s statement on COVID-19,https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/news/news_release.2020.03.0079.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All New Brunswickers have a role to play to prevent the spread of respiratory infection by taking simple actions including washing your hands frequently, covering your cough and sneezes, and staying home when sick.

We are asking all travellers who are returning to New Brunswick from outside the country, no matter where they were in the world, to monitor themselves and their children closely for symptoms for 14 days.

Symptoms such as fever, cough and difficulty breathing may take up to 14 days to appear. Should an individual who has recently traveled outside the country experience these symptoms, they should:

isolate themselves from others as quickly as possible;
immediately call 811 or their health-care provider;
describe their symptoms and travel history; and
follow instructions carefully.
There are several ways that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) could affect the province but the provincial government is committed to being prepared for any eventuality. The province has been planning for a flu pandemic for several years, and it has a comprehensive system in place to address a pandemic situation.

Preparations are being carried out in collaboration with other provincial and territorial public health agencies and the Public Health Agency of Canada, which is working with its international partners.

The Department of Health is continuing to work closely with its partners and continues to issue public updates as they become available.

It is recommended that people with influenza-like symptoms limit contact with other people, including other household members, until they are free of symptoms and are feeling well.

It is important for New Brunswickers to understand that if they do not have influenza-like symptoms it is safe to go to work and school, to participate in activities, and to socialize, unless they were directed otherwise on their return from being outside the country.",Government of New Brunswick,,New Release: COVID-19 novel coronavirus,https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/news/news_release.2020.03.0088.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anyone who has traveled internationally in the past 14 days should monitor themselves for 14 days from when they arrived back in Canada. Individual risk will vary depending upon the destination. People arriving from Iran or the Chinese province of Hubei will need to isolate themselves regardless of symptoms.

Older adults and people who have certain chronic medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart and lung disease are more likely to contract the novel coronavirus and to experience more severe symptoms.

This particular group should plan to start minimizing attendance at crowded gatherings and mass events or think of other ways of participating (i.e. virtual attendance). Stay in touch with others through phone, email or text. This group should think about what health and food supplies they need on hand should they have to stay home, and slowly start replenishing their shelves with non-perishable, easy-to-prepare foods like dried pasta and sauce and canned soup, vegetables and beans. Also consider seeing your health-care provider or pharmacist to renew your prescriptions ahead of time.

We are very concerned about keeping this infection out of nursing homes, seniors’ residences, and other locations where vulnerable people gather. If you are a staff member, family member, or friend and you have any symptoms of a respiratory infection, please avoid nursing and other care homes, senior’s residences, and assisted living facilities.

Symptoms such as fever, cough, and difficulty breathing may take up to 14 days to appear. Should an individual who has recently traveled outside the country experience non-specific symptoms (such as headache, congestion, achiness, feeling unwell) they should separate themselves from others and stay home to monitor themselves.

Should these symptoms progress to include fever or cough, the individual should:

immediately call 811;
describe their symptoms and travel history; and
follow any instructions carefully.
Continue to take important everyday precautions such as washing your hands often and avoiding touching common surfaces in public places.

We are very concerned about keeping this infection out of nursing homes, seniors’ residences, and other locations where vulnerable people gather. Visitors who have travelled outside the country in the last 14 days are restricted from entering long-term care homes. Those who have travelled outside the country in the last 14 days are also restricted from entering health-care facilities to visit those most at risk for severe illness. These measures do not apply to health-care professionals who work in those institutions unless they have visited the Hubei province in China, Iran or Italy.

Anyone who has traveled internationally in the past 14 days should monitor themselves for 14 days from when they arrived back in Canada. Individual risk will vary depending upon the destination. People arriving from Iran or the Chinese province of Hubei will need to isolate themselves regardless of symptoms.

All New Brunswickers have a role to play in preventing the spread of respiratory infection by taking simple actions such as washing your hands frequently, covering your coughs and sneezes and staying home when sick.

Symptoms such as fever, cough, and difficulty breathing may take up to 14 days to appear. Should an individual who has recently traveled outside the country experience non-specific symptoms (such as headache, congestion, achiness, feeling unwell) they should separate themselves from others and stay home to monitor themselves.

Should these symptoms progress to include fever or cough, the individual should:

immediately call 811;
describe their symptoms and travel history; and
follow any instructions carefully.
Continue to take important everyday precautions such as washing your hands often and avoiding touching common surfaces in public places.

The Department of Health continues to work closely with its partners and will continue to issue public updates.

It is recommended that all people with influenza-like symptoms limit contact with other people, including other household members, until they are free of symptoms and are feeling well, regardless of their travel history.",Government of New Brunswick,,News Release: Update on novel coronavirus,https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/news/news_release.2020.03.0108.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020-03-12,Canada,New Brunswick,All,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,Government Website,"FREDERICTON (GNB) – The following update on COVID-19 (the novel coronavirus) was issued today by Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health:

Everyone has a role to play in mitigating the impact of COVID-19. It takes more than governments and action from the health sector to protect the health and safety of New Brunswickers.

Social distancing measures are a way to minimize COVID-19 transmission in the community. This means minimizing close contact with others during the peak of an outbreak. In addition to staying home when ill, New Brunswickers should plan actions they can take to reduce the spread of infection in places where people gather.

Some social distancing measures need extensive preparation, especially those with large crowds.

At this time, in an abundance of caution and to address public anxiety, the Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health recommends that any non-essential mass gathering (150 or more people) be cancelled or postponed until we are able to better determine the risk to our population. We understand that such a measure will disrupt the normal activities of our residents but believe it the prudent path to ensuring that we delay and minimize the impact of COVID-19 on our population. We are also encouraging amateur sports leagues or social gathering activities like dance or theatre to consider suspending their non-essential activities.

Mass gatherings can have the potential for serious public health consequences if they are not planned and managed carefully. They can increase the spread of infectious diseases and cause additional strain on the health-care system when held during outbreaks.

Infections can also be transmitted during transit to and from an event, and in the homes of event participants upon their return.

Event planners need to consider the COVID-19 outbreak.

Aside from cancelling or postponing an event, other measures to reduce infection risks during smaller mass gatherings include:

avoiding shaking hands;
practising proper hygiene;
avoiding common sleeping areas;
discouraging attendees from sharing food or drinks;
increasing social distance between others (ideally to two metres) by:
broadcasting events
offering virtual participation
moving the venue from indoors to outdoors
eliminating self-serve buffet style eating at social or religious gatherings;
encouraging people who are ill or those with high-risk medical conditions not to attend gatherings;
supporting hand hygiene by providing hand sanitizer dispensers in prominent locations;
ensuring event organizers have arrangements in place to safely isolate and transport people who become ill onsite; and
communicating clearly to attendees about the risks and directing them to our advice on reducing the spread of illness.

The health and well-being of New Brunswickers is our top priority.

Public Health would support a government decision to close schools in New Brunswick for two weeks in response to COVID-19. While we recognize the significant impact such a decision would have on families, students, schools and the entire community, this measure would help keep our residents safe.

People may still be travelling and, as the spread of COVID-19 is continuing to escalate internationally, additional measures should be considered.

Such measures should not extend to operators, staff or youth within early learning and childcare facilities at this time. The current risk assessment indicates that the risk of children acquiring COVID-19 is very low and the risk of them having serious disease outcomes is even lower. Early learning and childcare facilities operating within schools should also remain open at this time.

Daycares should screen for the virus by asking parents if their child is unwell and if they have travelled in the last 14 days.

Early learning and childcare facilities operators and staff who have travelled outside the country are asked to monitor themselves for symptoms for 14 days after they have returned to Canada.

Operators can access information online to guide them in implementing appropriate measures within their facilities.

Like our health-care workers, the role of early learning and child-care providers is a crucial one and I recognize their contribution to ensuring that essential services can continue to be provided to New Brunswick families.",Government of New Brunswick,,News Release: Update on COVID-19,https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/news/news_release.2020.03.0117.html,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She recommends that:

the provincial government focus its efforts on providing critical services, with all employees working from home wherever feasible and redeploying staff to focus on the most critical activities.
private sector companies encourage their employees to work from home wherever feasible and focus on critical activities.
child-care providers close with the exception of those that provide services to essential service workers such as health-care workers.

o   libraries;

o   museums;

o   theatres;

o   performance spaces;

o   swimming pools, spas, saunas and water parks;

o   sugar bush operations open to the public.

Public Health is also asking restaurant owners to limit the number of customers to 50 per cent of the capacity of their dining areas. Take-out orders, deliveries and drive-through services are permitted.

“It is imperative that everyone keep a distance of two metres (six feet) between themselves and others at all times,” said Russell. “Everyone must practise social distancing in all their interactions with neighbours, co-workers and fellow residents.”

Russell said there is one additional presumptive case of COVID-19 in the province, bringing the number of presumptive or positive cases in New Brunswick to seven.

The new case is a female, between 20 and 30 years old in Zone 2 (in the southern part of the province). The patient was screened, her recent travel history to Greece was confirmed and the patient was treated, tested and is in self-isolation.

Diagnostic testing confirmed the case as presumptive. Additional testing to confirm the case as a positive COVID-19 case will take place at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.

“Active contact tracing is being conducted by regional public health officials. These individuals are already isolating, and Public Health officials have already taken swift action to implement effective precautions to prevent the infection from spreading,” said Russell.

The regional health authorities will be opening community assessment centres to allow those who have been identified as high risk to be tested, without going to an Emergency Department.

Individuals who are experiencing mild to moderate symptoms will be directed to the assessment centres by Tele-Care 811. Once the individual has been assessed by Tele-Care, and if they require an in-person assessment, a referral will be provided to the Community Assessment Centre in their area.

It is important to note that these centres are not walk-in clinics. They are appointment based and all appointments are made through Tele-Care 811.

The health and well-being of New Brunswickers is our top priority. Staying home will reduce direct contact with New Brunswickers. Everyone has a responsibility to stay home and go out only for essentials.

In an effort to allow 811 health-care professionals to support more people who are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, the Department of Health has authorized physicians to see their patients “virtually” for routine services such as prescription renewals and providing follow-up health advice. You can receive care and advice over the phone, or if available to you, via secure video chat software.

These provisions have also just been authorized for psychiatrists for the provision of mental health-care services. These measures will enable New Brunswickers to maintain social distance and still get the care they need. More importantly, these measures will better enable our health-care professionals to focus on meeting the needs of the most urgent cases and minimize in-person contact in an environment where the risk of passing on infection may be high.

Testing has identified one additional presumptive case of COVID-19, bringing the number of presumptive or positive cases in New Brunswick to eight.

The case is a male, under 10 years of age in zone 3 (in the central part of the province). The patient is a close contact to a confirmed travel-related case.

Additional testing to confirm the cases as positive COVID-19 cases will take place at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.

The provincial government has taken a number of steps to address the impact of COVID-19. As of today, only those public-sector workers who work in critical functions or areas that support critical functions will remain on the job.

Other changes include:

Nursing Homes

Premier Blaine Higgs reminded New Brunswickers visitation is restricted at nursing homes and hospitals in order to protect people over the age of 70 who are at the highest risk of contracting COVID-19.

Starting today, the Department of Social Development is introducing an urgent nursing home placement process to move 65 individuals currently in hospital beds receiving alternative levels of care into nursing homes around the province. These people will be moved into a nursing home that provides services in their language of choice within 100 kilometres of their permanent address. Doing this will enhance the well-being of seniors who require 24-hour nursing care while freeing up dozens of hospital beds. This will allow for more capacity in our health-care system to address the needs of people facing serious illness.

Legislature

Today, the legislative assembly sat with a quorum of 15 members. All the parties worked together to pass numerous pieces of legislation, including the legislation to postpone the municipal elections planned for May. This legislation will also make it possible to postpone the provincial byelections if that becomes necessary. A decision was also made today that the house is going to rise until further notice. This will help reduce interactions among members of the legislative assembly. The government is leading by example to highlight the importance of social distancing.

Businesses

Some businesses have had to temporarily close to help slow the spread of the virus, but Higgs reassured New Brunswickers that grocery stores and pharmacies have access to supplies and will stay open. Higgs congratulated the businesses that are not just staying open and that are making accommodations to make life easier for the most vulnerable residents by setting aside specific times for seniors and persons with disabilities to shop.

Higgs called on banks to consider what they can do to help small local businesses stay afloat, and he is working directly with the federal government to ensure there is a coordinated approach to assist small businesses and individuals who need help.

Correctional Services

In an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in correctional institutions, the province has closed public access to these facilities effective immediately. The restriction includes all members of the public, including inmate family members, volunteers and legal representatives.

These measures include all facilities in the province: Southeast Regional Correctional Centre; Saint John Regional Correctional Centre; Madawaska Regional Correctional Centre; Dalhousie Regional Correctional Centre; New Brunswick Youth Centre; and New Brunswick Women’s Correctional Centre.

Inmates will be offered extra phone calls during this time. Correctional Services will be monitoring the need to continue with this restriction and will be taking advice from officials with the Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health.

Child care

Information for essential service workers on how to access child care services is now available through the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development’s Parent Portal or by calling 1-833-221-9339.

Facilities remaining open to support essential service workers will follow the advice set out by the chief medical officer, including reduced group sizes and social distancing. In addition, they will continue to follow strict health and safety directives.

The directive relating to individuals who have travelled internationally on or after March 9 continues to apply and such travellers are to avoid early learning and child care centres for a period of 14 days.",Government of New Brunswick,,News Release: Update on COVID-19,https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/news/news_release.2020.03.0132.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,0.0,,Government Website,"FREDERICTON (GNB) – The following update on COVID-19 (the novel coronavirus) was issued today by Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health:

2020-03-18,Canada,New Brunswick,All,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,2.0,0.0,,Government Website,"FREDERICTON (GNB) – Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, is directing New Brunswickers to stay home and engage in proper social distancing practices to help slow the spread of COVID-19 (the novel coronavirus).

“It is up to us to take actions that will slow the spread of the virus, and give our doctors, nurses and other health-care professionals the best chance to cope with its impact,” said Russell. “The outbreak of COVID-19 can be stressful for people and communities. It is natural to feel distress, anxiety, grief, and worry during and after a stressful situation.”

Russell said there are actions individuals can take to support themselves and their families:

Connect with others while maintaining safe social distancing - Share your concerns and how you are feeling with a friend or family member. Check-in regularly with loved ones, especially those affected by the virus.
Take breaks - Take deep breaths, stretch or meditate. Make time to unwind and remind yourself that strong feelings will fade. Try to do activities you usually enjoy. Maintain a sense of hope and think positively.
Get plenty of sleep, exercise, and eat well.
Testing has identified three additional presumptive cases of COVID-19, bringing the number of presumptive or positive cases in New Brunswick to 11.

The three new cases are:

a female, between 60 and 70, in zone 1 (southeast) who had been on a cruise;
a male, between 60 and 70, in zone 3 (central) who had been in contact with an individual who had direct contact with a traveller; and
a female, between 50 and 60, in zone 3 (central) who had travelled to the United Kingdom.
Additional testing to confirm the cases will take place at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.

Premier Blaine Higgs implored New Brunswickers to heed recommendations from Dr. Russell and the Public Health team.

“People should stay home whenever possible, I cannot stress that enough,” said Higgs. “No play dates; no sleepovers; family visits only when required. Enjoy the fresh air, but avoid doing it in groups, and keep six feet away from others when you absolutely need to go somewhere.”

Higgs said these measures are designed to flatten the curve and reduce the impact of the virus. He also thanked New Brunswickers who continue to provide essential services.

“There are those on the front lines of our health-care system, but there are also people like the truck drivers who are making sure goods get to our stores, the staff working in those stores and keeping the shelves stocked, and the people working behind the scenes every day to enable us to continue to get these important updates to you,” he said. “They are leaving their families at home and in service to the greater good. We need to do what we can to help them stay healthy and safe, and that means we must stay at home as much as possible.”

Higgs stressed the importance of following the advice of health professionals to protect New Brunswickers, especially the more vulnerable residents. He warned that if people do not act as advised, additional measures may need to be taken to ensure that everyone follows the Public Health recommendations.

Other information related to the response to the virus includes:

Pharmacies

Pharmacists are considering the long-term needs of New Brunswickers and wish to ensure that medications are dispensed responsibly during this uncertain time. Providing patients with a 30-day supply of medication will help them continue to ensure a stable supply for patients. Requesting early refills unless absolutely necessary or stockpiling medications could create unintended drug shortages and put the health of other patients at risk.

In order to help keep pharmacists and their staff healthy, New Brunswickers are asked not to go to any pharmacy if they are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, new onset of cough or difficulty breathing), in the 14 days after the onset of symptoms or if they think they have been exposed to the virus.

Food Security

The Department of Social Development is in constant contact with food banks, soup kitchens, agencies such as Meals on Wheels and similar organizations, to ensure the continued provision of services. If volunteers are needed, many civil servants are available and have offered to help. If these organizations experience an influx of new clients, the department will provide additional financial support.

Shelters for the homeless

The Department of Social Development is working closely with shelters for the homeless to encourage best practices in preventing the onset and spread of the virus. The shelters are reinforcing safe hygiene practices, including constant handwashing, among the clients and staff are cleaning the shelters thoroughly.

Most shelters are operating at or near capacity, but plans are being finalized to provide temporary separate accommodations in the event a shelter client becomes ill with COVID 19.

Canadian Red Cross

As part of its efforts to encourage social distancing and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, the Canadian Red Cross will close its offices and branches to the public by the end of day, March 18. Regarding the Health Equipment Loan Program, delivery services are by appointment only between 9 a.m. and noon, if absolutely necessary.

New Brunswick courts

New Brunswick courts are closed to the public except for those people necessary to the proceedings including counsel, litigants, accused, witnesses, victim service workers and members of the media. No one who is experiencing any COVID-19 related symptoms should attend. Information related to the courts is available online.

Businesses

Information specific to businesses is available online and will be updated as more information becomes available. Businesses impacted by sudden shifts in the economy are encouraged you to get in touch with their local Opportunities NB office, or by emailing info@onbcanada.ca.

Daycares

Higgs said parents will not be charged while daycares are closed to their children and said essential service workers, whose children are at daycares, will continue to pay their regular rate.

“We are asking daycare operators not to increase their usual rates at this time,” he said. “Today the federal government announced relief for small businesses. We are working to determine how this applies to daycares, but we are committed to closing the gaps.”

Federal government initiatives

Higgs noted the federal government today announced a new set of economic measures to help stabilize the economy.

“These measures will provide up to $27 billion in direct support to Canadian workers and businesses,” he said. “As this was just announced, we need to determine the role New Brunswick will play in this. As we learn more, we will share the information.”

Higgs said he was pleased that Canada and the United States have agreed to collaborate on mutually restricting discretionary travel across the border.

“I was relieved to hear during a call with Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland and all the premiers, that this will not impact essential travel and trade, including trucking,” he said. “Specifically, we were given assurances that they are making progress to find a way to minimize the impact on Campobello Island.”",Government of New Brunswick,,Update on COVID-20,https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/news/news_release.2020.03.0136.html,2.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,Government Website,"FREDERICTON (GNB) – Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, is directing New Brunswickers to stay home and engage in proper social distancing practices to help slow the spread of COVID-19 (the novel coronavirus).

“It is up to us to take actions that will slow the spread of the virus, and give our doctors, nurses and other health-care professionals the best chance to cope with its impact,” said Russell. “The outbreak of COVID-19 can be stressful for people and communities. It is natural to feel distress, anxiety, grief, and worry during and after a stressful situation.”

Russell said there are actions individuals can take to support themselves and their families:

Connect with others while maintaining safe social distancing - Share your concerns and how you are feeling with a friend or family member. Check-in regularly with loved ones, especially those affected by the virus.
Take breaks - Take deep breaths, stretch or meditate. Make time to unwind and remind yourself that strong feelings will fade. Try to do activities you usually enjoy. Maintain a sense of hope and think positively.
Get plenty of sleep, exercise, and eat well.
Testing has identified three additional presumptive cases of COVID-19, bringing the number of presumptive or positive cases in New Brunswick to 11.

The three new cases are:

a female, between 60 and 70, in zone 1 (southeast) who had been on a cruise;
a male, between 60 and 70, in zone 3 (central) who had been in contact with an individual who had direct contact with a traveller; and
a female, between 50 and 60, in zone 3 (central) who had travelled to the United Kingdom.
Additional testing to confirm the cases will take place at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.

Premier Blaine Higgs implored New Brunswickers to heed recommendations from Dr. Russell and the Public Health team.

“People should stay home whenever possible, I cannot stress that enough,” said Higgs. “No play dates; no sleepovers; family visits only when required. Enjoy the fresh air, but avoid doing it in groups, and keep six feet away from others when you absolutely need to go somewhere.”

Higgs said these measures are designed to flatten the curve and reduce the impact of the virus. He also thanked New Brunswickers who continue to provide essential services.

“There are those on the front lines of our health-care system, but there are also people like the truck drivers who are making sure goods get to our stores, the staff working in those stores and keeping the shelves stocked, and the people working behind the scenes every day to enable us to continue to get these important updates to you,” he said. “They are leaving their families at home and in service to the greater good. We need to do what we can to help them stay healthy and safe, and that means we must stay at home as much as possible.”

Higgs stressed the importance of following the advice of health professionals to protect New Brunswickers, especially the more vulnerable residents. He warned that if people do not act as advised, additional measures may need to be taken to ensure that everyone follows the Public Health recommendations.

Other information related to the response to the virus includes:

Pharmacies

Pharmacists are considering the long-term needs of New Brunswickers and wish to ensure that medications are dispensed responsibly during this uncertain time. Providing patients with a 30-day supply of medication will help them continue to ensure a stable supply for patients. Requesting early refills unless absolutely necessary or stockpiling medications could create unintended drug shortages and put the health of other patients at risk.

Testing has identified six new presumptive cases and confirmed two previous presumptive cases of COVID-19, bringing the total number of cases in New Brunswick to 17: eight confirmed and nine presumptive. There have been 771 tests administered to date in the province.

Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, continues to urge people to stay home, maintain social distance and wash their hands frequently.

“It is critical that everyone do their part to stop the spread of COVID-19,” said Russell. “This can and will save lives.”

Premier Blaine Higgs acknowledged that the increase in cases is not surprising.

“Based on what we have seen in other jurisdictions, we know that the numbers will continue to rise,” said Higgs. “We have put measures in place here in New Brunswick to try to slow down the rising number of cases. With our province under a state of emergency, I am imploring people to continue to take this situation seriously.”

The six new cases are:

a male, between 40 and 50, in zone 2 (south), who had been on a cruise;
a female, between 50 and 60 in zone 3 (central), who is a direct contact of a previously identified presumptive case;
a female, between 40 and 50, in zone 2 (south), who had been on a cruise;
a male, between 60 and 70, in zone 2 (south), who had been on a cruise;
a female, between 50 and 60, in zone 2 (south), who had been on a cruise; and
a female, between 20 and 30, in zone 2 (south), who is a close contact to a travel-related presumptive case.
Additional testing to confirm the cases will take place at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.

A new online self-assessment tool is now in use and Russell is pleased with the public response.

“Yesterday, almost 5,500 individuals used the self-assessment tool,” said Russell. “This has led to a reduction in the number of calls to the 811 line, which has allowed our health-care professionals to assist callers more promptly.”

Effective immediately, and for the duration of the emergency, patients with drug coverage under New Brunswick’s public drug plans will only be responsible for the initial co-payment on a prescription fill or refill. For example, a patient with a 90-day prescription will only have a co-payment for the first 30-day fill. There will be no co-payment required for the second and third 30-day fills on the same 90-day prescription. This applies to all New Brunswickers that are on the public drug plan, including many seniors and low-income individuals.

Among the steps being taken to address the pandemic is closing off non-essential travel between Canada and the United States, effective today.

“I want New Brunswickers to know government is doing its part to make sure returning travellers know what is expected of them,” said Higgs.

The premier added that travellers with symptoms are not being allowed to board airplanes. Everyone who arrives, by air or by land, is being screened at the border. If they have symptoms, they will be separated from others and Public Health will conduct isolation and testing. If they do not have symptoms, they will receive detailed information on what is expected of them. As well, all travellers must isolate themselves for 14 days after returning home.

Testing has identified six new presumptive cases and confirmed two previous presumptive cases of COVID-19, bringing the total number of cases in New Brunswick to 17: eight confirmed and nine presumptive. There have been 771 tests administered to date in the province.

Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, continues to urge people to stay home, maintain social distance and wash their hands frequently.

“It is critical that everyone do their part to stop the spread of COVID-19,” said Russell. “This can and will save lives.”

Premier Blaine Higgs acknowledged that the increase in cases is not surprising.

“Based on what we have seen in other jurisdictions, we know that the numbers will continue to rise,” said Higgs. “We have put measures in place here in New Brunswick to try to slow down the rising number of cases. With our province under a state of emergency, I am imploring people to continue to take this situation seriously.”

The six new cases are:

a male, between 40 and 50, in zone 2 (south), who had been on a cruise;
a female, between 50 and 60 in zone 3 (central), who is a direct contact of a previously identified presumptive case;
a female, between 40 and 50, in zone 2 (south), who had been on a cruise;
a male, between 60 and 70, in zone 2 (south), who had been on a cruise;
a female, between 50 and 60, in zone 2 (south), who had been on a cruise; and
a female, between 20 and 30, in zone 2 (south), who is a close contact to a travel-related presumptive case.
Additional testing to confirm the cases will take place at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.

A new online self-assessment tool is now in use and Russell is pleased with the public response.

“Yesterday, almost 5,500 individuals used the self-assessment tool,” said Russell. “This has led to a reduction in the number of calls to the 811 line, which has allowed our health-care professionals to assist callers more promptly.”

Effective immediately, and for the duration of the emergency, patients with drug coverage under New Brunswick’s public drug plans will only be responsible for the initial co-payment on a prescription fill or refill. For example, a patient with a 90-day prescription will only have a co-payment for the first 30-day fill. There will be no co-payment required for the second and third 30-day fills on the same 90-day prescription. This applies to all New Brunswickers that are on the public drug plan, including many seniors and low-income individuals.

Among the steps being taken to address the pandemic is closing off non-essential travel between Canada and the United States, effective today.

“I want New Brunswickers to know government is doing its part to make sure returning travellers know what is expected of them,” said Higgs.

The premier added that travellers with symptoms are not being allowed to board airplanes. Everyone who arrives, by air or by land, is being screened at the border. If they have symptoms, they will be separated from others and Public Health will conduct isolation and testing. If they do not have symptoms, they will receive detailed information on what is expected of them. As well, all travellers must isolate themselves for 14 days after returning home. Anyone transporting these travellers from the airport, or those who mingle with them in other ways, must also self-isolate.

There are still 17 cases in New Brunswick: eight confirmed and nine presumptive. So far there have been 865 tests conducted in the province.

Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, reminds New Brunswickers to stay home and engage in proper social distancing practices to help slow the spread of COVID-19.

“All of us can take simple actions that can help stop the spread of any type of communicable disease,” said Russell. “Regular hand washing, coughing or sneezing into your elbow, avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth, practice social distancing by maintaining two-metres from others and staying home (self-isolating) when you are sick can greatly reduce the risk of infection spreading.”

To limit the spread of COVID-19, all non-essential travel between Canada and the United States is restricted, until further notice.

People who are returning to New Brunswick from international travel are required to self-isolate at home for 14 days. This means they must not make any stops, including at the grocery store or pharmacy. They must go directly home and connect with a relative, friend or volunteer to help them with any required errands.

Many New Brunswickers are returning from a lengthy stay in the southern United States or elsewhere. Over the 14 days they need to monitor themselves and their families closely for symptoms, which include a fever, or cough or difficulty breathing. Anyone with those symptoms can:

use the Government of New Brunswick’s online self-assessment tool at www.gnb.ca/coronavirus;
make a virtual appointment with their primary care provider; or;
call Tele-Care at 8-1-1 to speak with a registered nurse.
It is imperative that people remain home, self-isolating until directed otherwise by a health professional.

Everyone entering New Brunswick from outside Canada will be given a brochure explaining all the measures associated with COVID-19 and the State of Emergency. The objective is to ensure appropriate actions are taken to address the pandemic.

The provincial government will have a phone line available on Monday, March 23, which New Brunswickers can call if they have concerns about people not complying with the state of emergency orders. In the meantime, concerned individuals can remind returning travellers of their responsibility to do their part to keep everyone safe by staying in their homes. All residents, including those who have travelled and those who have not, are reminded to follow the guidelines laid out in the orders.

Russell is encouraging people to look after themselves and others, both physically and mentally.

“I encourage everyone to take the opportunity to get outdoors and enjoy the fresh air,” said Russell. “Several things are closed but the outdoors is not one of them! There are many activities that you and your family can do outside that still respect social distancing practices. Go for a walk or hike, do yoga in the backyard or look for signs of spring.”

Testing at the microbiology laboratory at the Dr. Georges-L.-Dumont University Hospital Centre in Moncton has identified 12 new cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in New Brunswick to 45. In addition, one of the individuals previously confirmed as a case of COVID-19, has now recovered.

The new cases include one which is being investigated as an incident of community transmission, which means the case cannot be directly traced back to an infection that occurred outside the province.

The new cases are:

An individual aged 60-69, in Zone 1 (southeast)
An individual aged 70-79, in Zone 1 (southeast)
An individual aged 70-79, in Zone 1 (southeast)

Public Health has identified one confirmed COVID-19 case on each of two flights that came into New Brunswick; Air Canada Flight 8900 from Montreal to Moncton on March 16, and Sunwing Flight 169 from Punta Cana to Fredericton on March 18.

All passengers on those flights should already be self-isolating. However, it remains vital that people on those flights continue to remain in self-isolation for at least 14 days.

Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, said that with a case of potential community transmission now under investigation, changes will be made to the testing protocols.

“We are expanding testing to cover our health-care workers who have not travelled but have developed a new cough, fever or shortness of breath,” said Russell. “All workers in our health-care sector who have developed COVID-19 symptoms are directed to immediately self-isolate. This includes employees of regional health authorities, long-term care facilities, the Extra-Mural Hospital, Ambulance New Brunswick, community physicians and pharmacists.”

Information on the toll-free number for health-care employees to seek assistance will be available Saturday.

As the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise in Canada, Premier Blaine Higgs said the need for co-operation between the federal government and the provinces has never been greater.

“We are already starting to discuss our country’s eventual recovery from this pandemic,” said Higgs. “Eventually, this situation will end, and as a nation, we will need to make the right decisions to grow our economy, repair the damage that has been done, and put us on a trajectory that will bring prosperity to Canada, including to the resilient people of New Brunswick.”

The Red Cross will have a website online at noon on Monday, March 30, that will provide information about a one-time income benefit available to either workers or self-employed people in New Brunswick who have lost their job due to the state of emergency.

Payments of this one-time $900 benefit will begin on April 2.

“I thank the Red Cross for their response and support,” said Higgs. “This is exactly the type of partnership we need during these difficult times.”

Playgrounds

Because of the pandemic, all school playgrounds and playgrounds associated with public housing facilities, are closed to support physical distancing requirements.

Businesses

Employers are reminded of their duty to comply with the measures in the state of emergency declaration. For the safety of employees and customers, businesses that are allowed to be open must limit the number of customers on their premises to maintain physical distancing rules and must check that customers entering are not among those required to be in self-isolation. Failing to comply could result in enforcement by the Department of Public Safety or a stop-work order by WorkSafeNB.

The correct numbers are below.

FREDERICTON (GNB) – Public Health has updated the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the province.

Testing at the microbiology laboratory at the Dr. Georges-L.-Dumont University Hospital Centre in Moncton has identified 15 new cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in New Brunswick to 66.

To date, two people who were diagnosed with COVID-19 have recovered from their illness.

Further analysis is being conducted to determine additional details of the new cases including whether community transmission has occurred.

With the addition of the new cases, the following details the number of cases in each health zone:

Zone 1 (Moncton Region): 17
Zone 2 (Saint John Region): 17
Zone 3 (Fredericton Region): 21
Zone 4 (Edmundston Region): 4
Zone 5 (Campbellton Region): 7
“While I understand this is an unusual and challenging time for our province, my recommendations have not changed,” said Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health. “We must continue to protect ourselves with frequent hand-washing and by remaining at home. Only go out for essential services like buying food, getting prescriptions, or attending medical appointments, and return home immediately after. It is important to continue to practice physical distancing. These practices will save lives.”

New Brunswick Workers Emergency Income Benefit

As announced on March 24, workers or self-employed people in New Brunswick who have lost their job due to the COVID-19 situation are eligible to receive a one-time income benefit of $900.

Applications will be available online starting at noon on Monday, March 30.

“We understand these are difficult times for all of us, and especially for our workers and their families,” said Premier Blaine Higgs. “We are facing a situation unlike anything we have ever experienced. We believe this one-time benefit will help workers and self-employed people with their immediate needs and will keep us on a trajectory that will bring prosperity back to New Brunswick.”

The benefit is intended to help to bridge the time between when people lose their employment or close their business to when they receive their federal benefit.

To be eligible for the $900 benefit, a person must:

have lost his or her job.
have been laid off, or be self-employed and have lost all revenue, on or after March 15 due to the state of emergency in New Brunswick.
have earned a minimum of $5,000 (gross) in the last 12 months or in the last calendar year.
have lost his or her primary source of income.
have applied (or plan to apply) for support from the federal government (either Employment Insurance or the Canada Emergency Response Benefit).
have no other income.
be 18 years or older.
More information on the benefit and the application procedure is available online.

“Since this benefit will be administered through the Red Cross, I want to personally thank the organization for its quick response and support,” said Higgs. “This is exactly the type of partnership we need during difficult times. It shows how strong we are as a province.”

In addition, individuals who visited Shoppers Drug Mart at 57 Lansdowne Ave. in Saint John on the date below were potentially exposed to COVID-19:

March 20 – 10 a.m. to 4:15 p.m.
Anyone who was in those stores during those times should self-monitor and call 811 if they have any symptoms.

Dr. Jennifer Russell, the province’s chief medical officer of health, confirmed that incidents of community transmission are now present in New Brunswick; these are cases that cannot be directly traced back to an infection which took place outside the province. There are confirmed cases of community transmission in zones 1 (Moncton region), 2 (Saint John region) and 4 (Edmundston region). There are additional cases being investigated in other regions.

“This follows the trend we have seen in other parts of Canada. We have been expecting this and preparing for it,” said Russell. “People everywhere in New Brunswick have to act as if the virus is in their community whether it is confirmed or not.”

Russell said the potential for community transmission was the reason the province took proactive measures, such as directing people to stay at home, asking people to maintain physical distancing with others, limiting travel, and cancelling events where crowds may gather. These actions will limit the spread of the virus and the disease it carries, said Russell.

With community transmission now a reality, Russell said further changes are being made to the province’s testing protocols to ensure protection for those in greatest need. Testing will now focus on:

symptomatic health-care workers and staff of long-term care facilities and prisons
hospitalized patients with respiratory symptoms and no alternative diagnosis
residents of long-term care facilities and other vulnerable communities
Symptomatic travellers from outside New Brunswick will continue to be tested.

Russell emphasized the continued importance of New Brunswickers being on alert for COVID-19 symptoms – a new or exacerbation of a chronic cough or a fever – among themselves and their families. People should use the self-assessment tool at the www.gnb.ca website for guidance and contact 811 if they have symptoms.

“If you have the symptoms of COVID-19, you must act as if you have COVID-19,” said Russell. “That means isolating yourself immediately for at least 14 days. Do not put others at risk by behaving as if you do not have this disease.

“More than ever, what you do matters. What each of us does matters. It remains within our capability to slow the progress and limit the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak.”

Entering the third week of emergency

Premier Blaine Higgs thanked all New Brunswickers for their quick action and innovation to address the pandemic.

Higgs said the government made difficult decisions early to flatten the curve and reduce the spread of COVID-19 by closing schools, government offices, businesses and all non-essential services. Higgs said he anticipates these decisions will have a positive effect in the days and weeks ahead.   

“Taking action before we were experiencing the full impact of the pandemic may have seemed extreme at the time, but I am confident it was the right thing to do,” said Higgs.  “We took these actions earlier than some jurisdictions because we saw what happened all around the world in places that waited too long to react.”

Emphasis on physical distancing

New Brunswickers are being reminded of the importance of physical distancing and self-isolation, particularly following stories in the media over the past week about people engaging in unacceptable behaviour that puts residents, essential workers and first responders in danger.

“The more successful we are at flattening the curve now, the quicker we can all get back to our regular lives,” said Higgs. “Many people and businesses have taken this situation seriously from the beginning, and they have done their part to help keep us all safe. We have to continue to do our part by staying at home and maintaining physical distance from others. There are still people disobeying the emergency order and putting us all at risk.”

Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, said as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, it becomes increasingly important that we protect those who are protecting us.

“Doctors, nurses, paramedics, lab technicians and a host of other health-care workers are working hard every day to protect us against the spread of this virus and provide care to those who become ill because of it,” said Russell. “They are putting themselves in harm’s way for all of us and they deserve our profound gratitude.”

State of emergency enforcement

The all-party cabinet committee on COVID-19 and the cabinet have agreed to extend the state of emergency declaration issued March 19 for another 14 days. The order will be reassessed after two weeks and will be extended as needed.

Premier Blaine Higgs stressed that failing to obey the emergency order has serious consequences, with fines ranging from $292.50 to $10,200.

“Most New Brunswickers understand that we are under a state of emergency and have been acting appropriately,” said Higgs. “But we are still seeing reports of people who are not taking the situation seriously. We need these people to understand that violating an order is against the law.”

Personal protection equipment (PPE) for health-care workers

Higgs said he was pleased to hear the federal government will invest $2 billion to produce necessary supplies, including ventilators, testing kits and personal protective equipment such as masks, face shields, gowns and hand sanitizer.

“We will continue to work closely with the federal government and the other provinces to ensure we have access to these supplies in New Brunswick as the demand increases,” said Higgs.

Russell urged the public not to obtain or use supplies made for the health-care sector.

“I am confident we have the medical supplies we need to meet the current demands of this pandemic,” said Russell. “But we cannot afford to waste our resources. We must maintain our supplies and use them appropriately.”

Flatten the curve

Higgs repeated calls for everyone to do their part to protect all New Brunswickers.

“Since this pandemic began, we have all been asked to make sacrifices,” said Higgs. “We need all of you to do your part. We need you to continue to stay at home and keep a safe physical distance from other people. We need you to help us flatten the curve.”

Assistance for post-secondary students

The Emergency Bridging Fund for Vulnerable Post-Secondary Students will support students who are directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The funds will be distributed by post-secondary institutions based upon eligibility criteria and will provide a one-time amount of up to $750 per student.

“The fund will support post-secondary students, including international students, who demonstrate a financial gap in meeting their basic needs between now and the end of the term,” said Premier Blaine Higgs.

Students must contact their institution directly to be considered and will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Funding support will be based upon the need for food, shelter, unanticipated medical costs not covered through health plans, and unforeseen additional academic costs.

To qualify, vulnerable students must not qualify for the one-time $900 provincial emergency fund as of March 30. They must be in a position in which they cannot access money through student loans, Employment Insurance, personal savings, or other COVID-19 related financial assistance programs.

Parks

All provincial parks as well as playgrounds provincewide are closed.

Higgs said today that if municipalities are going to keep their parks and trails open, they must have mechanisms in place to ensure that the limitations on the number of people that can gather is enforced.

“Appropriate signage must be put up at access points to identify limitations on gatherings and the requirements for physical distancing,” said Higgs. “If a municipality cannot monitor usage of their premises, they should be closed.”

Landlords and tenants

Higgs clarified confusion that has arisen around the state of emergency and how it impacts tenants.

The mandatory order under the Emergency Measures Act suspends the right for landlords to evict tenants for non-payment of rent, through to May 31.

“People can still be evicted,” said Higgs. However, the reason for the eviction cannot be that they are unable to pay their rent due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All other tenant obligations remain.”

Testing at the microbiology laboratory at the Dr. Georges-L.-Dumont University Hospital Centre in Moncton has identified four new cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in New Brunswick to 95.

Of the 95 cases, 54 are travel-related, 28 are close contacts of confirmed cases, three cases are from community transmission and 10 cases remain under investigation.

In six cases individuals were hospitalized, but two have since been discharged. Four patients remain in hospital, with one in the intensive care unit.

To date, 25 people have recovered.

The new cases are:

“As we see our cases continue to increase it is important that we keep washing our hands, continue to practise physical distancing and also continue to stay at home,” said Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health. “What we do now to flatten the curve will save lives in our province. We have community transmission so please follow the guidelines.”

Assistance for post-secondary students

The Emergency Bridging Fund for Vulnerable Post-Secondary Students will support students who are directly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The funds will be distributed by post-secondary institutions based upon eligibility criteria and will provide a one-time amount of up to $750 per student.

“The fund will support post-secondary students, including international students, who demonstrate a financial gap in meeting their basic needs between now and the end of the term,” said Premier Blaine Higgs.

Students must contact their institution directly to be considered and will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Funding support will be based upon the need for food, shelter, unanticipated medical costs not covered through health plans, and unforeseen additional academic costs.

To qualify, vulnerable students must not qualify for the one-time $900 provincial emergency fund as of March 30. They must be in a position in which they cannot access money through student loans, Employment Insurance, personal savings, or other COVID-19 related financial assistance programs.

Parks

All provincial parks as well as playgrounds provincewide are closed.

Higgs said today that if municipalities are going to keep their parks and trails open, they must have mechanisms in place to ensure that the limitations on the number of people that can gather is enforced.

“Appropriate signage must be put up at access points to identify limitations on gatherings and the requirements for physical distancing,” said Higgs. “If a municipality cannot monitor usage of their premises, they should be closed.”

“The directive that my office has given – and the province’s emergency declaration – must be followed,” said Russell. “There have been too many instances of people flouting these rules, seeking loopholes or attending gatherings they presume are free of risk. No gathering can be free of risk right now.”

However, an assessment is still required through 811 or an individual’s primary health-care provider.”

Testing will continue to focus upon the protection of health-care workers, patients in hospitals and nursing homes, as well as first responders. Priority will also be given to testing those who may be more vulnerable to the disease, including people over 60 and people with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes, or cancer.

“COVID-19 can strike anyone, of any age, in any community in our province,” said Russell. “That is why it remains vital that every New Brunswicker stay at home as much as possible. When people go out, they should keep their interactions brief and maintain six feet of physical distance between themselves and others.”

Loans for working capital now available

Small, medium and large employers in New Brunswick whose businesses have been impacted by COVID-19 can now apply to the provincial government for loans for working capital.

“We understand that this pandemic is impacting New Brunswick business,” said Premier Blaine Higgs. “We acted swiftly to address the needs of the business community and support these employers during this challenging time.”

The new loans are to support New Brunswick-based companies. A total of $50 million has been allocated for two distinct loan programs for working capital.

Businesses can access more information about the application processes on a dedicated web page which features frequently asked questions and online resources.

Deadline approaching for applications for income benefit

Applications for the New Brunswick Workers Emergency Income Benefit will end at 8 p.m. on Thursday, April 9. The one-time $900 benefit was created to help to bridge the time between when people lose their employment or close their business to when they receive their federal benefit.

“This benefit has provided some much-needed relief,” said Higgs. “Helping workers and self-employed people with their immediate needs will keep us on a trajectory that will bring prosperity back to New Brunswick.”

More than 60,000 applicants have registered for the benefit. To date the provincial government has provided more than $20 million in benefit payments.

Religious gatherings restricted during state of emergency

Residents are reminded that as part of the state of emergency for COVID-19, restrictions are in place for all gatherings, including religious celebrations.

Clergy members can livestream a religious service, but individuals operating video equipment must maintain the physical distancing requirements of two metres.

“With Easter weekend approaching, it is important to remember that in-person religious services in New Brunswick are prohibited,” said Premier Blaine Higgs. “With your co-operation, we will make Easter and all religious observations as safe as possible for everyone.”

Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, has directed New Brunswickers not to hold family gatherings, attend in-person religious services or hold recreational events over the Easter weekend, to avoid further spread of the COVID-19 virus.

“The temptation to gather with friends and loved ones will be great this weekend,” said Russell. “You may think ‘it’s just my family’ or ‘it’s just my friends.’ But the COVID-19 virus may be an uninvited guest at your event, brought along by someone who has only mild symptoms, or no symptoms at all. Do not let that happen.”

Buying essentials

Residents are reminded that many retailers will be closed on Good Friday and Easter Sunday.

Higgs encouraged people to make any essential purchases in advance, or plan to wait until next week, and to continue to observe restrictions and physical distancing requirements.

“We are grateful for all the essential retail workers who continue to provide important services and necessities,” said Higgs. “For everyone’s safety, we ask that households choose one person to be the designated shopper, whenever possible.”

These projections indicate that, with no public health measures, New Brunswick could have had up to 5,600 deaths over the course of the current outbreak. With the public health measures now in place – and adhered to by the public – the number of deaths could range from 550 to 1,750.

“I want to do everything in my power to make sure we keep the numbers as low as possible,” said Premier Blaine Higgs. “Together, we are already taking the steps to make the best-case scenario our reality.”

While there have been no COVID-19 deaths in the province to date, Health Minister Hugh J. Flemming emphasized that the eventual number of deaths is entirely dependent on the efforts that all New Brunswickers take to slow the spread of the virus.

“One death is one too many, but we must be realistic and expect that there will be deaths from COVID-19 in New Brunswick,” said Flemming. “Limiting the number of deaths requires that everyone follow the direction of the chief medical officer of health by staying home and maintaining physical distance from others when you have to go out.”

The pandemic modelling was developed by staff from the Department of Health, Public Health and the regional health authorities. It was inspired by similar modelling released by the governments of British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Quebec and Ontario. The models will be revised as new information is provided during the outbreak.

Facts about the modelling:

The scenarios are based on the experience of northern Italy, as a case where a large impact has been experienced, and on all of Italy, as a medium-impact scenario.
The scenarios show potential outcomes up to April 30, beyond which projections become less reliable.
In the large-impact scenario, New Brunswick could experience up to 132 deaths by the end of April; under the medium-impact scenario, the figure is estimated at 70 deaths. On its current trajectory, with all public health measures now in place and adhered to by the public, New Brunswick could have 15 COVID-19 deaths by April 30.
The projected number of patients hospitalized on April 30, based on the current trajectory, is 28. That number could be as high as 125 under a large-impact scenario.
The number of patients requiring admission to an intensive care unit, currently projected to rise to 13 by the end of the month, could peak at 84 on April 30 under the large-impact scenario.
The province’s health system is preparing for any of these scenarios by securing personal protective equipment for health-care workers, pursuing expanded capacity for COVID-19 testing, and strengthening its ability to trace contacts and respond to potential clusters of the disease as quickly as possible.

Three new cases

Testing at the microbiology laboratory at the Dr. Georges-L.-Dumont Hospital Centre in Moncton has identified three new cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in New Brunswick to 111.

Of the 111 cases, 62 are travel-related, 33 are close contacts of confirmed cases, six are the result of community transmission and 10 remain under investigation.

Ten people have been hospitalized and five have since been discharged. Four of the five patients remaining in hospital are in an intensive care unit.

To date, 53 people have recovered.

The new cases are:

An individual aged up to 10 in Zone 3 (Fredericton region)
An individual aged 30-39 in Zone 3 (Fredericton region)
An individual aged 40-49 in Zone 3 (Fredericton region)
Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, directed New Brunswickers to continue to stay at home, practise physical distancing and maintain good hygiene practices to further slow the spread of the virus.

“The message is simple: keep doing what you are doing,” said Russell. “We cannot afford to let up, even for a moment.”

Applications for income benefit close at 8 p.m.

More than 66,000 applicants have registered for the New Brunswick Workers Emergency Income Benefit.

The one-time $900 benefit was created for workers or self-employed people who have lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 situation. To date, the provincial government has provided more than $27 million in benefit payments.

The purpose of the benefit has been to provide a bridge for those who would be applying for Employment Insurance or the new Canada Emergency Response Benefit. As the federal program began on April 6, the provincial program funding is no longer required.

Applications close today at 8 p.m. and may be completed through the Red Cross, which is administering the program, at 1-800-863-6582. The applications will continue to be processed in the coming days.

Recreational fishing and bear hunting seasons delayed

The Department of Natural Resources and Energy Development has delayed, until at least May 1, the opening of all recreational fishing seasons and the spring bear hunting season due to COVID-19. Fishing season normally begins on April 15 and the spring bear hunt on April 20. 

“As a government, we are committed to doing everything possible to protect our citizens,” said Higgs. “I am a fisherman and I love the outdoors. I know what this means, and I am hopeful conditions will change soon.”  

This decision will be re-evaluated April 30.

It is the opposite. It means you are conveying your love by protecting them.”

Premier Blaine Higgs reminded New Brunswickers they cannot participate in their usual celebrations during this challenging time.

“This long weekend, when you are tempted to visit friends and family, remember our province’s COVID-19 projections – and remember the role you play in keeping those numbers as low as possible,” said Higgs. “By staying at home and practising physical distancing, you are making a difference.”

Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, said that people who want to donate items such as masks, gowns, gloves, hand sanitizer and other personal protective equipment should contact Service New Brunswick, which manages government procurement.

“While we have enough supplies in the health sector to meet the current demand, New Brunswickers have been calling the public health office asking how they can help those working in our hospitals, nursing homes and special care homes to stay safe,” said Russell. “These gestures of generosity are touching.”

Donators will be asked to complete and submit a form detailing specific information on the manufacturer, specifications, and certifications (CSA etc.) of the material to be donated, so it can be determined if the material is free of contamination.

If a donation is accepted, specific instructions for delivery will be provided. Physical distancing will be followed in the drop-off and delivery process.

No new cases

Public Health reported no new cases of COVID-19 today.

Of the 116 cases previously confirmed, 66 are travel-related, 40 are close contacts of confirmed cases, eight are the result of community transmission and two remain under investigation.

During the pandemic, 12 people have been hospitalized and seven have since been discharged. Three of the five patients remaining in hospital are in an intensive care unit.

To date, 75 people have recovered.

“We are definitely moving in the right direction but we have not yet reached our destination,” said Russell. “We must maintain our resolve. We cannot let up, not even for a minute. Please, continue to stay at home as much as you possibly can.”

Stay healthy

Russell encouraged New Brunswickers to keep healthy during the pandemic.

“Routine illnesses can put further strain on an already stressed health-care system,” she said. “Look after yourself by eating healthy food, getting regular exercise and plenty of rest. We need you to be well as we go through this pandemic, and for the recovery that will follow.”

Neighbours helping neighbours

Premier Blaine Higgs stressed the importance of staying connected with family, friends and neighbours during the pandemic.

“Do something that helps someone else and you will feel good at the same time,” said Higgs. “We are all struggling right now, so finding healthy ways to feel good are important.”

Support is available for people who need help to get through this challenging time. On the coronavirus webpage, there is contact information for organizations including the Kids Help Phone, the CHIMO Helpline and community addictions and mental health centres.

Income benefit

The one-time $900 New Brunswick Workers Emergency Income Benefit has been distributed to more than 33,000 people. The benefit was created for workers or self-employed people who have lost their jobs due to the pandemic.

To date, the provincial government has provided more than $30 million in benefit payments.

The benefit was intended to provide a bridge for those who would be applying for Employment Insurance or the new Canada Emergency Response Benefit. Since the federal program began on April 6, applications for the New Brunswick benefit have since closed. Applications which were submitted by the deadline continue to be processed.

But we must not get ahead of ourselves and we must continue to do all that we can to slow the spread of COVID-19.”

Extra-Mural Program  

The Extra-Mural Program provides a unique benefit to the province by offering at-home care to people who might otherwise require hospitalization.

Russell said the program is taking steps to reduce the risk of spreading the virus through its work by providing care remotely, when possible, and screening patients and employees.

“As with any other health-care setting, it is very important that you be truthful with Extra-Mural staff about any symptoms you may be experiencing,” said Russell. “They need to be ready if COVID-19 is potentially present in your home and to have the appropriate protective equipment when they visit.”

Long-term care workers

Premier Blaine Higgs said he will be exploring further an announcement by the federal government to supplement the salaries of essential workers, including those employed at long-term care facilities, who earn less than $2,500 per month.   

“We have not received a lot of detail on how this program would work or how many – if any – New Brunswick workers will qualify,” said Higgs. “We believe that our front-line workers deserve all the support they can get, and I look forward to speaking with the other premiers, as well as the prime minister and the deputy prime minister, to learn more about this program.”

State of emergency extended to April 30

Premier Blaine Higgs announced that the declaration of emergency under the Emergency Measures Act was formally extended today. A state of emergency was declared on March 19, however such declarations expire after 14 days unless extended by the lieutenant-governor in council. Both cabinet and the all-party cabinet committee have approved the extension.

“We will extend the declaration every 14 days until we are confident we do not need the emergency powers to impose restrictions to slow the spread of this infection,” said Higgs.

Some parts of the emergency order have also been clarified to ensure that residents and business owners understand what they can and cannot do. For example, the government clarified that restaurants offering take-out must ensure physical distancing of customers who are on the premises waiting for their food, and that property owners must take steps to prevent gatherings.

“We have been listening closely to the feedback of New Brunswickers throughout this evolving situation,” said Higgs. “We have received a number of requests for changes to the emergency order that could make life a little bit easier during these difficult times.  However, there are some requests that we still cannot accommodate because the goal of keeping New Brunswickers safe and healthy must remain our top priority.”  

The latest version of the declaration is available online.

Gardening and agricultural retailers to reopen

Since gardening and agricultural retailers are an important part of the food supply, Higgs announced that this sector will be allowed to reopen starting today.      

“In the weeks ahead, we will look for other adjustments,” said Higgs. “We are all keen to help our businesses recover, and we want New Brunswickers to begin to return to some of their normal activities.”

Public drug plans

Higgs addressed the issue of medical coverage under New Brunswick’s public drug plans. He said the government encourages all pharmacists to remove the extra dispensing and co-pay fees associated with the new limits of prescription refills.  

More flexible rules for restaurant owners

Higgs also announced that, for the duration of the state of emergency and at the request of restaurant owners, restaurants with a licence will be allowed to sell liquor off their menu for take-out or delivery. Owners will also need to ensure they do not sell liquor to minors.     

Closed borders and cottage owners

The government is asking non-residential cottage owners from outside the province to be patient and not to visit their cottage in the coming weeks.

“We understand that there are numerous enthusiastic users of off-road vehicles eager to practise their sport in various regions of the province, and we appreciate the work of Quad NB in the development of this sport,” said Urquhart. “However, it is premature to allow such activities.”

The mandatory order states, in paragraph eight, that every owner and occupier of any building or land on which people may gather must take all reasonable steps to prevent gatherings, and to ensure that people on their premises do not come within two metres of each other.

“We know that the majority of trail users are safety-minded and respectful of the rules, but we also know that it would be impossible to ensure that people stay two-metres from each other and not gather in groups along the thousands of kilometres of trails,” said Urquhart. “Keeping New Brunswickers safe and healthy must remain our top priority, not only for the provincial government, but for all organizations in this province. By working together, we will succeed in slowing the spread of the COVID-19.”

Of the 117 cases previously confirmed, 66 are travel-related, 42 are close contacts of confirmed cases and nine are the result of community transmission.

During the pandemic, 13 people have been hospitalized and seven have since been discharged. Three of the six patients remaining in hospital are in an intensive care unit.

To date, 80 people have recovered.

Dr. Jennifer Russell, the province’s chief medical officer of health, said these results are encouraging but she urged New Brunswickers to continue to stay home as much as possible and practise physical distancing when they do have to go out.

“We must not lose focus,” said Russell. “We need to maintain the barriers to the spread of infection that we have built over the last month. We cannot take a break from these actions. They remain very important in protecting the health of all New Brunswickers.”

Russell praised the work of Public Health teams that are engaged in contact-tracing to slow the spread of the virus. Community-based teams administered by the regional health authorities are working with the Department of Health to determine and limit the spread.

Russell stressed that public co-operation is needed to ensure that contact tracing is effective. She urged New Brunswickers to closely follow directions from Public Health if they have been in contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19.

State of emergency extended to April 30

Premier Blaine Higgs announced that the declaration of emergency under the Emergency Measures Act was formally extended today. A state of emergency was declared on March 19, however such declarations expire after 14 days unless extended by the lieutenant-governor in council. Both cabinet and the all-party cabinet committee have approved the extension.

“We will extend the declaration every 14 days until we are confident we do not need the emergency powers to impose restrictions to slow the spread of this infection,” said Higgs.

Some parts of the emergency order have also been clarified to ensure that residents and business owners understand what they can and cannot do. For example, the government clarified that restaurants offering take-out must ensure physical distancing of customers who are on the premises waiting for their food, and that property owners must take steps to prevent gatherings.

“We have been listening closely to the feedback of New Brunswickers throughout this evolving situation,” said Higgs. “We have received a number of requests for changes to the emergency order that could make life a little bit easier during these difficult times.  However, there are some requests that we still cannot accommodate because the goal of keeping New Brunswickers safe and healthy must remain our top priority.”  

The latest version of the declaration is available online.

Gardening and agricultural retailers to reopen

Since gardening and agricultural retailers are an important part of the food supply, Higgs announced that this sector will be allowed to reopen starting today.      

“In the weeks ahead, we will look for other adjustments,” said Higgs. “We are all keen to help our businesses recover, and we want New Brunswickers to begin to return to some of their normal activities.”

Public drug plans

Higgs addressed the issue of medical coverage under New Brunswick’s public drug plans. He said the government encourages all pharmacists to remove the extra dispensing and co-pay fees associated with the new limits of prescription refills.  

More flexible rules for restaurant owners

Higgs also announced that, for the duration of the state of emergency and at the request of restaurant owners, restaurants with a licence will be allowed to sell liquor off their menu for take-out or delivery. Owners will also need to ensure they do not sell liquor to minors.     

Closed borders and cottage owners

The government is asking non-residential cottage owners from outside the province to be patient and not to visit their cottage in the coming weeks.

“I appreciate that some individuals have chosen to make New Brunswick their second home,” said Higgs. “But right now, due to the situation we are all in, I ask them to remain in their primary province of residence. In the weeks ahead, we will reassess the situation.”",Government of New Brunswick,,One new case of COVID-19; 87 people have recovered,https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/news/news_release.2020.04.0213.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, 92 people have recovered. As of today, 10,742 tests have been conducted.

“It is encouraging to see this slow growth in the number of confirmed cases,” said Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health. “It is only natural to wonder if this indicates an end to the outbreak. But we must not get ahead of ourselves and we must continue to do all that we can to slow the spread of COVID-19.”

Premier Blaine Higgs said he is proud of how most people have followed the directives of Public Health and done their part to slow the spread of the virus.

“This experience is new to us and New Brunswickers have risen to the challenges we have faced, showing both resilience and caring,” said Higgs. “Thanks to the quick action of all of us, overall, we have fared well as a province.”

Higgs said, while fighting the outbreak and keeping people safe have been the main focuses to date, the government has begun to think about what recovery will look like once the virus is contained.

“When the time comes to return to a more normal way of life, we will need to do so gradually,” said Higgs. “People will return to work and businesses will open, but this will not happen overnight. It is important that we go at the appropriate pace to help shield New Brunswick as much as possible from the economic impacts of this pandemic, while continuing to keep everyone safe and healthy.”

Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, said patience and vigilance are still required to further slow the spread of the virus.

“Make no mistake – this pandemic is not over, in this province or anywhere else in the world,” said Russell. “We must remain on our guard and keep doing what has gotten us to this stage. That means continuing to stay at home, in your own home, as much as possible.”

We must continue to follow the directives of Public Health.”

Kearl Lake work site

Russell reported on a recent COVID-19 outbreak at an oil sands work site at Kearl Lake, Alberta, north of Fort McMurray. The outbreak has been linked to cases in British Columbia and Saskatchewan, where workers from the site returned home.

Russell urged any New Brunswickers who have recently been at Kearl Lake, or have had close contact with anyone recently working there, to self-isolate for 14 days as per travel instructions and call 811 for further instructions.

“Even if you feel well and are showing no symptoms, you may still be carrying the virus and may infect others around you,” said Russell.

Secure web portal for COVID-19 test results                     

With support from Canada Health Infoway, the provincial government has set up a secure web portal to enable eligible New Brunswickers to obtain faster access to their COVID-19 test results. This website will provide information to those who have been tested at an assessment centre. It can be accessed through the MyHealthNB website.

Effective today, those who have been tested for the virus at an assessment site will be given a registration code for the website. This code will enable them to check for results as soon as their tests have been processed, usually within 48 hours.

“With this new portal, patients will be able to access their test results faster from the safety of their home,” said Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health. “The quicker access to test results will relieve some of the stress associated with the testing process and enable those with positive tests to take immediate actions to protect the health of their family and community.”

If a test is confirmed as positive, the site will provide information on self-isolation and directions on how to prevent further spread of the virus. The site will also indicate if the person’s test is confirmed as negative or inconclusive.

Those with positive results will be contacted by Public Health, which will monitor the person’s condition through followup calls.  

Support for non-profit groups

The provincial government added a new category under the Community Investment Fund to support non-profit groups affected by COVID-19.

This funding will provide eligible small to medium-sized non-profits with grants between $500 and $10,000.

“New Brunswick’s non-profits and community groups play an important role in building vibrant communities, and they will help us rebuild our economy following this pandemic,” said Premier Blaine Higgs. “This assistance is designed to address gaps within the existing support being made available by the federal government.”

The application form and program information can be found online.

Interprovincial border restrictions remain in place

Higgs said, although the number of cases in New Brunswick remains low, the province is still vulnerable to further spread from other provinces and people need to remain diligent.

“We are still surrounded by COVID-19,” said Higgs. “Because of this, we can expect that our borders may remain closed for some time. If you have been outside the province for any reason and any amount of time, you must still self-isolate for 14 days.”

Recovery planning

New Brunswick’s recovery from the pandemic will be discussed this week at the all-party cabinet committee meeting.

“We must reopen our communities and our province methodically, and gradually, to ensure we do not set ourselves back,” said Higgs.

Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, said the test results continue to be encouraging. But she urged New Brunswickers to practise physical distancing when they go out.

Continued adherence to these practices will help prevent the re-emergence of the virus, she said.

“This is not the end,” Russell said. “I ask that you continue to observe the restrictions set under the provincial state of emergency and continue to take precautions against the spread of the virus, even when those restrictions have been eased.”

Ramadan celebrations

Russell reminded New Brunswick’s Muslim community that communal meals traditionally held to break the daily fast during the holy month of Ramadan are not permitted under the current state of emergency. Only gatherings of people currently sharing a home are permitted. She suggested Muslims participate in online events that will allow them to safely practise the tenets of their faith.

Assistance to help families stay connected

The provincial government is providing nursing homes with iPads to help residents stay in contact with loved ones. Each nursing home will be provided with one iPad for each 10 residents, for a total of about 480 tablets.

The government is working with BrunNet Inc., which will be responsible for delivering the tablets to nursing homes and for providing support as needed regarding their use.

In addition, to maximize the use of the tablets, each will be equipped with a virtual care application. This feature will enable physicians to provide care to residents remotely.

“We are very pleased to announce this initiative,” said Premier Blaine Higgs.” We understand how difficult it is for nursing home residents to be cut off from their families. We hope this will give residents and staff a great option to help keep families as close as possible under the circumstances.

“Our government will explore more ways it can use these tablets to improve the lives of nursing home residents,” said Higgs. “This is just one way we are using technology to our advantage during the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Toll-free line

The toll-free information line which was set up to help answer non-health related questions, including questions about compliance with the state of emergency, has been useful. Early statistics from Service New Brunswick show that more than 8,000 calls to this line have been responded to since its launch on March 23.

The number, 1-844-462-8387, offers services in both languages and is operational seven days a week from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The email address is helpaide@gnb.ca.

Depending upon the nature of the query, a caller may be directed to resources such as Opportunities NB’s Business Navigator or to WorkSafeNB. Complaints about non-compliance with the state of emergency are referred to law enforcement agencies for further review.

High level of compliance

Higgs said he is pleased to see that New Brunswickers are complying with the state of emergency order, as only in a very small number of cases has enforcement been required. As of April 20, 29 tickets had been issued across the province for violations of the order.

“The level of co-operation across New Brunswick, from law enforcement officials to the individuals patiently waiting in line at the grocery stores, is amazing,” said Higgs. “New Brunswick is on the right track and thanks to everyone’s co-operation we anticipate that we will be able to reduce some of the restrictions under the emergency order very soon.”

Open fires prohibited

New Brunswickers are reminded that under the emergency order, all open fires are prohibited until May 1. Conditions across the province vary. Even after receiving significant amounts of rain, grasslands dry very quickly and become extremely flammable. Under these conditions, a fire can spread quickly.

The ban on open fires applies to any burning where combustion products are not vented through a stack or chimney. It does not apply to stoves and barbecues that burn gaseous material or briquettes or to CSA-approved outdoor fireplaces.

“My advice to New Brunswickers has been clear and consistent since the pandemic began and it will not change in the weeks ahead,” said Russell. “Let’s not lose the advantage we have built over the last six weeks.”

Recovery plan on the way

Premier Blaine Higgs said the provincial government will present a recovery plan in the coming days.

“Recovery is not as easy as flipping a light switch,” said Higgs. “We have to be strategic and make sure that the government, daycares, businesses, restaurants and shops can operate with the necessary precautions to ensure the health and safety of their employees and customers. I caution everyone that recovery comes with risks and we need to minimize those risks.”

Removal of the 30-day limit on prescription drugs

The 30-day limit on prescription drugs will be eliminated for drugs where shortages do not exist. In some cases, the limit had resulted in people paying additional dispensing fees and co-payments.

“We realize this is a difficult decision, but in light of the unprecedented circumstances we are in, we strongly believe this is the right one,” said Higgs. “We are taking this action to ensure that our vulnerable population is not put in a position where they have to choose among paying for their medication, buying groceries, or paying their rent.”

However, the government will create a working group which will identify those drugs which could experience a shortage and put in place a 30-day supply limitation if necessary in order to protect the supply.

Higgs praised pharmacists in the province for their co-operation and collaboration with this complex issue.

“During this difficult time, pharmacists have played an important role in our communities as essential front-line workers,” said Higgs. “Our government understands that pharmacists want to ensure residents have the medications they need. We share the same concerns and that is why we will create this working group to keep a close eye on the drug supply, and to identify any anticipated drug shortages.”

“In these extraordinary times, I thank the other leaders, and Dr. Russell and her team for their unprecedented collaboration,” said Higgs. “To date, we have been able to manage a very difficult situation. The fact that over the past few days there have been no new cases is cause for measured optimism. I must say our success to date can largely be attributed to the ability of this group to put partisan politics aside and put New Brunswick first. Everyone in the province is focused on the same goal, whether they work in the departments of health, public safety or other frontline services, or whether they are at home doing their part by physical distancing. Your success thus far has made the next step possible.”

“We are fortunate that we have the lowest number of COVID-19 cases per capita of any province in Canada” said Vickers. “We are thankful for the exceptional work of Dr. Russell, our public health officials, our front-line workers and all those who have played a role in supporting New Brunswickers through this difficult time. We are all anxious to have businesses back up and running and to returning to the activities and social interactions we enjoyed prior to this health crisis. It is imperative, however, that we follow the guidelines and direction of Public Health laid out in the recovery plan. Let's all continue to do our part to protect ourselves, our families and our fellow residents. Stay safe.”

“New Brunswick has been a national leader in the COVID-19 fight with the fewest cases per capita in the country which is a testament to how bi-partisan cooperation works in the best interest of the people,” said Austin. “I believe it is now time to begin to re-open the economy while adhering to strict guidelines to prevent the spread and keeping our borders locked down to non-essential travel”

“I am so proud of everyone for their commitment to keep each other safe, secure and healthy,” said Coon. “Together, we have written the first chapter in the story of our fight against COVID-19. We will need that same dedication to take care of each other as we begin chapter two, particularly to look after the vulnerable and those most affected by the consequences of the pandemic.”

The plan to re-open businesses, educational facilities, the health-care system, recreational activities, and cultural events will be guided by four distinct public health alert levels:

Red: This is the present phase aimed at flattening the curve and containing the virus as quickly as possible.
Orange: The goal of this phase is to balance the reopening of social and economic settings while preventing a resurgence of transmission.
Yellow: The goal of this phase is to further increase the reopening of social and economic settings after the ability to control transmission has been demonstrated.
Green: This phase will likely come after a vaccine is available or more is learned about how to protect people from the virus.
The phased plan will allow health experts to monitor and evaluate the impact of the lifting of restrictions. At any time, restrictions that have been lifted may quickly be reinstated to protect public health. Restrictions may be put in place based on provincial, regional or local circumstances such as unlinked community outbreaks or cases that cannot be traced.

“We will continue to carefully monitor COVID-19 in the province. This includes testing and tracing,” said Russell. ""New Brunswickers must continue following public health measures. Even as we begin to remove restrictions, you will be required to continue to practise physical distancing and good hygiene.”

As a first step, the following will be allowed effective today:

Two-household bubbles: Households may now choose to spend time with one other household, if both households agree. The selection made is not interchangeable.
Golf courses and driving ranges: If all physical distancing and safety measures are in place, golf courses and driving ranges can now open.
Recreational fishing and hunting: The delay on springs seasons has been lifted.
Outdoor spaces: With physical distancing, people can now enjoy the outdoors including parks and beaches.
Carpooling: Co-workers or neighbours can carpool if physical distancing measures are maintained by transporting the passenger in the backseat.
Post-secondary education: Students requiring access to campus to fulfill their course requirements will be able to do so.
Outdoor religious services: As an alternative to online worship, religious organizations can hold outdoor services if parishioners stay in their vehicles that are two metres apart.
A guidance document of the public health measures during the recovery phases is being developed and will be available soon.

“We want every day to be like today, where we have no new positive cases,” said Russell. “It has been a week and I hope we can continue that trend.”

People should wear non-medical masks, also referred to as community face masks, when physical distancing may not be possible, such as in a grocery store or at a pharmacy.

“Some stores have indicated they may require customers to wear community face masks, so it is good to have one with you,” said Russell. “Make sure the mask is clean and dry and do not touch it while wearing it. Wash it after using it and do not share it with others.”

Premier Blaine Higgs said the recovery phase, which began on Friday, should not be taken lightly.

“We are opening the door slightly and we want to continue to loosen restrictions,” said Higgs. “However, we need to be vigilant during this phase and follow the directives of Public Health. Otherwise we will have to bring back more stringent restrictions.”

A guidance document, which is available online, outlines health measures for the general public and businesses, service providers and organizations that have been permitted to open during the first phase of recovery.

Restrictions that have been eased may be reinstated at any time to protect public health.

“We are starting to see hopeful and encouraging signs, but that does not erase the reality that this virus remains out there,” said Higgs. “You still need to continue to practise physical distancing and hand-washing. You can expect to see some people wearing masks in public, limits on the number of people in a store, and surfaces being regularly cleaned. This is how we will keep New Brunswickers safe and healthy.”

The number of confirmed cases in New Brunswick is 118, the number of active cases is six, and 112 people have recovered. Three people remain hospitalized, and there are no patients in an intensive care unit.

The latest updates and information on confirmed COVID-19 cases and laboratory testing in New Brunswick are available online.

Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, said that while testing results remain encouraging, real success against the COVID-19 virus will be measured by New Brunswick’s ability to manage new outbreaks as they occur.

“Let me be clear, we are nowhere near ready to declare victory over the COVID-19 virus,” Russell said. “We will continue to have cases during the recovery phase. Success is not merely the absence of new cases. Success is knowing how many cases we really have, how widespread the disease has become, and that we are able to manage it so that our health-care system is not overwhelmed.”

Russell urged New Brunswickers to continue to watch for symptoms of COVID-19 which include fever, cough, sore throat, running nose, and headache, and to call 811 and seek testing if symptoms emerge.

She also stressed the importance of continuing appropriate hygiene practices, maintaining physical distance from others and strongly recommended masks when physical distancing or other barriers are not possible.

Large gatherings still not allowed

Premier Blaine Higgs reminded New Brunswickers that although the province has entered into an early phase of recovery, several rules remain in place.

It is now possible for families and neighbours to visit another household unit, or “bubble.” Both households must mutually agree to only get together with one another. Individuals must limit their gatherings to these two households only.

Golf courses, driving ranges, beaches and parks can now open, as long as physical distancing and safety measures are in place. All public playgrounds are still off limits, including those in municipal parks, provincial parks and at schools.

Team sports, motorcycle gatherings and any gatherings of vehicles are still not allowed at this time. Driving ATVs is permitted, however, trails are not yet open.

“We are pleased that we were able to lessen the restrictions,” said Higgs. “However, we remind everyone that this is not a free-for-all. New Brunswickers are still not allowed to participate in large gatherings. If we want to continue to move forward, following the rules that are still in place is more important now than ever before.”

Law enforcement

Law enforcement agencies are still focusing on educating the public whenever possible, but tickets are being issued when necessary.

In the past week, 22 tickets were issued. A total of 77 tickets have been issued since the state of emergency was declared.

“Ticketing people is a last resort,” said Higgs. “But we will continue to issue them as long as people break the rules. If we all continue to follow the rules, we will be able to enjoy even fewer restrictions in the weeks and months to come.”

Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, announced that new symptoms are being added to the list that determines when a COVID-19 test is administered.

“If you or anyone in your family is experiencing any two of the symptoms, please call 811 and follow their directions,” said Russell. “You may be referred for testing and will be asked to self-isolate until your test results are known. People with positive results will be contacted by Public Health, which will monitor the person’s condition through follow-up calls.”

The new symptoms are:

a new onset of fatigue;
a new onset of muscle pain;
diarrhea;
loss of sense of taste or loss of sense of smell; and
in children, purple markings on the fingers or toes.
These symptoms are in addition to:

fever above 38°C;

Russell noted that in the case of children with purple markings on their fingers or toes, testing will be done even if none of the other symptoms are present.

“It is crucial that we do more testing at this stage, and with a broader range of symptoms,” said Russell. “This list of symptoms covers our current knowledge of the signs of COVID-19. As we continually learn more about the virus, and as symptoms are confirmed, they will be added to our testing protocols.”

Priority in processing tests will continue to be given to those most vulnerable to the disease, including patients in hospitals and residents of nursing homes and special care homes.

Priority will also be given to those working in the health-care sector, including doctors, nurses, paramedics and staff in health-care institutions.

Temporary foreign workers restricted from entering province

The provincial government has updated its mandatory order under the state of emergency to restrict temporary foreign workers from entering New Brunswick.

Premier Blaine Higgs said with so many serious outbreaks of COVID-19 in surrounding jurisdictions, the province’s borders must remain closed for now.

“Under normal circumstances, we welcome foreign temporary workers as they play an important role in New Brunswick’s continued economic growth,” said Higgs. “But right now, the risk of allowing more people to enter the province is simply too great.”

This restriction does not affect the status of temporary foreign workers currently in the province.

Rules for post-secondary education students who are moving

With the conclusion of the academic year for students attending universities and community colleges, the following rules are in place for students and anyone helping them to move their belongings in and out of the province:

People may enter New Brunswick for a period of not more than 24 hours to remove belongings from a students’ residence. They are expected to isolate themselves as best as possible while in the province.
Staying longer than 24 hours is considered remaining in the province and the 14-day self- isolation period would apply. Before traveling to New Brunswick, people should check with their home province to see if further restrictions may be applied upon their returning home.
Anyone leaving New Brunswick for any length of time to remove belongings from a residence in another province is ordered, upon their return, to self-isolate for 14 days and follow the directions of public health officials.

Recovery plan phases are flexible

The province’s recently announced recovery plan contains public health alert levels that outline when various sectors will reopen and when certain activities will be permitted.

New Brunswick is transitioning to the orange phase, which is aimed at reopening social and economic settings while preventing a resurgence of transmission.

Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, urged New Brunswickers to continue to maintain physical distancing and appropriate hygiene practices as the province gradually moves toward reopening.

“The phase we are now entering will be, in many respects, more difficult than what we have been through so far,” said Russell. “Whether we are as successful in the next six months as we have been in the last six weeks depends entirely on you. Your actions, now more than ever, will determine what happens next.”

Premier Blaine Higgs reminded New Brunswickers that the pandemic is evolving constantly and that people must be prepared to be flexible and adjust their behaviour as needed.

“We may be able to loosen restrictions on one type of business or activity included in a certain stage while still restricting other activities that are part of the same level,” said Higgs. “This pandemic is a new experience for all of us. Things are changing every day and we are learning as we go.”

Restrictions that have been eased may be reinstated at any time to protect public health.

Helping businesses with reopening planning

Businesses that might be allowed to reopen in the weeks and months ahead are looking at how to adjust their operations, so they can conduct business safely.

“I know business owners want to do the right thing and operate safely once they are allowed to reopen,” said Higgs. “Each sector is going to have unique needs and requirements that will involve planning and activating new operational requirements.”

Businesses are encouraged to review the Guidance Document of General Public Health Measures during COVID-19 Recovery, which includes pre-screening tools, signage templates and other information.

Engagement sessions with specific sectors are being developed. These sessions will allow business owners to hear directly from officials at Public Health, WorkSafeNB and relevant government departments.

Opportunities NB will issue a webinar on May 8 about economic recovery. It will feature an expert panel providing tips and answers to common questions that businesses might have as they get ready to reopen.  

Temporary foreign workers

Higgs said that, throughout this pandemic, the provincial government has acted with an abundance of caution, which has allowed New Brunswick to fare much better than other jurisdictions where less restrictive policies have been used.

“The decision to restrict temporary foreign workers from entering the province was made to protect the health and safety of New Brunswickers,” said Higgs. “We must continue to exercise caution. To do otherwise puts us all at risk of contracting COVID-19.”  

Higgs said steps will be taken to help affected businesses. They include:

Exploring opportunities to fill vacant positions by recruiting from the 30,000 post-secondary students; 7,000 Grade 12 students about to graduate; and tens of thousands of unemployed people who have been displaced by COVID-19.
Looking for ways to employ temporary foreign workers who are already in the province and have also been affected by this pandemic.
Exploring the possibility of redeploying or calling back unemployed casual or seasonal workers from government departments to work in the fishery and agriculture sectors.

The regulation also provides job protection for employees who cannot report to work because they are caring for their children due to school or daycare closures.

“We want to minimize the pressure on workers and protect their jobs during the pandemic,” said Post-Secondary Education, Training and Labour Minister Trevor Holder. “This is another measure we are taking to help ensure the health and safety of workers and workplaces.”

Employees must request this emergency leave from their employers, in writing, as soon as possible. The request must include the reason for the leave, the anticipated start date and the duration of the leave.

Employers are not required to pay employees while they are on a leave due to COVID-19.

Details on job protection for workers are available online.

Job protection provisions are not related to Employment Insurance (EI), and one does not necessarily influence the other. Questions about EI benefits can be directed to the federal government.

No new cases and no active cases in hospital

Public Health reports no new cases of COVID-19 today. The number of confirmed cases in New Brunswick remains at 118; the number of active cases is four and 114 people have recovered. None of the active cases are in hospital.

The latest updates and information on confirmed COVID-19 cases and laboratory testing in New Brunswick are available online.

Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, said the government will continue to move cautiously in its recovery plan, to give businesses, workers, the health-care system and the public enough time to adjust to the “new normal.”

“It is very likely that New Brunswick will see COVID-19 cases in the coming weeks and months,” said Russell. “Preparations must be made for a second wave of infections that may strike later in the year. Other jurisdictions have learned a painful lesson about the cost of rushing back to normalcy. I want us to learn from their experiences.”

Support available to businesses and workers

WorkingNB services are available to any New Brunswick employer or job-seeker looking for support. Staff are available to provide services over the phone, and more options will be available in the near future.

“We know that, to have an environment where businesses and New Brunswickers can get back on track and thrive, we need to start re-energizing our private sector,” said Holder. “Our WorkingNB offices are a valuable piece of that puzzle for employers and job-seekers.”

Businesses with human resource challenges, including with recruitment, retention or training, can contact WorkingNB for support through a workforce consultant.

Workers seeking career or training opportunities can connect with an employment counsellor at WorkingNB. Counsellors can help clients identify career goals and connect them to the labour market through training and employment opportunities.

Staff will also be working with municipalities and economic development agencies to help address community challenges.

More information about WorkingNB is available online.

State of emergency extended

The provincial government renewed the state of emergency today under the authority of the Emergency Measures Act.

Revisions made to the order include:

All licences, registrations, certificates and permits issued under provincial laws that were valid as of March 16, previously extended to May 31, have been extended again to June 30. Many renewals can be done online at www.snb.ca.
A new paragraph has been added to authorize municipal councils and council committees to hold more meetings electronically. The Local Governance Act normally limits councillors’ participation electronically rather than in person.
The latest version of the order, which extends to May 14, is available online.

Job-matching platform to be created

On May 4, the government will launch a virtual job-matching platform to connect New Brunswickers with positions that, in the past, have been filled by temporary foreign workers.

It is anticipated there will be up to 600 jobs in sectors such as agriculture and aquaculture.

Two-household bubble

Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, reminded New Brunswickers to keep extended contact to two households only. She said a “two-household bubble” will safely allow greater contact among people, but only if direct contact is strictly limited between the two groups.

“It is very important to stay in your bubble – one household unit joined with another household unit – and avoid the temptation to go beyond it,” said Russell. “If you have matched up with a family friend or relation, neither group can form a bubble with anyone else. This sets up the potential for a chain of contagion where infection could be passed between groups. The potential consequences of this could be tragic.”

Border restrictions remain in place

Under the province’s state of emergency mandatory order, border restrictions remain in place.

“We need people outside the province to understand that New Brunswick is closed to unnecessary travel,” said Premier Blaine Higgs. “Travellers who are trying to enter for non-essential reasons are being turned away. These steps are necessary to keep New Brunswickers safe.”

Nearing two weeks of no new cases

New Brunswick has gone 13 consecutive days without a new case of COVID-19.

“Some may think we no longer have to worry about the virus,” said Higgs. “We are still vulnerable. We are surrounded by COVID-19 and, though we are doing our best to keep New Brunswickers safe, we are still at risk.”

Russell emphasized the continued importance of testing for the virus and urged those experiencing symptoms to call 811 and follow directions given by Public Health.

“We have come a long way, but we still have a long way to go,” said Russell. “By continuing to support each other we will maintain the success we have built together.”

Premier Blaine Higgs welcomed the positive news and said the province was able to reach this significant milestone by following the advice from public health.

“I thank everyone, the frontline workers, essential workers, public safety employees and all New Brunswickers for helping us reach this milestone,” said Higgs. “Of course, we did not win the war yet and this victory may be short-lived. But what is important is that we find the balance between returning to a new normal while still staying on guard and protecting the health of our residents.”

Weekend gatherings

Higgs said New Brunswickers must continue to keep their distance from each other even though the government has removed several restrictions for outside activities such as golfing, fishing and gardening.

“May is a synonym for warmer days and New Brunswickers are absolutely right to spend time outside. This is not only because the weather is nice but also because it is important for their mental health,” said Higgs. “We encourage everyone to safely enjoy our province’s beautiful outdoor spaces as long as they keep a two-metre distance from others.”

Higgs also reminded the public that members of a household are only allowed to spend time with one other household. He said they cannot pick and choose different households and relatives to visit.

“We know everyone is excited about spending time with their loved ones and we are pleased we were able to loosen the restrictions,” added Higgs. “However, people must not take advantage of this less restrictive phase. If individuals start attending gatherings that extend beyond their two-household bubble right now, we could begin to see a resurgence of cases of COVID-19.”

Riverwatch

The New Brunswick Emergency Measures Organization reminds residents to be aware of rising water levels over the coming days and of the potential for a minor impact in the Saint John River watershed. Those living near waterways are encouraged to take appropriate precautions.

New Brunswickers are asked to stay off the waterways at this time as the water is cold, levels are high, currents are strong and could be carrying debris.

The number of confirmed cases in New Brunswick remains at 118 but all affected individuals have recovered.

Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health, said that with the onset of better weather, it remains important to follow Public Health’s recommendations on bubbling.

“As we begin the third week of no new COVID-19 cases, I recognize families want to get outside and spend more time together,” said Russell. “But it is crucial that everyone adheres to the rule about two households bubbling only with each other. Also, when outside, it is important to continue to practise physical distancing.”

“I would also strongly urge New Brunswickers to get tested if they have any two of the symptoms, even if those symptoms are mild,” she said.

Testing protocols for COVID-19 have recently expanded. If you or a member of your family are showing two of the following symptoms, contact Tele-Care 811 for further direction:

fever above 38°C;
a new cough or worsening chronic cough;
sore throat;
runny nose;
headache;
a new onset of fatigue;
a new onset of muscle pain;
diarrhea;
loss of sense of taste or loss of sense of smell; and
in children, purple markings on the fingers or toes.

Cautious optimism

Premier Blaine Higgs said New Brunswick has been a leader in the fight against COVID-19 on many levels. Residents listened to the advice of Public Health, stayed home, washed their hands frequently and respected physical distancing, all of which contributed to the positive results the province is now reporting, he said.

“We have been able to manage a very difficult situation with positive results so far, and the fact that we are now entering the third week with no new cases is cause for cautious optimism,” said Higgs. “But we must remain diligent in our efforts to keep New Brunswickers safe and healthy. Throughout our country and in neighbouring jurisdictions there are new COVID-19 cases, and sadly deaths, daily. We must stay on guard and take precautions until a vaccine is found.”

Higgs said that if New Brunswick continues on this path, residents will see fewer restrictions in the weeks ahead as the province moves into the next phase of economic recovery.

“We have come a long way, but we are still vulnerable,” said Higgs. “We expect to have more cases. Our province is still under a state of emergency, and we must continue to follow the advice of Public Health.”

Last week, NLESD cancelled tours planned for Northern Italy. The district has now extended cancellations to all European destinations until the end of April.

This is a difficult but necessary decision, which I fully support, to protect students and staff from risk of exposure and the possibility of quarantine while overseas, or self-quarantine upon their return to the province. The department and district continue to monitor other planned tours and these may also be cancelled as the situation evolves.

We appreciate the continued advice and collaboration from our provincial public health officials, including the province’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, who supports a low-risk approach.

We are also working with the school districts and public health officials to raise awareness about the importance of proper hygiene and handwashing practices to help reduce the risk of transmission. While there have been no reported cases of the virus in our province to date, we must be prepared.

Information will be distributed to schools and there is information specifically on hygiene available on the Department of Health and Community’s website.

March 14, 2020 In light of the ongoing and rapidly evolving situation regarding COVID-19, and in consultation with Dr. Janice Fitzgerald, Chief Medical Officer of Health for Newfoundland and Labrador, starting today anyone returning after travelling outside the country is required to self-isolate for a period of 14 days upon their return to Canada. This follows the advice that the Federal Government provided on Friday, March 13. Children who have travelled with their parents must also self-isolate for 14 days, rather than returning to school or daycare.

The Provincial Government will provide compensation to private sector employers to ensure continuation of pay for employees affected by this decision. Details on the required documentation and processes for reimbursement to private sector employers will be released in the coming days. Employees should retain documents regarding their travel (such as boarding passes) to facilitate reimbursement.

Provincial public sector employees affected by this decision will continue to be paid as usual.

Only those individuals who are scheduled to return to work within this period will be compensated. Anyone travelling outside of the country after today’s date will do so against public health advice, and will not be eligible for this compensation.

Any public service employee who enters self-isolation who has the ability to work from home is expected to do so.

Anyone who has travelled and returned to work prior to today’s announcement should continue working unless they begin showing symptoms, at which point they should self-isolate and contact 811 for further information.

We will continue to monitor and where necessary implement protocols required to contain the virus. For the most up-to-date information related to confirmed cases of COVID-19, please visit www.gov.nl.ca/covid-19.

Two of the new cases are in the Eastern Health region, while one is in the Western Health region, bringing the province's total number of cases to 247.

Dr. Janice Fitzgerald, the province's chief medical officer of health, said the cause of one of the three new cases is still under investigation, one is as a result from travelling and one is as a result of contact with a traveller. 

Fitzgerald said effective Thursday the province is broadening its testing criteria for the virus.

Anyone with two or more symptoms such as a fever — or signs of a fever, which include chills, sweats, muscle aches or light-headedness — a cough, headache, sore throat or a runny nose can be tested. 

Watch the full April 15 update:


Previously, anyone with two or more symptoms would have to have travelled, or have had contact with a positive case or a health-care worker before meeting criteria for testing.

""If it is recommended that you be tested, you will be required to self-isolate,"" Fitzgerald said during Wednesday's COVID-19 update.

""If your test comes back negative you will still be required to continue to self-isolate until 24 hours after your symptoms have resolved.""

As testing begins to cover more of the population under the new criteria, so too does the possibility of positive tests showing up negative. Fitzgerald said it has happened already, but only because the person, or people, were too early into having caught the virus. 

""We have had some cases that have initially tested negative and then subsequently tested positive. And that may be related to the fact that when we tested initially it was a little bit too early in the course of the disease to actually pick up enough of the virus to have a positive test,"" she said.

""That is why we have recommended testing only symptomatic people because we know that when people are symptomatic they are more likely to be shedding adequate amounts of that virus to be able to be detected on a test."" 


Test results can be accessed on the Newfoundland and Labrador government website. It can take up to five days for test results to appear online.

Fitzgerald said the new testing criteria are to catch as many cases as possible as cases stemming from the so-called ""Caul's cluster"" begin to dwindle. She said in looking at the evidence now is a good time to expand testing.

'A source of great relief'

Health Minister John Haggie said more test kits have been ""dribbling in"" among other essential personal protective equipment items. Haggie said a company in New Brunswick will soon be capable of producing the reagents required for COVID-19 testing for the entire country.

A mask in a bank is no longer what it used to be.
- John Haggie
""That is certainly a source of great relief to all of us and it's an example of how private industry, entrepreneurial spirit, research and public need have all come together at the right time,"" Haggie said.

The rate of testing per 100,000 people in Newfoundland and Labrador sits at 458 in Central Health, 1,239 in Eastern Health, 840 in Labrador-Grenfell Health and 531 in Western Health. The higher level for Eastern Health is due to the large outbreak and contact tracing, Haggie said.

By region 229 cases have been found in Eastern Health, eight in Central Health, four in Western Health and six in Labrador-Grenfell Health.

As of Wednesday eight people are in hospital as a result of COVID-19, with three of those in intensive care.

Fitzgerald said 159 people have recovered, and 5,166 tests have been completed across the province.

Don't toss aside old gloves: Haggie

Haggie again reinforced the pandemic is rapidly evolving, not only in Newfoundland and Labrador, but across the world.

With that, recommendations have been changing on how to best respond to the virus that causes COVID-19. Haggie referenced the recent recommendation for the public to wear masks during essential trips such as banking.

""I'd like to emphasize that wearing a mask is not a substitute for physical distancing,"" he said.

""But I think again we need to look at adapting our way of working to allow for a new reality. A mask in a bank is no longer what it used to be.""

Meanwhile, Haggie said the province has a huge problem with littering. As more people begin to wear masks and gloves in public, posts on social media are showing discarded PPE items.

Haggie said the province can't condone a widespread cleanup at the moment, as snow begins to melt away and uncover other types of litter. 

""Municipal workers are not there to pick up after you. If you've got a pair of gloves take them home,"" he said.

Focus to shift Thursday to seniors

On Thursday a fourth person will be joining the panel to deliver the province's COVID-19 update. Suzanne Brake, the provincial seniors' advocate, will join Haggie, Fitzgerald and Premier Dwight Ball to discuss the challenges surrounding the province's most at risk population.

""We have counted on our seniors our entire life, and now is when they need us the most,"" Ball said.

The Office of the Seniors' Advocate works directly on issues related to seniors, and gives recommendations to improve services and the quality of life for seniors across the province.

Ball said the daily briefings would be a good opportunity to allow for Brake to speak about resources currently available to that population.

COVID-19 has struck every age group, although most cases involve patients over 50. By age:

20 cases are under 20 years old.
37 are between 20 and 39 years old.
33 are between 40 and 49 years old.
54 are between 50 and 59 years old.
56 are between 60 and 69 years old.
47 are 70 years old or above.
Marine Atlantic challenges

Wednesday's briefing, meanwhile, also heard about how Marine Atlantic staff are facing grueling challenges while aboard the Crown corporation's vessels, which connect Newfoundland to mainland Canada. 

Staff on Marine Atlantic ferries are not allowed to leave the ship on either side of its points of entry. What's more, their two-week shift rotation means upon leaving work after their stint, they must self-isolate for 14 days while home, before going back to work for another 14 days. 

Essential workers, such as truck drivers, who entering the province and who show no symptoms of COVID-19 are not required to self-isolate. 

No new cases of COVID-19, but N.L. not yet out of the woods, officials say
N.L. arranges financial relief for doctors signing up to fight COVID-19
When asked about that challenge, Ball said it's difficult but the reality of the situation is hinged on the exposure Marine Atlantic crew members may have while dealing with travellers during mutliple crossings. 

""We realize the difficulty that this is on our workers. But, you know, we've had to put in some very strict measures to protect people [and] to protect their families as well,"" Ball said. 

""We're seeing this with people that have been traveling back and forth to Alberta as well … They leave the situation that they're into they come into our province and they've had to self isolate as well.""

Ball said the rules now in place for travellers are no different for anyone else required to travel for work outside of the province.  

""The rules that we've put in place right now if you leave the province, [it's] no different if you leave and you're an offshore rig worker. If you leave Newfoundland and Labrador, when you come back you must self-isolate.""",CBC,,N.L. expands testing criteria as caseload increases by 3,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/covid19-newfoundland-labrador-april-15-1.5532867,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Before we restart our public engagement efforts for projects, we want feedback on whether or not residents are able and willing to engage with the City over virtual platforms.
The City is asking residents to sign up on engagestjohns.ca and complete a survey on public engagement opportunities.

On March 17, the City postponed any planned public engagement activities based on public health recommendations around in-person meetings and physical distancing. However, it is still important that we seek feedback from the public on policies, programs and projects as we continue to do regular day-to-day business.

As we listen to our provincial and federal updates, it is becoming clear that working virtually and maintaining physical distancing is going to be the new normal for a while. With that in mind, we want to consider how we continue to do our public engagement work virtually in a way that respects our public engagement principles.

There are several projects the City had planned to engage on this spring including: sidewalk snow clearing, re-imagining Churchill Square and implementing new wayfinding signage.

The City also reminds residents that Council meetings are continuing every two weeks. These meetings are broadcast live at stjohns.ca/councilmeetings and available as a link following the meeting for those unable to watch at the time of the meeting.

News Type: Advisories
YELLOWKNIFE 10 March 2020 – The Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) would like to provide an update to NWT residents on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).

As of March 10, 2020 no one in the NWT has tested positive for COVID-19. To date, 24 tests have been performed.

Findings from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention Report showed that of over 70,000 people with COVID-19, 80% reported having a mild illness. Another 20% required hospitalization, of which an even smaller amount of people became critically sick. These individuals tended to be adults over 60 years of age or individuals with chronic diseases or weakened immune systems. Those under age 20 tend to have mild illness and represented only 2% of all known cases in this report.

The global picture of COVID-19 transmission is evolving quickly. However, the risk of acquiring COVID-19 within NWT remains low at present. As of this morning, there are 79 confirmed cases in 4 provinces with one reported death. There is also evidence of community transmission in British Columbia, where cases are no longer linked to direct travel to an affected area or contact to someone who has traveled to an affected area.

The NWT Office of the Chief Public Health Officer is working closely with partners at all government levels to protect the health and safety of NWT residents. This now involves testing residents and visitors for COVID-19 if they show flu-like symptoms and have recently travelled outside the NWT within the past 14 days. They will be requested to self-isolate until results are available. If a person should test positive for COVID-19, health officials will act quickly to identify and monitor the person’s contacts to prevent further spread.

Community-level transmission of COVID-19 in the United States and more recently in British Columbia is a reminder that this is possible in the NWT, and that the situation can change quickly. We have developed an NWT COVID-19 Pandemic Planning Guide and checklist for the health system to guide the review of local, regional and territorial pandemic plans. GNWT officials have also reached out to communities, schools, daycare, day homes and the college, as well as Indigenous governments on actions being taken to prepare for COVID-19.  The GNWT will continue to share new information with them to help in their preparedness efforts.

NWT residents have an important role to play to prevent the spread of infection within our communities. Residents should practice good etiquette for coughing or sneezing, frequently wash hands (or use hand sanitizers), stay home when ill, cleaning contaminated surfaces and contacting their local health unit if they have concerns. These actions are effective for preventing the spread of COVID-19 and other common respiratory illnesses such as the flu, common cold and RSV.

At this time the CPHO is advising residents to take the following proactive measures to protect themselves and their communities until further notice:

Adults over 60 years of age, individuals with chronic conditions or weakened immune systems are at increased risk of severe outcomes. They should:
Avoid travelling outside of the NWT
Avoid receiving travelers if possible from affected areas and
Avoid close contact with people who have flu-like symptoms (fever, cough shortness of breath)
Everyone should avoid cruise ship travel.
If you are returning from outside of the NWT, monitor yourself and your family members for symptoms like fever, cough or difficulty breathing for 14 days after your return from travel. If you or your family member develop symptoms, call your healthcare provider ahead of time so that they can arrange assessment and testing. When you arrive at a health care facility, you will be asked to wear a mask so you can protect others.
Employers may want to reconsider non-essential work travel for staff outside of NWT, especially if traveling to affected areas or if attending meetings that receive travelers from affected areas.
If you plan on traveling for personal reasons, check the Government of Canada for the latest travel alerts. If there is community spread of COVID 19 where you are visiting or if you are receiving visitors from an affected area, this will increase the risk of exposure to COVID-19.
If you and your family have visited Iran or Hubei Province, China in the last 14 days, you and your family must self-isolate for 14 days since your last day in those regions, even if you are feeling well. Self-isolation means staying home and not going outside. If you or a family member develops fever, cough, or difficulty breathing during your self-isolation, call your health care provider ahead of time so that they can arrange a visit.
Remember, this advice can change quickly so it is important to monitor the Department’s public website for the latest information.

Just like preparing for weather, ferry and ice road closures, you should have a plan in place that includes keeping 2 weeks of household supplies such as food, water, cleaning supplies, and medication, plus requirements for childcare or elder support.
Finally, NWT organizers of events and gatherings are advised to assess their plans recognizing the COVID-19 outbreak is an evolving situation in Canada and the NWT. As such, the Chief Public Health Officer may direct actions to protect the health and well-being of residents, including cancelling or modifying events or gatherings.

Yellowknife — March 12, 2020Ministers' Statements and Speeches
Mr. Speaker, today I wish to give well deserved recognition to Team Northwest Territories who were scheduled to compete at the 2020 Arctic Winter Games in Whitehorse, Yukon from March 15 -21.

At the same time as providing this recognition, we, of course, have to acknowledge the profound disappointment at the difficult but necessary decision to cancel the 2020 Arctic Winter Games due to the risk presented by the COVID-19 virus. The decision to cancel the games could not have been an easy one, but ultimately, doing what was in the best interests of the health and safety of all those involved had to be the priority.

Mr. Speaker, it is truly unfortunate that there will be no games. Team NT still deserves our thanks and our recognition. Mr. Speaker, I would like to provide Members with some information about Team NT:

At the Territorial Trials, 746 athletes, coaches and chaperones from 23 NWT communities competed for the opportunity to represent the NWT. Of this 344 were female participants and 402 were male participants.

The 2020 Arctic Winter Games Team consists of 355 participants including athletes, coaches and mission staff from 20 different communities. In addition, 17 officials from across the NWT were scheduled to be involved. Team NT athletes were set to compete in all 20 sports.  Team NT also included a cultural contingent that was going to celebrate our cultural heritage.

17 NWT Youth Ambassadors, with representation from all regions in the Territory, were also set to go to Whitehorse as volunteers. The NWT Youth Ambassador Program (NWT YAP) has been in operation in the Northwest Territories for 12 years, and offers a guided and structured volunteer experience for NWT youth at major territorial, national and international events. Participants have the opportunity to develop life and job skills as well as to build the confidence necessary to deal with complex life challenges.

Mr. Speaker,  everyone who is part of Team NT and the contingent who was going to the Arctic Winter games had worked hard for many months and in some cases years to prepare for these games. Team NT is built with the collaboration of so many people who deserve our thanks: Volunteers, sport organizations, and the tireless efforts of parents. I want to say thank you to everyone for all their efforts in the early morning drives, the long hours of practice, and the lessons in fair play and determination. We know the life lessons that involvement in sports teaches are very valuable. What we hope our young people take away from this difficult lesson is that the reward and pride in accomplishment is in the journey.   

Mr. Speaker, I want to advise Members that Team NT will be refunded for their deposits and to keep their uniforms. Unfortunately, due to the scope and magnitude that goes into planning events of this type, postponing the games or holding alternative events is not an option. 

To close, I would like to extend my thanks to Mr. Doug Rentmeister, Chef de Mission, Mr. Damon Crossman and Mr. Bill Othmer, Assistant Chef de Missions for Team NT  and all the rest of their mission staff as well as the Sport North Federation.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker.",Ministry of Municipal and Community Affairs,,Paulie Chinna: Arctic Winter Games Ministers' Statements and Speeches,https://www.gov.nt.ca/en/newsroom/paulie-chinna-arctic-winter-games,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Check against delivery 

Good afternoon. We all know in the coming weeks that there will be new challenges presented here in the Northwest Territories, both for our residents and for the health care system. I want to assure you that we are prepared, and are continuing to prepare.

Knowing that our health system faces unique challenges in the North, we’ve been at an active state of readiness for weeks. We’ve been making necessary preparations to address a surge in the number of NWT residents needing to receive health services in the coming weeks and months because of COVID-19.

We have also been carrying out comprehensive public health surveillance measures, at times going above and beyond what was being recommended by the federal government. This is because we know our best defence in managing the COVID-19 situation is in doing all we can to reduce the likelihood of having it transmitted in our communities.

I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the dedication and professionalism of the frontline and support staff of the health and social services system. I know staff are strongly committed to ensuring the health of NWT residents. And I know we’ll soon be entering a time when, over coming weeks and months, we will need to call upon staff to continue to support the health system and the delivery of health services to residents, in ways that will require new levels of sacrifice when it comes to work-life balance and spending time with family and friends.

I want to reassure residents that the risk of getting COVID-19 in the NWT is low at this time. However, in the coming weeks and months, I would like to call on the media to support the health system by playing a key role in helping residents stay up to date on the latest and accurate health information provided by our Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Kami Kandola.",Ministry of Health and Social Services,,"Diane Thom: COVID-19, Media Briefing Statement Ministers' Statements and Speeches",https://www.gov.nt.ca/en/newsroom/diane-thom-covid-19-media-briefing-statement,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Health:

The GNWT recognizes that our health system faces unique Northern challenges in these types of emergency situations, and as a result have been in an active state of readiness for weeks - making the necessary preparations to address the anticipated surge in the number of NWT residents needing to receive health services in the coming weeks and months because of COVID-19.
The NWT Chief Public Health Officer increased NWT surveillance to include testing anyone (residents and visitors) who arrives from outside of the NWT and show flu or cold like symptoms within 14 days of their arrival to test for COVID-19.  Having this enhanced surveillance allows for the identification and management of any cases early, thereby reducing the strain on our health care system.
Health care providers are on alert to identify and manage possible cases in the NWT, as well as share healthy respiratory practices on an ongoing basis.
Ensuring the continuity of critical government services and programs during a territorial emergency is the responsibility of each GNWT department. Departments have been proactively identifying which services are critical, and putting plans to support their continuation if impacted as this situation evolves.
Emergency Measures

The Emergency Management Office (EMO) coordinates the GNWT response in emergencies and is monitoring the COVID-19 situation closely to identify emergency preparedness needs of communities and potential impacts to communities and critical infrastructure. The EMO has been activated to coordinate a broader emergency response.

News Type: Advisories
YELLOWKNIFE 14 March 2020 – To limit the spread of COVID-19, Global Affairs Canada is advising citizens to avoid all non-essential travel outside of Canada. Further to this advice, the Chief Public Health Officer is recommending that NWT residents avoid all non-essential travel outside of the Northwest Territories.

More information on the Government of Canada’s Travel Advice:

Official Global Travel Advisory
Travellers arriving in the NWT
Further to the above recommendation, if you are arriving in Canada from Hubei province in China, Iran or Italy, you must self-isolate and stay at home for 14 days and contact your health care provider within 24 hours of arriving in Canada.

For all other travellers returning to the NWT, you should self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days. You will need to:

Monitor your health for fever, cough or difficulty breathing.
Wash your hands often for 20 seconds and cover your mouth and nose with your arm when coughing or sneezing.
If you do develop symptoms within 14 days continue to isolate yourself from others, call your health care provider and inform them about symptoms and travel history. They will provide advice on what you should do.

You can contact a health care provider as follows:

Yellowknife: 867-767-9120, or book online at www.nthssa.ca/appointments
Inuvik: 867-490-2225
Fort Smith: 867-621-2233 or 867-872-0562
Hay River: 867-874-7201 (between 08:30-16.30). After hours call Emergency Department at 867-874-8050.
Other Communities can call their local health centres, www.hss.gov.nt.ca/health-centres
If your symptoms become severe call 9-1-1.

Residents leaving the NWT
Making the choice to stay at home and to not travel outside of the NWT is the best way to protect yourself, your family, and our communities from the spread of COVID-19, and to support our health system in responding to this pandemic.

If you have plans to travel, you should consider contacting your airline or tour operator to determine options for cancelling or postponing your trip.

Residents outside of Canada should find out what commercial options are still available to return to Canada and should consider returning to Canada earlier than planned if these options are becoming limited.

Although not advised, if you are still considering travel outside of Canada, you should do the following:

check your destination before travelling
know the health risks for your destination
understand the risks of your safety and security abroad
ensure that you have sufficient finances and necessities, including medication, in case your travels are disrupted
be prepared if airlines revise scheduled flights to and from your destination
If you travel abroad, you could be subject to the measures of other countries. Your scheduled trip may become much longer. You may also have reduced access to quality health care and your travel health insurance will likely not provide coverage in a pandemic.

The Chief Public Health Officer would also like to reiterate that you should avoid all travel on cruise ships due to the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, until further notice.

Further, to ensure continuity of health and social services, there has been a strong recommendation made to staff that they cancel all personal travel outside the NWT cancelled effective today.",Office of the Chief Public Health Officer,,Avoid non-essential travel outside of Canada until further notice.,https://www.hss.gov.nt.ca/en/newsroom/avoid-non-essential-travel-outside-canada-until-further-notice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,Government Website,"Media Advisory: Government of the Northwest Territories Information on Covid-19

Yellowknife — March 16, 2020Ministers' Statements and Speeches
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the members of this Assembly for taking the step of suspending its current sitting after today to allow Cabinet and the public service greater opportunity to prepare for the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

Although there remains no reported case in the NWT, our government continues to prepare for the impact of this pandemic.  Hour to hour, we are monitoring the state of the COVID-19 situation as it continues to evolve. I want to share with the Assembly some of the actions and planning that is underway.

Our health system has been preparing over the last few months, as the concern over this new virus became known. This planning has included securing additional supplies and preparing staff and facilities to respond to an outbreak.

Our health officials have also been working with partners - including the Government of Canada and Public Health Agency of Canada – to stay current with the most recent information and recommendations about this disease. 

Based on these discussions, our Chief Public Health Officer has been working tirelessly with her colleagues to provide the best available advice to officials and the public about how to identify and care for those infected and prevent the spread of this disease.

One thing we know is that we can slow the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate its impact on our communities if everyone follows the advice of our Chief Public Health Officer, and takes the necessary precautions to protect themselves and most importantly to safeguard those who may be more vulnerable including our elders.

We are fortunate that our health system has not yet had to face any confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the NWT, but we know that this virus is spreading and we all need to take personal steps to slow the spread of this illness. By slowing the rate of infection, our health system will be better able to effectively respond to this pandemic.  

On Friday, our Health and Social Services Minister thanked our many health care professionals for their dedication and service, and Mr. Speaker on behalf of all of us here in this assembly, and on behalf of the people of the Northwest Territories, I want to also thank them for their efforts to look after us all. We know their work will become more challenging as the COVID-19 virus continues to spread.   

Over the weekend, we have also taken the extraordinary step of asking our health care professionals to avoid any unnecessary travel outside of the NWT. This will prevent exposure and help avoid the potential requirements for isolation and will ensure that the NWT health system can maintain as much operational readiness as possible to manage the spread of this disease.

Mr. Speaker, work to prepare for a COVID-19 pandemic in the Northwest Territories began even before the World Health Organization declared one. In addition to the measures our health system has put in place to identify, prevent and control the spread of infectious disease, our Government also has dedicated resources and procedures to manage emergencies.

Our Department of Municipal and Community Affairs includes the Emergency Management Organization established under the Emergency Management Act. Its role is, in part, to lead the Government of the Northwest Territories in the coordination of emergency management activities, support emergency management activities of local authorities, and coordinate and assist in the response of governments and public agencies.

The head of the Emergency Management Office also chairs the Territorial Planning Committee that works with community governments and other key partners to ensure readiness, and to respond to emergencies. 

Again, although we have yet to face a confirmed case of COVID-19 in the NWT, we have taken the proactive step of activating an Emergency Operations Centre under MACA’s leadership as of March 13, 2020 and work will continue to assist all communities in the NWT to help prevent or manage any COVID-19 outbreak.

Mr. Speaker, later this week I will also be convening a virtual meeting with community governments and Indigenous governments to share the latest information we have on our readiness and our plans. We will continue to meet regularly with them to work together to eliminate any gaps in our plans and support our efforts. 

We know that many communities and jurisdictions in Canada and throughout the world have made the decision to temporarily close schools as result of this pandemic. The Minister of Education, Culture and Employment has consulted with the Chief Public Health Officer on this, and has received the advice today to close NWT schools until after Easter. Later today, the Minister will be convening a teleconference with all District Education Authorities to discuss this direction and how best to support school teachers, staff and students as they return from Spring Break travel.

Mr. Speaker, as we prepare for this pandemic, the health and safety of our people is paramount. Every GNWT department and agency has been tasked with identifying and planning for the continuation of essential services. If a large number of our employees are required to self-isolate to prevent the further spread of the virus, we know that government services may face a significant disruption. It is critical that key services remain supported, and we are taking the proper steps to deal with a scenario where we have dramatically fewer available employees.

All departments and agencies have been updating their Business Continuity Plans and later this week these plans will be finalized, and validated with table top exercises to ensure potential gaps have been identified and can be addressed. We know that the work of our government touches upon the lives of the people we serve in important ways, and that we need to make sure that there is as little disruption as possible should we find that many of our employees have to be isolated to care for themselves or others. Our planning will also consider how best to manage the NWT supply chain to help ensure that residents and businesses continue to receive essential services.

Mr. Speaker, it is important to state again that the NWT has no reported cases of COVID-19 and that the risk of contracting the disease in the NWT remains low today.  This does not mean that we can rest easy. We must be prepared to take preventative actions now.

In recent days, we have seen many jurisdictions implement new measures in response to having the virus already spreading within their borders. We have the ability to take measures sooner than others to better manage the risk. This will mean some disruption in travel for residents coming home who will need to self-isolate, and tourists who will have to postpone their visits the NWT.

It is critically important that all residents of, and visitors to, the NWT take precautions and follow the advice of our Chief Public Health Officer. As our preparations continue it is also critical that our community partners work with MACA’s Emergency Operations Centre to ensure plans are in place, and that every effort is made to minimize the risk and manage the impacts of this pandemic.  

We are implementing the best approaches available to slow and manage the spread of COVID-19. While we must not panic, we do have to take precautions.

I want to thank all residents of the Northwest Territories for their understanding as we direct more of the work of our government to managing this issue, and acknowledge that some of this effort will necessarily come at the expense of other priorities. However, protecting our most vulnerable from this pandemic is our most important priority, and we are working closely with our service providers to develop plans.

Mr. Speaker, we know that the consequences of this pandemic are already having an impact on our economy, and that many of our residents and businesses will need support. These concerns have been raised with the Prime Minister, and I am very encouraged that there is clearly recognition that new federal programs and investments will be required to protect our economy. Additional options to provide support to our residents and businesses are being actively considered.   

Information on the spread of this new virus and knowledge of how best to manage its impacts has been changing rapidly. That is why we are working closely with our partners from across all jurisdictions to stay up to date on the latest information. We will be providing daily reports and have set up a single portal for more information at www.gov.nt.ca and click on the corona virus feature box. The website is being updated as new information becomes available.

We recognize that people are concerned, but I want to remind everbody that we can all take practical steps to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. We will continue to update our residents, our communities, and Indigenous government partners, and I strongly urge everybody to check our website frequently and heed the advice of the Chief Public Health Officer and our Emergency Management Office as we work together to safeguard our friends, families and our elders.

News Type: Advisories
YELLOWKNIFE 17 March 2020 – To limit the spread of COVID-19, the Government of NWT is advising all individuals, organizations, and businesses that they should cancel all mass gatherings which could reach over 50 people.

Large retail or grocery stores are exempt from the 50 person-requirement. The remaining guidance on hand-washing and physical distance still apply.  

Additionally, if you are holding a gathering of less than 50 people, the following measures must be available to be considered safe:

The ability to keep two metres between people.
Adequate supply of hygiene material (i.e. paper towels, soap, hand sanitizer, running water, waste disposal).
The direction that anyone who is not feeling well must stay home.
Increased cleaning and disinfecting of surfaces used often.
Remember: hosting gatherings outdoors is always safer.

Objective of Advice
Large gatherings are a significant source of spread. Physical distancing of more than two metres apart becomes challenging, healthy respiratory practices may not always be followed, and more bodies mean more chance of spread. Taking action to limit large gatherings will help protect all Northwest Territories residents — and especially the elderly and other vulnerable populations.

Who Can I Contact For More Advice?
If you’re looking to host a gathering and you are unsure whether yours will be safe, you can contact covid@gov.nt.ca for advice.

The email address is monitored regularly from 8:30 AM – 5:00 PM, Monday to Friday. Public Health staff will get back to you with advice as soon as they can.

Important Note
If you feel sick, you should not go to any gathering of any size — stay home.
 

If you develop fever, cough, or other flu-like symptoms during this time period, contact the following:

Yellowknife: 867-767-9120, or book online at www.nthssa.ca/appointments
Inuvik: 867-490-2225

They will talk to you about your symptoms, and advise you what to do next. Do not go in without calling.

If you develop severe symptoms such as difficulty breathing call 9-1-1.

Implications for Businesses
It is recommended businesses take measures to limit how many people are in an establishment at any given time.

They should also strongly encourage employees and customers to keep a distance of two metres between each other, including in line-ups, wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds frequently, or using hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol content.",Government of the Northwest Territories,,All Mass Gatherings 50 People or Over Should Be Cancelled,https://www.hss.gov.nt.ca/en/newsroom/all-mass-gatherings-50-people-or-over-should-be-cancelled,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yellowknife — March 20, 2020Ministers' Statements and Speeches
Check against delivery 

I’d like to take a moment to reiterate what many of my colleagues have also addressed over the last few days, and that’s that I know this is an anxious time, and many of us are unsure and worried about what the future holds.

The situation with COVID-19 is evolving quickly, and in times like this, what many people want most are answers. They want to know that their physical, and financial wellbeing are being looked out for. That their governments understand these pressures, and are doing everything they can.

Well, I am here today with Minister Wawzonek to try to ease some of that worry, and reassure you that there are many hardworking, dedicated people working tirelessly to deal with each issue that arises, and protect NWT residents during this uncertain time.  

There is no denying that COVID-19 is a significant challenge around the world, and in the Northwest Territories.  In the North, the global situation will have an immense impact on us.

There is no avoiding the economic impacts that we are already challenged with, but we are committed to doing what we can to help residents, businesses, and our economy during this period of uncertainty.

As Minister Wawzonek has outlined, the GNWT has put together an initial $13.2 Million dollar economic relief package that will take effect immediately.

This funding is intended to work in concert with federal incentives announced under Canada’s $27 billion COVID-19 Economic Response Plan, earlier this week.

We understand the critical importance of maintaining the northern supply chain. The delivery of essential goods must continue in order to resupply our communities, and support our economy.

To help maintain ground-based resupply into the territory, all toll fees for crossing the Deh Cho Bridge and many permit fees for transport trucks on all NWT highways will be waived until June.

To support our airlines, all landing fees at all NWT airports will also be waived.

At the BDIC, we’re going to offer low interest loans to businesses to help offset COVID-19 impacts, and allow the deferral of any BDIC loan payments for a period of up to three months with no penalty or additional interest charges.

As well, we’ll offer an extension of the due date for Employer Assessment Payments with the WSCC from April 1 to May 1, 2020.

We will also establish an Economic Council to help identify the economic impacts, represent the business community, and ensure that the items most critical to local economies and jobs are addressed.

There are a number of other items being implemented, and the full list of GNWT response measures for phase 1, are included in the release.  

I want to reassure residents and our business community that we will continue to look at ways to support you and continue to assess other relief measures, including leaning on the federal government to offer more support to the North.

The Premier and each member of Cabinet will continue to be a voice for our residents and businesses in conversations with our federal counterparts. Addressing the costs, and challenges that we are all experiencing is a priority, and we are committed to keeping you informed along the way.

Before I conclude my statement, I’d like to take a moment to address the concerns about the NWT Diamond Mines, and the decision made by Dominion Diamond Mine to temporarily suspend operations at Ekati, in the interest of mitigating the spread of COVID-19 to the NWT.

This is obviously difficult news to take from the perspective of the NWT economy, and the livelihoods of those that are reliant on Ekati for jobs or business. 

We know that the impacts of COVID-19 are far reaching and that includes our mining industry.

That said, all mines are not equal. Their ownership structure, operations, and their capacity to address issues like COVID-19 is different.

The Diavik and Gacho Kué mines, and other businesses, are also taking steps to address the COVID19 crisis. The fact that they are still operating should not be a reflection of a disregard for what is happening.

I am confident that businesses that are still in operation are adhering to the safety precautions outlined by the Chief Public Health Officer, and are operating within the parameters that have been put in place so far.

Yellowknife — March 20, 2020News Releases
NWT Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Kami Kandola is preparing to make an order effective March 21, 2020 prohibiting all travel (by air, land, and port) into the Northwest Territories, with limited exceptions, to combat COVID-19 in the territory.

This order will also require those who have returned to the NWT within the preceding 14 days, to self-isolate in their current community.  All individuals will be required to complete a self-isolation plan.  Further details on this measure will be forthcoming.

 

This is necessary due to the growing risk of COVID-19 as it spreads through throughout Canada, and make it possible to ensure those at risk of COVID-19 due to travel are self-isolating in communities with well-equipped healthcare facilities.

 

Travel through all points of entry into the Northwest Territories — both air and road — will be prohibited to all travelers with the exception of:

NWT residents.

Further Guidance and conditions will be issued as part of the order for the following persons:

NWT residents.
Import/export workers — including those providing important supply chain transportation services for food, equipment, fuel, or other goods into the territory, movers and carriers, and workers that support the supply chain industry.
Flight crews.
Persons who support essential services — including those coming to provide childcare or similar support services for essential service workers, and those participating in the COVID-19 response.
When Will It Come Into Force?

It is intended this order will be issued on Saturday, March 21, 2020.  However, it will not be issued until all operation measures are in-place to ensure it is implemented in the most orderly fashion possible.

PUBLIC HEALTH ADVISORY
Confirmed Case of COVID-19 in Northwest Territories
YELLOWKNIFE 21 March 2020 – The Office of the Chief Public Health Officer (OCPHO)
confirms that a person in the Northwest Territories has COVID-19.
The individual’s condition has improved and they are recovering at home. Our investigation
determines the individual traveled to British Columbia and Alberta. They returned home to

developing mild symptoms three days after their return.
Those who may have had close contact are being notified to self-isolate immediately. Public
health workers will assess and make further recommendations.
The public is being notified of the community because the size of Yellowknife allows privacy
to be sufficiently protected. In smaller communities, the public should not expect to be
informed of the community.
Testing Efforts

testing strategy to identify and respond to the spread of COVID-19 across the Northwest
Territories.
To date, 299 COVID-19 tests have been completed in the NWT with one positive.

News Type: Advisories
YELLOWKNIFE 22 March 2020 – To limit the spread of COVID-19, the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) is advising all individuals and organizations that they should cancel all gatherings regardless of size or number of participants or whether they are held inside or outside.

This will include (but not limited to) the following events/groups:

Organized outdoor and indoor events (jamborees, spring festivals, hamlet days, etc)
Religious services/churches (including funerals and weddings)
Recreational facilities/indoors (arenas, pools recreational centre, youth centre, gyms)
Bingos/Chase the Ace
Community centres
The CPHO is also recommending that the following businesses be closed as the nature of their operation will not allow them to have suitable distancing measures in place to reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19:

Tour Operators
Bottle Depots
Gyms and fitness centres
Museums and Art galleries
Bars and night clubs
Theatres and movie theatres
Buffet style restaurants
Personal service establishments (barber, hair salons, massage, nail and other salons)
Objective of Advice
The CPHO recommends social distancing of 2 metres to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Social distancing means limiting the amount of people you come into contact with, which lowers the risk of passing or catching the virus.

Organized gatherings (indoors or outside) are a source of spread COVID-19. Maintaining a distance of 2 metres significantly reduces the risk of exposure to COVID-19. Businesses that require close contact cannot provide this reduced risk.

Social distancing of more than two metres apart becomes challenging, healthy respiratory practices may not always be followed, and more bodies with more time near each other  means more chance of spread of COVID-19.

Taking action to limit gatherings and these business operations will help protect all Northwest Territories residents — and especially the elderly and other vulnerable populations.

Who Can I Contact For Advice?
If you’re business or event or gathering type is not listed in above you can contact environmental_ health@gov.nt.ca to request advice. Please ensure you provide a phone number, community name and some brief details of your event or business in your request email.

The email address is monitored regularly from 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday to Friday. Public health officials will get back to you with advice as soon as they can.

Important Note
If you feel sick, you should not go to any gathering of any size — stay home.

They will talk with you about your symptoms, and advise you what to do next. Do not go in without calling.

If you develop severe symptoms such as difficulty breathing call 9-1-1.

Implications for Businesses
Personal Services Establishments (massage, salons, barbers and tattoo parlors and piercers) should be closed until further notice as they cannot operate and provide for the 2 m separation required to be safe and they by nature require more time than a casual time limited contact. It is recommended businesses that require clients and staff to have close contact (less than two meters) close at this time or take steps to limit how close persons may be to one another.

Essential services large retail stores (groceries, gas bars and convenience stores) can remain open if they can maintain 2m separations between persons within the facility. They should also strongly encourage employees and customers to keep a distance of two metres between each other, including in line-ups, wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds frequently, or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol content frequently.

Other essential businesses should wherever possible limit face to face meeting and contact of any kind. Banks, pharmacies, Liquor stores, Gas stations, restaurants and pubs serving food, and coffee shops should if possible operate with 2 m distance, increased hand washing or use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol content.

Yellowknife — March 25, 2020News Releases
Minister of Education, Culture and Employment (ECE) R.J. Simpson met with Northwest Territories (NWT) Education Leaders and the Northwest Territories Teachers’ Association (NWTTA) via teleconference on Tuesday, March 24 to discuss the status of JK-12 education in the territory as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 public health emergency.

Education Leaders included Chairs of the Tłı̨chǫ Community Services Agency, Dettah and Ndilo District Education Authorities (DEAs), the Commission scolaire francophone des Territoires du Nord-Ouest, Beaufort Delta Education Council, Dehcho Divisional Education Council, South Slave Divisional Education Council, Sahtu Divisional Education Council, Yellowknife Education District No. 1 and Yellowknife Catholic Schools, as well as NWTTA President.

Due to the significant health concerns posed by COVID-19 and the importance of following direction from the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) on social distancing as a way to keep students, staff and communities safe, Education Leaders have agreed with the recommendation from Minister Simpson that schools be closed for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year.

Education Leaders have shared the recommendation with District Education Authorities, who hold the authority under the Education Act to close NWT schools. Closures are being announced individually by respective education councils.

Minister Simpson, Education Leaders and the NWTTA recognize the serious impact school closures will have on students, parents, staff and communities, and have agreed that a plan is required to support continued learning for all students, especially those in Grade 12, to achieve their education and career goals.

ECE continues to meet daily with NWT education superintendents and the NWTTA to discuss support for essential services, continuity of educational programming and ongoing communication. These plans continue to be adjusted as new information and direction is provided by the CPHO.

While the immediate priority is not to provide lessons or give instruction it is necessary to identify and secure essential services for supporting students and communities. All parties share the strong interest of parents and communities in ensuring opportunities for continued learning. The NWTTA has advised that teachers are prepared and willing to help students and communities however they can during this unprecedented time.

ECE will continue to work with the NWTTA and education bodies to find options for providing educational programming to all NWT students, particularly those in Grade 12. This includes reviewing what’s being done in other jurisdictions, especially Alberta, whose curriculum and major assessment tools are used for the majority of NWT education programming.

ECE will also be working to coordinate with post-secondary institutions across Canada in an effort to ensure the smoothest transition possible for those graduating this year. Minister Simpson continues to have weekly calls with Canadian Education Ministers to discuss ways to ensure students graduating high school this year are able to advance to post-secondary institutions.

The continuation of meal programs, along with counselling and other health and wellness programming, have been identified by ECE, the CPHO and education bodies as essential to NWT communities, and work is ongoing to identify which positions and individuals will be involved in providing these programs and services during school closures.

ECE will continue to provide updates to parents, communities and education bodies as plans are developed and implemented.

 

Quote:

“The COVID-19 situation in the Northwest Territories has evolved substantially since the initial closure of schools on March 16. As new public health advisories and orders are put in place, including the declaration of a public health emergency, the closure of the NWT border and the cancellation of all gatherings, we must continue to make difficult decisions to protect the health and safety of our residents. I am grateful to the NWT Education Leaders for their dedication and commitment to ensuring the well-being of our students, staff and communities in deciding to close schools for the remainder of the school year. As Minister, I remain committed to working with our education bodies to provide students and communities with the programs and services they need to succeed throughout this unprecedented time.”

 - Hon. R.J. Simpson, Minister of Education, Culture and Employment


Quick Facts:

The Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) of the NWT made the recommendation that schools remain closed until after Easter Break as a precautionary measure to minimize the potential spread of COVID-19. 
On March 21, the CPHO issued an order to close the border and require all NWT residents returning from outside the territory to self-isolate for 14 days. This current order from the CPHO applies to all school staff and students returning from travel. A significant number of school employees were out of the territory on spring break when these travel restrictions were ordered, and are therefore currently self-isolating.
ECE and education bodies continue to work together on continuity planning in relation to JK-12 class cancellation. All options for continued provision of educational services, including potential alternative learning plans, are currently being explored.

Yellowknife — March 27, 2020News Releases
Effective March 24, 2020, the Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs (MACA), Paulie Chinna, declared a territory-wide  State of Emergency under the Emergency Management Act to support ongoing efforts to protect public health in the Northwest Territories.

 

This decision does not indicate a significant change in circumstances or an increased risk to the people of the Northwest Territories.  The need to declare a state of emergency at this time is to make it more efficient to deploy resources to protect residents and enhance our response to the orders made by the Chief Public Health Officer.

This step has been taken to ensure the Emergency Management Organization (EMO) is better able to support the implementation of the orders issued by the Chief Public Health Officer to help slow the spread of COVID-19, and gives the EMO the authority to control and direct all persons, including the GNWT and public agencies involved in emergency management plans or programs under the Emergency Management Act.

 

At this time, all residents are urged to follow these Orders and all other direction and advice from the Chief Public Health Officer.

 

The State of Emergency will be in effect from March 24 through April 7, 2020.

Follow the advice and directions of health officials and emergency responders. Let’s be kind to one another and, as we have done so many times before, let us come together as a community to face this challenge together.”

Steps already taken by the GNWT to support the implementation of the public health order include establishing isolation centres and putting measures in place to receive travellers at airports in Yellowknife, Inuvik, Hay River and Fort Smith, and at ground entry points to secure borders in Enterprise, Fort Smith, Liard and Dempster entry points.

Yellowknife — March 30, 2020News Releases
Everyone is urged to Protect Our Elders in two new campaigns to combat the spread of COVID-19.

The Northwest Territories Association of Communities (NWTAC), Music NWT, and the GNWT have teamed up to run these campaigns.

Our goal is to build solidarity during the COVID-19 crisis, and get residents to recognize that changing behaviors isn’t just about them – it’s about the people they love, and our most vulnerable community-members.

Protect Our Elders: A Community Campaign To Stop The Spread Of COVID-19

This social media campaign encourages NWT residents to share the message that the kindest thing we can do to protect our Elders, and keep our loved ones safe, is to stay home and keep at least 2 meters away from people outside our homes.

Community members are encouraged to snap a selfie and submit it (& share it on your social media!) for your messages to be shared along with those of other northerners.

Together, we can send a message loud and clear to everyone in the NWT that NOW is the time to be physically apart, so that we can come together with our Elders in good health again soon.

Protect Our Elders: Radio Ad Writing Competition

This campaign invites you to record your own radio ad that encourages everyone to protect our elders and loved ones by keeping two metres apart, practice good hygiene, and do their part by self-isolating as much as possible.

It can be a song, a story, a touching PSA – the door is wide open and thinking outside the box is encouraged. And don’t think you need a professional recording rig – recording on your phone is good enough.

Music NWT is offering cash prizes for the top entries, as well as an honourable mention for ads that really hit home. The winning ads will be played on NWT radio!

Quick Facts

While anyone can catch it, elders, those who have compromised immune systems, and those who have had diseases like cancer, diabetes, and heart or lung disease are most at-risk of catching, and getting very sick from COVID-19.

“Everyone in the territory needs to change their behaviours to limit the spread of this virus – no matter who or where they are. So let’s show our elders how much we care, and engage everyone in the message that we must protect our most vulnerable in this difficult time.”

-Diane Thom, Minister of Health and Social Services

“We are so pleased to continue our partnership with Health and Social Services in working on these incredibly important campaigns. We Are the North! We will persevere but we must all do our part. We need to recognize that staying home and physical distancing is our responsibility for our community and for our loved ones. If it was the other way around and young people were in danger, our Elders would do anything to keep us safe.”

-Lynn Napier, President, Northwest Territories Association of Communities

“Music NWT is pleased to partner with the GNWT in the Protect our Elders Radio Ad Contest. With our mission ""to foster, provide opportunities for and promote musicians and the music Industry in the NWT,"" we can leverage the skills of NWT musicians in order for our band mates, fans, friends, family and neighbours to come out the other side of this pandemic healthy.

Yellowknife — April 1, 2020Media Statement
Premier Caroline Cochrane issued the following statement on the confirmation of a second case of COVID-19 in the Northwest Territories today:

""I was saddened to hear that the Chief Public Health Officer had confirmed a second case of COVID-19 in the Northwest Territories today. My thoughts are with this person and their family and I wish them well as they deal with this infection. While we knew that it was only reasonable to expect more cases would be discovered in the Northwest Territories, this news still comes as a disappointment to many.

""I hope that those disappointed by the news, were reassured like I was to hear that the individual had been following the advice to self-isolated at home, along with members of their household. I am also pleased that public health officials were able to respond quickly to this new case and that this individual is not expected to need hospitalization for their mild symptoms.

""I want to thank our public health officials for all the work they are doing to protect the health of our people and communities. Detecting cases as early as possible allows us to make sure that people who are sick with COVID-19 get the treatment they need right away and lets our public health officials start taking steps to protect the health of other people in their community.

""Today’s news does demonstrate that COVID-19 is in the Northwest Territories and we all have to keep doing our part to help slow its spread and lessen the impact on our friends, families and loved ones. Now more than ever, we must make sure we are following the orders of our Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO.)

""Following the direction of the Chief Public Health Officer remains essential. Stay home, maintain physical distance, and stay connected and support each other online or by telephone. We need to be on top of hand washing, cough into our elbows and do our best to not touch our faces.

""COVID-19 will be a challenge for the Northwest Territories, but we can all do our part to help if we remain vigilant and follow the advice of our public health officials.""",NWT Premier,Chief Public Health Officer,Statement from Premier Caroline Cochrane on the confirmation of the second NWT case of COVID-19,https://www.gov.nt.ca/en/newsroom/statement-premier-caroline-cochrane-confirmation-second-nwt-case-covid-19,1.0,,,,,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

News Type: Advisories
YELLOWKNIFE 5 April 2020 – The Office of the Chief Public Health Officer (OCPHO) confirms a new case of COVID-19 in the Northwest Territories in Yellowknife.

The case is linked with travel from Latin America. There remains no evidence of community spread in the Northwest Territories.

The individual completed a self-isolation plan prior to returning to Yellowknife on March 23 and immediately went into mandatory self-isolation along with their household.  

They developed symptoms on March 31 and were tested soon after. Positive results came back within three days.

This is another case where everything was done right. The individual and their household immediately isolated, had food dropped off, and stayed home. When they developed symptoms, they called ahead and were tested safely using the necessary protective equipment.

The individual is recuperating at home. 

While public health is investigating all possible contacts 48 hours before symptoms developed and onwards, because the individual followed all instructions, they are expected to be limited.

If You Have Symptoms, Get Tested
Information is our best weapon in tracing and responding to COVID-19 in the Northwest Territories. Arranging for testing if you have symptoms is one way to help us slow the spread.

Symptoms can include:

Cough
Fever
Sore throat
Shortness of breath
Chills
Loss of taste or smell
If you want to assess yourself, you can do it online. If your symptoms call for it, arrange your testing ahead of time – don’t go in first.

Yellowknife: 867-767-9120 or www.nthssa.ca/appointments
Inuvik: 867-490–2225
Fort Smith: 867-621-2233 or 867-872-0562
Hay River: 867-874-7201 (between 08:30-16.30). After hours call Emergency Department at (867) 874-8050
Other Communities can call their local health centres
It can take up to one week to get the result. Your health care provider will notify you once the results are in and will provide further advice at that time. While waiting for your results, you will need to continue to self-isolate until 14 days are up, or until your symptoms have ended – whichever is longest.

If your symptoms are severe, call 9-1-1.

Testing Note
Testing numbers will be updated in the morning when the latest data is received. Notification of positive tests is a priority outweighing the parsing of new data.

News Type: Advisories
YELLOWKNIFE 7 April 2020 – The Office of the Chief Public Health Officer (OCPHO) recognizes the evolving discussion on the use of face coverings to slow the spread of COVID-19.

The OCPHO now recommends residents use re-usable or disposable cloth face coverings when in public places.

Residents of the NWT are advised that materials available from home can be used to create effective, do-it-yourself face coverings.

Purpose of the Advice
While face coverings cannot prevent all contact with virus-containing droplets, they have been found to be effective in limiting the ability of these droplets to spread further from someone who may not be aware they have the virus.

This is a way to help each other help ourselves – if everyone wears face coverings while in public, we can limit the spread of COVID-19.

Previous Recommendations and Orders Apply
This does NOT replace the need for everyone to

keep distance of at least two metres apart,
stay home if you’re feeling even a little bit sick,
avoid touching your face
wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds using soap and water or use alcohol based sanitizer when putting on the mask and taking it off
clean & disinfect contaminated high touch surfaces and
cover your mouth in your elbow if you cough or sneeze if not wearing a facial covering. 
Limitations of Advice
This advice is intended for the general public, not employers.

Employers are responsible for completing their own risk assessments, having their own exposure control plans, and providing the right protective equipment based on those assessments. Please consult WSCC as needed.

Non-medical masks or facial coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

How to Wear a Cloth Face Covering
Cloth face coverings must:

Fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face
Be secured with ties or ear loops
Include multiple layers of fabric
Allow for breathing without restriction
Be able to be washed and machine dried without damage or change to shape with hot temperatures
If cloth material is not available then disposable material such as multiple layers of tissue and paper towels can be used but should be thrown out after each use
Use a clean covering each time
Put used coverings in a clean plastic bag and wash between uses
What do I Need?
There are many ways to create effective fabric masks. At-minimum, we recommend:

At least two 10 x 6 inches of 100% cotton. Acotton blend may be used if 100% cotton is not available. Polyester or nylon is not recommended
Material to create loops to go around your ears – fabric or rubber bands are common
Facial tissue, paper towel or coffee filters
For some approaches, a sewing machine is useful, but many sew-free methods exist.

Yellowknife — April 10, 2020Ministers' Statements and Speeches
First of all I want to recognize what you all already know, that all Northwest Territories businesses are making difficult decisions as they implement what is being asked of them to limit the spread of COVID-19 across our territory.

The Government of the Northwest Territories recognize this.  

We acknowledge that it is happening at a cost to business owners and entrepreneurs in the North; and we will continue to seek out, identify, and facilitate ways to support your efforts and address these challenges.

Today, Dr. Kandola is implementing new orders around Mining and Oil and Gas. These companies have worked closely with our public health officials to implement many of these measures as advice already. 

I want to emphasize that these are not measures that begin today. This mine order captures many of the precautions and safety protocols that mineral and petroleum companies have already put in place through their own efforts, and following the guidance of Public Health Officials from across the country.

I want to thank our resource companies in particular for working with us and taking extraordinary measures to protect their workforce and to committing to operate safely for as long as they can. 

Through this COVID-19 pandemic, our resources companies have proven themselves to be strong corporate citizens, and protocols have been in place to ensure the health and safety of our residents.

For instance, all transient employees entering the Northwest Territories are being screened with temperature testing, questionnaires, and pre-departure screening calls.  If an employee or contractor shows signs of illness or has a higher exposure risk, they are told to remain at home.

Charter aircraft flights have been introduced as much as possible to separate the travel of northern and southern workers and to reduce or eliminate interactions with commercial airline travellers. Charter flights protocols now include enhanced cleaning of aircraft, changes to or elimination of food and beverage services, and physical distancing measures.

On sites, companies have been following enhanced hygiene and cleaning awareness and practices for several weeks now. Social distancing measures have been incorporated for safety meetings, transportation, all work spaces, and in dining halls and accommodations. As much as possible, southern workers are being segregated from northern workers. 

All operators have also established dedicated quarantine facilities and practices. 

Companies will quarantine and treat any worker with COVID-19 symptoms. Medical personnel are on site to deal with situations that occur, and there will be no hesitation in using medevac services should advance medical care be deemed necessary.

Our resource companies have worked to inform their immediate staff of the precautions that are being taken.  They have also worked to inform their communities and Indigenous IBA partners regularly, as well as reach out to see what the community needs are and help in the ways that they can during these tough times.  

Similarly, the Premier and I have also taken steps to inform and advise our territory’s leaders of the extraordinary steps and initiatives being taken at these sites.

The situation is evolving quickly across Canada which is why these additional measures are needed. By implementing these orders, we continue to ensure the right precautions are in-place to protect NWT residents from the risks of having a southern transient workforce entering the territory.

It is our goal to reduce the risks that exists from COVID-19. We recognize that this is and will be as much of an economic crisis as it is a health one.

But we are assured that the precautions that are being taken mean our remote work sites are as safe as they can be.   With the restrictions and considerations that have been put in place, our government is supportive of continued operations at worksites that have chosen to follow this path.

I would also like to recognize the importance of the resource sector to the North, now and in the future.  This includes not just our mining industry, but also our advanced project and exploration companies. 

I want to reassure businesses and residents that the Government of the Northwest Territories understands the challenges you are faced with and takes this situation very seriously. 

Safety is our number one priority, but next to that is ensuring that our economy remains healthy and people feel secure.

I would now like to turn it over to Dr. Kandola to explain the details of the Orders being addressed today.",Office of the Chief Public Health Officer,Mining and Oil and Gas Companies,"Katrina Nokleby: News Conference, New Orders Announced in the NWT to Protect Against COVID-19",https://www.gov.nt.ca/en/newsroom/katrina-nokleby-news-conference-new-orders-announced-nwt-protect-against-covid-19,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,1.0,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yellowknife — April 10, 2020Public Service Announcement
YELLOWKNIFE (April 10, 2020) – NWT Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Kami Kandola today took action to protect NWT residents with two new binding public health Orders.

The announcement comes after forming a new Compliance and Enforcement Taskforce to track down and investigate complaints about those not following the rules of the Public Health Act or public health Orders.

Order on Mines and Oil and Gas Remote Camps to Protect Against the COVID-19 Pandemic

Dr. Kandola has ordered several measures to protect public health and continue safe operations at all mining and oil and gas projects in the Northwest Territories.

The measures apply to all companies and employers operating in the sectors – parent corporations and contractors alike.

Several measures also apply to employees.

This order excludes the Giant Mine Remediation project in Yellowknife. If this site is not staffed appropriately, the territory risks significant environmental damage.

The Order is effective as of 12pm on Friday April 10. 

 

Order Bans All Gatherings, Formalizes Closure of Certain Businesses

Dr. Kandola bans all indoor gatherings effective April 11.

A gathering is defined as a group of people of any size who do not live in the same household who are not able to maintain social (physical) distance indoors.

This means no visitors inside any home. And it means if you are helping care for someone in your community, you must limit your time inside their living space to an absolute minimum.

This would include activities like:

House parties
Funerals
Meetings
Feasts
Church services
Team sports 
Gathering of up to 10 people will be allowed only outdoors as long as social (physical) distance of at least two metres (six feet) can be maintained. This distance must be maintained throughout the duration of these activities.

Additionally, the advice on certain businesses closing has now been clarified and turned into an enforceable Order.

While our business community has cooperated and closed based on our advice, this Order will formalize this requirement and also ensure no businesses face barriers when applying for relief from the federal government.

Yellowknife — April 17, 2020News Releases
If you’re in the Northwest Territories, dialing 8-1-1 is your connection to COVID-19 information and services.

The new Service NWT COVID Support Line means residents can use one easy number to reach the established self-isolation, enforcement, and regional centre accommodations lines.

The line also has staff to provide callers with accurate information about COVID-19 and how it relates to residents of the NWT. The operators will assist the caller by:

Answering questions about COVID-19.
Determining if they should contact their local health centre to arrange for testing using the assessment guide.
Accepting credible, specific complaints of individuals not following public health orders for further consideration.
Providing them contact info to local health care providers and resources.
Providing contact information to other services as requested to help them during this time of physical distancing and self-isolation.


Other staff will also be able to provide information on what services are still available in their communities. 

8-1-1 is not:
A resource for clinical advice – if clinical advice is required, we encourage residents to contact their primary health care provider or local health centre
A triage system to determine order of priority of who will be seen in a health centre or hospital
A source of pharmaceutical information – we encourage everyone to contact their local pharmacy and/or health care professional if they have questions about their medication.
The lines will be staffed from 8am-8pm, with the exception of the Protect NWT enforcement line, which will have on-call staff available 24 hours a day. All lines will run seven-days-a-week.

Interpretation services will be available for those who need it.

This will allow all NWT residents to get all their COVID-19 questions answered at one easily-remembered number.

 

Quotes

“Government should be as accessible as possible – especially in crises like we face today. The Service NWT COVID Support Line will help unify our services under one portal, and get our residents the help they need throughout this pandemic.”

-Diane Thom, Minister of Health and Social Services

 

“We are here to support our residents. The Service NWT COVID Support Line allows us to provide answers to our residents and help keep us all safe and healthy.”

-Caroline Cochrane, Premier of NWT, Minister of Municipal and Community Affairs

 

Quick facts

Callers will be walked through the online NWT COVID19 Self-Assessment tool to determine if they should visit a health care provider for further COVID-19 related assessment and testing.
This is not a replacement for calling public health units or local health care centres to arrange for testing for COVID-19.
As with other 811 services in their jurisdictions, the portal will only work within the Northwest Territories.
For those calling from outside the NWT, the toll free numbers for both accommodations and self-isolation planning remain active.
All toll free numbers may also still be called within the NWT.
In addition to calling 811, people may also email credible, specific complaints about failures to follow public health orders to protectnwt@gov.nt.ca.

Yellowknife — April 22, 2020Ministers' Statements and Speeches
It is undoubtedly good news that at this time, our territory has no active cases of COVID-19, and our last confirmed case reported two-and-a-half weeks ago.

But as we respond to COVID-19, it’s important we both look at the facts, and remember our history.

We know that there are second and perhaps even third waves in Canada expected before we get a vaccine.

We know from history, those additional waves are often more deadly and widespread than the first. So even if Canada’s first curve flattens, we are far from through this.

And the fact is, the biggest risk to our territory is the situation across Canada – and right now, Canada’s cases continue to grow significantly each day in spite of testing rates far lower than our own.

The only way for us to keep our territory in containment through three waves across Canada is to be very careful in how we manage our response over this time.

We understand that our current levels of restriction cannot remain forever, but we also need to be very deliberate in how we weigh all of the evidence.

We are looking at infection rates, deaths, regional outbreaks, transmission dynamics, growing worries about asymptomatic spread, and rapidly evolving research we are getting all the time.

And from that data, we are looking at ways loosening our restrictions only where it makes the most sense.

We are formulating a plan for moving forward with all the information we have, and will be speaking in greater detail in the near future.",Office of the Chief Public Health Officer,,"Dr. Kami Kandola, Opening Remarks, Weekly Media Briefing, COVID-19",https://www.gov.nt.ca/en/newsroom/dr-kami-kandola-opening-remarks-weekly-media-briefing-covid-19,1.0,,,,,,,,,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was a difficult decision that was not made lightly. The situation involving COVID-19 continues to evolve and the regions made the decision, based on discussions with Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health, to adopt a low-risk approach for students and chaperones. I fully support this direction.

Government introduced the travel protocols today, March 13, to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the province.

To date, there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nova Scotia.

Health-care workers, teachers, civil servants and other public sector employees who travel anywhere outside Canada will have to stay at home/self-isolate away from the public for 14 days after returning to the country. These measures also apply to students of Nova Scotia public schools and children in regulated child care centres who have travelled with their families, even if their parents or caregivers are not public sector employees.

“While we are fortunate to have no cases of COVID-19 in the province, we expect to see cases here very soon,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “We all need to do our part to reduce the spread, protect our most vulnerable and keep Nova Scotians healthy and safe.”
The private sector is encouraged to take the same approach and support employees to self-isolate for 14 days after travelling outside Canada.

The chief medical officer of health is also encouraging individuals, employers and community organizations to limit social gatherings to no more than 150 people to limit spread. This could include events like weddings, church services, movie theatres and concerts. This measure will help protect vulnerable Nova Scotians who are at greatest risk and will be reassessed as the situation evolves.

The province is also working with the federal government to delay the start of the cruise ship season.

Nova Scotians should think about additional measures they can take to help reduce the spread of COVID-19, such as:
avoiding close contact with others (keeping at least two metres or roughly six feet apart)
avoiding crowds and gatherings like parties and other group activities
staying home if ill, especially if you have a fever and or a new cough
Nova Scotians can find the most accurate, up-to-date information, including what to do if you are feeling unwell, at https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/

Quick Facts:
Nova Scotia has no confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of March 13 with 226 negative tests completed
travel advice from the Public Health Agency of Canada says anyone who travels to Hubei province in China, Iran or Italy must self-isolate for 14 days upon return to Canada
Nova Scotia’s Health Protection Act gives the chief medical officer of health the authority to give advice to protect public health and decrease risk to public health presented by communicable diseases such as COVID-19

2020-03-15,Canada,Nova Scotia,All,2.0,1.0,,Government Website,"Nova Scotia announced the province’s first three presumptive cases of novel coronavirus (COVID-19), today, March 15. The province is also taking further measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19.

The cases are not connected and are travel related. The individuals followed all the proper procedures when they started to feel unwell.

“My thoughts are with the individuals affected and I wish them a speedy and thorough recovery. Now, more than ever, all Nova Scotians must follow public health direction – that’s how we will reduce the spread of this virus in our province,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “We need to work together to protect our most vulnerable.”
Two individuals are in the Halifax Regional Municipality and one is in Kings County. All three are managing their symptoms at home in self-isolation. Details include:
a female in her 60’s, who returned to Halifax from Australia on March 8.
a male in his late 50’s, who recently attended a conference in California and returned to Halifax on March 13.
a male in his 30’s, who returned to Halifax on March 10 following travel throughout Europe.
Public health has been in contact with these individuals and those who have come in close contact with them are also being directed to self-isolate at home, away from the public, for 14 days.

Additional prevention measures for Nova Scotians are in effect immediately under the authority of the Health Protection Act and include:
long-term care facilities closed to visitors effectively immediately
public schools closed for two weeks following March Break (weeks of March 23 and March 30) and then will be reassessed
regulated child care centres closed March 17 to April 3 and then will be reassessed
March break camps cancelled

Nova Scotians should not leave the province and only leave home for essential items and services.

A state of emergency gives government broad powers to do whatever is necessary for the safety and protection of Nova Scotians.

“These decisions were not made lightly and should signal to Nova Scotians the seriousness of what’s before us,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “These orders may seem harsh but they are absolutely necessary. We all have a moral and legal obligation to obey if we want to bring the spread of COVID-19 under control.”
Under the state of emergency:
Nova Scotia borders will tighten to travellers and all entry points (land, sea, air) will be closely managed starting Monday, March 23, at 6 a.m., Nova Scotians should only leave if essential. Anyone entering the province will be stopped, questioned and told to self-isolate for 14 days. Exemptions for cross-border travel include healthy workers in trades and transportations sectors who move goods and people (e.g. truck drivers); healthy people going to work (e.g. health-care workers); and people travelling into the province for essential health services (e.g. chemotherapy treatment)
effective immediately, provincial parks, beaches and tourist attractions are closed. Provincial trails will remain open for exercise. Gathering limits and social distancing guidelines must be followed
police will be authorized to enforce orders under the Health Protection Act. If Nova Scotians and businesses do not practice social distancing and self-isolation, they will face fines of $1,000 for individuals and $7,500 for businesses. Multiple fines can be given each day an individual or business fails to comply. Police can also enforce offences under the Emergency Management Act. For example, fines for charging higher than fair market prices for goods and services
there are several groups who are essential and exempt from gathering limits. They include but are not limited to grocery stores, gas stations and pharmacies. If possible, one person per family should be designated to do these tasks. Other groups include construction sites, health-care services, community services (e.g. child protection), criminal justice services and law enforcement
New orders in effect under the Health Protection Act include:
effective immediately, social gatherings of more than five people are prohibited
any workplace or business that is not deemed essential can remain open as long as a two-metre or six-foot distance can be maintained. Workspaces must also be cleaned and disinfected at a minimum of twice daily or as required and employees follow proper hygiene
dentists can no longer practice dentistry in their offices unless they deem it necessary to perform an emergency dental procedure in the best interest of the patient’s health (in effect March 21)
“This is a significant adjustment for all of us and people are understandably anxious about the changes in our daily lives,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health. “Nova Scotians must follow public health direction - practice good hygiene, keep a social distance of six feet and self-isolate for 14 days if you have travelled outside the province or are feeling unwell. It’s up to all of us.”
Seven new cases were identified on Saturday, March 21. All are travel-related or connected to an earlier case. To date, Nova Scotia has 28 positive test results and 2088 negative cases. The 28 individuals affected range in age from late-teens to mid-70’s. Two cases are hospitalized.

The QEII Health Sciences Centre’s Microbiology Lab is now certified to report positive and negative tests for COVID-19. Tests no longer have to be sent to the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg.

“Keeping Nova Scotians safe and healthy is our number one job. Everything we are doing, we are doing to keep you safe,” said Premier McNeil. “We all need to keep working together, support one another and make sure we are following the public health advice. That is the only way we can control the spread of this virus.”
Measures announced today include:
increased testing for COVID-19 -- public health officials have begun testing all close contacts of positive cases
lab capacity is doubling to accommodate increased testing
expanding virtual care for physicians, nurse practitioners and others so they can offer appointments to patients through telephone or video, minimizing the need to leave the house; more than 80 providers have signed up for video so far
811 has increased staff and technology and is now answering 50 per cent more calls; on April 3, 811 will again double its capacity
enhanced infection control measures at hospitals to protect health-care workers and the public include reassigning and adding new staff to increase the frequency of cleaning and disinfection; focusing on high-risk areas and high-traffic areas and high-touch surfaces; using stronger cleaning products
regulated health professions can only stay open for emergency or urgent cases or to provide virtual care (excluding doctors, pharmacists, nurse practitioners, nurses and paramedics) as long as they can meet social distancing requirements in their waiting room or other non-clinical areas and follow the cleaning protocol
non-regulated health professions (such as naturopaths) must close. One exception is podiatrists who must follow the directive related to regulated health professions
Access Centres and Registry of Motor Vehicle Offices will start to resume operations in a scaled back, limited contact business model. Staff working out of Access Centres and Registry of Motor Vehicle offices in Amherst, Bridgewater, Dartmouth, Kentville, Stellarton, Sydney and Yarmouth will be available to help people with urgent matters by calling 1-800-670-4357. In addition, government has extended deadlines for more vehicle permits, registrations and renewals until Aug.31. Drop-off boxes for applicable services will also be available at Access Centres in Amherst, Bridgewater, Dartmouth, Kentville, Stellarton, Sydney and Yarmouth. Many of the services are also available online.
Essential service sectors in Nova Scotia, which are exempt from the five-person-or-fewer gathering rules, have been clarified and are:
health
food, agri-food and fisheries
transportation, including trucking, rail and transit
construction and manufacturing
IT, telecommunications and critical infrastructure
public services, such as police, fire and ambulances
Individual business in these sectors must still maintain social distancing and other public health protocols.

“We need your help to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” said Dr. Strang. “It is critically important to wash your hands, practise social distancing and self-isolate if you need to. It’s also important to be truthful in your interactions with health-care workers and don’t call 911 unless you have an emergency. Working together we can protect our communities and our most vulnerable citizens.”
Ten new cases were identified Monday, March 23. The cases are travel-related or connected to earlier reported cases. Several of the new cases are connected to groups or families who have returned to Nova Scotia following travel outside of Canada. None of these cases are from spread within the community.

The 51 individuals affected range in age from under 10 to mid-70s. Cases have been identified in all parts of the province. One individual remains in hospital. One individual has recovered and their case of COVID-19 is considered resolved.

Public health has been in contact with these individuals and is working to identify others who may have come in close contact with them. Those individuals are also being directed to self-isolate at home, away from the public, for 14 days.

To date, Nova Scotia has 2,474 negative test results and 51 confirmed cases.

Anyone who has travelled outside of Nova Scotia must self-isolate for 14 days. If you have travelled outside of Nova Scotia or been in close contact with someone who has travelled and are experiencing fever or new cough you should complete the online questionnaire before calling 811.

“Our health-care system is being examined from top to bottom to ensure we are ready for COVID-19,” said Premier McNeil. “Our hospital administrators, our doctors and nurses, cleaning staff – everyone is focused on containing the spread. But none of this matters if you don’t stay at home and avoid social gatherings.”
Dr. Strang said testing to confirm COVID-19 is being expanded to include:
anyone referred by 811 to an assessment centre
all close contacts of people who test positive
people in hospital that meet the criteria for testing
An alternate phone line has been set up to ensure health-care workers are virus-free, able to safely provide care and not burden the 811 system. The service deals with NSHA and IWK staff, home-care and long-term care providers, pharmacists and health providers in First Nations communities.

“Over the next two weeks as travellers come home, we need to control and limit spread of this virus,” said Dr. Strang. “We can do this by strictly following public health measures – physical distancing and self-isolation.”
Other measures announced today include:
reservations for the 2020 camping season are on hold; an announcement will made when they are available
open fires are banned for any purpose in woods or within 305 metres of woods in any part of the province and will be in effect until May 15 (the public can report wildfires by calling 911 in an emergency or by calling 1-800-565-2224)

While most people are being told not to go to work, our staff and physicians are showing up every day to ensure Nova Scotians get the care they need. As we continue to plan, prepare and respond to COVID-19, we appreciate your patience, support and co-operation with the important public health measures that are in place. This will help reduce the impact the pandemic will have on Nova Scotians and our health system. It is a difficult time for everyone, but if we all do our part, we will reduce the spread of the virus and life will return to normal sooner.
Dr. Brendan Carr, president and CEO, Nova Scotia Health Authority

Five occurred at the Northwood long-term care home in Halifax Regional Municipality. As well, a man in his 80s with underlying medical conditions died in the Western Zone; he was not a resident of a long-term care home.

“Our province is experiencing a tremendous amount of pain right now. Our thoughts are with everyone who has lost a loved one from this virus,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “We stand together to grieve those who have died and to support those who are in mourning.”

As of today, Nova Scotia has 865 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Fifteen new cases were identified Friday, April 24.

“With the weekend upon us, I ask everyone to remain vigilant. Please stay home as much as possible, wash your hands and maintain physical distance,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health. “Let’s be able to look back and know we did everything we could to stop this virus from hurting any more of our fellow Nova Scotians.”

The QEII Health Sciences Centre’s microbiology lab completed 965 Nova Scotia tests on April 24 and is operating 24-hours. Nova Scotia has conducted more COVID-19 tests per capita than any other province.

As of April 24, there were 10 licensed long-term care homes and unlicensed seniors’ facilities in Nova Scotia with cases of COVID-19, involving 191 residents and 90 staff. While most cases in Nova Scotia have been connected to travel or a known case, there is now community spread. That is why travel has been removed as a requirement for testing for COVID-19.

The list of symptoms being screened for has recently expanded. If you have two or more of the following symptoms, visit https://811.novascotia.ca to determine if you should call 811 for further assessment:

fever
new or worsening cough
sore throat
runny nose
headache
To date, Nova Scotia has 25,119 negative test results, 865 positive COVID-19 test results and 22 deaths. Confirmed cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. Eleven individuals are currently in hospital, three of those in ICU. Four hundred and twelve individuals have now recovered and their cases of COVID-19 are considered resolved. Cases have been identified in all parts of the province. A map and graphic presentation of the case data is available at https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/data .

Public health is working to identify and test people who may have come in close contact with the confirmed cases. Those individuals who have been confirmed are being directed to self-isolate at home, away from the public, for 14 days.

Anyone who has travelled outside Nova Scotia must self-isolate for 14 days. As always, any Nova Scotian who develops symptoms of acute respiratory illness should limit their contact with others until they feel better.

It is now more important than ever for Nova Scotians to strictly adhere to the public health orders and directives - practise good hygiene, maintain a physical distance of two metres or six feet from others, limit essential gatherings to no more than five people and stay at home as much as possible.

As a precautionary measure against COVID-19, the first seat on many Halifax Transit buses will be unavailable to riders. This is to exercise safe social distancing between operators and riders. This does not impact wheelchair-accessible seating.
For riders’ information, some Halifax Transit operators may be wearing masks. This is not a mandated requirement but a personal choice we support.

Steps are being taken to mitigate impacts on municipal services while also helping to reduce the spread of the disease.

The health and wellness of residents and employees is our main priority.

Effective Wednesday, March 18, Halifax Transit passengers will be asked to use the rear doors for boarding and exiting. For those who require the use of the ramp for accessibility, the front door will continue to be used. Regular ferry boarding service will remain in place.

Halifax Transit will suspend all fare collection on bus and ferry services effective Wednesday, March 18 as a result of the municipality’s commitment to safe social distancing.  

Halifax Transit has already taken measures to help reduce the spread of disease, including an increased frequency in wipe-downs of high-touch surfaces, making the first seat unavailable to riders on buses, limiting passengers on buses to seated passengers only, and limiting the number of ferry passengers to 50 per trip.

Ridership is down more than 43 per cent on conventional bus service, 51 per cent on ferry service and 67 per cent on Access-A-Bus service. Residents are being thanked for their continued cooperation in the effort to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19.

All transit services will continue to operate on a regular schedule at this time.

Changes in fare collection are in response to keeping the community safe from the spread of COVID-19, and are not intended to encourage increased use of transit services. Riders are asked to stay on buses and ferries for necessary trips only, and not to loiter.  

Residents and visitors who are feeling ill are asked to avoid using all transit services until their health has returned to normal.

The following steps were taken immediately:

All maintenance staff on the evening shift were sent home.
The Burnside Maintenance Department workspace was disinfected, with a particular focus on high-touch surfaces such as doorknobs, work surfaces, tools, etc.
Maintenance staff scheduled to work this morning were advised to not report for their shift.
Adjustments are being made in the shared work areas in the maintenance department to ensure safe social distancing is made easier for staff (e.g. spacing tables and chairs in lunchroom).

Today, Halifax Transit was advised that a bus operator has tested positive for COVID-19.

Halifax Transit is working with Public Health to investigate the situation.

The individual who tested positive has not been in the workspace since April 4. Since that time, all workspaces and vehicles, with which the individual was in contact, have already undergone cleanings as part of Halifax Transit’s enhanced protocol.

Halifax Transit continues to engage with Public Health regularly to take direction regarding all the necessary steps required to safeguard the health of employees and residents.

Public Health has been in contact with the person who tested positive for COVID-19, and will complete contact tracing to identify all those who have been in close contact with the individual. Public Health will contact those who must self-isolate and will test anyone who they deem to require testing.

Halifax Transit has been designated by the Province of Nova Scotia an essential service under the current provincial state of emergency. In light of this direction by the province, the municipality will continue delivering the highest level of service that can be reasonably provided – while also continuing to take steps that help minimize the spread of COVID-19 and make buses as safe an environment as possible in the circumstances. Residents are reminded that the level of transit service provided will continue to be adjusted as necessary, based on available operational resources.

Over the past several weeks, many measures have been taken by Halifax Transit to help reduce the spread of disease, including:

fare collection is suspended on bus and ferry services to support the municipality’s commitment to safe social distancing
increased frequency in wipe-downs of high-touch surfaces
making the first 7-10 seats immediately behind the operator unavailable to riders on buses (this does not impact accessible seating)
limiting passengers on buses to seated passengers only
limiting the number of ferry passengers to 50 per trip
Buses and ferries continue to operate on a reduced schedule.

Coronavirus: Travellers Remain Vigilant

COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that emerged in late 2019 and has now spread to a number of countries. Coronaviruses can cause a range of symptoms from the common cold to more severe breathing problems.

The Department of Health encourages Nunavummiut to remain vigilant when travelling outside of the country. It is important for all travellers to monitor their health for fever, new or worsening cough, and difficulty breathing when returning to Nunavut.

There are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nunavut. As of March 2, 2020, approximately 27 cases of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) have been confirmed in Canada. More than 80,000 cases have been reported abroad, with the majority of these in China.

The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) has assessed the public health risk associated with COVID-19 as low for Canada. Public health risk is continually reassessed as new information becomes available. The Department of Health is in close contact with the Public Health Agency of Canada and with provincial and territorial partners to share information. Currently there are significant preparedness activities underway, and the international situation is being closely monitored.

If you have been travelling through an affected region and you start having symptoms of COVID-19, or you believe you may have been exposed to an individual with the virus, immediately isolate yourself from others and call your local health centre. Describe your symptoms and travel history.

You can also do your part to prevent the spread of infections by washing your hands frequently, covering your mouth with your sleeve when you cough or sneeze, and avoiding contact with others when you are not feeling well.

Government of Nunavut response to COVID-19

IQALUIT, Nunavut (March 13, 2020) – Dr. Michael Patterson, Nunavut’s Chief Public Health Officer, today outlined additional preventive measures and the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) current preparation in response to COVID-19.

“While there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nunavut, it is important that all measures are taken to minimize risks for Nunavummiut,” said Dr. Patterson. “The additional preventive steps we are taking today and our whole-of-government approach are aligned with nation-wide initiatives and will ensure the GN is ready should the situation change.”
Until further notice, Nunavummiut are asked to avoid international travel and reduce non-essential travel within Canada. In-territory travel is not restricted at this time. All non-essential duty travel for GN employees is cancelled, effective immediately. International school-sponsored trips have been cancelled.

GN public events will be cancelled. Nunavummiut should avoid mass gatherings and refrain from going to community airports unless required. Nunavummiut are encouraged to limit visiting.

As of today, sick notes will no longer be issued by Health until further notice. Health also recommends that organizations in Nunavut waive the requirement for sick notes. The GN waived sick notes requirements for employees last week.

The Department of Health has a long-standing territorial pandemic plan. Health centres in all communities have the necessary supplies and are ready to respond. Increased sanitary measures are in effect in GN departments and airports. Schools across the territory have been directed on enhanced cleaning protocols, hygiene and disinfecting measures and implementing non-sharing protocols.

The Territorial Emergency Management Committee made up of senior Health staff, representatives in all regions of Nunavut, along with Nunavut Emergency Management, monitors the status of all territorial health facilities and coordinates Health’s response to COVID-19 within the territory.

Additionally, GN departments are meeting daily to coordinate their preparedness efforts. Health is actively working with partners across the country to ensure a coordinated response.

“I understand this is an uncertain, evolving situation. It is normal to be concerned, but we are prepared. The best course of action is to stay aware and use preventive measures: if you are sick, stay home; observe travel restrictions and listen to the advice of health professionals.” said Dr. Patterson.

Temporary Nunavut-wide school and daycare closures as precaution to COVID-19

IQALUIT, Nunavut (March 16, 2020) – Dr. Michael Patterson, Nunavut’s Chief Public Health Officer, today recommended the temporary closure of all schools and daycares in Nunavut to limit any potential spread of COVID-19. These closures are effective starting Tuesday, March 17 for a three-week period.

“It is with an over-abundance of caution that I have made this recommendation,” said Dr. Patterson. “While there are still no confirmed cases in Nunavut, this approach aligns with preventive measures in several jurisdictions across the country and ensures the potential spread of COVID-19 is mitigated.”

During this period, affected Government of Nunavut employees will be accommodated and are encouraged to work flex hours or work from home.

The best way to be prepared for COVID-19 is to be aware, and wash your hands, often, for at least 20 seconds; cough and sneeze into your elbow; stay home if you feel sick; and call your health centre if you have symptoms. Families should avoid group gatherings and remain at home as much as possible.

“We are taking no chances with the health of Nunavummiut, and need to ensure that we take every possible precaution,” said Premier Joe Savikataaq. “Stay home and limit visiting, especially with Elders. Now is the time for our communities to show resiliency and help one another. If you are well, call to check on each other and share what you have, like we have always done. During this uncertain time, our kindness and consideration of others matters more than ever.”

News Release

IQALUIT, Nunavut (March 18, 2020) – Premier Joe Savikataaq today announced that the Government of Nunavut (GN) will begin transition to have non-essential public servants work from home, in light of the rapidly-changing COVID-19 situation. These measures will fully come into effect by end of day, Friday, March 20.

“The health and well-being of our employees is critical. In keeping with our advice to practice social distancing, we are shifting our public service to work from home,” said Premier Savikataaq. “This is an evolving situation, so we want to have staff prepared to work remotely, where possible. Essential service positions will continue to work in-office, as much as possible.”

GN employees will work with their supervisors to find ways to perform duties and job requirements away from the office.  

“We ask for patience and understanding as we continue to provide necessary programs and services for Nunavummiut. There may be delays, and certain non-essential programs and services will have to be suspended temporarily. Rest assured, we are working hard and making sure Nunavummiut are taken care of during this time,” said Premier Savikataaq.

Deputy Minister of Family Services update regarding student travel back to Nunavut, March 23, 2020

Family Services, Health, Education, and Community & Government Services have been working together to ensure the safe return of students from southern-based educational institutions to their home communities across Nunavut.

Those students who wish to return home now, will require immediate isolation in central points for a 14-day period prior to an arranged charter plane to return to Nunavut. The two host facilities for students will be located in Ottawa and Winnipeg. Kivalliq and Kitikmeot Region students will muster in Winnipeg to commence a 14-day period once the last student arrives in to the facility. Baffin/Qikiqtani Region students will muster in an Ottawa facility, and likewise – once the last student arrives into the facility a 14-day period will commence. A charter from each of those cities will then return the students to Nunavut.

During the period of quarantine in Ottawa and Winnipeg, the students will have access to tools to complete their studies, will have access to health professionals who will check in to ensure their health needs are met. (There will also be an oversight group tasked with monitoring and addressing issues coming out of this operation)

Message to Students: If you wish to get home as soon as possible, please be packed and ready to get to one of the two mustering points. There will be maximum baggage amounts for both the commercial airlines and for the final chartered flight.

For those with special needs or requirements, they should be identified with the travel team member that contacts you.

And for those that are remaining to complete their terms in place, but wish to return home afterward, FANS will cover until the first available arrangements can be made home.

It is my understanding that for the other populations returning to Nunavut, there are avenues to take. For the travel coverage, usual FANS process would continue.

Emails will be sent out to students today asking them to provide FANS the necessary level of details and giving them the information, they need.

Chief Public Health Officer update

It has now been over two weeks since the travel ban into Nunavut was put into place.

This means that many Nunavummiut currently in the south are coming to the end of their mandatory 14-day isolation periods. It is time for many of these residents to return home.

The mandatory rules we put in place in our isolation sites are very strict. I think it is important to remind everyone that for 14 days, residents are:

Confined in their hotel rooms most of the day.
Have no physical contact with other residents undergoing isolation and no physical contact with the general population.
Are allowed only monitored outings on hotel grounds.
Must have daily health check-ins with on-site nurses.
Are held responsible if they break isolation.
There are no exceptions.

These measures are a first step and they ensure Nunavummiut who want to come home, as well as their families and communities, remain healthy and safe.

The second step is bringing residents home. I want to take a moment and outline this process:

48 hours before anticipated departure, travellers are informed on the clearance and travel process.
The day before departure, the nurses on-site review each traveller’s daily check-in logs to make sure they complied with the isolation rules. The nurses conduct a final in-person assessment to ensure travellers are healthy and show no symptoms of COVID-19.
The assessments and results are sent to my office – and a decision to clear a traveller for the scheduled return home is made and a letter approving travel is issued. Residents need both the letter and a proof of residency to return to the territory.
The day of departure, residents approved for travel are transported from the hotel to the airport via a private shuttle, sanitized thoroughly before use.
The Government of Nunavut worked with airlines to minimize, to the greatest possible extent, the risk of anyone being exposed to COVID-19 during their travel back to the territory.
Airports have enhanced cleaning, sanitation and passenger procedures throughout the check-in and security process that ensure physical distancing. As an additional precaution, residents will also undergo an airline health check prior to boarding.
Until they arrive at their final destination in Nunavut, residents remain bound by the isolation agreement they signed the day they accepted to enter the isolation sites.
Residents will travel to Nunavut on both chartered and scheduled flights:
Residents travelling on chartered flights are shuttled directly to their airplane for boarding and take-off. Once in Nunavut, they will be chartered to their final in-territory destination.
Residents travelling on scheduled flights are dropped off at the airport, where they are met and guided by airline employees to check-in, through security, to the boarding area and finally on the plane. They do not come in contact with other travellers during this process and remain bound by their isolation agreement.
I want to thank our returning residents for going through these drastic measures to protect their communities and Nunavut.

As we welcome back friends, family members, and loved ones, it is more important than ever to follow the rules: All social gatherings are still banned, and all Nunavummiut, including those just returning to their home communities, are expected to do their part to keep Nunavut safe. Practice strict social distancing, stay home when possible, avoid contact with individuals outside of your household, and monitor your health.

Public Health Officer statement:
Use of COVID-19 diagnostic equipment in Nunavut

As many are aware, Agnico Eagle Mine has brought COVID-19 diagnostic equipment to Rankin Inlet. This equipment will be used to test mine staff for COVID-19.

At this time there is no evidence that screening in this fashion is a substitute for 14 days of isolation. This is why Nunavut, and every other Canadian jurisdiction, is using 14 days of isolation after exposure or travel. As a result, I have informed management of Agnico Eagle Mines that these tests do not change the current requirement for mine staff to stay out of the town of Rankin Inlet.

The Department of Health is committed to improving and protecting the health of all Nunavummiut. For COVID-19 this means having testing equipment that meets Canadian standards and can be deployed to every community in Nunavut. The equipment used by AEM does not meet these criteria. If the Department of Health were to commit to using devices like this, we would not improve access to COVID testing for all Nunavummiut.

The Department of Health continues to work on acquiring diagnostic capability that can be rapidly deployed and will provide quick access to results for all Nunavummiut.

The combination of machines we continue to pursue will not only allow testing in all communities but will also improve our ability to rapidly diagnose a number of other infectious diseases that threaten Nunavummiut on a regular basis.

Testing for COVID-19 at the wrong time can produce incorrect results and create a false sense of reassurance.

 

 

As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:

03 April 2020
Department of Education Services, April 3, 2020

On Tuesday, April 7, school staff will be able to access schools on a voluntary basis should they wish to prepare learning packages for students.

The department has a working group developing guidelines for teachers identifying grade-specific areas of focus for learning packages. Packages may look different for each student.

School access is for operational purposes only and not for recreation or other non-education-related activities.

The department has also provided all schools with health and safety protocols related to COVID-19, including respiratory etiquette, hand washing, and physical distancing.

Department of Education Services, March 31, 2020

Minister of Education update:

Since March 17, Nunavut schools have been closed to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. As a result, parents and caregivers have been asking for educational resources to help their children continue to learn.

Today I am announcing that the Department of Education has developed a learn-at-home website, Angirrami Ilinniarniq (angirrami.com). This website offers free access to some of the same educational resources used in our schools.

These include downloadable books and e-books for pre-school ages and up; educational audiobooks and animated videos; tips and activities for learning; and resources for managing stress and mental health.

There will also be links to download the department’s Inuktut language learning apps:

Uqausiit Pinnguarutiit has fun activities that support Inuit language shape and sound recognition, and vocabulary development.
Titirariuqsauti introduces Inuit language symbol sounds and printing paths. 
Qimirrunaut is the department’s new Inuktut e-book library app.
These apps are available for Android and iOS devices and can be downloaded from the Google Play or Apple App stores.

Angirrami Ilinniarniq provides links to other online educational resources on subjects such as science, math, history, and social studies. 

I want to also note that although the website launches today, new resources will be regularly added. The priority is to get our Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun resources online as quickly as possible. English and French resources will follow soon after.

All the resources found on this site were created by the Department of Education and its partners, including the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and the Representative for Children and Youth’s Office, as well as the Departments of Family Services, Health, Environment, and Economic Development and Transportation.

I want to thank all the students, parents, and caregivers for their patience. I know for many of you it has not been easy with schools and child care facilities closed. However, we must all do our part to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

I assure you that my department has been working hard to get this website ready as quickly as possible.

I encourage Nunavummiut to explore all the resources this website has to offer. Make learning a part of your daily routine!

Qujannamiik, quana, thank you, merci.

Department of Education Services, March 31, 2020

Today, the Department of Education Is launching a learn-at-home website, Angirrami Ilinniarniq (angirrami.com). This learn-at-home website developed by the Department of Education provides free access to help children and youth continue learning in their language during the school closure.

Upon recommendation from the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO), schools and daycare facility closures for students and children will be extended until end of day April 20. At that point and time, the CPHO will reassess and provide direction.

Chief Public Health Officer update

It has now been over two weeks since the travel ban into Nunavut was put into place.

This means that many Nunavummiut currently in the south are coming to the end of their mandatory 14-day isolation periods. It is time for many of these residents to return home.

The mandatory rules we put in place in our isolation sites are very strict. I think it is important to remind everyone that for 14 days, residents are:

Confined in their hotel rooms most of the day.
Have no physical contact with other residents undergoing isolation and no physical contact with the general population.
Are allowed only monitored outings on hotel grounds.
Must have daily health check-ins with on-site nurses.
Are held responsible if they break isolation.
There are no exceptions.

These measures are a first step and they ensure Nunavummiut who want to come home, as well as their families and communities, remain healthy and safe.

The second step is bringing residents home. I want to take a moment and outline this process:

48 hours before anticipated departure, travellers are informed on the clearance and travel process.
The day before departure, the nurses on-site review each traveller’s daily check-in logs to make sure they complied with the isolation rules. The nurses conduct a final in-person assessment to ensure travellers are healthy and show no symptoms of COVID-19.
The assessments and results are sent to my office – and a decision to clear a traveller for the scheduled return home is made and a letter approving travel is issued. Residents need both the letter and a proof of residency to return to the territory.
The day of departure, residents approved for travel are transported from the hotel to the airport via a private shuttle, sanitized thoroughly before use.
The Government of Nunavut worked with airlines to minimize, to the greatest possible extent, the risk of anyone being exposed to COVID-19 during their travel back to the territory.
Airports have enhanced cleaning, sanitation and passenger procedures throughout the check-in and security process that ensure physical distancing. As an additional precaution, residents will also undergo an airline health check prior to boarding.
Until they arrive at their final destination in Nunavut, residents remain bound by the isolation agreement they signed the day they accepted to enter the isolation sites.
Residents will travel to Nunavut on both chartered and scheduled flights:
Residents travelling on chartered flights are shuttled directly to their airplane for boarding and take-off. Once in Nunavut, they will be chartered to their final in-territory destination.
Residents travelling on scheduled flights are dropped off at the airport, where they are met and guided by airline employees to check-in, through security, to the boarding area and finally on the plane. They do not come in contact with other travellers during this process and remain bound by their isolation agreement.
I want to thank our returning residents for going through these drastic measures to protect their communities and Nunavut.

As we welcome back friends, family members, and loved ones, it is more important than ever to follow the rules: All social gatherings are still banned, and all Nunavummiut, including those just returning to their home communities, are expected to do their part to keep Nunavut safe. Practice strict social distancing, stay home when possible, avoid contact with individuals outside of your household, and monitor your health.

Public Health Officer statement:
Use of COVID-19 diagnostic equipment in Nunavut

As many are aware, Agnico Eagle Mine has brought COVID-19 diagnostic equipment to Rankin Inlet. This equipment will be used to test mine staff for COVID-19.

At this time there is no evidence that screening in this fashion is a substitute for 14 days of isolation. This is why Nunavut, and every other Canadian jurisdiction, is using 14 days of isolation after exposure or travel. As a result, I have informed management of Agnico Eagle Mines that these tests do not change the current requirement for mine staff to stay out of the town of Rankin Inlet.

The Department of Health is committed to improving and protecting the health of all Nunavummiut. For COVID-19 this means having testing equipment that meets Canadian standards and can be deployed to every community in Nunavut. The equipment used by AEM does not meet these criteria. If the Department of Health were to commit to using devices like this, we would not improve access to COVID testing for all Nunavummiut.

The Department of Health continues to work on acquiring diagnostic capability that can be rapidly deployed and will provide quick access to results for all Nunavummiut.

The combination of machines we continue to pursue will not only allow testing in all communities but will also improve our ability to rapidly diagnose a number of other infectious diseases that threaten Nunavummiut on a regular basis.

Testing for COVID-19 at the wrong time can produce incorrect results and create a false sense of reassurance.

 

 

As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:

17 April 2020
Department of Education Services, April 17, 2020

Minister of Education update:

Ullukkut,

The well-being and success of Nunavut’s children and youth is the top priority of the Department of Education. In these uncertain times, we want to make sure students have the opportunity to thrive, and to pursue any future path they desire.

With students’ well-being in mind, I am announcing that as of today, all schools in Nunavut will be closed to students for the rest of the 2019-20 school year.

This closure is supported by the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO).

Because students have already missed over a month of class time, it is even more important that all school staff report to work on April 21, 2020.

As in other provinces and territories, Nunavut’s school staff are vital to ensuring our students do not fall behind in their education.

The Department of Education has developed guidelines to help school staff prepare learning packages to meet the specific needs of their students. Staff will work with students and their families to determine how best to support learning.

This means that for our students in Kindergarten to Grade 9, teachers will prioritize literacy and numeracy, while strengthening the skills and knowledge that have been taught so far this school year.

For high school students, teachers and administrators will evaluate their individual situations. Some students may already have completed the credits they need to graduate. Others may need to complete specific courses to be eligible to graduate. Teachers may provide opportunities for students to upgrade their marks or earn the credits they need by completing suggested assignments and projects.

Teachers will review their students’ outcomes to date, align them with skills that need to be strengthened, and take into consideration what is possible for them to accomplish at home. There will be a strong focus on supporting health and wellness, literacy, and numeracy for all students. This includes household projects and activities that allow families to learn together, such as reading together, journal writing, and projects that draw on the creativity of students.

The Department is also aware that many families are currently on the land and may not be able to receive student learning packages. On-the-land activities like hunting and fishing complement student learning, and the department encourages these activities.

Realizing Nunavut’s technology limitations, especially in some of our smaller communities, students’ continued learning will not be entirely online. This means that students’ learning packages will take many forms -- some will be paper-based, some will be activity-based, and some will be electronic. However, all of them will give students an opportunity to further their learning.

Wherever possible, teachers will be asked to check in with families weekly, to see how they are progressing and if they need any extra support or resources. The best way to communicate -- either by phone, text, GN email, or through other online portals -- will be determined with students and families.

Beyond creating student learning packages, staff also will be supporting students by assessing their work prior to the school closure to determine final grades, and preparing year-end report cards.

To Nunavut’s high school students and their families, a reminder that all departmental exams are cancelled for the school year. For those Grade 12 students on track to graduate, I want to assure you that principals and teachers will work with you to ensure you complete any necessary requirements. We are here to help you succeed and realize your goals.

Finally, school staff will also plan and prepare for the 2020-21 school year, particularly with the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic in mind.

For school staff who have voluntarily returned to work and have already been preparing learning packages, many students and families recognize your hard work and expressed their appreciation. As a parent, and as Minister of Education, I want to express my sincere gratitude to you for your dedication and enthusiasm. Thank you for your efforts and commitment to Nunavut’s students.

We all want the best for our children and youth. The Department of Education appreciates the support and patience Nunavummiut and our education partners have shown during these unprecedented times. The uncertainty has not been easy, but we will make it through, together. Stay safe everyone.

Qujannamiik, quana, thank you, merci.

Department of Education Services

Students in Nunavut will not have class for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year.
School staff will continue to work to support learning at home until the end of the school year.
Students will be receiving learning packages from their schools to support learning at home.
School staff will connect with families over the coming weeks.
All high school diploma exams for this year are cancelled, and high school marks will be based on course work only.
All students will receive a year-end report card.
Department of Education Services, April 15, 2020

To ensure staff at licenced child care facilities continue to be paid, the Department of Education will fund parental fees for all licensed child care facilities up to April 21, 2020.

The Government of Nunavut has taken strict measures to minimize the spread of COVID-19, this is why child care facilities must remain closed until further notice.

Department of Education Services, April 8, 2020

Minister of Education update

Yesterday, the Department of Education sent a letter to all school staff about returning to work in their home communities on April 21, 2020. This is specific to STAFF ONLY, so that they can prepare and develop continuity of learning plans in the case the school closure is extended.

I want to clarify the numbers I provided yesterday – there are 1,185 staff who work in schools across the territory. Ninety-three (93) of these staff are currently out of the territory, making their way back to their home communities. This represents eight per cent (8%) of all school staff.

Teachers across the country are working hard to support learning at home for students so that they are not disadvantaged by the school closure. Our students deserve the same supports, and this is why we are asking teachers to work during this time.

Teachers returning to work will focus on supporting students in their education and their wellbeing by developing learning packages. This is particularly important for those students that do not have access to online resources and those who are on specialized learning plans.

School staff who may have travelled out of territory must undergo a mandatory 14-day isolation period in a GN-designated isolation hub in the south before returning to Nunavut. This is the same process that all Nunavut residents, FANS students, and medical travel patients returning to Nunavut have been following. This process was established under the orders of the Chief Public Health Officer.

Nunavut residents, including school staff, are responsible for their travel costs to return home to Nunavut. The GN is covering the cost of the isolation hubs for all Nunavut residents, including school staff.

All GN staff, including teachers, are expected to work from within the territory. We will address any requests from staff who currently are out-of-territory to work remotely on a case-by-case basis.

The Department of Education has been in continuous contact with the Nunavut Teachers’ Association (NTA) and the Coalition of Nunavut DEAs.

They both support the decision to bring teachers back to work to ensure that students can continue to learn and are supported during school closures.

Schools will only be reopened to students once the Chief Public Health Officer determines it is safe to do so. However, we need our staff back at work by April 21 to prepare for our students’ success and progress, whatever the next step may be.

Department of Education Services, April 7, 2020

As of April 7, teachers currently in-territory can go back to school on a voluntary basis, in order to start developing learning packages for students. Guidelines on the delivery of those packages to students are being finalised by the Department of Education.

All school staff are expected to return to work in their home communities on April 21, 2020. Teachers that are currently out of territory must undergo a 14-day isolation period in a designated isolation hub before returning to Nunavut. If teachers cannot begin their 14-day isolation period in time for their return on April 21, they must contact their principal and provide information on travel plans and correspondence with the isolation hubs to support any expected delays.

On April 21, a decision will be made according to the recommendation of the Chief Public Health Officer.

If school closures persist:

School staff will be required to resume operations and will be asked to develop continuity of learning plans for all students.
Teachers will be provided with clear guidance on how assessments, final report cards, and grade progression will be achieved.
If schools re-open:

School operations will resume as normal.
In both cases, departmental exams for high school students have been cancelled until the end of June.

Department of Education Services, April 3, 2020

On Tuesday, April 7, school staff will be able to access schools on a voluntary basis should they wish to prepare learning packages for students.

The department has a working group developing guidelines for teachers identifying grade-specific areas of focus for learning packages. Packages may look different for each student.

School access is for operational purposes only and not for recreation or other non-education-related activities.

The department has also provided all schools with health and safety protocols related to COVID-19, including respiratory etiquette, hand washing, and physical distancing.

Department of Education Services, March 31, 2020

Minister of Education update:

Since March 17, Nunavut schools have been closed to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. As a result, parents and caregivers have been asking for educational resources to help their children continue to learn.

Today I am announcing that the Department of Education has developed a learn-at-home website, Angirrami Ilinniarniq (angirrami.com). This website offers free access to some of the same educational resources used in our schools.

These include downloadable books and e-books for pre-school ages and up; educational audiobooks and animated videos; tips and activities for learning; and resources for managing stress and mental health.

There will also be links to download the department’s Inuktut language learning apps:

Uqausiit Pinnguarutiit has fun activities that support Inuit language shape and sound recognition, and vocabulary development.
Titirariuqsauti introduces Inuit language symbol sounds and printing paths. 
Qimirrunaut is the department’s new Inuktut e-book library app.
These apps are available for Android and iOS devices and can be downloaded from the Google Play or Apple App stores.

Angirrami Ilinniarniq provides links to other online educational resources on subjects such as science, math, history, and social studies. 

I want to also note that although the website launches today, new resources will be regularly added. The priority is to get our Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun resources online as quickly as possible. English and French resources will follow soon after.

All the resources found on this site were created by the Department of Education and its partners, including the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and the Representative for Children and Youth’s Office, as well as the Departments of Family Services, Health, Environment, and Economic Development and Transportation.

I want to thank all the students, parents, and caregivers for their patience. I know for many of you it has not been easy with schools and child care facilities closed. However, we must all do our part to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

I assure you that my department has been working hard to get this website ready as quickly as possible.

I encourage Nunavummiut to explore all the resources this website has to offer. Make learning a part of your daily routine!

Qujannamiik, quana, thank you, merci.

Department of Education Services, March 31, 2020

Today, the Department of Education Is launching a learn-at-home website, Angirrami Ilinniarniq (angirrami.com). This learn-at-home website developed by the Department of Education provides free access to help children and youth continue learning in their language during the school closure.

Upon recommendation from the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO), schools and daycare facility closures for students and children will be extended until end of day April 20. At that point and time, the CPHO will reassess and provide direction.

Department of Education Services, March 25, 2020

Ongoing services:

Bus service contracts will continue to be paid during the three-week school closure.
Department of Education Services, March 24, 2020

The Department of Education is supporting the Department of Family Services in coordinating the return of out of territory FANS students and their families to Nunavut.
The Department of Education is providing funds to licensed child care facilities to cover parental fees from March 17-April 7, 2020.
All licensed child care facilities in Nunavut that charge parental fees will qualify for the grant.
Funding will be processed and sent to licensed child care facilities by Friday, March 27, 2020.
During this time, parents will not be required to pay parental fees.

Chief Public Health Officer update

I’d like to give an update on the current status in Pond Inlet:

The patient is isolated, and still doing well.
The Rapid Response Team is in the community, and they are implementing containment and contact tracing.
As the team completes additional testing, there is the possibility that more positive cases may be confirmed in the community. This does not necessarily mean that there is community transmission and should not be cause for alarm. What this does mean is that the Rapid Response Team is doing their job, which is finding the virus and stopping it from spreading.
Containment is key, and right now it is our top priority.
As this process takes place, the Government of Nunavut will continue to support the community of Pond Inlet.
I also want to take a moment and thank the municipality of Pond Inlet and its residents for allowing me to answer their questions earlier today on the community radio.

Moving forward, I would like to remind all Nunavummiut, using the strongest possible terms, that every single social interaction carries a degree of risk. Despite all of the Government of Nunavut’s preventative measures, and the new containment measures now in place within Pond Inlet, it is impossible to reasonably predict where or when COVID-19 may be detected next.

I urge all Nunavummiut to exercise a high degree of caution, and to seriously consider these risks before participating in a gathering of any kind. If you deem it necessary to participate in gatherings, then please keep track of the people with whom you interact, as this information may be necessary in case contact tracing needs to be conducted in your community.

Health staff cannot get us through this alone. How well we do, and where we go from here, depends on the actions of every single Nunavummiut. Right now, the best way of slowing the spread of COVID-19 continues to be through social distancing and effective hygiene.

If everyone follows these rules together, we can put ourselves in the best position to make it through this uncertain time. It’s more important than ever that we be careful, responsible, kind, and supportive.

I’d like to thank Nunavummiut for their continued cooperation and understanding.

As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:

Travel outside the territory as of May 7, 2020

Starting May 7, 2020, Nunavummiut who chose to travel outside Nunavut while the CPHO’s travel ban is still in effect will have to cover the costs of their 14-day isolation period in one of the Government of Nunavut’s isolation sites.
The fee for a single individual in a room is $2,100 for the 14-day period, and each additional family member in the room will pay $1,050.
Updates will be provided as they become available.

Department of Health Services, April 30, 2020

Chief Public Health Officer update

As you have seen and heard, today we have announced that a case of COVID-19 has been detected within Pond Inlet. Since the onset of the pandemic, we knew that no combination of preventative measures can absolutely guarantee the prevention of COVID-19. We anticipated that sooner or later the virus would be detected in the territory. Just as we have poured extensive effort into our prevention plan, so too have we developed a comprehensive response plan to minimize, to the greatest possible extent, the impact that COVID-19 has on Nunavut.

We have been in contact with hamlet authorities and have initiated our Rapid Response Plan. A Rapid Response Team has already been deployed to Pond Inlet and is scheduled to arrive early this afternoon. That team will immediately initiate containment measures, begin contact tracing, and monitor the health and well-being of persons on home isolation orders. The Pond Inlet Health Centre is well-staffed and prepared, and health centre operations will continue.

All passenger travel in and out of Pond Inlet has ceased. This includes any movement in or out of the community by land travel. This travel ban is a necessary containment measure to minimize the risk of COVID-19 spreading to multiple communities at once.

Until we have determined the potential spread of the virus within the community, all non-essential offices and services will be closed. There is to be no social gatherings within dwellings, and all residents of Pond Inlet are asked to continue to maintain social distancing and good hygiene.

For residents of Pond Inlet, we recognize that this news may be frightening. However, the Government of Nunavut would like to assure everyone that although travel is restricted, you are not cut off from help and support. Critical services will be maintained, and plans are in place to ensure that access to services such as heat, power, water, sewer, and communications will not be interrupted. Our primary focus now is to detect and contain the virus to prevent further transmission within the community and to other communities.

Anyone who has reason to believe that they have been exposed to the virus is advised to call the COVID-19 hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. or 6 p.m. or call your community health centre. Please, do not go to the health centre in person unless you are instructed to by a health official.

To all Nunavummiut, know that the preventative measures that we have all been taking are more important now than ever. Everyone needs to practise social distancing, stay home whenever possible, and avoid contact with those who are not a member of your household. Together, our efforts can slow the spread of COVID-19.

Finally, I remind everyone of the importance of kindness. Now is not the time for blame, or shame. It is the time for compassion, empathy, and support of your fellow Nunavummiut.

The Government of Nunavut thanks all Nunavummiut for their efforts to date. We will continue to exhaust all efforts to contain the virus, and minimize its impact on Pond Inlet, and on all the territory. Only together can we all protect our territory from the threat of COVID-19.

Today, I joined Patty Hajdu, Minister of Health for Canada, and my ministerial colleagues from each of the provinces and territories to share important information and further coordinate our joint efforts to protect the health and well being of all Canadians, including Ontarians, from the emerging issues of the Wuhan novel coronavirus. The federal government outlined their enhanced measures, which now include: Screening questions at border kiosks will now include questions about previous travel to Wuhan, China in the past 14 days. A positive response would trigger an enhanced screening process, including sending the traveller to a Canadian border agent for further questioning about their health status. The border agent will determine whether the traveller needs to seek immediate medical assessment and treatment and, if so, EMS will transport the traveller from the airport directly to hospital. This screening will be done in Vancouver and Montreal as well.Fact sheets are also being developed in English, French and Chinese for people who have travelled to China and are not currently exhibiting signs of illness. These fact sheets will outline the symptoms that individuals should watch for and any next steps should they experience symptoms, including seeking an immediate medical assessment. The federalgovernment's enhanced screening measures build on Ontario's robust and comprehensive protocols in place to actively monitor for, detect and contain any suspected cases of Wuhan novel coronavirus. The federal government's measures will further support my ministry, in collaborationwith Public Health Ontario, local health units, hospitals and health care providers, to monitor the Wuhan novel coronavirus and contain any cases, should one present in Ontario. While the risk to Ontariansremains low, we will continue to be in close contact with the Public Health Agency of Canada and other jurisdictions to monitor this developing situation and safeguard the health of all Ontarians. I'dlike to thank all our partners for their on-going efforts in respondingto this emerging situation.

Ontario recently announced that the province is implementing an enhancedresponse structure to COVID-19 that brings together a wide range of partners to strengthen and implement provincial and regional plans. Thestructure involves the creation of a number of tables - or expert teams- including a new Command Table that will serve as a single point of oversight. Senior leadership from across government and the health sector are now providing clear strategic direction to guide Ontario's ongoing response to COVID-19. Through a Collaboration Table, stakeholders from the long-term care sector have the opportunity to provide valuable advice. Our government has also recently instructed long-term care homes to begin active screening of staff, students, volunteers, visitors, residents moving into a long-term care home and residents returning to a long-term care home. These individualswill now be proactively checked for symptoms and asked about recent travel history and contacts. Outbreaks can occur in long-term care homes throughout the year and, as it is flu season, homes currentlyhave respiratory infection outbreak protocols in place. When long-term care homes submit samples for standard respiratory testing, they will now also be tested for COVID-19 automatically to ensure the province identifies potentially unknown cases. Ontario continues to work directly with our partners at the Public Health Agency of Canada and local public health units to monitor the situation closely. Newly strengthened protocols for identification and control are in place to keep the public safe. These protocols and processes continue to be effective and the risk to Ontarians taking precautions to keep themselves and their families safe remains low. There are everyday actions that residents, staff and family members should continue to taketo reduce exposure to the virus and help prevent the spread of germs: wash your hands often with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer;sneeze and cough into your sleeve;avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth;avoid contact with people who are sick;stay home if you are sick; anddo not visit a long-term care home if you are feeling ill. Ontario'scommitment to the safety, quality of care and quality of life of long-term care home residents is safeguarded by regulations and requirements in the Long-Term Care Homes Act, 2007. Long-term care homes enforce rigorous provincial standards for all public health concerns, including outbreak management systems for detecting, managing,and controlling infectious disease outbreaks. The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Long-Term Care are working together in close cooperation with our partners in both the long-term care and other health care sectors to ensure the continued safety and well-being of residents, families and staff.""

""Ontario'spublic health system continues to demonstrate remarkable responsivenessto COVID-19,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""While we have so far effectively contained new cases of this virus, we are relentlessly focused on planning for any scenario. We are actively working with our partners at all levels in the health care system to implement enhanced measures to ensure that we are prepared to protect the health of all Ontarians."" Enhanced Access to Screening To rapidly expand screening and ease pressures on hospital emergency departments, Ontario will immediately establish a number of dedicated assessment centresin areas experiencing significant growth in testing. Some of the first wave of assessment centres will open in the next several days, includingat William Osler Health System - Peel Memorial site, The Ottawa Hospital, North York General Hospital, Mackenzie Health, Scarborough Health Network, and Trillium Health Partners. These centres are located in dedicated spaces that will facilitate high-quality care, to protect broader patient populations.  Additional assessment centres will be established across the province in the coming weeks. Regions without an assessment centre will continue to be serviced by their local hospital or primary care settings. Ontario has also approved new physician billing codesfor telephone assessments, enabling doctors to conduct more assessmentsover the phone rather than in their clinic, helping to keep patients athome rather than in primary care settings where they would co-mingle with others. In the coming days, the province will also launch a new COVID-19 self-assessment tool on its dedicated web page (Ontario.ca/coronavirus).This new tool will take the public through a series of questions to help inform those who are concerned about having contracted COVID-19 about how they can seek care based on their needs. Ontario is workingclosely with Telehealth to ensure adequate support to handle increased call volumes and is committed to allocating additional resources as needed to ensure timely responses for Ontarians. In addition tocontinuing to review virtual care capacity, including further expandingTelehealth and encouraging virtual care uptake, the Command Table has initiated early planning for the implementation of at-home testing, all of which will support caring for people at home. Expanding Lab-Testing Capacity Working with Public Health Ontario and Ontario Health, the province is working to enhance laboratory testing capacity across the province to rapidly mobilize, monitor and coordinate COVID-19 testing. Laboratorytesting is also being conducted on other respiratory samples from hospital emergency departments and long-term care homes in order to identify and quickly respond to any unknown cases of COVID-19. Protecting the Public and Frontline Workers Toensure Ontarians have access to credible and up-to-date information on how to maintain their health and the health of their families, Ontario has launched a provincewide public education campaign. The campaign, which includes search, social, print and radio ads on every-day steps Ontarians can take to keep themselves safe, is in addition to the resources available on Ontario.ca/coronavirus. This dedicated web page is now being updated twice a day (10:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. EST), seven days a week, with relevant information on any new cases and includes fact sheets translated in nearly 30 distinct languages. As the global and local situation evolves, the Command Table will continue to evaluate the latest evidence to provide ongoing guidance to the public and providers. Ontario has issued updated guidelines to long-term care homesto ensure active screening for all staff, volunteers, family members, as well as new and returning residents, and will do so for retirement homes shortly. Ontario will continue to update guidelines for other health care facilities in response to the evolving situation. In addition to these extensive planning measures, Ontario is providing stability to municipalities as they complete 2021 budget planning by committing to extending one-time mitigation funding for an additional calendar year forthe province's public health units. This action ensures that historicalmunicipal adjustments remain capped at 10 per cent, and recognizes the considerable time and resources necessary for public health units to effectively respond to COVID-19. Extending mitigation funding would keepmunicipal funding levels for public health units in calendar year 2021 at the same level as calendar year 2020. This is in addition to the up to $100 million COVID-19 Contingency Fund announced yesterday.

This is an evolving situation, and your role in helping to manage the spread of COVID-19 in Ontario is critical.It is imperative that we take steps now and take steps together to reduce opportunities for transmission. I am asking for your cooperation in following the advice below as best you can over the coming weeks. By working together, we can make a difference in this outbreak and protect those among us who are most vulnerable to COVID-19. The symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, new cough and difficulty breathing, and these may occur within 14 days of an exposure to another case. Additional closures Iam strongly recommending a further limitation to public gatherings frommy advice on March 12, 2020. I am further advising Ontarians to avoid large gatherings of over 50 people. In addition, I am specifically requesting the closure of the following settings as soon as possible: All recreational programs and librariesAll private schoolsAll daycaresAll churches and other faith settingsAll bars and restaurants, with the exception of restaurants that can shift to takeout/delivery mechanisms If you do not have any symptoms of COVID-19 Everyonein Ontario should be practicing social distancing to reduce their exposure to other people. This means that you can carry out daily activities, such as going to work (if you cannot work from home) and doing necessary shopping and appointments. I ask that everyone in Ontario does their best to avoid close contact with people outside of their immediate families. Close contact includes being within2 meters of another person.  In addition: If you believe you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 symptoms, I recommend that you begin to self-monitorfor a period of 14 days. This means that, in addition to social distancing, you should track how you feel. You should take your temperature daily and log any other symptoms that develop (e.g., sore throat, new cough). You can share these records with your primary care provider over the phone if you seek assessment services. All persons over 70 years of age and individuals who are immunocompromised are advised to self-isolatefor a period of 14 days. This means that you should only leave your home or see other people for essential reasons.  Where possible, you should seek services over the phone or internet or ask for help from friends, family or neighbours with essential errands.  If you have travelled outside of Canada in the last 14 days If you have travelled and are not a healthcare worker or another essential service worker, I ask that you self-isolate for 14 days since your arrival in Canada. People who are self-isolating should not go to work. In addition: Workerswho have travelled and are part of workplaces that are essential to daily living are able to return to work as long as they are asymptomatic. However, they should self-monitor for a period of 14 days and identify themselves to their employer so that a plan can be put into place to ensure the protection of those workplaces.Children under the age of 16 years who have travelled outside of Canada should also self-isolatefor a period of 14 days. Parents should actively monitor their children's symptoms. Children who are self-isolating should stay at homeand avoid social gathering points such as community centres or parks. Public Health Ontario has excellent fact sheets on how to self monitor and self isolate. If you start to feel symptoms of COVID-19 I am requesting anyone who begins to feel unwell (fever, new cough or difficulty breathing) to return home and self-isolateimmediately. People who are self-isolating should seek clinical assessment over the phone - either through TeleHealth Ontario (1-866-797-0000) or by calling their primary care provider's office. If you need additional assessment, your primary care provider or TeleHealthwill direct you to in-person care options. If you are in medical distress and need urgent care, you should call 911 and let them know what you are self-isolating because of COVID-19. If you are an employer Iam asking all employers in Ontarians to facilitate virtual work arrangements to enable employees to work from home where possible to enable workers to limit their activities, care for children and to self isolate. However, I recognize that there are a number of workplaces where this is not possible. I would ask those employers to use their judgement to sustain operations in a manner that maintains social distancing. If need to seek health care for COVID-19 If you are unwell and need to seek health assessment for COVID-19 there are three options to available: A Self Assessment Tool available at: https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirusTelehealth Ontario at: 1-866-797-0000 (24/7)Yourprimary care provider - you should call your primary care provider and they will provide virtual assessment by phone or other technology. You should not book an in-person visit for COVID-19 assessment without firsthaving a virtual assessment.  If you require an in-person health assessment, you will be referred to an appropriate location for in-person health assessment.  Only people with COVID-19 symptoms will be tested.  I want to remind all Ontarians that there are important actions that they should be taking every day inorder to protect your health. These include: washing your hands often with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizersneezing and cough into your sleeveavoid touching your eyes, nose or mouthavoid contact with people who are sickstayat home if you are sick. In particular, do not visit a long-term care, retirement home or other congregate living situation.  Thankyou for all of your support.

However, they should self-monitor for a period of 14 days and identify themselves to their employer so that a plan can be put into place to ensure the protection of those workplaces.Children under the age of 16 years who have travelled outside of Canada should also self-isolatefor a period of 14 days. Parents should actively monitor their children's symptoms. Children who are self-isolating should stay at homeand avoid social gathering points such as community centres or parks. Public Health Ontario has excellent fact sheets on how to self monitor and self isolate. If you start to feel symptoms of COVID-19 I am requesting anyone who begins to feel unwell (fever, new cough or difficulty breathing) to return home and self-isolateimmediately. People who are self-isolating should seek clinical assessment over the phone - either through TeleHealth Ontario (1-866-797-0000) or by calling their primary care provider's office. If you need additional assessment, your primary care provider or TeleHealthwill direct you to in-person care options. If you are in medical distress and need urgent care, you should call 911 and let them know what you are self-isolating because of COVID-19. If you are an employer Iam asking all employers in Ontarians to facilitate virtual work arrangements to enable employees to work from home where possible to enable workers to limit their activities, care for children and to self isolate. However, I recognize that there are a number of workplaces where this is not possible. I would ask those employers to use their judgement to sustain operations in a manner that maintains social distancing.

This is an evolving situation, and your role in helping to manage the spread of COVID-19 in Ontario is critical.It is imperative that we take steps now and take steps together to reduce opportunities for transmission. I am asking for your cooperation in following the advice below as best you can over the coming weeks. By working together, we can make a difference in this outbreak and protect those among us who are most vulnerable to COVID-19. The symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, new cough and difficulty breathing, and these may occur within 14 days of an exposure to another case. Additional closures Iam strongly recommending a further limitation to public gatherings frommy advice on March 12, 2020. I am further advising Ontarians to avoid large gatherings of over 50 people. In addition, I am specifically requesting the closure of the following settings as soon as possible: All recreational programs and librariesAll private schoolsAll daycaresAll churches and other faith settingsAll bars and restaurants, with the exception of restaurants that can shift to takeout/delivery mechanisms If you do not have any symptoms of COVID-19 Everyonein Ontario should be practicing social distancing to reduce their exposure to other people. This means that you can carry out daily activities, such as going to work (if you cannot work from home) and doing necessary shopping and appointments. I ask that everyone in Ontario does their best to avoid close contact with people outside of their immediate families. Close contact includes being within2 meters of another person.  In addition: If you believe you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 symptoms, I recommend that you begin to self-monitorfor a period of 14 days. This means that, in addition to social distancing, you should track how you feel. You should take your temperature daily and log any other symptoms that develop (e.g., sore throat, new cough). You can share these records with your primary care provider over the phone if you seek assessment services. All persons over 70 years of age and individuals who are immunocompromised are advised to self-isolatefor a period of 14 days. This means that you should only leave your home or see other people for essential reasons.  Where possible, you should seek services over the phone or internet or ask for help from friends, family or neighbours with essential errands.  If you have travelled outside of Canada in the last 14 days If you have travelled and are not a healthcare worker or another essential service worker, I ask that you self-isolate for 14 days since your arrival in Canada. People who are self-isolating should not go to work.

This commitment extends across the vast network of justice partners and individuals who interact with the justice system ona daily basis. We are working around the clock with our partnersto respond to this constantly evolving public health issue. Adjustmentsare being made throughout the justice system to minimize disruption andcontinue to provide seamless, responsive justice services to all Ontarians, particularly the most vulnerable members of our communities. Technology Solutions and Prioritizing Urgent Matters Tosustain these efforts and to address health and safety concerns raised by legal service professionals, Ontario courts and tribunals are limiting in-person proceedings and making use of audio and video conferencing to hear priority matters remotely, where possible. Justice partners are working collaboratively to develop and deploy technology solutions and other innovative tools across the province to ensure urgent matters can be heard without needing to appear in person. This approach will also help to mitigate the potential impacts of possible service disruptions. Courts and tribunals are also deferring non-urgent matters until they can be managed safely and securely. Ontario'sjudges and justices of the peace continue to prioritize critical matters such as criminal and child protection proceedings. There is strong collaboration across the system to ensure that urgent and priority legal matters continue to be heard before our courts and tribunals. All Tribunals Ontario in-person proceedings, includingat the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal, Landlord and Tenant Board and Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, are postponed and will be rescheduled at a later date. Where feasible, alternative hearing options such as written and telephone hearings will be considered. Front-line counter services will be closed until further notice. We are also workingvery closely with our partners and colleagues in Ontario's court systems to ensure Ontarians can see justice done while also prioritizingthe protection of public health in the province. The following actions have been taken across the justice system: The Superior Court of Justice has suspended all regular court operations until further notice, while continuing to hear urgent matters during this emergency period.All sittings of the Small Claims Court in Ontario are suspended until further notice.  TheOntario Court of Justice has established procedures to reduce the number of people who attend court in-person for criminal and family matters. All non-urgent matters have been adjourned.All Provincial Offences Actmatters scheduled up to and including April 3, 2020 will be adjourned and rescheduled to a later date. Tickets, fines or other court business may be handled online.  The Court of Appeal has suspended allscheduled appeals until April 3, 2020. During this period, urgent appeals will be heard based on either the written materials or remotely.Keeping People Safe We are committed to ensuring Ontarians remain safe and secure during this challenging time and are looking at all tools to help individuals and families stay in their homes. As part of this approach, the Ministry of the Attorney General has been granted an order suspending the enforcement of residential evictions until ordered otherwise by the court. Tribunals Ontario will not issue any new eviction orders until further notice. Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week. Wewant to thank our partners at the Superior and Ontario Courts of Justice, Tribunals Ontario, and the front-line workers across our justice system who are working hard to keep everyone safe and healthy while maintaining the administration of justice in our province. Ontariotakes the health and safety of court users, staff and the judiciary very seriously.

People can also call Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000 (24/7), where they can speak to a health care professional about their symptoms. As announced last week, the province is rapidly expanding service capacity to ensure timely responses and has increased Telehealth's line capacity to more than 2,000 to help manage the high daily call volume. In some cases, based on the virtual assessment, individuals may be referred by their primary care provider or Telehealth Ontario to one of the province's 58 assessment centres foran in-person assessment. These centres, which are by referral only, arehelping to ease the pressures on hospital emergency departments using innovative care models, including in some cases drive-thru testing.

 TORONTO — Due to the rapidly evolving COVID-19 outbreak, the Ontario government announced that schools and child care centres will remain closed to protect the health and safety of students and staff. This extension is being made on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health.
 Today's announcement was made by Premier Doug Ford, Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education, Ross Romano, Minister of Colleges and Universities and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. To ensure continuity of learning, the government is launching the second phase of Learn at Home. Developed in conjunction with education partners, the government is establishing clarity for parents, enhancing education supports, and creating opportunities for teachers and educators to connect with students. ""The decision to extend school closures was not made lightly. We know from the medical experts that the next two weeks will be critical in the fight against COVID-19 and that's why we're taking further action to keep our kids safe and healthy by having them stay home,"" said Premier Ford. ""At the same time, we cannot put the school year in jeopardy. That's why we're providing additional tools for at-home learning and ensuring students from kindergarten to Grade 12 to postsecondary education can finish their academic year and get the credits they need to graduate."" Public schools will remain closed to teachers until Friday, May 1, 2020, and to students until Monday, May 4, 2020. As these dates come closer, this decision will be re-evaluated based on public health advice.

Private schools, licensed child care centres and EarlyON programs will also remain closed until April 13, according to the Declaration of Emergency, which only allows closures to be extended for one 14-day period at a time. Select centres designated to support frontline health care workers and first responders will remain open. As previously announced, no student will have their graduation compromised by COVID-19 and the Ministry of Education continues to collaborate with the Ministry of Colleges and Universities to ensure that there will be no barriers to accessing postsecondary education. ""We will do whatever it takes to keep students safe from COVID-19 - which is why we have extended the school closure period and why we have unveiled a teacher-led program that keeps students learning while at home,"" said Minister Lecce. ""By providing clarity for parents, enhancing support for students and enabling the teacher-student relationship, we are ensuring our children continue to safely learn - providing some sense of stability and hope for them amid this difficulty."" The second phase of Learn at Home features a new set of expectations for the education community, including: Reconnecting students with teachers and other school staff, including mental health workers;Re-establishing teacher-led learning by grade groupings as follows:Kindergarten-Grade 3: five hours of work per student/week (focus on literacy and math)Grades 4-6: five hours of work per student/week (focus on literacy, math, science and social studies)Grades 7-8: 10 hours of work per student/week (focus on math, literacy, science and social studies)Grades 9-12: three hours of work per course per week for semestered students; 1.5 hours of work per course per week for non-semestered students (focus on achieving credits/completion/graduation)Leveraging digital resources and identifying alternative forms of teacher-student connectivity, such as phone and mail;Developing a program of training for educators to support them in virtual learning delivery;Requiring final report cards for all students;Prioritizing and supporting students on track to graduate;Distributing laptops and/or devices from schools as needed, while observing public health direction;Maintaining a responsive posture for health care and community partner requests; andEstablishing formal COVID-19 working groups with education sector unions to work together, share ideas and to find solutions in the support of students.

 TORONTO — Following the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health, the Ontario government is reducing the list of businesses classified as essential and ordering more workplaces to close. This measure is necessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and protect the health of the people of Ontario, while ensuring that necessary goods and services remain available.
 The government is ordering all businesses not covered by the updated Emergency Order to close effective as of Saturday, April 4, 2020 at 11:59 p.m. This closure will be in effect for 14 days, with the possibility of an extension as the situation evolves. Teleworking, online commerce and other innovative ways of working remotely are permitted at all times and are strongly encouraged for all businesses. All supply chains necessary for the production of vital food and healthcare supplies are being protected and remain intact. The updated essential businesses list can be found here. ""We are facing a critical moment in the fight against COVID-19 and we must do everything in our power to keep everyone safe and healthy and prevent our health care system from being overwhelmed,"" said Premier Ford. ""Everyone must do their part to stop the spread and flatten the curve. If you are not an essential business, you need to close your doors, work from home if possible and play a role to help contain this outbreak. This is a matter of life and death."" As a temporary measure the Ontario government has revised the list of essential businesses. The updated list will direct additional businesses to close and restricts specified businesses to providing services by alternate methods such as curb side pick up and delivery, except in exceptional circumstances. This includes stores that sell hardware products, vehicle parts and supplies, pet and animal supplies, office supplies and computer products and repairs and safety supplies. ""We have now reached a critical time in our fight against COVID-19."" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health ""Every step taken by the province and every effort made by each of us to avoid close contact with others are the key to our success as a province to stop the spread of this virus."" Only critical construction projects will continue, including industrial projects such as refineries and petrochemical plants and infrastructure projects such as new hospitals, roads and bridges. New starts in residential projects will stop, while residential construction that is near completion will continue. Business-owners with questions concerning their essential business status are encouraged to call the Stop the Spread hotline at 1-888-444-3659. The hotline is available from 8:30 a.m.― 9:00 p.m. Monday to Friday and 8:30 a.m.— 5:00 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. ""We recognize the toll this outbreak is taking on business owners and workers,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""Ontario businesses are top of mind during this unprecedented time. We know that the only way to ensure the health of our businesses and our economy is to ensure the health of all Ontarians."" The government is implementing additional measures to protect frontline workers in essential businesses by adding more than 60 special consultants and officers and doubling the number of phone agents at its Health and Safety Call Centre to 50 to make it easier for workers to report safety concerns. Workers worried their workplaces are unsafe can phone 1-877-202-0008 to speak with an agent. ""If you're a worker on the frontlines of this outbreak, you should know we're doing everything in our power to keep you safe at work,"" said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""We're beefing up our inspectors and making it easier for you to report your concerns. We're working around the clock.""

 TORONTO — To stop the spread of COVID-19, the Ontario government is implementing the next phase of its strategy to significantly expand and enhance testing. In addition to the ongoing testing of the general public at any of the 100 assessment centres now established across the province, Ontario will be proactively testing several priority groups, including:
 Hospital inpatients;Residents of long-term care and retirement homes;Health care workers, caregivers, care providers, paramedics, and first responders, including police and firefighters;Remote, isolated, rural and Indigenous communities;Other congregate living centres, including homeless shelters, prisons and group homes;Specific vulnerable populations, including patients undergoing chemotherapy or hemodialysis and requiring transplants, as well as pregnant persons, newborns and cross-border workers; andOther essential workers, as defined by provincial orders.""We're laser-focused on ramping up our testing capacity so we can protect the most vulnerable in our communities and those who protect them, like our frontline health care workers and first responders,"" said Premier Ford. ""By expanding our testing capacity, we will be able to find cases faster, intervene earlier, reduce the spread, and save lives."" By implementing this strategy, Ontario expects to double the number of tests processed each day to 8,000 by April 15, 2020 and 14,000 by April 29, 2020, at which point overall lab capacity will have been further expanded. ""By significantly increasing the number of tests each day, we will identify cases early, contain them and prevent putting more people at risk,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""Doing so is especially important for priority groups like hospital inpatients, long-term care home residents and our brave frontline health care workers and first responders, all of whom are more vulnerable to being exposed to this virus. Nothing is more important than protecting their health and wellbeing."" This testing strategy follows extensive efforts to expand Ontario's lab testing capacity, which helped to quickly eliminate a backlog of approximately 10,000 people within less than two weeks. To date, the province has conducted over 94,000 tests. The province has re-established same-day testing results, which are now conveniently accessible to patients through a new user-friendly online portal. This portal will help ease pressure on public health units and frontline workers, allowing them to focus their efforts on combating COVID-19. The province is also helping to significantly expand the capacity of public health units to conduct contact tracing and case management, both of which are critical to stopping the spread of the virus, by enabling the use of volunteers, including retired nurses and medical students. People who have tested negative for COVID-19 must still follow all precautions, including staying at home except to pick up essential supplies like groceries and prescriptions, and keeping at least two-meters apart from others. While an individual may receive a negative test at a given moment in time, the individual is still able to contract and spread the virus.
 

 Quick Facts
 

 Testing guidelines have been provided to health-system partners, including public health units, assessment centres, primary care settings and long-term care homes. Guidelines are forthcoming for specific vulnerable populations and essential workers. The province will also provide guidelines to begin targeted surveillance by sampling populations within northern towns. 
 Ontario will continue to increase its testing capacity by leveraging hospital, community and research labs.
 The province is also updating the list of symptoms related to COVID-19, including a hoarse voice, difficulty swallowing, loss of sense of smell or taste, diarrhea or nausea/vomiting. For seniors, there are additional symptoms including chills, delirium with no other obvious reason, falls, acute functional decline, increased heart rate and decreased blood pressure. These updated symptoms are in addition to difficulty breathing, fever, cough, muscle aches, fatigue, headache, sore throat and runny nose.
 All Ontarians should stay home unless for essential reasons only, such as such as accessing health care services, shopping for groceries, picking up medication, walking pets when required, or supporting vulnerable community members with meeting essential needs. If you must leave your home, stay at least two meters apart from others.

 TORONTO — The Ontario government is making progress on the implementation of the COVID-19 Action Plan for Protecting Long-Term Care Homes to help stop and contain the spread of COVID-19 in the province's long-term care homes. The government has introduced more aggressive testing, screening, and surveillance, deployed specialized teams from hospitals, public health and the home care sector, recruited additional frontline staff, and increased personal protective equipment. 
 Today's update was provided by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""Within 48 hours of launching our Action Plan, we sent in reinforcements to further protect our most vulnerable seniors and those who care for them in our long-term care homes,"" said Premier Ford. ""Today, we are making progress against this ruthless disease, but I want to emphasize that every option is on the table to get our long-term care homes what they need to stop the spread. That is why we intend to make a formal request for assistance from the federal government."" Since the Action Plan was announced, the government has worked swiftly and decisively to provide targeted, on-the-ground support to long-term care homes through the following measures: Assisting 20 long-term care homes, which were previously experiencing outbreaks, to become now outbreak-free. Increasing testing on both symptomatic and asymptomatic staff and residents. To date, approximately 11,600 tests have been completed amongst residents in long-term care.Conducting additional testing of asymptomatic residents and staff outside of the testing guidance at 21 long-term care homes, to help understand the spread of the virus.Setting up a 24/7 Long-Term Care COVID-19 Response Team, which has already helped more than 30 homes by putting in place infection control protocols, resolving staffing issues, and fulfilling personal protective equipment needs.Launching 31 Infection Prevention and Control interventions, which are currently in progress, with six assessments already completed. Continuing to identify critical 24-, 48-, and 72-hour help that homes need by matching qualified people and volunteers who can help with duties, including nursing support and cleaning. Responding to every escalated request for personal protective equipment from long-term care homes within 24 hours through the following measures:A four-step process is in place to ensure an optimized regional distribution and redistribution when supplies are urgently needed.Critical supply needs are escalated for provincial action.Daily distribution of supply from provincial warehouses to regional sites.Daily monitoring of and reporting against performance target of 100 per cent of critical need requests being shipped within 24 hours.Working with hospitals across the province to deploy additional staffing and infection prevention controls in long-term care homes:In Toronto alone, five hospitals (Michael Garron Hospital, Women's College, North York General, Unity Health Toronto and Mount Sinai Hospital) have been engaged to support approximately 40 long-term care homes in the city.Other hospital partners and health partners have stepped up to help their local homes, including Trillium Health Partners, Halton Healthcare, Grand River, Cambridge Memorial Hospital, and the Ottawa Hospital.More than 70 volunteers, including registered nurses, social workers, administration and medical doctors, have been recruited from the University Health Network to assist long-term care homes in the Greater Toronto Area.Providing over 400 job matches for long-term care homes through the province's Health Workforce Matching Portal, with over half of Ontario's long-term care homes now using the portal.To further support ongoing efforts to fight COVID-19 in Ontario's long-term care homes, the federal government has offered resources that could include personnel and other supports from Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada and Canadian Armed Forces. This support would be deployed to five priority long-term care homes as one element of the government's robust Action Plan. The Ontario government will be making a formal request to access those extra reinforcements today. The government continues to explore additional measures to help stop the spread of COVID-19 and keep vulnerable people safe, including building isolation capacity at long-term care homes. ""We must continue to act swiftly and decisively to keep our loved ones in long-term care safe, as well as their caregivers,"" said Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""Our long-term care homes continue to be the front-lines of this pandemic and we must continue to work around the clock to assist all our dedicated staff during this crisis.""

 TORONTO — Ontario is delivering a new COVID-19 Action Plan for Vulnerable People to better protect vulnerable populations during the outbreak of COVID-19. This plan builds on the government's previous actions to protect people living in high-risk settings, including homes serving those with developmental disabilities, shelters for survivors of gender-based violence and human trafficking, children's residential settings, and those residential settings supporting vulnerable Indigenous individuals and families both on and off reserve.
 Details of the plan were unveiled today by Premier Doug Ford, Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""The plan we are announcing today will build on and support the critical work that is currently being carried out each and every day by our frontline heroes to care for our most vulnerable citizens,"" said Premier Ford. ""These people are most at risk during this pandemic and that's why we are helping these organizations immediately ramp up screening and testing, deploy more protective masks and gloves, and put more boots on the ground in the fight against COVID-19."" ""We have been working in close partnership with the federal government, municipalities, First Nations, Indigenous organizations and bargaining agents as part of the rapid response to COVID-19 in congregate care settings,"" said Minister Smith. ""The action plan we are delivering today lays out a set of interventions, tailored by sector, to enable prevention and infection control, while maintaining service continuity for the benefit of our vulnerable clients and staff."" The COVID-19 Action Plan for Vulnerable People focuses on three specific areas: Enhanced Screening and Reduced Exposure to Prevent SpreadEnhancing screening of visitors, staff, and residents on sites, as well as restricting non-essential visitors.Providing masks to staff working in congregate care settings and providing training on the use of personal protective equipment in the event of an outbreak. Infection Control: Managing Outbreaks and Limiting SpreadEnhancing testing of symptomatic staff and clients to identify the need for isolation and additional infection control measures on-site.Planning to limit staff from working at more than one congregate care setting during an outbreak, specifically in developmental services, intervenor services, violence against women and anti-human trafficking settings.Providing additional training and support for high-risk settings dealing with an outbreak, including guidance on how to isolate clients.Sustaining Staffing and Managing Staff ShortagesWorking with organizations to promote workforce stability and capacity in high-risk settings.""Women and children who are in a vulnerable place in their lives must have access to the supports they need and a setting that is safe,"" said Jill Dunlop, Associate Minister of Children and Women's Issues. ""We are taking steps to stop the spread of COVID-19, including physical distancing, flexible staffing, and cleaning and disinfecting protocols, to keep people safe where they work and where they live."" ""We know that those who live and work in homeless shelters face unique challenges because of the COVID-19 outbreak,"" said Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. ""That's why we're working closely with service managers and our local partners to collect data and identify specific actions we can take to help."" The government will work with Indigenous-led congregate care settings both on and off reserve to ensure that these tools and supports are available and adapted to meet their local needs in keeping their clients and staff safe. ""Indigenous leaders across the province have taken swift action to protect their communities from the spread of COVID-19 and today's enhanced safety measures will provide additional protection for those community members living and working in congregate care settings,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines and Minister of Indigenous Affairs. The plan also supports mobilizing action to assessed high-risk locations in managing the COVID-19 outbreak in the days and weeks to come by providing assistance with staffing and additional training and support. The government is also moving immediately to solicit ideas on additional actions and measures that can be taken now to further support vulnerable Ontarians and staff in high-risk settings.
 

 Quick Facts
 

 Tens of thousands of Ontarians live and work in congregate care settings across more than 4,000 locations.
 The Action Plan builds on current measures implemented by the government to protect vulnerable populations, including visitor restrictions, flexibility for staff hours, expanded access to emergency daycare for frontline workers, and providing alternate settings for care. 
 The province has also suspended evictions, provided funds through the province’s $200 million Social Services Relief Fund to Service Managers and invested over $37 million to support outbreak planning, prevention and mitigation efforts to ensure the health and well-being of Indigenous people and communities. Constant monitoring is also underway with local public health organizations.
 The government is expanding the list of eligible expenses under Special Services at Home and for Passport funding. We will also continue to assist families and provide greater clarity about what expenses are eligible under the Ontario Autism program, including Childhood Budgets and Interim one-time funding, for the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak.

 Ministry of Education
 

 

 TORONTO — Today, Education Minister Stephen Lecce announced that all publicly-funded schools will remain closed until at least May 31, 2020, as part of an effort to keep students, staff and families safe from COVID-19.
 The extension was based on expert advice from the Chief Medical Officer of Health and health officials on the COVID-19 Command Table and is part of the government's ongoing effort to stop the spread of the virus. The advice was to extend school closures for an additional period of time to permit updated modelling and data to inform next steps, given the government's absolute commitment to safety. ""We will do whatever it takes to keep our students safe,"" said Minister Lecce. ""The government is taking a careful approach which provides our medical experts the time to review the modelling and make the best decision for the safety of our students and the future of learning."" The government took immediate action to close schools in Ontario, the first in Canada to do so. The ministry continues to monitor the evolving situation and if necessary, the closure may be extended further to protect the health and safety of Ontario's school communities. At the same time the Ontario government is taking steps to ensure learning can continue. In March the province unveiled its Learn at Home portal. It offers all students high-quality resources, featuring made-in-Ontario math and literacy resources, created by Ontario-certified educators, in both English and French. Elementary resources are designed to help young students learn at home with interactive activities that encourage participation through entertaining and stimulating digital content. High school content was designed with a focus on STEM courses and ensures core competencies and skills are reinforced. At the end of March the Ministry of Education unveiled the second phase of Learn at Home to ensure the continuity of learning for students. This included providing clarity for parents, enhancing education supports and creating opportunities for educators to connect with students. The government has also partnered with Rogers Communications and Apple to help meet the educational needs of students and families during the COVID-19 outbreak. iPads are being purchased and distributed by Ontario school boards, pre-equipped with free Rogers LTE wireless data. Apple is providing on-going support in French and English to teachers, parents and students, with a collection of resources to support learning and working from home. To date, over 20,000 iPads have been sent to targeted families in need. The free Rogers wireless data will be available until the end of June. ""Regardless of what transpires over the coming weeks, Ontario's students will be able to complete their school year with confidence,"" added Minister Lecce. ""In particular, for students in their final year, we are removing all impediments to ensure students graduate and pursue post-secondary education."" 
 

 Quick Facts
 

 Should schools be permitted to reopen, school employees will have access as of May 29, 2020.
 The Ministry of Education will move forward to replace the remainder of Professional Activity (PA) days and examination days with instructional time, as well as the introduction of an expanded summer learning program that will focus on credit recovery, supports for vulnerable students, and course upgrading. Boards are to find solutions at the local level in keeping with this direction while upholding collective agreement obligations.
 Private schools, First Nation schools, licensed child care centres and EarlyON programs will remain closed until May 6, 2020, with certain exceptions for licenced care, under an emergency order made under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, which only allows closures to be extended for 14 days at a time.
 Through the Ontario Together web site, the province received more than 300 proposals from businesses, organizations and everyday Ontarians to provide solutions to remote learning while schools are closed during the COVID-19 global pandemic. Next steps will be shared soon.

 Premier and Ministers Commit to New Phased Approach for a Safe Restart and Recovery 
 

 April 27, 2020 1:30 P.M.
 

 Office of the Premier
 

 

 TORONTO — Today, the Ontario government released A Framework for Reopening our Province, which outlines the criteria Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health and health experts will use to advise the government on the loosening of emergency measures, as well as guiding principles for the safe, gradual reopening of businesses, services and public spaces. The framework also provides details of an outreach strategy, led by the Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee, to help inform the restart of the provincial economy.
 Details were provided by Premier Doug Ford, Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance, Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""Our top priority remains protecting the health and safety of the people of Ontario and supporting our frontline heroes as we do everything in our power to contain and defeat this deadly virus,"" said Premier Ford. ""At the same time, we are preparing for the responsible restart of our economy. This next phase of our response to COVID-19 is designed to help us map out what needs to be done, and when, to get us back on the road to recovery."" The government is planning a stage-by-stage approach to reopening the economy to ensure there are appropriate measures in place so workplaces can open safely. Public health officials will carefully monitor each stage for two to four weeks, as they assess the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak to determine if it is necessary to change course to maintain public health. Stage 1: For businesses that were ordered to close or restrict operations, opening select workplaces that can immediately modify operations to meet public health guidance. Opening some outdoor spaces like parks and allowing for a greater number of individuals to attend some events. Hospitals would also begin to offer some non-urgent and scheduled surgeries, and other health care services.Stage 2: Opening more workplaces, based on risk assessments, which may include some service industries and additional office and retail workplaces. Some larger public gatherings would be allowed, and more outdoor spaces would open.Stage 3: Opening of all workplaces responsibly and further relaxing of restrictions on public gatherings.Throughout each stage, continued protections for vulnerable populations must be in place, along with the continued practice of physical distancing, hand washing and respiratory hygiene, and significant mitigation plans to limit health risks. ""Recent public health indicators show us that we're beginning to turn a corner in the COVID-19 outbreak, while economic data, feedback from businesses and insights from our communities are outlining how we need to plan for economic recovery,"" said Minister Phillips. ""Turning on an economy after an unprecedented shut-down is not as simple as flipping a switch. We need to plan this out carefully to ensure we do not spark a sudden outbreak, undo the progress we have made and put the safety of the public at risk."" To reopen the economy, the government will consider factors such as the risk of the spread of COVID-19 and the ability to implement protective measures to keep workplaces safe. The Chief Medical Officer of Health and health experts will provide advice to the government about easing public health measures using a range of set criteria, including: A consistent two-to-four week decrease in the number of new daily COVID-19 cases;Sufficient acute and critical care capacity, including access to ventilators and ongoing availability of personal protective equipment;Approximately 90 per cent of new COVID-19 contacts are being reached by local public health officials within one day, with guidance and direction to contain community spread; andOngoing testing of suspected COVID-19 cases, especially of vulnerable populations, to detect new outbreaks quickly.""It is because of the collective efforts of all Ontarians to stay at home and stop the spread of COVID-19 that we are able to consider plans to move into the next phase of our battle against this virus,"" said Minister Elliott. ""The Chief Medical Officer of Health has outlined some criteria he will use to advise government on when we may begin to slowly and safely ease public health measures and restart our economy. To be able to do so, we need everyone to continue their extraordinary efforts so that we can meet these thresholds and begin to move forward."" Supporting the next phases of Ontario's Action Plan, the new Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee, chaired by Minister Phillips, will be consulting with key sectors in all regions to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the provincial economy and develop a plan to move forward. The government and Members of Provincial Parliament will lead discussions with business associations, chambers of commerce, municipal leaders, the postsecondary sector, corporate leaders, small business owners, community and social service providers, Indigenous partners, Franco-Ontarians, entrepreneurs and others. The work of the committee will build on Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19, the first phase of the government's $17 billion response, that is delivering targeted relief for businesses and families across Ontario. ""The COVID-19 outbreak has had far-reaching economic impacts for businesses and communities across Ontario,"" said Minister Fedeli. ""In the face of these challenges, businesses and individuals have stepped up to support our frontline workers, produce essential equipment and keep our supply chains moving. Our plan to carefully and methodically reopen Ontario's economy will ensure that businesses are supported on our path to renewed economic prosperity.""

 TORONTO — The Ontario government is launching the COVID-19: Tackling the Barriers website to help businesses overcome the unique challenges created by the global pandemic. Businesses working to retool their operations to produce health-related products, or those that want to continue their operations in this new environment of physical distancing, can submit any potential roadblocks to the website. The province is prepared to allow temporary changes to provincial rules and regulations in order to remove any barriers that are hindering business and negatively impacting Ontario's supply chain.
 Today's announcement was made by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Prabmeet Sarkaria, Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction. ""With COVID-19, we are facing unchartered territory. As government, we must be prepared to work with businesses and show some flexibility in helping them to overcome challenges they may have never faced before,"" said Premier Ford. ""This website will allow us to listen to and support businesses as they adapt to this new environment. At the same time, it should also make it easier for businesses to retool to produce the health-related supplies and equipment that our frontline workers need."" ""During this extraordinary period, we need to do everything we can to support businesses as they struggle to operate as an essential business, or wait for the outbreak to subside,"" said Minister Sarkaria. ""Clearly, it is not business as usual for anyone, and that's why our government is prepared to temporarily adjust our processes, rules, and regulations to accommodate unforeseen circumstances. I encourage everyone to visit our new website if there are any questions or concerns."" The website builds on steps the government has already taken to help businesses respond to COVID-19, including: providing $10 billion in provincial tax deferrals, Workplace Safety and Insurance Board premium deferrals, and other business supports;providing more than $900 million in urgent relief to small businesses and their landlords through a new program, the Ontario-Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance Program (OCECRA);providing $50 million to help businesses such as manufacturers and distilleries retool so they can produce health-related products and supplies, such as ventilators, gowns, face masks and hand sanitizer;permitting 24-hour construction for critical infrastructure;permitting 24-hour deliveries in every municipality across the province to help grocery stores and pharmacies keep their shelves stocked; andallowing restaurants and bars to sell alcohol with food takeout or delivery orders.In order to help Ontario businesses focus on overcoming today's challenges, the province is also pausing or extending any existing public consultations, delaying non-urgent related consultations while the emergency situation remains in place, and considering extending deadlines for reports and audits.

 Province Takes Critical Steps to Help Businesses Adapt to New Environment

 Office of the Premier
 

 

 TORONTO ― The Ontario government is ensuring employers have the safety guidelines they need to protect workers, customers, and the general public from COVID-19 as it prepares for a gradual reopening of the provincial economy.
 The government safety guidelines released today will provide direction to those working in manufacturing, food manufacturing and processing, restaurant and food service, and the agricultural sector. These measures build on more than 60 guidelines developed by Ontario's health and safety associations in response to COVID-19 for various sectors such as retail, health care, construction, transportation, police services, firefighters, and transit employees. ""We all want to reopen our businesses, services and favourite places across the province, but we must do it in a safe and responsible way,"" said Premier Ford. ""That's why we are providing clear guidelines to employers, with practical measures to help them keep staff and customers safe while preventing the spread of COVID-19. By taking these steps, we will be prepared to get people back to work when the time is right."" These new sector-specific guidelines feature recommended actions employers can begin to plan for as they prepare to adapt to the new reality during COVID-19, including: Ways to ensure appropriate physical distancing, like eliminating pay-at-the-door options, holding team meetings outdoors, staggering shift times and using ground markings and barriers to manage traffic flow.Changes to the workplace, like installing plexiglass barriers, increasing the air intake on building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems to increase air flow, and using boot sanitizing trays.Promoting proper workplace sanitation, providing personal protective equipment, substituting dry dusting with vacuuming, ensuring customer-facing staff are given hand sanitizer, providing a place to dispose of sanitizing wipes, and enforcing handwashing before and after breaks.The government is also issuing posters to promote a variety of useful safety tips. The posters offer helpful advice on physical distancing and sanitation. They are downloadable from the Ontario.ca website so employers can print and post them in their workplaces. ""We are truly in extraordinary times and employers and employees are facing situations they have never had to deal with before,"" said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""It is incumbent on our government, with the advice of health officials, to provide the guidance and tips outlining the safest ways to reopen workplaces and help prevent the spread."" The government will work with Ontario's health and safety associations to bring forward additional workplace safety guidelines for more sectors in the coming days and weeks. Starting this week, 58 new inspectors will join the hundreds of existing provincial labour inspectors on the ground. The inspectors, which include workers from the Technical Standards and Safety Authority (TSSA) and the Ontario College of Trades (OCOT), will be tasked with communicating COVID-19 safety guidelines to essential workplaces or enforcing emergency measures, including physical distancing and the closure of non-essential businesses. ""Protecting the health and well-being of Ontarians during the COVID-19 outbreak has been and will always be our government's number one priority,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""These guidelines will help employers begin to plan for their safe reopening based on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health and in alignment with our framework to ease public health measures and restart our economy. In doing so, we can ensure we continue to stop the spread of COVID-19 and keep workers safe."" ""Our province's businesses have made great efforts to protect the health and safety of their workers throughout the course of this pandemic,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""These new guidelines will help employers continue to protect their staff and customers as we begin to carefully and methodically re-open our economy, so that we can return Ontario to prosperity in the safest way possible."" The government is committed to a careful, stage-by-stage approach to loosening emergency measures and reopening Ontario's economy. Public health and workplace safety will remain the top priority, while balancing the needs of people and businesses.

 Steady Decrease in COVID-19 Cases Required Before Beginning Next Stage of Reopening

 Office of the Premier
 

 

 TORONTO ― The Ontario government is allowing certain businesses and workplaces to reopen as long as they comply with strict public health measures and operate safely during the COVID-19 outbreak. Those permitted to start up include seasonal businesses and some essential construction projects.
 Today's announcement was made by Premier Doug Ford, Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance, Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. The Chief Medical Officer of Health has provided general recommendations on how the openings of businesses and workplaces could be implemented to support safe operations, including strict adherence to health and safety requirements. ""We are allowing certain businesses to reopen under strict guidelines because we are confident they can operate safely and adapt to the current environment,"" said Premier Ford. ""While further reductions in the spread are needed before we can begin reopening the province, we have the right framework and the right workplace guidelines in place to do so gradually and safely."" The government, in partnership with Ontario's health and safety associations, has developed more than 60 guidelines in response to COVID-19. These sector-specific measures will help employers prepare their workplaces so they can be reopened safely and ensure workers, customers and the general public are protected. By following the proper health and safety guidelines these businesses will be permitted to begin operations on Monday, May 4 at 12:01 a.m.: Garden centres and nurseries with curbside pick-up and delivery only;Lawn care and landscaping;Additional essential construction projects that include:shipping and logistics;broadband, telecommunications, and digital infrastructure;any other project that supports the improved delivery of goods and services;municipal projects;colleges and universities;child care centres;schools; andsite preparation, excavation, and servicing for institutional, commercial, industrial and residential development;Automatic and self-serve car washes;Auto dealerships, open by appointment only;Golf courses may prepare their courses for the upcoming season, but not open to the public; andMarinas may also begin preparations for the recreational boating season by servicing boats and other watercraft and placing boats in the water, but not open to the public. Boats and watercraft must be secured to a dock in the marina until public access is allowed.""Ontario workers and businesses have shown exemplary cooperation and resilience throughout the course of this crisis,"" said Minister Fedeli. ""We're beginning to ease restrictions on select businesses as we carefully and methodically re-open Ontario's economy and continue together on our path to renewed prosperity."" Although certain businesses are being permitted to reopen, it is critical that people continue to stay home, practise physical distancing and only go out for essential reasons, to pick up groceries, prescriptions or to keep a medical appointment. It is through these simple actions that Ontario is making progress to stop the spread of COVID-19. ""As we begin planning for the next phase of our fight against COVID-19, Ontarians should continue to stay home as much as possible to ensure we stop as quickly as possible the spread of this virus,"" said Minister Elliott. ""While we have made tremendous progress in our shared battle against this new virus, we are not done yet. We need to keep up the fight by continuing to practise physical distancing and good hygiene habits."" On April 27, the government released A Framework for Reopening our Province, which outlines the criteria Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health and health experts are using to advise the government on the loosening of emergency measures, as well as guiding principles for the safe, gradual reopening of businesses, services and public spaces. While the government remains in Phase One of Ontario's Action Plan in response to COVID-19, Protect and Support, allowing certain businesses and workplaces to open under strict guidelines demonstrates the government's commitment to balance the needs of the economy with the health and safety of the people of Ontario. ""People's efforts are paying off and we can see a light at the end of the tunnel,"" said Minister Phillips. ""Our response has always been based on the current status of the outbreak in our province, and on what makes sense for Ontario. To be clear ― we haven't moved into the reopening phase of our response to COVID-19. Not yet. But based on the best public health advice available to us, we are a step closer.""

Metrolinx is reducing service on a number of Hamilton routes as COVID-19 cases pop up across the province. (Laura Howells/CBC)
Metrolinx has announced reduced GO train and bus services starting Wednesday which have almost completely cancelled some Hamilton bus routes and affected others. 

Route 16, an express GO Bus travelling between Toronto and Hamilton is almost completely cancelled.

Spokesperson Nitish Bissonauth confirmed with CBC News the route will only offer one Toronto-bound trip in the middle of the night — 12:30 a.m. — on weekdays and weekends.

""Remember, these are only temporary changes,"" he said.

Bissonauth said commuters taking the Route 16 bus can switch to the Lakeshore West train instead, which will also run on a revised schedule. To do that, riders can take the Route 1 bus which travels from Hamilton GO Centre to Aldershot GO and vice versa.

Second confirmed case of COVID-19 in St. Catharines is 55-year-old woman
4 new cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Hamilton, 1 new case in Burlington
The shuttered service is also suspending train service to Niagara Falls or St. Catharines, recommending travellers take GO Bus Route 12 service to Niagara Falls, which connects to GO train service at Burlington GO.

Some other local bus routes that will face reduced service include:

Route 12 (Niagara Falls).
Route 15 (Brantford/Burlington).
Route 18 (Lakeshore West).
Route 40 (Hamilton/Richmond Hill).
Highway 407 West Routes 45, 46, 47 and 48.
Highway 407 West Routes 51, 52 and 54.
""Our key consideration is ensuring our services can continue and our employees and customers are safe,"" said Metrolinx President and CEO Phil Verster in a release on Friday.

""We want to ensure there is a reliable and sustainable plan for service to continue over the weeks to come.""

The provincial transit agency added the reduced service comes as it expects fewer riders with the March break, school closures and businesses implementing more work-from-home policies.",CBC,,"Metrolinx cuts GO services in Hamilton and Niagara, expecting reduced ridership

Below is an update on our cases in Waterloo Region, new recommendations from the Province on the testing of people who have traveled and have respiratory symptoms, as well as recommendations for our community.

Current Situation:

The third confirmed case in Waterloo Region, a male in his 40s, was assessed by Public Health and was tested at Grand River Hospital. He was initially well enough to be released from hospital and self-isolate at home, but later in the day returned to hospital as his condition became more serious. He is currently hospitalized and in serious but stable condition.

Additionally, late last night we also received confirmation of our fourth confirmed case. A female in her 50s acquired the illness during travel to France. She developed symptoms upon her return for which she was tested at Grand River Hospital. Hospital staff took all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of staff and other patients. The patient was experiencing mild respiratory symptoms and has been released from hospital to self-isolate at home. Public Health is monitoring her, as well as close family members who are not experiencing any symptoms at present.

Update to testing:

Given the evolving situation and the need to ensure that those who may need more elevated levels of care are able to receive the assessment and care that they need, as of late last night, Ontario updated its recommendations for testing. In general, testing will be prioritized for people who need hospital care or certain groups of people such as health care workers or those in long-term care homes or retirement homes.

For most other people who develop fever and/or cough and have traveled to an affected area, testing is no longer recommended. They will still need to remain at home in self-isolation until such time as they are no longer symptomatic for 24 hours.

Recommendations:

By taking these following measures, we have the opportunity to slow the spread of the virus in our community. These recommendations reflect the changing nature of the situation around the world.

It is recommended that:

Large gatherings of 250 people or more and all international events be postponed or cancelled.
This does not apply to post-secondary institutions and workplaces at this time
Post-secondary institutions and workplaces are encouraged to consider increasing flexibility for their students and/or workers to work from home or work remotely should that become recommended in the future
Waterloo Region residents postpone all non-essential travel outside of Canada, including to the United States.
Returning travelers to Waterloo Region refrain from:
Visiting patients in hospital.
Visiting long-term care homes or retirement homes
Visiting the elderly or those with chronic health conditions
In addition, children who have travelled outside of Canada should not return to child care settings including daycare and camps for 14 days.
Returning visitors from Hubei Province (China), Iran and Italy self-isolate for 14 days from their date of return.
Returning visitors from all other countries, including the United States, self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days from their date of return.
And last but not least, that our residents refuse to participate in the Ezra Street party. This uncontrolled party was already a significant risk to the health and safety of our residents. It is even more so now. In this time when we need to ensure our health care and community resources are available to respond to serious needs in our community, I am asking people not to put their own health or these essential resources at risk. Please do your part in helping to protect our community.

Residents are also reminded that Public Health is experiencing high call volumes and you may experience longer wait times on the phone. We apologize for this inconvenience. Public Health has increased staffing significantly in the past days and we are adding additional staff as quickly as possible.

In an effort to contain the spread of COVID-19, we have had to make some difficult decisions. The university is requiring all students to move out of Laurier-operated residences at all campus locations by Wednesday, March 18 at 11:59 p.m. We recognize how disruptive this will be as you move out of the space you’ve called home and we’re committed to supporting you through this process.

The information below will guide you through the check-out procedure.

EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES
Only under exceptional circumstances will students be permitted to remain in residence beyond Wednesday. Students should consider all options, including staying with relatives or friends.

Students who may be able to remain in residence include:

International students;

Out-of-province students who need extra time to move out;
Students who live more than five hours away from campus; and
Students who are currently self-isolating.
To see whether your situation warrants an exception, or if you require additional assistance, please contact the Department of Residence at housing@wlu.ca.

It's to help control the spread of COVID-19.

""Watching the news today, obviously they didn't take the actions that we had anticipated. We huddled quickly, and still feel strongly, not providing an opportunity for the virus to continue spreading with the various stakeholders of our business ... Although painful, was the right thing to do do."" Jody Palubiski, Partner and CEO of the Charcoal Group, told 570 NEWS.

Closing the restaurants during the pandemic will impact close to 1,000 employees.

Charcoal is now trying to help their workers with any Employment Insurance claims.

""We're in this situation where crowds, etc. are probably not the most prudent thing to be facilitating ... we're looking at it, trying to make the best decision for our team members."" 

Palubiski adds, at this point, they don't have a timeline as to how long they'll have to keep their restaurants closed.

Charcoal operates restaurants including the Charcoal Steak House, Beertown, and The Bauer Kitchen.

Morty's Pub in Waterloo also announced Monday it is temporarily closing its doors due to the outbreak. 

The Duke of Wellington in Waterloo will be closing its dining room to the public, but will continue to offer food delivery as well as take out.

On Monday night, Fionn MacCool's in Kitchener confirmed it is closing its doors for the foreseeable future, meaning it will not be open for St. Patrick's Day.

Solé Restaurant and Wine Bar, Blackshop Restaurant, and the Melville Café are also closed effective Monday.

2020-03-17,Canada,Ontario,Kitchener-Waterloo,2.0,0.0,,,,,,,,2.0,0.0,,Government Website,"In light of the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation and in line with updated recommendations from the Government of Canada and the Chief Medical Officer of Health of Ontario, Region of Waterloo Public Health’s Acting Medical Officer of Health Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang is recommending further measures to those shared on March 15, 2020 in order to prevent the spread of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the region. 

New recommendations – March 17, 2020: 

I am now asking Region of Waterloo residents to avoid large gatherings of over 50 people.

This includes indoor and outdoor sporting events, conferences, meetings, religious or social gatherings, festivals, markets or other similar events.
In addition, I am specifically requesting the closure of the following settings as soon as possible:

All recreational programs
All private schools
All daycares
All churches and other faith settings
All bars and restaurants, with the exception of restaurants that can shift to takeout/delivery mechanisms
I know these new measures will be difficult. However, they will further help to slow the spread of the virus, and further reduce cases of serious illness and death. Everyone in Waterloo Region can help to protect our most vulnerable.

If you start to feel symptoms that are compatible with COVID-19:

Anyone who begins to feel unwell (fever, new cough or difficulty breathing) should return home and self-isolate immediately.
People who are self-isolating should seek clinical assessment over the phone - either through TeleHealth Ontario (1-866-797-0000) or by calling their primary care provider's office.
If you need additional assessment, your primary care provider or TeleHealth will direct you to in-person care options.
If you are in medical distress and need urgent care, you should call 911.
 

Continuing recommendations (first issued March 15, 2020):

Social distancing recommendations:

In addition to practicing hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, practice social distancing as much as possible.
Social distancing means maintaining distance from others (two arms’ length or 2 meters).
Organizations should look for ways to take advantage of virtual options to continue providing services.
Travel recommendations:

Waterloo Region residents postpone all non-essential travel outside of Canada, including to the United States.
The Government of Canada has issued a broad recommendation that all travelers returning from destinations outside of Canada self-isolate for 14 days.
https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/travel-health-notices/221
For certain groups, such as health care workers, different recommendations may apply.
Returning visitors from Hubei Province (China), Iran and Italy should also reach out to their local Public Health unit within 24 hours of return.
Returning travelers to Waterloo Region should also refrain from:
Visiting patients in hospital
Visiting long-term care homes or retirement homes
Visiting the elderly or those with chronic health conditions
Long-term care, retirement homes recommendations:

Long-term care homes, retirement homes, supportive housing and hospices should allow only essential visitors into their facilities until further notice.
The Ministry is identifying essential visitors as those who have a resident who is dying or very ill or a parent/guardian of an ill child or youth in a live-in treatment setting.
These visitors must continue to be actively screened into these settings.

Region of Waterloo’s acting medical officer of health Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang said public health will start to announce the locations where people may have contracted the disease. “As we receive more cases, we are learning of public places that these cases have visited when they had symptoms,” she explained. “And where we believe there might have been an exposure for other people at these places.”

Wang says public health will begin posting some of the details of these places on its website.

“People can self-identify if they have been at these locations at times,” she noted. “For those people who self-identify as having been present at those places and at those times, we ask that they self-monitor for symptoms and we’ll indicate until when until a specific date.” Wang also recommended the closure of personal service settings or businesses. “These include, but are not limited to, barbershops, hair and nail salons, tattoo and piercing services, tanning salons and all aesthetic services,” the doctor explained. “Whether they’re in public or home-based.”

She also added fitness facilities, banquet halls and conference centres to the list. Wang also asked that realtors change their practices.

“I am also requesting that real estate companies avoid holding open houses and move to methods such as virtual open houses,” she said.

Wang said she understands the impact the measures are having on people’s lives but said they will play a role in flattening the curve, although she is not certain when the measures will start to bear fruit. “A lot of these cases we’re reporting now are due to the exposures that they’ve had a couple of weeks ago,” she explained. ”We’re going to have to see week by week how it evolves but regardless, everything we do now and today will have a direct impact on the future. “And so I think that’s kind of what I’m hoping people will understand and continue to help us reinforce.”

Questions about COVID-19? Here are some things you need to know:

Health officials caution against all international travel. Returning travellers are asked to self-isolate for 14 days in case they develop symptoms and to prevent spreading the virus to others.

Symptoms can include fever, cough and difficulty breathing — very similar to a cold or flu. Some people can develop a more severe illness. People most at risk of this include older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease. If you develop symptoms, contact public health authorities.

To prevent the virus from spreading, experts recommend frequent handwashing and coughing into your sleeve. They also recommend minimizing contact with others, staying home as much as possible and maintaining a distance of two metres from other people if you go out.

London City Council has passed a motion to waive the $1.50 per bag fee for residents that need to dispose of bagged garbage at three EnviroDepots until May 4, 2020. Homes that have to dispose of bagged garbage above the three container limit can do so at one of these three EnviroDepot without paying the fee.

West EnviroDepot - Oxford Street, 1450 Oxford Street West

East EnviroDepot - Clarke Road South, 28 Clarke Road

North EnviroDepot - Clarke Road North (at Try Recycling Inc.), 21462 Clarke Road

In response to COVID-19 and to mitigate impacts on Londoners, this update will take effect immediately. Physical distancing will continue to be practiced at EnviroDepots.

How to use the EnviroDepots at this time

To help slow the spread of COVID-19, please observe the following measures: 

Maintain physical distancing of 2 metres.
Cash is not accepted until further notice. Credit and Debit continue to be accepted.
Complete your visit safely and quickly, and then leave the depot.
Do not mingle and socialize.
Bag Tags for curbside pickup are available at three EnviroDepots. We recommend that you purchase tags for extra garbage and place out for curbside collection to avoid use of the Depot if possible, or store materials such as extra bagged garbage and yard waste as long as possible. The EnviroDepots do not accept furniture, mattresses, or other bulky items.

 

2. Closure of the Household Special Waste Depot and Public Drop-off Area Located at the W12A Landfill Site

Public access to the waste disposal drop-off area and Household Special Waste Depot located inside the W12A Landfill is closed until further notice.

An increase in large trucks and a reduction in staff resources due to COVID-19 requires additional on-site health and safety measures be implemented. The only way to safely protect the public is to not permit them access inside the site.

Residents are asked to continue to store household special waste items safely at home. Do not place these items in the garbage.

 

3. Garbage and Recycling Collection

Garbage and recycling collection continues as scheduled in London and there are a number of actions you can take to help collectors.

Bag all used tissues and napkins, and please place in the garbage. Do not place waste loosely in garbage containers.
If you or someone in your household is feeling unwell, please place items that have been in contact with your mouth, nose or eyes into a bag and then into the garbage. This includes items that you normally place into your Blue Box such as plastic bottles, pop cans and milk or juice containers.
Reduce the amount of waste placed at the curb – we ask that Londoners place the least amount of garbage at the curb as possible.
Hold on to bulky waste like furniture, mattresses, couches. Please store these items at your property as long as possible during this time.
Please respect physical distancing with Sanitation and Recycling Operators and do not approach the vehicle.
And please remember to wash your hands after handling waste or recycling. Simple actions will help protect collectors from the risk of spreading COVID-19. Thank you for being accommodating during this time.

 

4. Yard Waste Collection

Yard waste collection continues as scheduled and begins in Zone A (Westmount, Byron, Oakridge) on March 30, 2020. View the collection calendar online, or use the Recycle Coach app for reminders and notifications about garbage, recycling, and yard waste collection.

 

5. Stay connected

We continue to monitor the updates and recommendations from the Middlesex London Health Unit along with the Federal and Provincial Governments.

The City of London, working with London Police Service and the Middlesex-London Health Unit have established a process to act on concerns that are reported through a newly-established email address and phone line. 

The email COVIDOrderConcerns@london.ca will be monitored  24/7. There is also a phone line (519-661-4660) that will be monitored between 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday to Friday.

A number of agencies have been receiving calls from people concerned about individuals and businesses who are in violation of Provincial orders and municipal closures. Establishing this email address and phone line  will provide a single point of contact to help ease the demands on other community phone lines, including the Middlesex-London Health Unit and 9-1-1.

Emails and calls that can be managed through this process include concerns about non-essential businesses that are not closed, activities taking place at closed outdoor structures including playgrounds, multi-use courts and skate parks, residents that are gathering in large groups, and individuals who are not following Federal quarantine orders.

“Everyone has the responsibility to follow all of the orders that have been issued by governments, and to take every precaution possible to slow the spread of COVID-19,” said Dave O’Brien, Division Manager, Corporate Security and Emergency Management, City of London. “Despite every effort to reinforce the importance of social and physical distancing, we continue to see people who aren’t paying attention. When we receive a call or email through this new process, we will work with our community partners at LPS and MLHU to enforce the restrictions that have been put in place.”

“We urge all Londoners to utilize the email address and phone number provided by the City of London to report any COVID-19 related concerns,” says Chief Steve Williams, London Police Service. “This will ensure that our 9-1-1 lines are free for emergencies.”

Residents who are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 are advised to use the Provincial self-assessment tool.

April 1st is fast approaching and for many Londoners the ability to pay rent during this uncertain time is a source of stress and anxiety. Below is some information and resources that may help renters navigate these challenging times.

Do I Have to Pay My Rent?

The Government of Canada is calling on landlords to be as flexible as possible when it comes to collecting rents for April, as well as rethinking any planned rent increases, whether approved by the Landlord and Tenant board or not, during this time. It is important that tenants try and pay their rent if they can as it supports keeping buildings operational, clean and safe.

However; if you are a tenant struggling to pay rent due to the COVID-19 emergency, there are some options for you:

Reach out to your landlord and/ or property manager by phone or online (to respect physical distancing) and explain your situation. 
Offer to pay what you can, if possible.
Ask about government programs you might qualify for, and for the remainder, discuss a plan for how you can repay over time.
If I Can’t Pay, Will I Be Evicted?

The Provincial Government has indicated that they will work, to the best of their abilities, to ensure renters can stay in their homes during this time.

It is important to note that the Provincial Landlord and Tenant Board is not issuing any eviction orders and the Province has instructed the Sherriff’s office not to enforce any eviction orders that were issued but not enforced before the pandemic began.

Tenants can contact the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing’s Rental Housing Enforcement Unit (RHEU) if they have been locked out of their unit or are being threatened with such an action.

The RHEU can be reached by:

Safely maintaining physical distance is extremely important at all times when travelling on London’s roadways and multi-use pathways – especially on bridges and when passing each other.

Here are the additional actions that are underway:

Road closures:

Blackfriars Bridge and the east bound curb lane of Kensington Bridge (Riverside Drive across the Thames River) will be closed to motor vehicles until further notice to provide more space for people walking and biking at these potentially busy locations. Traffic flow in both directions on Kensington Bridge will continue. Pedestrians and cyclists are reminded to use caution and maintain a minimum of two metres physical distance.

Bridges & pedestrian tunnels:

Pedestrians are now required to stop for oncoming pedestrians and wait until the sidewalk is clear before crossing some bridges and pedestrian tunnels where sidewalks are narrow. Signage with instructions will be installed to make Londoners aware of locations impacted by this change.  

One-way sidewalks:

Sections of the Highbury Avenue sidewalks over the railway bridges will be deemed one-way for pedestrian traffic (one-side for southbound users, one-side for northbound users) where it can be difficult to maintain a two-metre distance when meeting another pedestrian. Londoners approaching these areas will be notified by signs at the nearest signalized intersection so they can proceed in their desired direction of travel.

Parks, trails & amenities:

As a reminder, all outdoor play structures including playgrounds, multi-use courts and skate parks are closed. As well, City sports fields, golf courses, off-leash dog parks and community gardens are closed. The City will be enforcing these closures.

Parks, green space, trails and pathways remain open for walk-through only. Londoners are reminded to maintain physical distance of a minimum two metres and take turns when using narrow boardwalks and bridges on all pathways and trails. 

The City of London is constantly reassessing COVID-19 developments to ensure the safety and well-being of residents and our staff. The conditions in local road, park pathway and cycling networks continue to be monitored by staff.

The City will be actively monitoring outdoor spaces over the weekend. Individuals who are not complying with closures and Provincial or Federal orders will face fines. To report a concern, contact COVIDOrderConcerns@london.ca or 519-661-4660.

To help simplify what Londoners can and can’t do as a result of these Orders, the City is providing the following information.

What’s closed?

All outdoor recreation facilities remain closed including:

Playgrounds
Soccer pitches
Baseball diamonds
Tennis courts
Basketball courts
Skate parks
Golf courses
Off-leash dog parks
Community gardens
Benches, picnic areas, park shelters and outdoor exercise equipment.
Can I go outside?

The Province of Ontario is strongly urging everyone to stay home except for essential reasons – groceries, prescriptions, medical appointments, for example – and to limit the number of trips outside.  If you’re over 70 years old, or you have a compromised immune system or medical condition, the Province is also suggesting that you self-isolate and get help for essential errands.

Can I use the park?

Parks, green space, trails and pathways remain open for walking and biking through only. They aren’t for gathering, and if you are in an open green space, maintaining physical distance of no less than 6 feet is required at all times.

One way to maintain 6 feet of physical distance is to find a path less travelled. A list of pathways and parks can be found on CityMap Parks and Pathways.  

Can I meet up with my friends?

Organized social gatherings and public events of more than five people are not allowed in London and across the Province. This includes social gatherings held in private homes with people who don’t reside there. Households where more than five people live are exempt. Unless it’s essential, health officials and the Province are strongly urging you to stay home.

Can my business stay open? 
The Province has updated their essential businesses and services list. Reducing the number of businesses that can stay open, and modifying how services are delivered – takeout only, curbside pick-up and delivery, for example – are some of the ways the Province is hoping to minimize the risk of transferring COVID-19.  

Business owners with questions on whether they fall within the list of essential businesses and services can call 1-888-444-3659.

Can I enjoy a backyard fire?

Not right now. The open air burning ban is another temporary measure in place during this time. This applies to all solid fuel burning appliances (all wood burning appliances) including chimneys, fire tables, fire pits, and fire bowls. This is a safety precaution that will help ease the demand on the London Fire Department during these unprecedented times.

Will I get a ticket?
You could. All of these measures are in place to help stop the spread of COVID-19 in our community. Now isn’t the time to take these orders lightly.

If you choose to ignore them, not only are you putting your health, the health of your family and the health of your community at risk, you could face a fine of $750 for failure to comply with an order made under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act or $1,000 for obstructing any person in exercising a power if a provincial offences officer issues a ticket.

In addition, failure to comply with an emergency order could carry punishments of up to one-year imprisonment or a fine of up to $100,000 for an individual, $500,000 for a director of a corporation, or $10,000,000 for a corporation itself if a provincial offences officer charges the individual by issuing a summons.

Residents who have concerns about businesses and individuals who are not following COVID-19 related orders can contact COVIDOrderConcerns@london.ca / 519-661-4660.

Why are these restrictions in place?

The province has enacted a declaration of emergency to help contain the spread of COVID-19 and protect the public. These measures are for your health, the health of your loved ones and the community. For more information from the Ontario Government on measures to help stop the spread of COVID-19, please visit ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirus

“Now is the time for every one of us to be doing everything we possibly can to slow the spread of COVID-19,” said London Mayor Ed Holder. “I know these restrictions may be difficult, but I can’t stress enough that they are necessary. Sometimes, staying safe and staying healthy means following all of the rules.”

What else can I do to slow the spread of COVID-19? 
We’re glad you asked! Here is advice provided by the Middlesex-London Public Health Unit:

Stay home except for essential trips
Stay six feet away from others
Avoid non-essential gatherings
Work from home if possible
Quarantine for 14 days if you’ve been outside of Canada
Self-isolate for 14 days if you have any symptoms of COVID-19
Wash your hands with soap and water often (for 15 to 20 seconds)
Cover coughs/sneezes with your sleeve or sneeze into your elbow
Clean and disinfect high touch areas frequently

Residents are encouraged to check their collection calendar for when their Three Container Exemption Pickup is scheduled, and to be mindful of how much waste they have to place at the curb.

“London’s waste and recycling operators have been working tirelessly while we maintain essential services,” says Mayor Ed Holder. “During this time, small adjustments from Londoners can have a big impact and help protect our waste and recycling collectors.”

“Collecting extra containers and other items has its challenges during COVID-19, and it is our hope that Londoners will only use the Three Container Exemption when necessary,” says Jay Stanford, Director - Environment, Fleet and Solid Waste at the City of London. “Please be kind and considerate to collectors when placing waste to the curb, and don’t throw out what you don’t have to right now especially bulky waste.”

Hold on to bulky waste like furniture, mattresses, and couches. Please store these items at your property as long as possible during this time. Heavy, bulky items at the curb are a challenge for collectors and require extra time to manage safely.
Reduce the amount of waste placed at the curb. Only throw out what you have to right now.
Renovation materials are not collected at the curb.  Store drywall, wood and scrap metal as long as you can before taking it to an EnviroDepot.
Don’t throw out paint and batteries. London’s Household Special Waste Depot is temporarily closed at this time. Hazardous materials should never go in the garbage so please hold onto these items until safe and proper disposal can resume.
Help Keep Collectors Safe

It is important that residents practice safe waste disposal to help protect collectors from the risk of spreading COVID-19.

Please bag all used tissues and napkins, and place them in the garbage. Do not place waste loosely in garbage containers.

If you or someone in your household is feeling unwell, place items that have been in contact with your mouth, nose or eyes into a bag and then into the garbage – this includes items that you normally place into your Blue Box such as plastic bottles, pop cans and milk or juice containers.

Respect physical distancing with Sanitation and Recycling Operators and do not approach the vehicle or operator.

EnviroDepots

EnviroDepots remain open, but only for necessary trips. Please continue to maintain physical distancing of two metres at the depots. Cash is not accepted at the depots, but credit and debit continue to be accepted.

The $1.50 per bag fee for residents that need to dispose of Bagged Garbage remains waived until May 4, 2020 at the following three EnviroDepots:

West EnviroDepot - Oxford Street, 1450 Oxford Street West
East EnviroDepot - Clarke Road South, 28 Clarke Road
North EnviroDepot - Clarke Road North (at Try Recycling Inc.), 21462 Clarke Road
Household Special Waste Depot Remains Closed

The Household Special Waste Depot located inside the W12A Landfill is closed until further notice.

Residents are asked to continue to store household special waste items safely at home. Do not place these items in the garbage.",City of London,,Three Container Exemption Pickups and Bulky Waste: Expectations During COVID-19,https://www.london.ca/newsroom/Pages/Three-Container-Exemption-Pickups-and-Bulky-Waste.aspx,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2020-03-17,Canada,Ontario,Niagara,1.0,0.0,,Government Website,"​As the COVID-19 situation continues to rapidly evolve, and to ensure consistency with the Government of Canada and Government of Ontario, Niagara Region Public Health reiterates the following measures to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the region.
 
Recommendations from the province as of March 17, 2020:
Avoid large gatherings over 50 people
Closure of the following settings as soon as possible:
All facilities providing indoor recreational programs
All public libraries
All private schools as defined in the Education Act
All licensed child care centres
All bars and restaurants, except to the extent that such facilities provide takeout food and delivery
All theatres including those offering live performances of music, dance, and other art forms, as well as cinemas that show movies
Concert venues
Full details can be found in the media release from the Office of the Premier of Ontario.
 
Announcements such as these understandably can generate a sense of panic or crisis. It is important to remember that over 80 per cent of COVID-19 illness is mild, and that we can continue with our essential daily activities as much as possible within these new limitations, and taking some reasonable precautions as outlined below.
 
Contact Niagara Region Public Health and Emergency Services by calling 905-688-8248 ext. 7019 or toll-free 1-888-505-6074 if you have a fever, or new cough, or shortness of breath and difficulty breathing, and any of the following:
Travelled outside of Canada in the 14 days before onset of illness
Close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19
Close contact with a person with acute respiratory illness who travelled to affected areas within 14 days prior to their illness onset
The best way to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including COVID-19 is to:
Avoid all non-essential international travel, as recommended by Provincial and Federal health authorities
Wash your hands often with soap and water or with alcohol-based hand rub
Practice social distancing by avoiding unnecessary close interaction with others (e.g. shaking hands, deferring events)
Stay home if you’re sick
Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue or sleeve
Clean and disinfect high touch surfaces daily. Use a disinfectant and follow manufacturer’s instructions.
Call ahead if visiting your health care provider for infectious symptoms so they can plan to protect others from spread
We continue to recommend that Niagara residents practice social distancing measures:
Minimize close contact - keep 1-2 metres apart
Limit non-essential trips into the community
Postpone or cancel gatherings
As this is an evolving situation, we continue to remind everyone the importance of using credible sources to stay informed. We update our website frequently as new information is confirmed. We encourage all Niagara residents to visit our Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) webpage.

Today, in anticipation of a surge of COVID-19 activity in Niagara in the coming weeks, Niagara Region and Niagara’s 12 local area municipalities have jointly declared a state of emergency.

Declaring an emergency under s 7.0.1 (1) of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act provides Niagara with all options available to protect the health and safety of Niagara residents.

Joint Statement

The Mayors and Regional Chair offer the following joint statement regarding the decision to declare this emergency to help protect the health of Niagara:

“The timing of this declaration is imperative as our actions over the next several weeks will determine how well Niagara will fare in the COVID-19 pandemic. This situation represents a real and pressing risk to the health of our community and we all need to work together to slow the spread of the virus.

By declaring this emergency together, we are underscoring the critical nature of the situation with everyone in the region. We know most of you are following the guidance of our public health experts, and we offer our sincere thanks. We recognize how hard this time is for everyone, and the sacrifices you are making to practice physical distancing, and even complete isolation in some cases.

We are here today, as a united Niagara, to ask everyone who is currently following these directives to keep it up. You are making a real difference by slowing the spread of the virus and you are helping to protect the health of your friends, families and neighbours.

Your responsible behaviour is also helping to protect our vital healthcare workers, hospital staff and first responders. These are the people who are working around the clock to keep us all safe and we all need to step up and do our part to help keep them healthy.

But through this declaration we also want to address those in our communities who think these rules and regulations do not apply to them. Ignoring the order to stay home and practice physical distancing is not negotiable. We are at a tipping point in this pandemic, and everyone needs to get on board – we are all in this together and we need everyone to do their part.

We know that with the arrival of warmer weather, and the upcoming religious holidays, there will be some across Niagara who may not follow the public health directions as closely as they should. But these next few weeks could be the most important for our community if we want to slow the spread of the virus and protect as many people as possible.

On behalf of the people of Niagara, we would like to offer our heartfelt thanks and gratitude to the healthcare workers, hospital staff and first responders in our community. You are doing incredible work and putting your health on the line to keep us all safe. We will forever be in your debt.

We want to acknowledge and thank the residents, non-profit groups and service clubs helping those in need during these difficult times. We recognize these efforts and encourage those who are helping their neighbours in self-isolation due to age, health or being at a higher risk to keep it up.

We also want to call the people of Niagara to action. There are countless examples of our residents and businesses rising to the occasion over the past 50 years, and this will be no different. We ask you to check in on each other with a phone call, email or video chat. Offer to help friends, family and loved ones with groceries if you have to make the trip. If you have family members or neighbours over the age of 70 do what you can to make sure they don’t have to leave the house. And finally, if you have the means, consider making financial donations to your local food banks.

It is during these most challenging times that Niagara proves it is one of the best places to live, work, raise a family and do business. As your Mayors and Regional Chair, we want to assure you that when we arrive on the other side of this emergency we will be a stronger, and more resilient Niagara. Remember, stay home and stay safe.”

Directives for Niagara

Residents are reminded that the following mandatory directives are now in place:

​Stop all gatherings of more than five people (this includes private gatherings of extended family)
Avoid all outdoor recreational amenities, including parks, playgrounds, beaches and sports fields
Close all non-essential businesses
Stay home as much as possible and only leave the house once a week if required
Self-isolate for 14 days if you have symptoms or have returned to Canada from being outside the country
Practice physical distancing and wash hands frequently
Enforcing the Emergency Management and Civil Protections Act

Municipalities across Ontario have the power to issue fines to enforce these public health and emergency directives. Failing to comply with an emergency order carries a fine of $750 per offence, and up to $1,000 for obstructing those attempting to carry out their duties under the Act.

Concerns around enforcement should be directed to local municipal by-law offices. After-hours calls may also be directed to the Niagara Regional Police Service’s non-​emergency line at 905-688-4111. Do not call 911.

More information on Niagara’s response to the COVID-19 situation can be found on the Region's COVID-19 webpage, or by calling Public Health’s COVID-19 Info-Line at 905-688-8248 (press 7, then press 2).

2020-03-13,Canada,Ontario,Ottawa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,1.0,,Government Website,"The City of Ottawa is closing all City-managed recreation and cultural facilities, and all Ottawa Public Library branches, based on the recommendation of the Ministry of Health’s guidance to limit mass gatherings. These proactive measures are being taken as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic. Staying ahead of the curve will require us to work together – the City and you – to help stop the spread in our communities.

All recreation and cultural facilities, including recreation complexes, community centers, arenas, swimming pools, theatres and museums will be closed, effective Monday, March 16.
City programs, including March break camps and fitness classes, will also be cancelled, starting Monday, as will performances at the Shenkman and Meridian Theatres. There is no need for ticketholders to call 3-1-1 as tickets will be refunded automatically. Programming and rental fee refunds will also be processed automatically. All other inquiries can be sent by email to 123go@ottawa.ca.(link sends e-mail)
All Client Service Centres and City Hall will remain open.
The City of Ottawa will be providing regular updates through on ottawa.ca and through our social media channels. Ottawa Public Health will also continue to provide updates related to COVID-19 in Ottawa on OttawaPublicHealth.ca/Coronavirus(link is external). This is an evolving situation and the most current information will be shared with the public through all official City channels.

Ottawa now has confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ottawa. To date, all have been related to international travel. In addition to preventive measures(link is external) that you can take at home, at work and in public settings, here are some steps your City is taking to limit the impact in Ottawa.

What the City is doing

Service Ottawa - The City is taking steps to help prevent the spread of the virus in our facilities. You can go on to myservice.ottawa.ca to pay your water bills and your interim property taxes. If you do not have an account, registration is simple – you can sign up with your email address. Once registered, you’ll need your account or property roll number to pay your bill.

City bills have other payment options besides the myservice.ottawa.ca accounts, which include:

Paying by credit or debit card online at ottawa.ca
Paying through your financial institution by creating a payee number on your institution’s mobile app or through an ATM machine
Residents can access many other services online as well. You do not need to come in person to a Client Service Centre if you want to:

Register or renew a pet registration
Apply or renew open air fire permit
Pay a parking or traffic ticket
Look up extension or reopening applications
Apply for a Food Premise Business License
Sign up for future recreation programs
Load up and manage a Presto Card
Long-term care facilities

Seniors are vulnerable for serious and life-threatening complications from COVID-19. An extensive screening process has been instituted in our long-term care facilities. Any visitors or staff who may be feeling ill, been in contact with anyone not feeling well, or recently travelled outside of Canada, should not visit the centres – to protect your loved ones and their fellow residents.

More extensive cleaning and sanitizing procedures at City facilities

The City has increased its cleaning and sanitizing processes in our facilities – allowing us to continue with programming over the weekend. For the safety of our employees and residents, please avoid entering our facilities and Client Service Centres if you are sick or not feeling well.

Public consultation meetings

In-person City of Ottawa public consultations will be cancelled – including for the Ward Boundary Review and the Community Safety and Well-being Plan. You can still participate in consultations by completing online surveys at engage.ottawa.ca.

Committee and Council Meetings

The City is also working to limit the number of Committee meetings. If agendas are updated, information will be available on ottawa.ca.

Provincial Offences Act court appearances

If you have a scheduled court appearance at Mary Pitt Centre, 100 Constellation Drive, but you are showing symptoms, please call 3-1-1 before your court time to receive further directions.

What you can do

If you are showing symptoms, please avoid taking public transit.

There is currently no vaccine for COVID-19. To reduce the spread of germs including the flu and the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) we recommend that you:

Wash your hands often with soap and water, or use hand sanitizer
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth unless you have just cleaned your hands
Cover your cough and sneeze with a tissue or into your arm, not your hand
If possible, stay home if you are sick
Avoid visiting people in hospitals or long-term care centres if you are sick
It is still recommended to get your flu shot if you haven’t already as the flu virus is still circulating in the community

2020-03-20,Canada,Ontario,Ottawa,,,,,,,,,,2.0,0.0,,Government Website,"The City is actively working with its partners to identify the needs of the community during the COVID-19 outbreak and to support this vulnerable population. The City recognizes the difficult circumstances our residents are facing and we are prepared to respond to those challenges to meet the needs of our community.

The City has established a Human Services Task Force to ensure we are responsive to the emerging needs of the community. In addition to representatives from City departments and Ottawa Public Health, the task force includes partners from all sectors, including:

United Way East Ontario
Coalition of Community Health and Resource Centres of Ottawa
Ottawa Community Housing
Ottawa Food Bank
Canadian Red Cross
The Salvation Army
Ottawa Inner City Health
The task force will:

Plan how to provide food, housing, shelter and psychosocial supports in future scenarios.
Coordinate information, service changes and emerging needs.
Resolve issues, service gaps and community concerns.
The task force is currently working on:

Food security
Twenty-three of Ottawa’s 26 food banks are currently open and additional locations are expected to close in the coming weeks due to a lack of volunteers.
Information about how to access the food bank is regularly updated on ottawafoodbank.ca.(link is external)
The Ottawa Fod Bank is working on alternative pick up locations and increasing the number of volunteers(link is external).
Isolated seniors
The Good Companions is closed. Staff have been redirected to essential programs.
The Good Companions’ Senior Centres Without Walls program is ramping up to provide transportation to emergency services, medical appointments and shopping, and to deliver groceries and Meals on Wheels.
The City is working to identify further support required for seniors.
Transportation of vulnerable residents to COVID-19 assessment centres and medical appointments
Community partners are assessing the need.
Volunteer management to support community efforts during a pandemic
We recognize the generosity of those looking to volunteer. Currently, we are not seeking volunteers to help with the response to COVID-19. However, this is a priority for the City, and we are looking at ways to provide opportunities for those who want to support their community. As Ottawa Public Health has suggested, residents can help by checking in with neighbours and friends who may be vulnerable, overwhelmed, lonely or in need of help.
The City continues to deliver essential programs and services to support residents.

Employment and Social Services

Ontario Works financial assistance may be available for basic living expenses and health expenses.
Residents should make requests by phone, not in person. Please call 3-1-1 and press 4 for Social Services.
Existing clients can call or email their case worker.
Ontario Works clients can use the online tool MyBenefits for any updates.
Staff are waiting on further direction on changes to the Employment Insurance program.
Long-Term Care

The City’s four long-term care homes are open.
Staff are following best practices to ensure everyone’s safety, including screening all visitors.
Visitors are limited to family visiting residents at end of life or in palliative care.
Adult day programs and tours of the homes are cancelled.
Children’s Services

Licensed child care centres, including municipal child care centres, and EarlyON Child and Family Centres are closed.
The City is asking the Province about exceptions so essential staff can access child care.
Housing Services

The City continues to support residents experiencing homelessness or at risk of becoming homeless through emergency shelters, support services and outreach.
Households and landlords will get housing allowances and rent supplements one week early to assist with cash flow.
There will be no evictions from social housing during this time.
The Social Housing Registry continues to take calls from residents. People fleeing domestic violence can continue to apply for priority housing.
Housing providers are checking in with vulnerable tenants over the phone.
Visits to the City’s family shelter are limited to specialized services.
Ottawa Inner City Health is visiting shelters with a mobile assessment van and has a nurse on call during evenings and weekends.
On Monday, March 23 the Routhier Community Centre will be converted to a temporary isolation centre for people in the shelter system who are required to self-isolate due to COVID-19. This will help mitigate the spread of the virus within the shelter environment.
The City will consult with Ottawa Public Health to implement best practices for cleaning and maintaining the centre, both as its use as an isolation centre and before it is returned to the City for community use.
The City is exploring options for families who may need to self-isolate due to exposure, symptoms or testing positive for COVID-19.
Funding for homelessness programs continues. Some agencies are closed, but staff are available by phone. Agencies that are open have reduced staffing, are social distancing and are following strict hygiene procedures.
Please call 2-1-1 for more information on the community, social, government and health services and programs available in Ottawa.

While the City is not currently looking for volunteers, residents who want to help can check in with neighbours and friends who may be vulnerable, overwhelmed, lonely or in need of help.

The campaign encourages residents to support their favourite small businesses by taking immediate and concrete steps now:

Buy from local businesses online.
Purchase gift cards from local businesses to use later.
Order delivery or takeout from area restaurants.
Send local businesses messages of support on social media.
These actions will help local shops, restaurants and services by providing them with critical income during this challenging period.

The campaign includes targeted ads that will reach residents on several online platforms over the coming weeks and direct them to ottawa.ca/buylocal. There, residents will find links to sites listing businesses serving customers virtually or providing takeout and meal delivery.

The City is also launching a web page on ottawa.ca to provide businesses with access to essential information and support programs. The page will have links to provincial and federal assistance programs, as well as details on measures offered by the City to help businesses in the coming weeks and months. This includes the property tax deferral and other relief measures that Council approved at its meeting on March 25.

Before I begin, I would like to offer my most sincere condolences to the family of the resident who has passed away this past weekend.

As Dr. Etches mentioned, this is the second death related to COVID-19, it serves as a sad and important reminder that we all need to do our part in making efforts to flatten the curve.

This means washing your hands regularly, respecting physical (social) distancing guidelines, limiting trips outside the house to essential ones only, and to check in virtually on family, friends and neighbours.

New Enforcement Measures 

We need to keep residents safe and do everything we can to slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community.

That is why Ottawa By-law Officers have been given the ability to enforce new rules under the Ontario Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act related to physical distancing.

This means that, effective immediately, a dedicated team of officers at By-law and Regulatory Services will be proactively monitoring and enforcing calls related to:

Gatherings of more than 5 people in public or private residences;
People congregating in parks/using park facilities or equipment;
Restaurants that continue to offer dine-in services; and,
Non-essential retail businesses continuing to operate.
Residents who witness these issues should report them by calling 3-1-1.

By-law Officers will be taking a progressive enforcement approach; with the initial goal to educate residents and businesses about these laws and their importance to public health.

As time goes on, failure to comply could result in fines under the provincial Act of up to $100,000 for individuals, $500,000 for a director of a corporation or $10-million for a corporation itself.

By-law and Regulatory Services continues to collaborate with the Ottawa Police Service, which will continue to enforce calls related to Quarantine Orders issued to individuals who have been travelling or are experiencing symptoms related to COVID-19.

Complaints related to the Quarantine Act should be reported to the non-urgent Ottawa Police phone line at 613-236-1222.

2020 Spring Freshet 

In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are now facing the 2020 Spring Freshet.

Many of Ottawa residents awoke today with renewed concerns for potential flooding given the heavy weekend rains.

Staff has advised me that water levels are not currently at threatening levels.

Later today, I will be issuing a memo to Council saying that I have asked Councillor Eli El-Chantiry to play a leadership role as Council Liaison on the 2020 Spring Freshet.

Councillor El-Chantiry has been front and centre in helping our local communities rebuild after the devastating floods that hit our City in 2017 and 2019.

Some of you may recall that Councillor El-Chantiry was helping his friends and neighbours sandbag their properties while his family was losing a property to the flooding.

Councillor El-Chantiry will work closely with members of Councillor whose wards have been most severely impacted in the past, including Councillor Theresa Kavanagh (Bay) and Councillor George Darouze (Osgoode) - who is temporarily managing Cumberland Ward issues for Cumberland Village and other parts of the ward.

I want to thank Councillor El-Chantiry for liaising with the City’s senior leadership team, my office, members of Council and key community agencies over the course of the coming days and until such time as the 2020 spring flood threat is behind us.

This is an exceptionally challenging time for our City and our residents, and I want to thank Councillor El-Chantiry and all members of Council for working together as we focus on mobilizing the spirit and resources our communities need to overcome these challenges.",Ottawa Public Health,,"March 30, 2020 - Special statement from Mayor Jim Watson",https://www.ottawapublichealth.ca/en/public-health-topics/novel-coronavirus.aspx?utm_source=OPH&utm_medium=Friendly_URL&utm_campaign=Coronavirus&utm_content=Friendly_URL#March-30-2020---Special-statement-from-Mayor-Jim-Watson,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2020-04-08,Canada,Ontario,Ottawa,,,,,,,,,,2.0,1.0,,Government Website,"Over the past four weeks, the Province of Ontario and the City of Ottawa have issued many regulations, closures, and restrictions under their states of emergency to help prevent group gatherings, flatten the spread of the COVID-19, and save lives. These are not merely guidelines – they are law.

That’s why the City’s By-law and Regulatory Services are monitoring, to raise awareness and, when required, enforcing compliance for many of these measures. 

Gatherings of five or more

The Province has prohibited gatherings of five people or more, which includes social gatherings, parties, and groups playing sports. By-law staff will monitor and respond to complaints to ensure compliance with warnings and education – which can also carry an $880 fine, including the victim surcharge for each person involved.

Exception: Gatherings at funerals can include up to 10 people. Attendees must follow physical distancing and keep two metres from others.

Gathering in parks, using amenities and equipment

Parks are sites that attract gatherings on sports fields, courts, skateboard ramps and multiple users on equipment – like play structures, exercise-related equipment, and swings. That is why the City has closed parks, posted signs, and cordoned off equipment and amenities. Gatherings in the park and use of equipment are strictly prohibited and By-law staff will be patrolling proactively and responding to complaints to ensure compliance through warnings and education, but it can also carry a fine of $880.

Remember, structures and equipment, even picnic tables and benches, are not cleaned regularly – which means these surfaces can help spread this highly contagious virus.

Exception: While the parks are closed for gatherings and the use of amenities, you can walk or jog directly through the park. Please do not loiter and remember to keep a two-metre distance of others and continue that physical distancing on streets and sidewalks.

Non-essential businesses and dine-in practice at restaurants

The provincial regulations require the closure of all non-essential businesses and the prohibition of all dine-in practices for food establishments. By-law staff will be monitoring these businesses and responding to complaints to ensure compliance, which can carry a fine of $880.

Fines for all these infractions are provincially mandated and all revenue from the fines will be collected by the Province of Ontario.

To report any violations of these protective measures to By-law and Regulatory Services, contact the City of Ottawa at 3-1-1.

Who handles self-isolation (quarantine) enforcement and regulations?

The Quarantine Act is a federal law and enforcement is handled by the Ottawa Police Service (OPS). OPS has been actively enforcing the regulations under the Act that cover those people who have travelled outside Canada and exhibit flu-related symptoms and received a red quarantine order receipt from Canada Border Service Agency officials. To get in touch with Ottawa Police with respect to offences in relation to orders issued under the Federal Quarantine Act you can call 613-236-1222, extension 7502.

Ottawa Public Health, which is monitoring those undergoing COVID-19 testing, follows up directly with those residents receiving a positive COVID-19 test results. They establish a list of close contacts for follow-up investigations and to explain the self-isolation process. Each person also receives a Self-Isolation factsheet to ensure they understand the requirements for self-isolation.

While many people feel burdened by restrictions and enforcement, these are in place to protect you and the health of your family, friends and fellow neighbours. The sooner we can flatten the spread of this virus, the sooner we can return to the lives and freedoms that we have taken for granted. Let’s remain united by keeping apart.

These holidays are often celebrated with gatherings of friends and family.   

I urge everyone not to gather in person, even with extended family outside of your household, as we still need everyone’s efforts to flatten the curve. Instead, I encourage you to find ways to connect through technology for these celebrations.     

We know following these measures has been difficult, and it’s understandable if you are feeling stressed or overwhelmed. Personal connections are how we often support one another through tough times, and this lack of in-person connection is one facet of what makes this emergency unique and more difficult.

I encourage everyone to find ways to support their mental health at this time. Take the time to do what is best for you - whether that means taking a walk alone, taking a break from the news, or cooking a holiday meal with your household members. 

Some people may consider using alcohol during times of stress. We also know that alcohol is the most commonly used substance in Ottawa. This was the case before this pandemic, and recent news reports during COVID-19 have indicated an increase in alcohol sales across the country. Alcohol use is associated with more negative outcomes for individuals and families.  There are some important things we can do to ensure we are balancing our alcohol intake during these challenging times:

Set limits for yourself and stick to them;
Drink slowly, and have no more than 2 standard drinks in 3 hours;
Avoid stockpiling alcohol; and
Keep a daily routine, be physically active, and virtually connect with family and friends as healthy ways to manage stress.
For all residents, there are resources and supports available for alcohol, substance use, and mental health, as well as for women and children specifically. Please visit our OPH mental health and COVID-19 webpage to learn more and see what is available for you and your family.

Number of cases
As of 4 pm yesterday, OPH is investigating 458 lab-confirmed cases in the community and 13 outbreaks in institutions. That’s 29 new cases since yesterday. We also have 143 resolved cases.

The number of people hospitalized and in intensive care also changes daily. There are currently 30 people in hospital (five less than yesterday) and 12 of them are in ICU (one less than yesterday).

Sadly, nine people now have died in total. Of these, 8 were over the age of 65 years and 1 was 45-64 years old. Six males and three females.

Increasing testing
There is now more capacity to test people at the COVID-19 Community Assessment Centre at Brewer Arena.

The priority of the healthcare system is being able to test those who are most in need of testing. High priority individuals include:

Health care workers and staff who work in health care facilities;
Residents and staff in long-term care facilities, retirement homes, and other institutional settings (e.g. correctional facilities, homeless shelters);
Hospitalized patients admitted with respiratory symptoms; and
Members of remote, isolated, rural, and/or indigenous communities.
Testing is also available for the following people to be tested for COVID-19 if they’re showing symptoms such as fever, cough or shortness of breath:

Essential workers (people working directly with the public)
Household members of health care workers and staff who work in health care facilities
Pregnant individuals in the last three months of their pregnancy
Returning international travelers
Close contacts of confirmed or probable cases
It is also important to remind everyone that it is still not recommended for asymptomatic people from the general public to be tested.

New Care Clinic
To increase access to health services, a second care clinic opened this morning in Ottawa’s east end. It is operated by Hôpital Montfort, in partnership with Ottawa Public Health and the region’s Clinical Care Coordination Centre (C4). The clinic’s primary function is to provide treatment for people with symptoms of respiratory illness – cough, fever, and cold-like symptoms – that can’t be managed at home.  

If you do need to access the Assessment Centre for testing or either care clinic over the long weekend, check out our webpage for updated Easter weekend hours.    

Thank you again for all the actions you are taking as a community – these actions matter. There would be more cases of COVID-19 in our community had everyone not done their part over the past month.

Many of you cancelled family gatherings, opting instead to connect via telephone or video chats. We know this is not easy, but it is vitally important in our continued efforts as a community to flatten the curve of COVID-19.

We have heard that people continue to seek clarity about what is acceptable within physical distancing. Physical distancing involves taking steps to limit the number of people you come into close contact with. Overall this means limiting your contacts to members of your household as much as possible and avoiding all non-essential trips in the community. If you are in your driveway, on your front porch or out for a walk and want to connect with your neighbours, we encourage you to do this as long as you can maintain a 2 metre distance. These measures, along with proper hand hygiene and coughing and sneezing etiquette, are the best way to slow the spread of illness in our community.

Update on testing

Since last week, we have received clarification from the Ontario Ministry of Health with respect to expanded testing criteria for residents and staff of long-term care and retirement homes, for hospital inpatients, as well as for front-line workers. In addition, local laboratories are working hard to increase their capacity for analyzing COVID-19 test swabs and for delivering timely test results.

As Dr. Etches had previously mentioned, continuing to expand access to testing is important to help enable more targeted strategies and the eventual gradual relaxation of current restrictions in the future.

Number of cases

As of 4 pm yesterday, Ottawa Public Health is investigating 619 lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the community and 15 ongoing outbreaks in institutions. Two institutional outbreaks having been resolved. That’s 33 new confirmed cases since yesterday. We also now have 217 resolved cases.

There are currently 42 people in hospital and 16 of them are in intensive care units (ICU). Sadly, 12 people have died. Of these individuals, 11 were over the age of 65 years and one was 45-64 years old, seven males and five females.

EKOS survey

Last week at Council, Dr. Etches referenced an EKOS survey on Ottawa residents’ views about COVID-19. Details of the survey – and survey results, will be posted to our website later today. This survey showed that 84 per cent of Ottawa residents have changed their social behavior in response to COVID-19 by only socializing using remote connections. These actions make a difference in planking the curve and we thank these residents for following public health guidance on physical distancing.

Unsafe at Home Ottawa

We know that for some, home is not a safe place. Crime Prevention Ottawa (CPO), the Ottawa Coalition to End Violence Against Women (OCTEVAW), Interval House of Ottawa and the Eastern Ottawa Resource Centre have teamed up to launch a new initiative called “Unsafe at Home Ottawa” -  a text and online chat tool that allows victims and survivors of domestic violence and abuse to get help and support.

The service was created for those who may find it impossible to reach out by calling a crisis line when trapped at home with their abuser due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and physical distancing measures.

Ottawa Public Health will be promoting these new resources through our social media platforms so please look for those Tweets and Facebook posts and help us amplify these messages.

Thank you again for all the actions you are taking as a community – these actions matter. There would be more cases of COVID-19 in our community had everyone not done their part over the past month.

The closure includes all amenities and equipment such as swings, courts, skateboard ramps, off-leash dog enclosures, benches and picnic tables, ball diamonds and sports fields.

However, the City allows people to walk, run, or ride their bikes directly through the park, but lingering, gatherings or prolonged stays are prohibited.

While most people understand and have abided by these closures and restrictions, many have asked us common questions on the rationale or why simple use is prohibited. Here are some answers to those prevalent questions.

Why can’t just my kid and I kick the ball around the park?

The reason parks are closed is that they are natural attractions for people to group and gather, which goes against the physical distancing measures.

While it seems so harmless for one parent to kick or throw a ball with their kid in the park, you need to look beyond just those two family members.

What could happen is two more people show up, followed by a few more parents and kids. Before you know it, you have a group of people in the park – which increases the risk for compromising physical distancing and spreading the virus.

That is why there are no exceptions to the rule, no matter how simple or harmless it appears. We understand how this pandemic has turned our lives upside down and disrupted the simple things in life. But we need to stick together with this battle to plank the curve and avoid a prolonged spread – which would further disrupt our lives.

Why I can’t sit down on a park bench or have a picnic with my family – while practicing physical distancing with others?

Like in the previous answer, we can’t allow any exceptions to the restrictions. When people see others using the park, it will attract more users.

Also, park equipment and amenities are not cleaned or sanitized. This means the COVID-19 virus can present on any surface – metal, wood or plastic. In fact, the virus can live on surfaces for not just hours, but days. This includes park benches, play equipment and picnic tables.

This puts you and your family at risk to contract the COVID-19 virus and spread it to loved ones.

What is permitted in the park?

The answer to what is permitted is very simple and basic. You can walk, run or ride your bike through the park to get to your destination. However, you cannot linger around the park, use any equipment or sit on a bench. No prolonged stays and no gatherings – even for a simple chat.

And when you are cutting through the park, you must practice physical distancing – keeping two metres from others crossing the park.

You can also walk your dog through the park where this is allowed, while respecting the established leashing requirements for the site. Stopping in a park to throw a ball, to let your dog play or to linger in one area of the park with your dog is not permitted.

Who do I call if I see people using the park and gathering?

You can register your complaint with the City’s By-law and Regulatory Services by calling3-1-1. By-law is enforcing these restrictions with education and warnings, but not adhering to the rules can result in a $880 fine, including victim surcharges.

But if you see someone in the park, do not be confrontational – with shouting and yelling. This is a stressful time for everyone. While we are practicing physical distancing and safety, we also need practice kindness – because we are all in this together.

Why are there no signs in some parks?

Park closure signs have been installed in our 800 parks – especially near equipment and play structures. Some of these signs have been vandalized or ripped down. Even when a sign is no longer present, these restrictions and regulations remain in place.

Restrictions and closures have a purpose – stopping the spread, saving lives

Parks, like other public spaces, encourage gatherings and multiple users. While we are striving to plank the curve of this virus spread, we need to sacrifice and restrain from doing the regular and normal things we usually do – like enjoying a park and playing sports. This pandemic has really proved that we have taken many of life’s simple pleasures for granted.

These restrictions and closures have a real purpose – to prevent further spread of the virus and, more importantly, save lives. The sooner we can stop the spread, the sooner we can enjoy our parks and the in-person company of our friends.

The Province has again increased the categories of people eligible for testing:

Some asymptomatic residents and staff in long-term care and retirement homes experiencing an outbreak;
People experiencing at least one common symptom, and certain less common COVID-19 symptoms have also been added;
People and workers in congregate settings;
First responders;
Caregivers;
People with frequent health care contact; and
People living in remote, isolated, rural or Indigenous communities.
These expanded criteria will allow us to test more people and get a better sense of the potential scope of infection in our community. This is important into the future to enable more targeted strategies and the eventual relaxation of restrictions. I encourage everyone that meets these criteria testing to get tested. We are starting to see the testing numbers increase again.

Managing mental health

We know that this situation is taking a toll on people’s mental health. This was a common concern shared on Twitter this morning when I asked for residents’ ideas on how we can sustain physical distancing measures a bit longer.  Everyone will experience this situation in their own way. It is completely natural to feel stress and concern during these times and so it is important to practice positive coping strategies.

Our team has added various resources on the Ottawa Public Health website, including a video on maintaining your mental health and a list of telephone, text or chat services. These may be helpful to you. However, if you are in crisis, please contact the Distress Centre at 613-238-3311. They are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Also, in response to the COVID-19 situation, the Walk-in Counselling Clinic is offering phone and video counselling services.

Wearing face coverings and masks

A lot of people have been asking if they should be wearing face coverings or masks when they do leave their home and go out into the community; this was also a common theme on the Twitter discussion about how we can sustain physical distancing. We know that there is some asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission of COVID-19; so if you cannot maintain physical distancing, wearing a mask helps to protect people you may come into contact with when you’re out in the community. It provides an added layer of protection.

Continue physical distancing

We continue to ask people to limit trips outside the home to essential needs such as for groceries, medicine or daily physical activity and to limit close contacts to members of their household. Thank you to the many residents who have provided ideas on Twitter about how we can be resilient in this difficult time; the top themes shared were about consideration for how our outdoor spaces can be used and for all to continue to spread love and kindness in different ways. I will take these suggestions into the planning process for when we are able to safely relax restrictions.

Our efforts are working. We are seeing signs of hope, but we need to keep practicing physical distancing in order to get to the other side of the curve.

Daily case numbers

Details about the daily case numbers are updated on our website daily.

Ottawa, you are proving to be a committed and resilient city, and I appreciate all of the feedback I have been receiving about considerations for relaxing some measures, when it is time, in coordination with the provincial and federal governments. Maintaining physical distancing and handling the uncertainty around the impact of COVID-19 is unprecedented in our lives. How we collectively work through these current challenges, and how we bounce back from this adversity in a positive way, will continue to build our strength as a community.

There would be more cases of COVID-19 in our community had everyone not done their part over the past month. Please keep up this hard work over the next stretch of time. Thank you again for all the actions you are taking as a community – these actions are saving lives.

Cases and new deaths

As of 4 pm on April 16, 2020, OPH is investigating 728 lab-confirmed cases (50 newly reported since yesterday). An increase in testing and possibly the expanded testing recommendations might be contributing in part to the increase in newly-identified cases.    

Of great concern and with sadness is the increase of seven new deaths since yesterday, bringing the total number of deaths in Ottawa to 21.

This number is the largest recorded number of deaths in Ottawa in one day since the beginning of this emergency response. All seven deaths are related to outbreaks in long-term care and retirement homes. Fifty-seven percent (12/21) of all deaths due to COVID-19 in Ottawa are related to outbreaks in long-term care and retirement homes.

My thoughts are with the family members, friends, and caregivers of the people who have died. OPH continues to work with health care partners to ensure long-term care and retirement homes are a top priority for protection.

It is encouraging that 42 per cent of confirmed cases have been resolved. Hospitalizations (37) and ICU admissions (13) are down slightly.

A further breakdown of epidemiological data can be found on our website.

Consideration for reducing physical distancing measures

Our collective actions will determine when we can begin to relax some of the measures. We can begin to consider changes when we see the rate of new cases and hospitalizations slow down, and we know our hospitals and health care system are ready and have capacity to meet the demand. Keeping two metres apart really makes a difference, and the more that we keep up with this physical distancing, the sooner we’ll be able to relax restrictions in a careful way. Many people have been sharing their ideas about what is most important to start up first. For example, increasing access to more outdoor spaces to have adequate space for walking, biking, and playing has been a common idea from residents. 

One strategy used in communities that have reduced restrictions is the use of masks and face coverings in public when the two-metre distance cannot be maintained. There is community transmission here in Ottawa – 25 per cent of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 are currently not linked to travel or close contact with a confirmed case.

We also know that there is some asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission of COVID-19; these individuals may not yet be self-isolating. Wearing a homemade mask provides an added layer of protection for the people you may come into contact with when you’re out in the community.

This online engagement platform, called COVID-19: Share your thoughts, will allow us to learn how residents are making changes in their lives to protect themselves and loved ones, what their experience has been receiving and understanding information, what kinds of supports residents have accessed, ideas to maintain physical distancing into the future and what is perhaps much needed right now – good news stories.

The City and OPH are currently exploring how we can safely reopen the city in a gradual, phased approach while aligning with the Province of Ontario’s framework for reopening the province, and we must include public feedback.

The information we receive from residents will help to ensure we develop a plan for the post-peak period that aligns with the province and meets the needs and expectations of our community as much as possible.  OPH is also working with stakeholders, such as the Mayor’s office and City leadership, City task forces, health system partners, the NCC and others, to interpret and apply the anticipated provincial guidelines within Ottawa.

Community and client engagement is one of the transformational initiatives in OPH’s strategic plan. Engagement is a process to work with our community, not just for our community, and ensures the decisions we make, and the work that we do, is rooted in the voices of clients and partners.

I encourage everyone to visit https://engage.ottawa.ca/covid19 or https://participons.ottawa.ca/covid19 to participate in English and French. Please check back regularly as we will update this page to seek ongoing feedback as we continue to navigate next steps.

Aging Well in Ottawa

One other way that OPH regularly engages with our residents is through Facebook. This week we launched another moderated Facebook page, called Aging Well in Ottawa for residents 55 years of age and older and their caregivers. This page has had a lot of interest in its first week.  Ottawa Public Health staff will be online from 9 am to 3 pm daily (Monday to Friday) to discuss timely health topics, address questions and support residents to connect with one another. Please join us online for this exciting new initiative.

Updated testing criteria

OPH is now recommending that any residents over 60 years of age experiencing any signs or symptoms of COVID-19, go for assessment.  The full list of who is eligible for testing is available on our website.  You can get tested at a COVID-19 Assessment Centre or a COVID-19 Care Clinic.

If you are in distress (e.g. significant trouble breathing, chest pain, fainting, or have a significant worsening of any chronic disease symptoms), do not go to the Assessment Centre or a COVID-19 Care clinic. Go to the nearest Emergency Department or call 9-1-1.

New case management system and epidemiology report

OPH is transitioning to a new case management and reporting system called the COVID-19 Ottawa Database. This transition will position OPH to better manage COVID-19 case volumes, facilitate remote work options for the case management team and continue to uphold provincial reporting obligations.

To support the transition, OPH is currently conducting quality assurance to validate the data in the new system. In the interim, a snapshot report will be posted until the transition is complete, likely early next week.

With COVID-19 wreaking havoc on everyone’s lives, it’s reassuring to know that some things don’t change. Take 3-1-1 for example. Whether it’s 12 pm or 3 am, whether the city is facing a tornado, a flood or a global pandemic, the men and women on the other end of that line are there around the clock, 365 days a year.

Toronto’s Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Eileen de Villa, this afternoon, announced recommendations for anyone in Toronto who has recently arrived from outside of Canada, including the United States, to limit their social interactions with large groups of people, and avoid all contact in hospital settings, with older residents or those with chronic illnesses. This recommendation is in addition to guidelines already provided for anyone who has been to Hubei Province in China, Italy or Iran to self-isolate for 14 days.

The Medical Officer of Health is also recommending residents and event organizers conduct a thorough risk assessment before going ahead with any planned large events. A federal government tool – Public Health Mass Gathering Risk Assessment Tool – is available here: canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/health-professionals/mass-gatherings-risk-assesment.htm and event organizers are encouraged to use this tool to make decisions about cancelling or continuing their event.

The City is also using this tool to help inform decisions about scheduled public meetings or events. Where possible, it will look to transition to virtual meetings, or postpone meetings and events where that is not possible. There are no statutory public meetings scheduled for next week, March 16-20.

Further, effective immediately, business travel will be cancelled for all City of Toronto staff until further notice.

To date, there has been no community transmission of COVID-19. It is with this knowledge that the City is asking everyone to do their part to limit that possibility. Individuals need to very carefully assess risks to themselves and others if they have travelled. If they are unwell, stay home and contact Toronto Public Health if symptoms of COVID-19 materialize. The Toronto Public Health website has information to assist Torontonians in their decision-making at toronto.ca/coronavirus.

Toronto Fire Chief Matthew Pegg, who is leading the City of Toronto’s operational planning and response to this global pandemic, announced that the City's Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) has been activated at Level 2 as of March 12 at 2 p.m. to support the following:
• Effective policy and strategic direction to the emergency
• Emergency operations
• Consequence management
• Resource management
• Coordination of management linkages to the emergency site, Divisional Operations Centre, external agencies and the Provincial Emergency Operations Centre
• Information to the public and news media
• Business continuity for the rest of the City

The work of the City's COVID-19 task force is continuing and is not impacted by the transition to Level 2 operations within the EOC.

You can view the City’s news conference here: youtube.com/watch?v=NZ8p0scpksQ. And read statements by Dr. de Villa on COVID-19 here: toronto.ca/coronavirus.

Toronto is home to more than 2.9 million people whose diversity and experiences make this great city Canada’s leading economic engine and one of the world’s most diverse and livable cities. As the fourth largest city in North America, Toronto is a global leader in technology, finance, film, music, culture, and innovation, and consistently places at the top of international rankings due to investments championed by its government, residents and businesses.

Today, as part of the City of Toronto's ongoing response to COVID-19, Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Eileen de Villa is strongly recommending all bars, dine-in restaurants, nightclubs, and theatres close to further prevent the spread of COVID-19 effective 12:01 a.m., March 17, 2020.

Businesses that provide food takeout and delivery options are encouraged to keep those options available to continue to provide the public with food options while limiting social interactions between people.

Many restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and theatres have already taken the important step of voluntarily closing their doors to the seated public during the pandemic response. Dr. de Villa is encouraging the rest of the industry to follow that example for the health of our entire community.

Dr. de Villa warned that if businesses fail to comply with the recommendation, she will issue orders to individual establishments under Section 22 of the Health Protection and Promotion Act.

Dr. de Villa is recommending this unprecedented step to protect the health and safety of all Toronto residents, and to further encourage residents to undertake social distancing – limiting their interactions with other residents to avoid the possibility of spreading COVID-19 through the community. Every social interaction that doesn't happen will further prevent the spread of COVID-19 and avoid people carrying the virus to vulnerable residents of our city, including seniors and people with pre-existing health conditions.

This is a critical time to flatten the growth curve of COVID-19 in our community and Toronto Public Health, along with the City of Toronto, is committed to doing everything possible based on the expert advice of public health professionals to stop the spread of COVID-19.

Toronto Public Health continues to encourage all residents to stay home if possible and reduce their interactions with other people. As well, residents who have travelled outside of Canada, including to the United States, are strongly encouraged by Toronto Public Health to self-isolate for 14 days.

Many residents that work frontline jobs in healthcare and emergency services can't work from home. Dr. de Villa said the measures being urged today, provided the public follows them, will help protect those frontline workers and allow them to continue to do their jobs.

The City is also working to address the economic impact of COVID-19. The Mayor's Economic Support and Recovery Task Force was launched Monday along with the announcement of several measures aimed at providing immediate economic relief. The City is also exempting retail businesses from its Noise Bylaw to facilitate after-hour deliveries.

311 and the Toronto Public Health Hotline are experiencing a very high volume of calls. Answers to the many questions residents have are available at toronto.ca/home/covid-19, including a full list of COVID-19 related City cancellations and closures. By using this online resource, wait times on the phone can be reduced, allowing staff to address more complex questions.

The City’s website will be updated regularly as new information becomes available. People are encouraged to check back often for the latest information on programs and services.

Quotes:

“I believe these unprecedented public health recommendations are necessary in order to protect the health of all Toronto residents. Every opportunity to avoid interactions with others helps to prevent the spread of this disease. Every interaction avoided helps to flatten the curve. So, if you can, stay home, help out our city by reducing your interaction with others. Every little bit counts.”
- Dr. Eileen de Villa, Medical Officer of Health

“I support Dr. de Villa's strong recommendation for restaurants, bars, nightclubs and theatres to close their in-house options and focus on delivery and takeout services. We are following the advice of our public health professionals to make sure we are doing everything possible to confront the COVID-19 pandemic and protect our residents and our city. I encourage all Toronto residents to practice social distancing as much as possible to protect their health and the health of their loved ones and neighbours.”
- Mayor John Tory

“I know that all of this information, and the changes to our daily routines and schedules, is a lot to absorb and adapt to. I want residents to know that at Toronto Public Health and the City of Toronto we are prepared, we will continue to act quickly, and we will not let our residents down.”
- City Councillor and Board of Health Chair Joe Cressy

This afternoon, Mary-Anne Bédard, General Manager of the City’s Shelter, Support and Housing Administration (SSHA), announced the City is strengthening prevention and response to COVID-19 in our emergency shelter system. There are currently no cases of COVID-19 in Toronto’s shelter system.

SSHA is responding to COVID-19 with a three-tier approach. First, it is creating the ability for additional social distancing spacing within the existing shelter system through creation of new programs. The first spaces opened yesterday and by the end of this week the plan is for 200 spaces within City facilities that are currently empty. This will not create additional capacity in our shelters, but will allow the City to move people within existing programs, particularly the 24-hour respite sites and 24-hour drop-ins.

Second, the City is creating additional isolation spaces for people identified through screening and assessment processes that are awaiting test results. This process has been initiated and the City continues to move people who need it over this week into isolation.

SSHA is using Toronto Public Health’s recommended screening questions at all points of entry by phone or in-person for all those seeking shelter. Anyone wanting to access the shelter system who should be assessed for COVID-19 is being referred to one of the Province's assessment centres.

People who are experiencing homelessness who are being tested for COVID-19 will not be admitted into our regular shelter system. Instead, they will be isolated in separate spaces at a designated program location. This is the first program of its kind in Canada, as a medically supported isolation service for people who are homeless while they wait to receive their test results.

On the third tier, the City is working with its provincial partners to identify an appropriate service for people who have tested positive for COVID-19.

To date, no one has tested positive in the shelter system and the City is working hard to ensure it has a program available should that occur, and that it has the appropriate medical supports in place to protect staff, community partners and those it serves.

Another vulnerable group the City serves are newcomers and refugee claimants who request access to emergency shelter. In Toronto, each week, there are an average of 100 new refugee claimants who access the shelter system. The actions that the federal government took yesterday to close the border with some exceptions will likely reduce the number of refugees entering the shelter system.
Toronto is asking the federal government to screen and quarantine anyone who has entered the country in the past 14 days at the border, particularly those who have nowhere to go through their own means where they will be able to self-isolate. In the meantime, for people who have entered the country within the past 14 days who present themselves in Toronto seeking temporary shelter, the City is in the process of setting up 200 beds for self-isolation purposes.

In addition, working closely with TPH, the City has provided staff at all City-run shelters, as well as its partners, with advice on enhanced Infection, Prevention & Control and cleaning measures.

Yesterday, as part of the City of Toronto's ongoing response to COVID-19 and following the advice of the City’s Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Eileen de Villa, Mayor John Tory announced the suspension of a number of City services and closure of City facilities. The measures ensure the continued delivery of critical City services and support of vulnerable communities while protecting the health of City staff and residents.

The City’s COVID-19 response webpages, available at toronto.ca/home/covid-19, have now been updated with the temporary service impacts. Fire Chief and Manager of the Office of Emergency Management Matthew Pegg today provided greater clarity on what residents should expect from today until April 5.

Initial, continuing service impacts focused on increasing social distancing:
• Closure of all child care centres, including those in private homes
• Closure of recreation centres and cancellation of recreation programming
• Enhanced intake screening and cleaning and disinfecting at emergency shelters
• Restriction of visitors and strengthened screening at long-term care homes
• Cancellation of Council, Committee, tribunal, and public consultations

There are now additional service suspensions intended to limit non-essential work and in-person interactions to protect the health and safety of our employees:
• Access to animal shelters for emergencies only by appointment
• Suspension of non-emergency building, bylaw, and Toronto Public Health inspections and enforcement of expired business licences
• Closure of civic centres and many City offices and help counters, including those servicing Courts Services, Housing Support, and Toronto Employment & Social Services
• Closure of all civic centre wedding chambers and suspension of new bookings
• Suspension of in-person permitting and licensing
• Enhancing screening prior to any in-person meeting or service and posting of signage with details on self-assessment and public health practices

Emergency response by Toronto Police, Fire, and Paramedics is not impacted. Toronto Water and Toronto Hydro operations, waste collection with the exception of yard waste, shelters and supports for individuals experiencing homelessness, TTC, road operations including snow removal as needed, and the response to COVID-19 continue.

For those employees required to report to work in their regular locations, the City continues to maintain a safe and healthy workplace and comply with the best public health and occupational health advice available.

This is an evolving situation. A full list of service impacts is available on the City’s website at toronto.ca/home/covid-19.

This afternoon, Mayor John Tory and City of Toronto officials announced actions the municipal government is taking to help essential service workers with child care options; vulnerable residents such as seniors; people affected by untreated trauma, mental health and addictions; people in need of housing supports and emergency food access; and people with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The City is committed to doing everything it can to help residents during this extremely difficult time.

Support for vulnerable residents

To ensure that the needs of vulnerable residents are met during the COVID-19 emergency, the City is working in partnership with social service agencies to address issues that arise in the community service sector.

A City-Community Response Table meets daily and includes representatives from more than 30 agencies across Toronto and 11 City divisions. This group is working to identify new and emerging issues affecting vulnerable Torontonians during the COVID-19 emergency and to plan city-wide responses to address and resolve these issues, for example, food security and community resource needs.

The City is also partnering with community agencies like the United Way Greater Toronto to help agencies and groups communicate with each other so they can continue to do their important work of serving Torontonians as well as communicate with Councillors and other services providers. Toronto Aboriginal Social Services Council (TASSC) is also leading the coordinated Indigenous response and will collaborate with the City and United Way.

All long-term care homes continue to care for residents. For seniors not living in a long-term care home, Seniors Services and Long-Term Care continues to provide essential support services to seniors already enrolled in their Supportive Housing program with personal care, medication reminders, and safety checks. Many community agencies offer supports to seniors including Meals on Wheels, friendly visiting, transportation to appointments, personal support, and adult day programs. Seniors and caregivers should check with the individual agencies to confirm continuity of service delivery. Call 211 (available 24/7 in 150+ languages) to obtain up-to-date information.

Other resources for seniors include:
• Toronto Seniors Helpline:416-217-2077 or 1-877-621-2077, for support and referral to services
• Local Health Integration Network (LHIN) Home Care: 310-2222 (no area code required) to find out about services in their area
• Distress Centres of Toronto: 416-408-4357, 416-408-HELP
• Seniors Safety Line (Elder Abuse Ontario): 1-866-299-1011

Food Security Table to ensure access to food

Access to food is a major issue for residents that live near or below the poverty line. Community food programs, which include food banks, are a vital part of our communities, especially in times of crisis. To ensure that Toronto’s food programs can stay open during the outbreak, the City has convened a Food Security Table (including Second Harvest, Daily Bread Food Bank, North York Harvest Food Bank and Red Cross) to receive updates and find solutions for food access issues.

The City is calling on all restaurants that are still providing take-out and delivery services and businesses that sell food to consider donating any type of unsold, good food through foodrescue.ca. Residents who are able, are also encouraged to donate essentials to their local food bank.

Child care for essential and core service workers

The City of Toronto is working with the province of Ontario to find ways to help health care workers and emergency responders and other essential workers with child care. We hope to have further updates on this shortly.

Volunteers to help deliver essential services

Non-profit agencies in the community services sector are also facing a shortage of volunteers to help with delivering essential services. The City is urging non-profit organizations and agencies to do the following to help facilitate connecting residents willing to volunteer to organizations and agencies who need the help:
1. Update or add information about current operations to 211’s database
2. Register volunteer needs through Spark Ontario at sparkontario.ca and/or with Volunteer Toronto at volunteertoronto.ca. Volunteer Toronto has waived the fee associated with posting volunteer positions.

Residents interested in volunteering should register with the above-mentioned websites to get alerts for volunteer opportunities (some of which may be remote), call Volunteer Toronto at 416-961-6888 or email info@volunteertoronto.ca to connect with an advisor to discuss volunteer opportunities. Non-profit organizations and agencies’ staff are practicing infection prevention measures within their operations and volunteers would be required to do the same.

Although many places across Toronto have been closed due to social distancing measures, there are still social services supports available for residents in need. Through 211, operators can connect residents to income supports, distress lines, and mental health supports to name a few. Call 211, text 21166, or live chat with 211 agents Monday to Friday from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., or visit 211toronto.ca to search for services.

- City Councillor and Board of Health Chair Joe Cressy

“Leveraging our partnerships, not just with the community, but with businesses as well, is critical during an emergency like this. As we see this situation changing daily we must work with our partners to find solutions quickly to address emerging issues.”
- Deputy Mayor Michael Thompson, Chair, Economic and Community Development Committee

"" As the largest investor in social services next to government, United Way stands with our City partners to ensure Toronto’s network of community agencies can best support our most vulnerable in these unprecedented times.

That’s the power of community.""

This afternoon, Toronto’s Medical Office of Health, Dr. Eileen de Villa, Fire Chief and General Manager of the Office of Emergency Management, Matthew Pegg, and City Manager, Chris Murray, provided an update on the City of Toronto’s COVID-19 response.

The number of positive cases of COVID-19 confirmed by Toronto Public Health in the city continues to increase. As of 1 p.m. today there are now 193 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Toronto.

New cases are not unexpected as the City continues to respond to the current situation. As the number of cases grows, the City urges that the privacy of individuals who have tested positive for the virus be respected.

The best way for Torontonians to contribute to the public health response is to continue the proactive measures of social distancing, and if sick, self-isolation.

Importantly, for those returning from abroad following March break, self-isolation is critical to helping mitigate the continued spread of COVID-19. Anyone who has returned to Canada, including from the United States, is asked to self-isolate for 14 days.

We have received inquiries about gathering in parks and playgrounds in the city. While exercise and enjoying the outdoors is important for those who are not self-isolating, these gatherings may pose a risk to the health of families and the wider community. To that end, the City will begin erecting signage near playgrounds reminding the public of the importance of social distancing and that playgrounds are not sanitized.

Following the Province’s declaration of an emergency under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act earlier this week, complaints and requests for enforcement have come into the City, representing about 2% of calls to 311. These calls will be responded to on a priority basis. While enforcement of provincial orders is carried out by police, not bylaw enforcement, the public is asked to not call 911 and instead direct calls to 311.

Finally, City of Toronto employees at home may be called in and redeployed to ensure the City can continue to deliver critical services during this unprecedented time. The services the City provides are critical to millions of residents and business. The Toronto Public Service is a dedicated and committed workforce that continues to show up and do an outstanding job during this extremely difficult time.

A number of measures have been put in place to protect employees from COVID-19 and City Manager Chris Murray is committed to continuing to ensure staff are protected so they are able to keep the city and its infrastructure safe, while responding to this pandemic.

The City’s website is updated daily with the latest health advice and information about City services, social supports, and economic recovery measures. Check toronto.ca/covid-19 for answers to common questions before contacting the Toronto Public Health COVID-19 Hotline or 311.

Quote:

“Your City government is working around the clock to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Every resident can help this effort by practicing social distancing. This weekend in particular, we want to make sure everyone returning from March Break travel outside Canada gets the message that they must self-isolate for 14 days. All of these efforts will stop the spread of COVID-19, help flatten the curve, and save lives.”

For the many Torontonians who are returning from travel outside Canada, including the United States, following March Break, 14-day self-isolation is critical to stopping the spread of COVID-19, even if symptoms of illness are not present.

Those returning home who need to restock their house with supplies are encouraged to order online for home delivery or ask a family or friend to pick up items for them.

All other Torontonians are strongly encouraged to stay home and practise social distancing, only making essential trips out for groceries or medicine as required. Ordering these items online and having them delivered is also encouraged.

The number of positive cases of COVID-19 confirmed by Toronto Public Health in the city continues to increase. As of 1 p.m. today, March 22, there are now 220 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Toronto with 9 hospitalized.

New cases are not unexpected as the City continues to respond to the current situation. As the number of cases grows, the City continues to urge the privacy of individuals who have tested positive for the virus be respected.

Today, Mayor John Tory declared a State of Emergency in the city of Toronto after receiving advice this morning from Toronto’s Medical Officer of Health and the Office of Emergency Management.

Through his office, the Mayor has also been in communication with the members of City Council, and has spoken to both Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Premier Doug Ford.

The declaration of a municipal emergency is part of the City's ongoing efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19 and will ensure the municipal government can continue to act and respond quickly to the pandemic and any other events that arise in the weeks ahead.

We know the number of COVID-19 cases continues to increase in our city and that the next few days are absolutely critical in our ongoing efforts to slow down the spread of COVID-19. In making this declaration, Mayor Tory strongly encourages our residents to continue taking every precaution in protecting themselves – stay home, stay safe, and only venture out to buy essential supplies once a week. Even better, order online if at all possible.

While the Mayor thanks the residents and businesses who are listening to public health advice and practising social distancing, we know from our public health professionals that there are many who are continuing to put their health and the health of our community at risk.

This declaration sends the strongest possible message to our residents to stay home and to change their behaviour.

This decision was not taken lightly. It is part of an overall collaborative effort and cooperation with the Government of Canada led by Prime Minister Trudeau and the Government of Ontario led by Premier Ford – both of whom the Mayor has worked very well with throughout this crisis.

It also comes after we learned on the weekend about the first death of a Toronto resident related to COVID-19. It is a tragic reminder that we are confronting a deadly virus. That is why it is so important that we all continue to do everything we can to keep COVID-19 from continuing to spread.

The Mayor continues to ask all non-essential businesses to close – as the Medical Officer of Health has urged publicly – and as the Government of Ontario has ordered. To further contain the spread of COVID-19, the Ontario Government has ordered the mandatory closure of all non-essential workplaces effective as of Tuesday, March 24th at 11:59 p.m. Mayor Tory supports this action by the province and has been clear that he will support further recommendations and orders from the Medical Officer of Health and the provincial and federal governments if people do not comply with the need to stay home.

Later this afternoon, Dr. Eileen de Villa and Chief Matthew Pegg will outline, in greater detail, what this declaration means for essential and critical workers, and how it assists in the City’s operations as it works to protect Torontonians.

Right now across Toronto, our healthcare workers are confronting the reality of COVID-19. The Mayor is making this emergency declaration in support of our healthcare workers and all City workers focused on this crisis, to make sure we flatten the curve, and protect our healthcare system.

While the declaration does not change the Level 3 status of the City’s Emergency Operations Centre, it does provide City staff with the necessary flexibility to access resources in a more timely way so it can continue to keep the city functioning and safe.

I want them to know that we are doing everything we can at the City to fight this virus while continuing to deliver our essential and critical services. I remain confident that we will get through this pandemic by continuing to work together and all following the advice of our public health professionals.""

Today, the City of Toronto announced that all City-owned playgrounds, sports fields, basketball and tennis courts, off-leash dog parks, skateboard and BMX parks, picnic areas, outdoor exercise equipment and other parks amenities, as well as parking lots attached to its parks system, will be closed effective immediately, in the City’s continuing efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19.

While the public has been advised that fresh air and exercise is good if you are not ill, and if so, you should stay home, it has been observed that individuals are using parks and their amenities to congregate. The public has also shared its concerns about how parks amenities are supporting that congregation. The City is urging all residents, who are not performing essential or critical services, to stay home.

Beginning tomorrow, signage will be erected across Toronto’s parks amenities to advise of closures, including playgrounds. Where fencing or gates exists, they will be locked. Unfenced playground structures will be signed and taped off. Parks green spaces will remain accessible, but all amenities within City parks will be closed.

Toronto’s Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Eileen de Villa, has been clear: physical distancing of at least two metres is critical in helping stop the spread of COVID-19. Every Torontonian has a part to play in helping bring an end to this pandemic. The action today is one more important step in that effort.

Dr. de Villa is also urging condominium boards, all Toronto schools and the Toronto Community Housing Corporation to close its playgrounds and parks amenities to limit public congregation and reduce the spread of COVID-19.

City parks by the numbers:
• More than 1,500 parks
• 800+ playgrounds (mostly unfenced, signed to be taped off)
• 300+ soccer and multi-use fields (signed, many are unfenced and will be locked where possible)
• 300+ baseball diamonds (signed)
• Approx. 70 dog off-leash areas (signed, the majority are fenced and where gated, will be locked)
• 150 basketball courts (hoops to be wrapped up and taped)
• 360+ parking lots at 200 locations (roughly half of these are gated and will be locked)
• 14 skate parks (signed, unfenced)
• 5 BMX parks (signed, unfenced)
• 4 Frisbee golf locations (signed, unfenced)
• 50+ park locations with outdoor fitness equipment (signed, to be taped off)
• 600+ tennis and pickleball courts at 185 locations (signed, fenced and locked where gates exist)
• 12 outdoor allotment gardens (signed, mostly unfenced)
• 83 community gardens (signed, mostly unfenced)
• picnic sites (signed)
• park shelters (signed, to be taped off).

Parks Forestry and Recreation staff will be locking gates, taping off playgrounds and amenities, securing basketball nets, and affixing signage over the next several days, with 75 per cent of planned completion by March 27. Work will continue throughout weekend.

Municipal bylaws give the General Manager of Parks Forestry and Recreation the authority to close parks amenities. Violations of municipal bylaws related to accessing a closed, City-owned parks amenity vary depending on the offence, but can result in fines of up to $5,000. Residents with concerns can call 311.

Quote:
""As Mayor, I know how important our parks are to residents – they are the hearts of so many neighbourhoods across the city. They are some of the best parts of our city, but playgrounds and other park amenities are gathering places and the more that people gather, the more COVID-19 will spread in our community, putting lives at risk. As much as it will cause further discomfort and disruption, the steps we are taking today are based – as we have based all decisions around protecting the public – on the strong recommendation of our Medical Officer of Health.""

The City of Toronto continues to respond to COVID-19, with first responders and staff working around the clock to keep Torontonians safe and healthy. All people in the city need to be our partner in slowing the spread of the virus.

The number of positive cases of COVID-19 in Toronto confirmed by Toronto Public Health continues to increase. As of 1 p.m. today, there are 512 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Toronto, including 74 new confirmed cases since yesterday’s report. Of the cases, 24 have recovered, 36 are in hospital, and 17 are in the ICU.

Toronto Public Health, led by our Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Eileen de Villa, has repeatedly stated the importance of self-isolation for those that are ill but do not require medical attention, have travelled, or may have been exposed to the virus. Self-isolated people living with roommates should stay in a separate room as much as possible, open windows in shared rooms to help with airflow, increase cleaning, and stay two metres away from others. Staying home, maintaining physical distance when out, and good hygiene, including hand-washing, remains the most responsible behaviour for healthy individuals.

We are asking everyone to remember they have a role to play in slowing the spread of COVID-19. City staff continue to see troubling examples of people disregarding public health recommendations. Barriers to closed City park equipment and facilities have been removed. People of all ages are regularly seen in groups with much less than two metres between them in City green spaces and public places. These behaviours are easy to correct in support of our community’s response to COVID-19.

The City of Toronto continues to respond to the COVID-19 emergency. As of today, the City’s Emergency Operations Centre has been mobilized for 19 days, working with Toronto Public Health to slow the spread of the virus and keep our community safe and healthy.

Toronto Public Health has had 540 cases of COVID-19 reported in Toronto, up from 512 cases yesterday. Currently, 39 of these people are hospitalized and there are 18 in ICU. Among cases of COVID-19 in Toronto, there have been four deaths to-date. There have been 24 other people diagnosed with COVID-19 who have recovered from their illness. This data was extracted from the Integrated Public Health Information System at 1 p.m. The numbers may differ from other sources as data are extracted at different times.

Earlier this week, Mayor John Tory, Medical Office of Health, Dr. Eileen de Villa, and Fire Chief and General Manager of the Office of Emergency Management, Matthew Pegg, stressed the importance of mental health and addressed the anxiety many people are experiencing in response to the public health and social impacts of COVID-19. These are normal and healthy responses and feelings to an abnormal situation. It’s OK not to feel OK.

Whether in self-isolation or practising physical distancing, it is important to connect with friends and family over the phone or online and try to eat well and stay rested. Everyone is encouraged to check in by phone or other means that maintain physical distancing on family, friends, and colleagues who may be struggling.

Individuals looking for additional crisis supports should reach out to Crisis Services Canada or Toronto Public Health. Crisis Services Canada is available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week at crisisservicescanada.ca, by phone at 1-833-456-4566 or by text message at 45645. In an emergency, always call 911.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in response to the recent provincial emergency order to prohibit organized public events and social gatherings of more than five people, the City of Toronto will cancel all City-led major mass participation events, festivals, conferences and cultural programs, and all City permits for major mass participation events organized by external groups at civic centres and squares, parks, public spaces (including road closures), City-operated museums and cultural centres through June 30.

The decision to cancel City-led events and third-party permits has been made in consultation with Toronto's Medical Officer of Health, the Emergency Operations Centre, Toronto Police Service, Mayor John Tory's office and major event organizers, and supports the directive that physical distancing is critical to stopping the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The breadth of the COVID-19 crisis and the City's need to ensure the sustainability of essential services also limits the City's ability to provide the usual level of support to third-party event organizers to ensure public safety.

The City’s decision provides clear direction to event organizers to enable them to make sound decisions in support of public health efforts and their business needs, access insurance, support impacted employees and manage sponsors.

The City urges event organizers to follow Toronto’s Medical Officer of Health’s recommendations of physical distancing as a way to minimize COVID-19 transmission in the community when reviewing their event plans for the upcoming months and make prudent decisions about cancellations. Physical distancing means limiting the number of people a person comes into close contact with, including keeping two metres (six feet) apart from others, avoiding mass gatherings and avoiding crowds.

The end date for the cancellation period will be reviewed every two weeks following the initial announcement and may be extended beyond June 30 in consultation with Toronto’s Medical Officer of Health and in consideration of the provincial prohibition of organized public events and social gatherings.

The City of Toronto will not be in a position to issue new permits until there is further direction on mass gatherings from Toronto’s Medical Officer of Health. The City is committed to working with event organizers to mitigate the impacts of these cancellations and to determine potential future dates once the public health crisis is contained and economic recovery efforts are underway. Among the major events impacted by today's announcement are Doors Open Toronto, Indigenous Arts Festival, Pride Toronto, and NXNE Music and Gaming festival.

Event organizers are encouraged to contact the relevant permitting bodies at the City or Toronto Police Service officers/liaisons they have been working with. Alternatively, event organizers can contact the City at eventpal@toronto.ca.

Mayor Tory also announced today that City of Toronto facilities will continue to be closed until further notice, including non-emergency city child care facilities in schools. All regular Council and Committee meetings are cancelled until May 4. City-operated programs also remain suspended. Frontline emergency and critical services continue to be delivered.

This is based on recommendations from Toronto Public Health to help slow the rate of COVID-19 infection in Toronto.

More information about the City's response to COVID-19 is available at toronto.ca/home/covid-19.

Quote

""While the City recognizes the importance of special events and festivals to the livability and vitality of the city, protecting the health and safety of residents is of primary concern. City staff are working closely with event organizers to help mitigate the impacts of cancellations wherever possible and we look forward to Toronto's festivals and events being featured prominently as part of the city's recovery from the impact of COVID-19.""

Today, Mayor John Tory announced that the City of Toronto, under the strong advice of its Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Eileen de Villa, is taking action to aggressively halt the spread of COVID-19 in Toronto.

Just two weeks ago, on March 18, Toronto had 145 COVID-19 cases, with 10 people in hospital. Four were in intensive care, there were no outbreaks and there were no COVID-19-related deaths.

As of March 31, Toronto has 763 cases of COVID-19, with 66 in hospital and 33 in intensive care. There are now 11 outbreaks reported and, tragically, eight deaths.

In the last two weeks alone, the economic loss to the retail sector is estimated to be $291 million.

To arrest COVID-19 more quickly, and to save lives, protect the healthcare system and ensure the economy and society can rebound more quickly, the following measures will take effect immediately for up to 12 weeks:

- All individuals with COVID-19 are ordered by the Medical Officer of Health to stay home, under the Health Protection and Promotion Act for 14 days
- All individuals who have had close contact with someone who has COVID-19 are also ordered to stay home by the Medical Officer of Health for 14 days
- Anyone who is not ill or has not travelled, is strongly directed to stay home except for the following reasons:
o accessing healthcare or medication
o shop for groceries once per week
o walk their dogs
o get daily exercise while maintaining physical distancing of at least two metres
- People returning from international travel must stay home, already a federal order
- Anyone over the age of 70, as the province announced this week, is strongly encouraged to stay home as much as possible
- Increased supports for self-isolation for those experiencing homelessness
- Only essential businesses remain open, and those businesses maximize physical distancing and infection prevention and control practices, and limit in-person access to those businesses, as much as possible
- Increased cleaning and active screening of employees at all businesses.

The City, under the guidance of the Medical Officer of Health, will monitor cases and community transmission of COVID-19, adjusting the timing and measures as appropriate. If we do not take these actions today, the city will see substantially increased loss of life, and may not begin to recover, economically and as a society, until the end of 2020.

Mayor Tory strongly supports these unprecedented measures to save lives, protect health and give residents their lives back at the earliest possible date. The Mayor urged all residents to follow the guidance of public health officials to reduce substantial loss of life in Toronto, to protect the healthcare system, and to minimize the significant social and economic disruptions that will occur if new measures are not taken, noting these new measures will require tremendous sacrifice by the people of Toronto.

The City is asking residents to adhere to these orders and strong recommendations in the interest of public health and safety. While informing and educating the public in understanding why these measures are important, additional orders could be issued by the Medical Officer of Health, and in some cases, fines could be issued where there is non-compliance. City bylaw enforcement officers and the Toronto Police Service will work together to enforce the provincial Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act and the orders issued by the Medical Officer of Health under the Health Protection and Promotion Act.

The City of Toronto is compiling a comprehensive list of resources and critical information to ensure businesses, the city’s most vulnerable, community groups and the public are kept informed during this unprecedented time. The City’s website is being updated and revamped with new information, daily. A public information campaign, in multiple languages, will help ensure a full understanding of what the public is being asked to do and, importantly, why.

The City’s Emergency Operations Centre remains fully activated at a Level 3 and will continue to respond and coordinate all activities associated with keeping Toronto safe. City staff are working in parallel on a recovery plan to ensure the City’s finances remain stable, as well as ensuring the stability of the Toronto Public Service. Later this week, the City will provide an update on its finances and workforce deployment.

By following the direction of public health officials and limiting COVID-19 exposure to essential and critical workers that keep the city functioning, we can ensure that emergency services, garbage collection, water, gas, electricity, public transportation, emergency daycare, and support for our most vulnerable can continue to function.

""Our Medical Officer of Health Dr. Eileen de Villa has been clear that the healthcare system depends on these actions – failure to do more will result in its inability to manage. That would cost lives. The sacrifices we are asking people to make now will save lives and allow for a quicker recovery. Our public health professionals believe the additional actions being announced today – locking the city down as much as the municipal government possibly can – will save lives, flatten that curve down, and bring this wave of the pandemic to an end earlier than would otherwise have been the case.""

The City of Toronto continues to respond to the COVID-19 emergency. As of today, the City’s Emergency Operations Centre has been mobilized for 25 days, working with Toronto Public Health, City divisions, and emergency responders to slow the spread of the virus and keep our community safe and healthy.

The City of Toronto continues to respond to the COVID-19 emergency. Municipal Licensing & Standards (MLS) enforcement officers and police have been at City parks across Toronto this weekend to educate the public and enforce physical distancing and park amenity closures. The enforcement blitz is targeting busy parks, particularly the top 10 problem areas observed by City staff and reported to 311.

Early reports from frontline enforcement staff are encouraging. Many people in city parks are practising physical distancing and only travelling in small groups from the same household. In many instances, where enforcement officers have spoken to park goers, people have responded positively to education about public health recommendations and willingly adjusted their behaviour.

The City thanks the vast majority of people who are doing the right thing by staying home as much as possible and keeping their distance from others in public.

Some problem locations persist. Yesterday, 311 received 141 complaints about gatherings and unsafe behaviour at parks. In just the first day of the enforcement blitz, 800 vehicles were turned away at Bluffers Park and 140 vehicles were deterred from parking at High Park. Police also issued 19 parking tickets.

Enforcement staff reported today that, over the course of yesterday, MLS and police officers spoke with 780 people to educate them on public health recommendations and closures and cautioned a further 373 people. Police issued nine tickets while MLS officers gave out one ticket related to park amenities and five to non-essential businesses that were operating in violation of provincial orders. Toronto Public Health received 28 complaints related to non-essential businesses remaining open and issued two notices.

Toronto Public Health is reporting there are now 1,232 cases of COVID-19 in Toronto, an increase of 113 cases from yesterday. Of the cases, 1,026 cases are confirmed and 206 are probable, 69 cases have recovered, 140 are in hospital with 58 in ICU. In Toronto, there have been 25 deaths to-date. Community spread is responsible for 25% of COVID-19 cases in the city.

Mayor John Tory, Medical Officer of Health Dr. Eileen de Villa, and Fire Chief and Manager of the Office of Emergency Management Matthew Pegg, today, provided an update on the City’s continuing response to COVID-19.

Toronto Public Health is reporting there are now 1,449 cases of COVID-19 in Toronto, an increase of 148 cases from yesterday. Of the cases, 1,218 cases are confirmed and 231 are probable, 82 cases have recovered, 142 are in hospital with 63 in ICU. In Toronto, there have been 42 deaths to-date. This data was extracted from the Integrated Public Health Information System at 12:30 p.m. The numbers may differ from other sources as data are extracted at different times.

Municipal Licensing & Standards (MLS) continues to work with Toronto Police Service, Toronto Public Health, and Parks, Forestry & Recreation to enforce the various orders and closures necessitated by the continuing spread of COVID-19. Yesterday, the City received 55 complaints related to non-essential businesses remaining open in contravention of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act. Since March 24, MLS has issued notices to 34 non-essential businesses.

The City also received 385 complaints yesterday alone about people using closed park amenities or not practising physical distancing in parks. MLS spoke to 848 people regarding the closure of park amenities and distancing and issued 12 tickets – the highest number of tickets issued by MLS in a single day since the start of the pandemic. Enforcement continues to focus on locations with the most activity. Yesterday, officers intervened to respond to a large gathering in the off-leash are of Windfields Park, a ball hockey game in the Sorauren Park Town Square, soccer and basketball games at Regent Park Athletic Grounds, and a 40-person gathering at the Stan Wadlow Park skateboard park.

These continuing reports of large gatherings are concerning, especially as we approach faith-based holidays normally centred around community celebrations. The City of Toronto, under the advice of Dr. de Villa, urges everyone to follow provincial orders limiting gatherings and public health recommendations to remain at home, leaving only for essential reasons.

Another emerging concern is the accumulation of donated goods, as well as garbage, surrounding full clothing drop boxes. These boxes play an important role in the city – they help reduce waste and raise money for worthwhile charities. Right now, in response to COVID-19, many charities are not accepting donations or emptying boxes. Mayor Tory announced today that, to address concerns of overflowing boxes and litter surrounding boxes, City Solid Waste Management Services workers will be collecting items left around bins and clearing the areas.

Mayor John Tory, Medical Officer of Health Dr. Eileen de Villa, and Fire Chief and Manager of the Office of Emergency Management Matthew Pegg, today, provided an update on the City’s continuing response to COVID-19.

Toronto Public Health is reporting there are now 1,570 cases of COVID-19 in Toronto. Of the cases, 1,332 cases are confirmed and 238 are probable, 156 are in hospital with 71 in ICU. In Toronto, there have been 49 deaths to-date. This data was extracted from the Integrated Public Health Information System at 12:30 p.m. The numbers may differ from other sources as data are extracted at different times.

The City’s COVID-19 enforcement team, comprised of City of Toronto, Toronto Public Health and Toronto Police Services, continues to conduct a number of coordinated enforcement activities.

While many are complying with the Orders and Bylaws yesterday, the City received 34 complaints related to non-essential businesses remaining open in contravention of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act. Since March 24, MLS has issued notices to 39 non-essential businesses.

Also yesterday, the City received 482 complaints about people using park amenities or not practising physical distancing in parks. Bylaw officers spoke to 629 people regarding the closure of park amenities and distancing and issued 37 written cautions and 33 tickets – bringing the total to 53 tickets since April 4.

Enforcement activity continues to focus on locations with the most activity. Yesterday, officers intervened to respond to a large group congregating at Smythe Park; people continuing to trespass and play golf at Don Valley Golf Course and people using cricket, baseball and off-leash dog amenities at Cedarvale Park. Enforcement efforts will continue through the weekend.

This evening at sundown, the Jewish community will begin the eight-day celebration of Passover, and with Easter, and the start of Ramadan also here soon, many will want to spend time with family and faith-based communities. However, the City urges everyone to remain at home, leaving only for essential reasons. The holidays are important spiritually and emotionally for many and to support this, people are encouraged to connect with loved ones, friends, and vulnerable members of the community online or by phone. Residents should also check with their place of worship for information on online services and other innovative ways to connect while staying physically apart.

The City of Toronto’s COVID-19 Enforcement Team – a partnership between Toronto Police Service and the City – continues to carry out an enforcement blitz in parks across the city, enforcing closures and physical distancing to protect the health and safety of our community.

Toronto Public Health is reporting there are now 2,225 cases of COVID-19 in Toronto. Of the cases, 1956 cases are confirmed, an increased of 161 confirmed cases from yesterday, and 269 are probable, 208 are in hospital with 85 in ICU. The numbers may differ from other sources as data are extracted at different times. The most up-to-date COVID-19 case status data can be found on the City’s new reporting platform at toronto.ca/home/covid-19/media-room/covid-19-status-of-cases-in-toronto.

The advice from Toronto’s public health officials has been clear and consistent: to stop the community spread of this deadly virus, we must reduce all contact with others as much as possible.

The City’s Enforcement Team is now focused on stricter enforcement in 20 high-use parks. Initially, the team provided public education to individuals not observing orders and public health recommendations. Yesterday, the team moved to almost exclusively issuing tickets. Municipal Licensing & Standards (MLS) officers issued 48 tickets for the use of closed park amenities and not practising physical distancing – 32 per cent of the total number of tickets issued since enforcement began nine days ago on April 3.

Any two people who don’t live together, who fail to keep two metres of distance between them in a park or public square, can receive a $1,000 ticket – the maximum set fine available. In addition, failing to identify oneself (correct name, date of birth and address) to an officer investigating a matter under the Emergency Measures and Civil Protection Act carries a set fine of $750.

Officers participating in this weekend’s blitz have reported lighter use of some busy parks. Yesterday, MLS officers spoke with 286 people regarding use of amenities and social distancing, an 83 per cent decrease from Friday. Complaints to 311 about behaviour in parks decreased by almost 39 per cent yesterday from the previous day. Officers did report continuing issues with individuals and groups with off-leash dogs in Trinity Bellwoods Park and people lingering in Muskoka chairs and starting bonfires in waterfront parks.

To help stop the spread of COVID-19, the City of Toronto’s COVID-19 Enforcement Team – a partnership between Toronto Police Service and the City – continues to carry out stricter enforcement in parks across the city. Toronto Public Health is also educating essential businesses on physical distancing, cleaning and disinfection on their premises.

Toronto Public Health is reporting there are now 2,362 cases of COVID-19 in Toronto. Of the cases, 2088 cases are confirmed and 274 are probable, 210 are in hospital with 80 in ICU. In Toronto, there have been 92 deaths to-date.

The most up-to-date COVID-19 case status data can be found on the City’s new reporting platform at toronto.ca/home/covid-19/media-room/covid-19-status-of-cases-in-toronto.

The City’s Enforcement Team is focused on stricter enforcement in City parks and squares. This weekend, the team moved from issuing warnings to almost exclusively issuing tickets in order to convey the seriousness of the City’s measures and increase compliance.

Yesterday, Municipal Licensing & Standards (MLS) officers issued 40 tickets for the use of closed park amenities and not practising physical distancing. This brings the total to 107 tickets issued over the long weekend, which accounts for 56 per cent of the total tickets issued since April 4. Any two people who don’t live together, who fail to keep two metres of distance between them in a park or public square, can receive a $1,000 ticket – the maximum set fine available.

While officers reported lighter use of some busy parks this weekend, tickets were issued for using park amenities such as lingering on Muskoka chairs and benches. Individuals who need to physically rest while out on walk are permitted to use benches to recover, however lingering and use of benches beyond necessary resting purposes is prohibited.

In an effort to stop the community spread of this deadly virus, Toronto Public Health is visiting essential businesses to provide these open businesses with advice, recommendations, and instructions on physical distancing, cleaning, and disinfection.

Mayor John Tory, Medical Officer of Health Dr. Eileen de Villa, and Fire Chief and General Manager of the Office of Emergency Management Matthew Pegg provided an update on the City’s continuing response to COVID-19 today.

Toronto Public Health is reporting there are now 2,670 cases of COVID-19 in Toronto. Of the cases, 2,369 cases are confirmed and 301 are probable, 243 are in hospital with 94 in ICU. In Toronto, there have been 121 deaths to-date. This data was extracted from the Integrated Public Health Information System. The numbers may differ from other sources as data are extracted at different times.

The City continues to focus on stricter enforcement, monitoring popular parks across the city and issuing tickets to individuals and groups using closed park amenities and not practising physical distancing. The COVID-19 Enforcement Team continues to observe prohibited activities, including permit holders ignoring “closed” signage at allotment gardens, dogs off leash at High Park and gatherings at Barbara Hall Park.

Any two or more people who are not members of the same household, and who fail to keep at least two metres of distance between them in a park or public square, can receive a $1,000 ticket – which is the applicable set fine for the City’s Physical Distancing Bylaw. In addition, failing to identify oneself to an officer investigating a matter under the Emergency Measures and Civil Protection Act carries a set fine of $750.

Yesterday, the City received 396 complaints involving people using amenities or not practising physical distancing in parks. Bylaw and police officers cautioned 470 individuals regarding the closure of park amenities and physical distancing, and issued 35 tickets – bringing the total to 252 tickets since April 3. The City received 49 complaints yesterday related to non-essential businesses remaining open in contravention of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act. Since March 24, Municipal Licensing and Standards has issued 12 tickets, 12 summons and 70 notices to non-essential businesses.

The response to the current COVID-19 pandemic has been dynamic and based on the best advice from public health experts. New legislation and bylaws have been put in place, which have not existed in the past. This advice has been clear and consistent: To stop the community spread of this deadly virus, we must reduce all contact with others as much as possible by staying home, except for essential outings.

The City’s website is updated daily with the latest health advice and information about City services and social supports. Check toronto.ca/covid-19 for answers to common questions before contacting the Toronto Public Health COVID-19 Hotline or 311.

The City of Toronto continues to respond to COVID-19. The coordinated COVID-19 Enforcement Team, made up of staff from Municipal Licensing & Standards, Parks, Forestry & Recreation, Toronto Public Health, Toronto Building, and Toronto Police Service, will be out all weekend ensuring people across the city are following public health direction and provincial orders.

Education and enforcement are essential to keeping our community safe. Yesterday, the City received 440 complaints involving people using outdoor amenities or not practising physical distancing in parks. Bylaw and police officers issued 19 tickets – bringing the total number of tickets issued since April 3 to 338. The City received 30 complaints yesterday related to non-essential businesses remaining open in contravention of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act. Since March 24, Municipal Licensing & Standards and Toronto Public Health have issued 41 tickets and 117 notices to non-essential businesses.

The enforcement team continues to see troubling behaviour as weather improves and people become frustrated with restrictions. People continue to build fire pits at Bluffers Park and gatherings were observed at the boat launch in King’s Mill Park. People are still removing signage and barriers at many locations. Long lines without proper social distancing continue to form outside businesses. Most disturbing, yesterday while performing his duties, an enforcement officer was assaulted in a park. An arrest has been made.

As of this afternoon, there are 3,346 cases of COVID-19 in Toronto. Cases include 3,013 confirmed cases and 333 probable cases. There are 274 cases hospitalized, with 98 in intensive care units. In the city, 162 people have died of COVID-19. Case status data can be found on the City’s reporting platform at toronto.ca/home/covid-19/covid-19-latest-city-of-toronto-news/covid-19-status-of-cases-in-toronto.

Based on the recommendations of the Medical Officer of Health to stop the spread of COVID-19 and save lives, the City of Toronto is working to make the High Park cherry blossoms available online during the upcoming park closure.

Every year tens of thousands of people visit High Park to view the blossoming Sakura (cherry blossom) trees. The blossoms typically last between four and 10 days, depending on weather. The peak bloom time period traditionally occurs from late April to early May.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, High Park will be closed during the pre-bloom and peak bloom period of the cherry blossom trees, as maintaining proper physical distancing will not be possible. The park closure dates are weather-dependent and will be announced when the bloom period is determined.

To encourage residents to stay home and stay safe, the City is working on a virtual walk-through of the blossoming trees in High Park. Residents will be able to experience this year's cherry blossom season through multiple livestream events and videos. More details will be announced soon.

High Park is already closed to vehicle traffic. Roads through the park were closed off when the City moved to close park amenities based on public health's advice.

This closure follows similar cherry blossom crowd control responses that have already occurred in Japan, Korea, Europe and Washington, D.C.

Park enforcement City bylaw officers and the Toronto Police Service will ensure residents are complying with the closure. Municipal bylaws give the General Manager of Parks, Forestry & Recreation the authority to close a park in the interest of public safety. Violations related to accessing a closed City park can result in a set fine of $750 if a ticket is paid voluntarily, but the maximum fine can be $5,000.

While we understand many residents use High Park every day, a partial closure of the park isn't possible given the number of cherry blossom trees throughout the park and the size and layout of the park itself. Health and parks staff believe this is the best plan to discourage gathering and protect public health.

The cherry blossoms area at Trinity Bellwoods Park will be enclosed by fencing with enforcement patrols during the bloom period. City enforcement officials and Toronto Police Services may patrol other smaller sites of cherry blossoms in Toronto.

During the closure, Parks staff will undertake extensive work on the park that includes:
• Removal of litter, debris, branches and other material that accumulates over the winter;
• Grass cutting, turf maintenance, tree cutting and horticultural bed maintenance, and
• Animal care, repairs to benches and maintenance activities, such as painting.

The City’s website is updated daily with the latest health advice and information about City services and social supports. Check toronto.ca/covid-19 for answers to common questions before contacting the Toronto Public Health COVID-19 Hotline or 311.

Quotes:

""I know this closure will be tough for local residents who enjoy High Park year-round and those who look forward to seeing the cherry blossoms every year. This virtual event and the proactive closure is meant to ensure the traditional overcrowding that happens at High Park during the annual cherry blossom bloom does not occur this year to further stop the spread of COVID-19. We are following the advice of our professional public health officials to protect the health and safety of all residents and park visitors. Thank you in advance to the vast majority of residents who will respect this closure and understand this is needed to save lives. I look forward to joining residents in High Park
in future years – after we have won the war against COVID-19 – to enjoy the cherry blossoms again.""
- Mayor John Tory

“This will be disappointing both for people who love the Cherry Blossoms, and people who regularly use the park. But, our first duty is to keep each other safe.""
- Councillor Gord Perks, Parkdale-High Park (Ward 4)

Mayor John Tory, Medical Officer of Health Dr. Eileen de Villa, and Fire Chief and General Manager of the Office of Emergency Management Matthew Pegg, today, provided an update on the City’s continuing response to COVID-19.

As Toronto moves into week seven of this pandemic, officials are seeing promising signs that public health measures are working. Dr. de Villa stressed the need to continue to practise social distancing and only leave the house for essential reasons, noting restrictions will be eased sooner if people continue to heed public health advice. Dr. de Villa shared five practices that can promote mental health and resilience for the duration of our local pandemic outbreak:
1. Connect with others
2. Be active
3. Keep learning
4. Be mindful
5. Give back

More advice and information on mental health supports is available at toronto.ca/home/covid-19/covid-19-protect-yourself-others/covid-19-mental-health-resources.

As of this afternoon, there are 4,973 cases of COVID-19 in Toronto. Cases include 4,493 confirmed cases and 480 probable cases. There are 308 cases hospitalized, with 104 in intensive care units.

The service performance target for 311 is to answer incoming calls within 75 seconds or less, no less than 80% of the time. The average length of time required for 311 to answer incoming calls was 76 seconds on Saturday and only 53 seconds on Sunday. Most incoming calls were wildlife concerns, solid waste collection questions, and questions about City services during COVID-19.

“As we move into week seven of this pandemic, I know people want this pandemic to be over as soon as possible. But I also know you want this to be over safely. I want us to protect the health of each and every resident and save as many lives as we can. That's why we took decisive action last month and why, unfortunately, these restrictions will have to last longer than anyone would like. We have made progress and your actions have saved lives. Residents have responded magnificently staying home and distancing themselves in a way that has saved lives. Please stay the course. It is working.”

I look forward to celebrating with Toronto residents virtually on July 1, but even more, I look forward to the day when we can safely resume our celebrations in-person.”

",,,Government Website,"Windsor Regional Hospital, in discussion with the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit (WECHU), has been approved by Ontario Health, West Region to open a COVID-19 Assessment Centre at its Ouellette campus starting Monday, March 16, 2020. The hours of operation will be between 9 AM and 4 PM, seven days a week, and expanded based on demand.

The COVID-19 Assessment Centre is located at the former outpatient clinic entrance (off Goyeau St.). It is a segregated area next to the Ouellette campus emergency department. There will be no access into the main hospital from this area or access into the COVID-19 Assessment Centre from the main hospital. All access will be from the entrance off of Goyeau Street. 



The goal of the COVID-19 Assessment Centre is to build community capacity to respond to individuals experiencing symptoms which could be caused by COVID-19 in Windsor and Essex County. The Centre will support that emergency department services can be directed to those who are most vulnerable and require acute care hospital services.



“These measures are being implemented as a part of our collective best effort to limit the potential transmission of the COVID-19 virus from person to person,” said David Musyj, President and CEO, Windsor Regional Hospital. “They are taking effect to protect you, and your loved ones, whether they are our patients, our visitors, or our staff.""

The Ontario Ministry of Health has revised the COVID-19 case definition to clarify who should be tested. The Ministry is asking all providers not to test asymptomatic individuals.

“As we have communicated previously, if you are ill with a respiratory infection, DO NOT come to hospital where you may risk transmitting this virus to another individual,” Musyj said. “If you are unsure whether you have contracted the COVID-19 virus, contact by phone your primary care provider, the WECHU 519-258-2146 ext. 1420, or call Telehealth at 1-866-797-0000 (24 hours, seven days a week).”

Attending the COVID-19 Assessment Centre does NOT mean you will be automatically tested for COVID-19. The clinical team will conduct a health assessment, provide an examination, and determine if you meet the clinical case definition for testing.

You should still call your primary care provider, the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit (WECHU) at 519-258-2146 ext. 1420, or Telehealth at 1-866-797-0000 if you have any questions regarding COVID-19 and whether you should attend the COVID-19 Assessment Centre.

Only individuals who meet certain criteria will be tested for COVID-19. The test is similar to that of other respiratory illnesses and involves taking a sample from the back of the nasal cavity with a swab. The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit will follow up with all individuals who have been tested for COVID-19.

The WECHU will continue to update the public regarding any changes to the status of COVID-19 in our community.

PLEASE NOTE: People who do not have symptoms should not visit the COVID-19 Assessment Centre. If you have travelled from anywhere outside of Canada, please monitor your health for symptoms of COVID-19 for 14 days after you arrive back in Canada. If you develop symptoms, please self-isolate and contact the WECHU at 519-258-2146 ext. 1420.",Windsor-Essex County Health Unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Protecting the health and wellbeing of the residents of Windsor and Essex County remains our top priority.

 

To date, we have 0 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Windsor-Essex.
Overall, 56 individuals have been tested for COVID-19; and 14 tests are pending.
There are 218 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada and 101 of cases in Ontario.
COVID-19 is a respiratory infection spread by droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes in close proximity to another person. It can also be spread through direct contact when a person touches a contaminated surface and then transfers it to their nose, mouth or eyes when touching their face.

If you have symptoms of a fever (over 38 degrees Celsius), and/or a cough AND within the past 14 days have travelled outside of Canada OR have had close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 OR have had close contact with a person who has symptoms and travelled to an impacted area call the WECHU at 519-258-2146 ext. 1420 or visit the new COVID-19 Assessment Centre located at Windsor Regional Hospital’s Ouellette Campus at 1030 Ouellette Avenue (Goyeau Street entrance) opening Monday.

An initial COVID-19 Self Assessment Tool has been posted to the Ontario Government site. Individuals who suspect they have COVID-19 can consult this tool to determine whether and how to seek further care.

What is happening locally?
The WECHU has implemented our Incident Management System (IMS), including redeployment of staff from regular program areas to support the response to COVID-19.  Currently public health staff are responding to hundreds of calls, emails and social media messages daily to assist individuals who feel they may have been exposed to COVID-19.  

The WECHU staff are screening individuals over the phone for symptoms of COVID-19 and reviewing travel and contact history. Based on this screening public health determines if individuals should be tested for COVID-19. Please note that testing is available only for individuals who are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19.

What is happening locally?
Compliance with Closures

Yesterday the provincial government declared a state of emergency in the province of Ontario and issued orders under the Emergency Act for the closures of a number of establishment most notably bars, restaurants and nightclubs, excluding takeout and delivery services. The Windsor-Essex County Health unit officers were out yesterday to investigate the level of compliance with the order, focusing first on high-risk establishments for St. Patrick’s Day such as bars and nightclubs. As a result, several area businesses were issued a section 22 order under the Health Promotion and Protection Act (HPPA).

Workplaces

The health unit staff have responded to hundreds of emails and phone calls with questions from employees and employers regarding the recommendations for social distancing and travel related self-isolation.

The current recommendation from all levels of government including our local Medical Officer of Health is to avoid all non-essential travel outside of Canada. Essential travel would be that related to employment where work from home is not an option. All workplaces must put in appropriate screening practices and protocols for workers returning from travel outside of Canada to exclude them from work for 14 days upon their return. Employees must do their part to identify their travel and stay home. Employees concerned that fellow workers are returning to work and not following current guidance should consult with the organizations human resource department or internal occupational health and safety committee.

 ",Windsor-Essex County Health Unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,0.0,,"Media Statement Regarding Essential Workers and Self-Isolation
",,,Government Website,"The following quote can be attributed to Dr. Wajid Ahmed, Medical Officer of Health for the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit (WECHU):

“The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted almost every country including Canada. Strong measures must be put in place to slow the spread of COVID-19 and flatten the curve. Every level of government is recommending all travelers outside of Canada self-isolate for 14-days upon return. Dr. Williams, Chief Medical Officer of Health for Ontario, has recommended essential workers contact their employers to assess their ability to return to work.

Essential workers are those that are considered critical to preserving life, health, and basic societal functioning. Essential workers include (but are not limited to):

first responders to life threatening events;
health care workers who are essential to delivering patient care and life-saving services;
critical infrastructure workers such as drinking water, hydro, internet, and natural gas;
others as determined by the workplaces as essential to maintain the critical societal functions during pandemic.
I’ve expanded Dr. Williams recommendations locally for essential service workers and ask that:

Essential workers who have travelled outside of Canada must self-isolate for 14-days upon return. This is for ‘non-essential travel’ such as cruises or vacations and is not meant for the daily commuters who are crossing the border for work.
As a border community, we have additional risks to consider. Essential workers returning to Canada also have the potential to spread COVID-19 in the community. We must reduce the likelihood of these workers spreading the disease through public health measures such as self-isolation for 14 days and monitoring for symptoms.”",Windsor-Essex County Health Unit,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Protecting the health and wellbeing of the residents of Windsor and Essex County remains our top priority.

To date, we have 2 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Windsor-Essex.
Overall, 383 individuals have been tested for COVID-19; and 264 tests are pending.
There are 1,471 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada and 425 cases in Ontario, with three deaths
***These numbers are as of March 23, 8:30 am

Individuals who suspect they have COVID-19 can consult the COVID-19 Self Assessment Tool on the Ontario Government site.

What is happening locally?
Both the City of Windsor and the County of Essex declared a state emergency this weekend, giving them the ability to make the necessary decisions needed to protect our region. Dr. Wajid Ahmed strengthened these measures by recommending all non-essential retail and personal service settings close immediately with orders to be issued for noncompliance.

March 20 and 21st, the WECHU announced the first and second confirmed case of COVID-19 for our community, the 1st a cruise traveller in his sixties, the 2nd a Michigan healthcare worker in his twenties. The community level risk for COVID-19 is still considered low. Each protective measure recommended or required is intended to mitigate and reduce the risk of spread of the virus. Individuals should take the risk associated with COVID-19 very seriously. We know that recent travel, especially high-risk travel such as cruise travel, increases the risk of acquiring COVID-19. Self-isolation of all returning travelers is essential to the protection of the community. Individuals who are recommended to self-isolate should not go to work, stay home. This includes essential workers.

March 20th, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services issued a memo reporting, “sustained widespread community transmission of COVID-19” in many areas of the state. Michigan reports that due to this, all healthcare workers are “at risk for unrecognized exposures to COVID-19” and as such are required to self-monitor daily for illness. Michigan further states that healthcare workers previously isolated (due to travel) can return to work if asymptomatic and further lifts the requirement for 14-day quarantine for healthcare workers.

This announcement poses unique challenges for Windsor-Essex, given that many of our residents work in healthcare facilities in Michigan. As well, the recommendations for healthcare workers across the border conflict with those in Windsor-Essex. Dr. Wajid Ahmed, Medical Officer of Health has recommended any essential worker returning from travel to self-isolate for 14-days upon return and only after assessment under the Medical Officer of Health can return to work earlier.

If you are a healthcare worker and work in Michigan and was advised to self-isolate from your hospital, please notify the WECHU immediately for further guidance.

If you are travelling to Michigan to pick up your family from the airport after March break, please ensure that you are following social distancing at all times including with your family. Your family must self-isolate for 14 days and you must monitor your symptoms for the next 14 days.

“It is very important for everyone who is returning after March break to complete their self-isolation for 14 days. Please do not go for groceries, do not go outside and do not go to work. Have a friend or family deliver your groceries to you, at your doorstep. Your community safety is dependent on your self-isolation,” says Dr. Ahmed, Medical Officer of Health.

What is happening locally?
We continue to receive a high volume of questions about social distancing. COVID-19 spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets when an infected person sneezes or coughs in close proximity to another person. Maintaining a physical distance of 2 metres (6 feet) is important to protect yourself and others from COVID-19 and is essential to what is called “flattening the curve”. With confirmed community transmission (not travel related) residents should assume that any potential contact might be infected with COVID-19. We know that most individuals who become infected will have mild symptoms and many may not show symptoms but can still infect others. It is recommended that residents avoid any non-essential trips and limit trips as much as possible, such as those to the grocery store. When venturing outdoors for a walk or a bike ride or going to the store, maintain at minimum 2 metres from anyone. Wash your hands, cover your cough or sneeze and most important to your mental wellbeing stay connected with friends and family virtually or by phone.

“We have a real chance to slow the spread of COVID-19 in our community. Adhering to restrictions for social gatherings of more than 5 people and diligently practicing physical distancing will make the difference and slow this disease. This is serious and we all need to play our part, remember you are not only risking your life but the life of others in your community. Do your part, stay home if you are sick, maintain 2 metres distance and stay informed,” says Dr. Wajid Ahmed, Medical Officer of Health.

The number of confirmed cases of COVDI-19 in Windsor-Essex increased from 25 on Sunday to 44 on Monday.  Figure 1 below provides an overview of current confirmed cases by age for Windsor-Essex.

Testing for COVID-19 should be based on clinical assessment. Testing guidelines have been updated with an emphasis on symptomatic residents of long term care and retirement homes. New guidance from the Ministry of Health, released yesterday, now requires testing of asymptomatic new admissions or readmissions to these facilities within the first 14 days of admission.

Residents being transferred from a hospital should be tested prior to the transfer.
All residents will be required to remain in self-isolation for 14 days following the admission.
During an outbreak the testing increases to include asymptomatic contacts of the confirmed case.
The WECHU through our health inspectors and Environmental Health team works with homes to determine testing and support ongoing infection prevention and control and outbreak management. For questions or more information about Long-Term Care Homes check out our website or call 519-258-2146 ext. 4475.

Cases increased from 244 reported Wednesday April 8th to 262 Thursday April 9th. For further case details visit us at wechu.org.",Windsor-Essex County Health Unit,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is evolving daily, the Department of Education and Lifelong Learning has been reviewing the situation with education authorities and considering impacts to student travel. 

A decision was made this morning to cancel all Public Schools Branch sanctioned school trips to Europe for the March Break period, as well as all school-planned travel abroad for the rest of March. There are currently no international trips planned for the French Language School Board.

“We appreciate that Islanders are concerned, including our students, their families and staff. Our school boards have been working closely with the Chief Public Health Office to keep our staff, students and their families informed about COVID-19. The decision to cancel school trips by the Public Schools Branch was not made easily. We know that students were looking forward to the experience; however, their safety always comes first.”

- Education and Lifelong Learning Minister Brad Trivers

The Public Schools Branch will continue to review future student travel opportunities at an appropriate time, including rescheduling trips planned for this month that have been cancelled, and will communicate with impacted students and parents. Approximately 100 students and staff have been impacted by the cancellation of school-planned trips this month. 

Island families and students planning personal trips over March break encouraged to visit the province’s website for up-to-date important information about COVID-19, including updates and instructions for those traveling.  

“Many staff and students may have personal trips planned over March break, and I strongly encourage everyone to be aware of travel advice being shared our Chief Public Health Office and take the appropriate precautions,” added Minister Trivers.  

Island students and school staff returning from trips abroad who are feeling well can return to school. Those who may not be feeling well and are experiencing symptoms such as fever, cough, or difficulty breathing are asked to stay home and contact 8-1-1 for instructions.

The public health risk of COVID-19 is continually reassessed and Islanders will be updated as new information becomes available.

Government’s special situation response group also continues to work collaboratively with the Chief Public Health Office, stakeholders and community partners in preparing for all impacts related to COVID-19 to the province, including health, social and economic. 

Everyone is encouraged to follow routine prevention measures:

Washing hands frequently with soap and water
Cough and sneeze into your elbow or a tissue

“School and licensed child care centre closures will assist in our efforts to minimize the spread of COVID-19 and keep all Islanders, especially our most vulnerable citizens, safe,” said Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Heather Morrison. “This is a rapidly evolving situation and we continue to make decisions in the public interest as new information becomes available.” 

Additional measures include the immediate closure of Mark Arendz Provincial Ski Park at Brookvale, and all provincially run visitor information centres. 

The first positive case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Prince Edward Island on March 14, 2020. The Chief Public Health Office has been in contact with the patient and those who been in close contact with her, and further contact tracing is currently underway. 

“Closing daycares and schools are measures we can take to help flatten the curve,” said Brad Trivers, Minister of Education and Lifelong Learning. “Under the leadership of Prince Edward Island’s Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Heather Morrison, we must all do our part to and we will get through this together as a province.”

Islanders with questions about COVID-19 should call PEI’s toll-free information line at 1-800-958-6400. The information line is taking messages 24-hours a day, 7 days a week.

Islanders experiencing symptoms (cough, fever, or shortness of breath) within 14 days after international travel should call 8-1-1 to be screened and, if necessary, directed for testing.

Those requiring immediate medical attention should call 9-1-1.

Effective today, all public and private long-term care and community care facilities will be restricting visitors. 

Children who have travelled outside the country, or whose parents/caregivers have travelled outside the country, should not attend childcare centres and are asked to self-isolate for 14 days. Children who are showing any sign of illness should also not attend child care centres. 

Marion Dowling, Health PEI’s COVID-19 response lead, also noted that Health PEI, as part of activating its pandemic plan and reflecting staffing pressures across the health care system, will be moving to delivering essential services only. For some Islanders, this will mean that their elective procedure or appointment will be rescheduled to a later date, some services will be offered via home-based programming or generally deferred. Islanders will still be able to access primary care, prenatal and newborn care, emergency care and urgent care, in addition to other services.

Dr. Morrison extended her appreciation to Islanders for their continued patience, noting that both 8-1-1 and the toll-free COVID-19 information line are experiencing high call volumes and re-emphasized that Islanders’ calls will be returned.

The special cabinet committees are focused on responding to the community and economic challenges being created by COVID-19, ensuring that Islanders, workers and industries are supported during this challenging time and that the delivery of government’s essential services are maintained. 

The three special cabinet committees announced today are: 

Economy and Business Supports: Chaired by Minister Matthew MacKay, other members include Minister Darlene Compton, Minister Steven Myers and Minister Jamie Fox. 
Labour and Social Supports: Chaired by Minister Ernie Hudson, other members include Minister Brad Trivers, Minister Natalie Jameson, Minister Bloyce Thompson and Minister James Aylward. 
Government Operations: Chaired by Minister Steven Myers, other members include Minister Darlene Compton and Minister Bloyce Thompson. 
“As a government, we are working across departments and with our agencies and community partners every day to ensure that we have a coordinated and responsive approach to addressing COVID-19,” said Premier King. “This is first and foremost a public health priority, and containing the virus and protecting Islanders is paramount; however, we also need to continue with our efforts to address the community and economic impacts of this situation in a meaningful way.”  

The three special cabinet committees are mirrored with corresponding task groups established to provide rapid response to the potential non-health related impacts of COVID-19. This is in addition to the provincial COVID-19 situation response table which has been operational for the past two weeks. 

“What’s happening right now across the country and around the world is unprecedented. We will continue to follow the expert advice of our Chief Public Health Officer as we make decisions as a government with respect to programs, services and supports we put in place to help Islanders,” added Premier King.

“We know the decisions that we are making today as Cabinet and as a government are significant; however, we are making them with the best interests, health and safety of Islanders in mind,” said Premier King.

“Our three special executive council committees – Economy and Business Supports, Labour and Social Support, and Government Operations – are actively working to develop measures to address economic and community. I have invited the leader of the official opposition, Peter Bevan Baker, and the leader of the Third Party, Sonny Gallant, to join these committees.

This new Emergency Contingency Fund is a first step in our efforts to support Islanders as we get through this unprecedented event together.”

Several specific measures are being put in place as part of the province’s response to COVID-19 and were highlighted by several Cabinet Ministers. A highlight of measures currently being implemented include: 

Establishing a $25 million COVID-19 Emergency Contingency Fund 
Establishing a toll-free number to assist employers in addressing their concerns and support needs
Actively monitoring the supply chain impacts
Exploring compensation plans for childcare staff
Moving provincial government departments and agencies to essential services 
Cancelling all government initiated public consultation sessions
More details on these urgent actions being put in place will be shared with Islanders in the next 24-hours. 

The Premier also confirmed that Cabinet met this afternoon and took steps to further empower the province’s Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Heather Morrison by declaring a state of public health emergency to ensure the province is taking all appropriate actions to prepare and mitigate the impacts of COVID-19. Under the Public Health Act, a state of public health emergency has been declared for the province effective immediately. 

While under a provincial state of emergency, the Chief Public Health Officer will be able to: 

order Islanders to refrain from attending any public gatherings;
align resources to where they are needed most; and
manage hospitals and other health care facilities and ambulance services.
Dr. Morrison indicated that she would be providing Islanders with more direction in the coming days about actions they should be taking. 

“I want to thank all Islanders for their patience and for the role they are all playing in helping to flatten the curve and slow the spread of COVID-19. It is important that we continue to work together as that is how we will get through this unprecedented situation.

I encourage every Islander, whether you’re a political leader, employer, or a leader of an organization that represents Islanders across our province, to continue following the advice of Dr. Morrison,” added Premier King.

Prince Edward Island has two confirmed positive cases of COVID-19. There have been 240 tests conducted, of which 167 are negative and 71 are still pending. 

Dr. Morrison shared additional details regarding the Island’s second case of COVID-19. The flight the man was on was Air Canada flight 7564 which travelled from Toronto to Charlottetown on March 11. Passengers on the flight are asked to self-isolate for the remaining 14 days from when they returned and monitor their symptoms. 

Islanders who are not self-isolating are encouraged to consider blood donation if they are feeling well and have not travelled internationally. Keeping up with the demand of Canada’s national supply of blood products is very important. Islanders should take the online eligibility quiz before making an appointment. Appointments must be made in advance by visiting www.blood.ca(link is external) or by calling 1-888-2-donate, to allow for social distancing.

Environmental Health Officers will now be stationed at the Charlottetown airport to pass out self-isolation information sheets to travelers as they land. These sheets are available in English and French. 

Dr. Morrison stressed the importance that children get outside to play and stay active, but they should do so while respecting social distancing. Children should participate in activities with supervision, but should not play in groups or have sleepovers. Children can get sick and spread the virus to others too. 

Dr. Morrison asks that Islanders refrain from stock piling medications, as this can lead to a shortage of medications for those who need them. Speak with a pharmacist about accessing a reasonable supply of medication. If you are experiencing symptoms, please do not go into your pharmacy.

New screening measures are being put in place for the next 10 days at all entry points into the province, including the Charlottetown Airport, Confederation Bridge and Magdalene Island Ferry dock in Souris. 

Exceptions will be made for individuals who are considered essential workers (e.g. health care workers, truck drivers, airline crews, essential frontline workers in the public or private sector, workers in critical sectors). Upon their return from domestic travel, essential workers will be:

screened upon entry to the province;
asked to self- monitor daily for symptoms of COVID-19 if feeling well; and, 
asked to self-isolate if experiencing symptoms of COVID-19. 
Recommendations from the Chief Public Health Officer may change as the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve. 
Dr. Morrison also noted that that in order to ensure all Islanders have fair access to the medications they need, Island pharmacies will now be limiting all prescription refills to a maximum of 30 days. Pharmacare clients will have no additional financial burden due to the more frequent refills.

Dr. Morrison further clarified details regarding the flight linked to the second case of COVID-19. It was Air Canada flight 7564 which travelled from Toronto to Charlottetown on March 11. All passengers on that flight are asked to self-isolate for 14 days from date they returned and monitor their symptoms daily.

Earlier today, Cabinet empowered the Chief Public Health Officer to issue orders under the Public Health Act as needed, including fines to anyone who is not complying with the direction to self-isolate. The measures put in place today are not unlike measures that have been put in place in other Canadian jurisdictions in recent days.

“These decisions aren’t made lightly and should signal to Islanders the seriousness of what’s before us with COVID-19. It is our collective responsibility to do our part, whether that is self-isolating, practicing social distancing or offering a helping hand to those in need. We are at a crucial point in the COVID-19 situation and the decisions we make now will help us in the long run.”

- Premier Dennis King

The penalties outlined today for Islanders who do not comply include: 

A fine of $1,000 for a first offence;
A fine of $2,000 for a second offence; or,
A fine of $10,000 for a third offence and every offence thereafter.
 
“Dr. Morrison has been giving Islanders expert advice daily on what we must do to contain the spread of COVID-19,” said Justice and Public Safety Minister Bloyce Thompson. ""It is important that we do what we can with the resources available to us to support her efforts to keep Islanders safe. The time to act is now and our individual actions will have a direct impact on how successful we are in protecting the health and safety of everyone.”

Islanders returning to Prince Edward Island from domestic or international travel must self-isolate for 14 days. Exceptions are being made for essential workers, including truck drivers, airline crews, essential public and private sector workers in critical sectors, as well as on compassionate grounds. 

New screening measures have been put in place at all entry points into the province – Confederation Bridge, Charlottetown Airport and Magdalen Ferry Terminal. 

“This is a significant adjustment for all of us and while people are understandably anxious about these changes, they are necessary changes to protect our community,” said Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Heather Morrison. “We don’t want to have to use these measures, but we will if we need to. Islanders need to go home and stay home. Anyone putting their families, their neighbours, and Islanders at risk will face the potential consequences.”

Islanders with concerns about people they know not following the self-isolation directive can contact the toll-free COVID-19 information line at 1-800-958-6400.

Dr. Morrison reiterated that she does expect the situation on PEI to get worse.  Similar to what is being seen across the country, PEI will likely experience community transmission. She reminded Islanders that this is why practicing physical distancing, along with self-isolation upon return from travel, is so crucial in our efforts in slowing the spread of the virus here in PEI. 

Screening measures have now been strengthened at the Confederation Bridge and the Charlottetown Airport. Additional information is being gathered from travelers, including where they are travelling from, where they are going, and if they have a support system to deliver supplies to them while they are in self-isolation. 

The Chief Public Health Office has received 56 complaints of those failing to self-isolate upon return from travel outside the province. 26 of these resulted in a visit from an officer, 12 resulted in verbal warnings to self-isolate and nine resulted in a written warning for violating the Public Health Order. 
Those issued written warnings have been advised any further failure to comply will result in charges. A number of the 56 complaints received have more than one complaint against an individual. 

Islanders experiencing symptoms (cough, fever, or shortness of breath) within 14 days after travelling outside the province should call 8-1-1 to be screened and, if necessary, directed for testing. Those requiring immediate medical attention should call 9-1-1.  ",Government of PEI,,Prince Edward Island confirms seven additional COVID-19 cases,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/prince-edward-island-confirms-seven-additional-covid-19-cases,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,1.0,,Government Website,"Premier Dennis King today announced two key initiatives to engage Islanders and the business community in identifying opportunities to address economic and supply challenges stemming from COVID-19 and support Islanders who need help now.

The recently established Premier’s Economic Recovery Council, a strategic business working group made up of individuals from across business sectors, will leverage the experience, knowledge and ingenuity of the business community to advise the Premier on the issues being faced by the business community and opportunities as the province looks down the road to economic recovery. 

“We want to work closely with businesses – those who drive our economy and have been responsible for our recent economic strength as a province – so that we are doing everything we can to minimize the economic impacts of COVID-19 on our province and looking to the future when we can set a course for recovery and return to normal,” said Premier King.  

The initial Council held its first virtual meeting on Saturday and will continue to meet as required through the duration of the pandemic. The Council will consult broadly with other businesses and across all business networks as part of the “all-hands-on-deck” model. 

As part of government’s efforts to support this initiative, the Premier also launched PEI Sourced Solutions, an online portal to help Island residents and businesses meet the challenges of the pandemic, including the need for medical supplies, virtual care services, or to share ideas on how the province can help businesses and industries weather the impacts of COVID-19. 

“Islanders are innovative and resourceful, and we continue to see them stepping up to support each other during this unimaginable time. The new online portal will help connect provincial efforts and community supports so that we are ready and able to respond to the continued needs of our province going forward. It’s by working together that we will get through this,” added Premier King. 

PEI Sourced Solutions identifies the province’s potential supply challenges and important services required to support communities. Through the portal, Islanders – individuals and businesses – will be able to identify opportunities for government to procure required goods and services, as well as share creative solutions on how to direct resources and explore new ways of doing business to support COVID-19 specifc needs. The province will review all submissions and work with individuals and businesses to provide solutions. 

Islanders can access the online portal at www.princeedwardisland.ca/sourcedsolutions starting March 31 at 8 a.m.",Government of PEI,,Premier announces initiatives to support COVID-19 specific needs,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/premier-announces-initiatives-support-covid-19-specific-needs,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eight of PEI’s COVID-19 cases are now considered recovered. All 22 cases have been related to international travel. PEI tests continue to be sent to the National Microbiology Lab and the Island’s local testing capacity has and will to expand in the days ahead. 

Dr. Morrison reminded Islanders that the most effective way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19 is through staying home, practicing physical distancing, washing hands and coughing into a tissue or sleeve to reduce droplet spread. Wearing a homemade cloth mask has not been proven to protect the person who is wearing it, and should not be used in replacement of public health measures. However, wearing a mask in public where social and physical distancing could be difficult may be appropriate to ensure the safety of the people and workers around you, for example public transit.  

Health PEI’s Chief Nursing Officer, Marion Dowling, says plans for a virtual care platform to be used by physicians, nurse practitioners, and mental health and addictions will launch this week. This will allow health care providers to offer services, over a secure video platform, to improve access for patients while reducing the need for in-person visits. 

Cough and fever clinics and drive thru testing clinics continue to run seven days a week in both Charlottetown and Summerside. This weekend, 148 patients were seen in Charlottetown and 63 patients in Summerside. Appointments to the cough and fever clinics are by referral from family physicians, nurse practitioners or 811. Assessment clinics are also providing an option for telephone assessments, if necessary.

A Special Cabinet Committee on Family Violence Prevention has been established to ensure parents, children, and individuals at risk of family violence have the proper resources available during this difficult and uncertain time. The committee consists of ministers and staff of the departments of Justice and Public Safety, Social Development and Housing and the Interministerial Women’s Secretariat. Minister of Justice and Public Safety Bloyce Thompson chairs the committee.

“There is no doubt that the measures that governments and community are taking to protect the health and safety of Islanders are necessary during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Minister Thompson. “However, the threat of violence remains present in our communities and anyone facing those situations needs to know that we are still here to help. If anyone needs support, reach out.  Now, more than ever, is a time to come together and to look out for our Island family.”

Minister Thompson stated that COVID-19 specific resources for individuals and families have been developed to address topics such as co-parenting,  how to support and answer questions from children and youth, and taking care of your mental health. 

To help provide parents with techniques and strategies for handling parenting challenges, Minister of Social Development and Housing Ernie Hudson announced that the province has purchased 150 additional licenses for the Positive Parenting Program so more Islanders can access the program free of charge online.

The Positive Parenting Program, commonly known as Triple P, is one of the most effective, evidenced-based parenting programs in the world. The program is available in English and French and each online session ranges from 30-60 minutes. 

This week, Triple P launched a COVID-19 specific session for parents. Island parents interested in the program should visit www.triplep-parenting.ca/can-en/find-help/triple-p-parenting-in-prince-edward-island(link is external).
Minister Hudson urged parents who need additional support to reach out to Child and Family Services. The primary goal of Child and Family Services is keeping children secure by offering support to parent and caregivers so that they can provide children with a safe, caring, healthy home. 

“Staying apart doesn’t mean going it alone,” said Minister Hudson. “As Islanders, we are here to support one another; to lift up our neighbours and friends and ensure that no person feels unsafe, unvalued or unwanted. It is so very important that those who are in difficult situations know that they are not alone, that there is support available and that there are people who care about them and their well-being.”

Minister responsible for the Status of Women Natalie Jameson reminded Islanders experiencing domestic abuse or violence who need to flee their homes that support is available and thanked individuals who continue to provide essential services to keep families safe during this difficult time. 

“While people need to stay at home as much as possible, we know that not every home is safe,” said Minister Jameson. “Sometimes women need to leave to protect themselves and their children. It is important to know that during these times that help is available. There are still services for people who are experiencing violence. You are not alone and you will not be alone.” 

For information, resources and community support available for family violence prevention, visit www.princeedwardisland.ca/familyviolenceprevention.  
If you are in immediate danger, contact 9-1-1.

If you suspect a child is being abused or neglected by a parent or guardian, by law you need to report it. Call Child Protection Services at 1-877-341-3101 or after hours 1-800-341-6868.

“We understand how important the fishing season is to Islanders. This is not a decision we have taken lightly. As Dr. Morrison has said, we are in an important time. How well we do at social distancing in the next few weeks will have an impact on the health and the lives of Islanders in the months to come. That means staying apart and avoiding contact at places like gas stations, boat launches and popular fishing and recreation spots.”

- Environment, Water and Climate Change Minister Natalie Jameson

The delay applies to both inland and tidal water fisheries. It includes trout, Atlantic salmon, smelt, striped bass, mackerel, flounder, perch, scallop, softshell clam, bar clam, razor clam and mussels. It also closes all recreational shellfish until June 1, 2020.

“When making this decision, we considered the need to protect our front-line staff like Conservation Officers and first responders. They are already working incredibly hard during this time to keep us safe. We need to stay apart to support them,” said Jamie Fox, Minister of Fisheries and Communities. “I talk regularly with my Atlantic and federal colleagues about how we can best protect public health while preserving our fisheries. I know the fishing community will do its part as we go through these difficult times.”

Fisheries and Oceans Canada has made the necessary regulatory changes to support the delay. This decision is supported by the Departments of Fisheries and Communities, Environment, Water and Climate Change, Justice and Public Safety and the province’s Chief Public Health Office.

In total, the Province will support the creation of 1,000 new job placements for Island high school and post-secondary students through increases to current employment programs and partnerships with community and industry as long as the jobs can follow the health and safety recommendations of the Chief Public Health Office.

“We know that Island post-secondary students have been negatively impacted as a result of this pandemic and the province is here to help. Whether they anticipated working over the summer to help pay the cost of their tuition and expenses or they were ready to embark on their first career after graduating, we have put supports in place to help. Every Islander is dealing with the unique challenges of COVID-19 and we need to be there to support those individual needs so that we can all get through this together.”

- Premier Dennis King

The Province of Prince Edward Island has been working with the federal government and students’ unions to understand the economic challenges Island students are facing and fill potential gaps in funding currently available so that the immediate and long-term needs of students are met.

Minister of Fisheries and Communities Jamie Fox announced an expansion of the Team Seafood program to encourage more Island youth to participate in the fishing and aquaculture industries. Through Team Seafood, the province provides a bursary, on top of employee wages, to high school or post-secondary students. The province will support 250 new placements through this program.

Minister Fox also announced enhancements through the Jobs for Youth Program to community, environment, and non-government organizations to create 280 student employment opportunities.

To help Island business retain their current employees, Minister Fox announced an increase to private sector wage subsidies through the Employment Development Agency. The subsidy will increase from 50 per cent of wages to 75 per cent of wages.

“As our province deals with the consequences of COVID-19, the provincial government is committed to helping Islanders, including our secondary and post-secondary students, find employment and help businesses and organizations hire the personnel they need to continue operating safely,” said Minster Fox. “The sooner people can return to work, the better off all Islanders will be.”

Minister of Economic Growth, Tourism and Culture Matthew MacKay announced an expansion of the Post-Secondary Employment Program through Skills PEI. The program supports 100 per cent of student wages for government and non-government organizations and will now support 75 per cent wage funding for the private sector, up from 50 per cent. The Post-Secondary Employment Program will create up to 320 new positions.

“We are proud of our ambitious Island youth and want to be there to support their educational and career pursuits but recognize that the pandemic has altered their plans,” said Minister of Economic Growth, Tourism and Culture Matthew MacKay. “Working with industry, and with our students, we want to ensure that job opportunities are available and that no Islander is left behind.”

To increase the COVID-related supports provided by the province’s post-secondary institutions to students in immediate need, Minister of Education and Lifelong Learning Brad Trivers announced a total of $95,000 to support the UPEI Student Union, Holland College and Collège de l'Île.

In addition, Minister Trivers announced a partnership with the University of Prince Edward Island to develop a $75,000 research fund for students wishing to pursue opportunities in their respective fields of interest.  

“Our post-secondary students are at a very critical point in their lives as they pursue education and training opportunities to help create a brighter future for themselves and our province,” said Minister Trivers. “It’s very important that students can continue to learn and that as a community, we do everything possible to ensure that the pandemic does not disrupt their educational pursuits.”

Premier Dennis King extended the state of public health emergency initially declared under the Public Health Act on March 16 for an additional 30 days to ensure Prince Edward Island’s Chief Public Health Officer continues to have the necessary authority to lead the province’s ongoing public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

“From the beginning, I have said we will take our direction in navigating this unprecedented situation from Dr. Morrison. She has been steadfast in doing what is right to keep Islanders safe and we must continue to follow her lead. We have been clear in our commitment to supporting her efforts, as she needs us to do right now, and we will not hesitate to make difficult decisions quickly to help our province get through this pandemic. Together, we can and we will persevere through this.”

- Premier Dennis King

To further support the provincial public health response to the global pandemic, and following discussions with Dr. Morrison, Justice and Public Safety Minister Bloyce Thompson today confirmed that a state of emergency is being declared across the province until the end of the month under the Emergency Measures Act. This additional state of emergency complements the existing authority set out in the public health order and enables a more efficient deployment of resources that will assist the Chief Public Health Officer’s guidance to protect Islanders, particularly through enhanced controls and screening at points of entry.

The Emergency Measures Organization, under the direction of the Minister of Justice and Public Safety, will support the Chief Public Health Office in controlling access at various points of entry to the province, along with any other access points to the province and, where applicable, direct individuals to leave Prince Edward Island. This includes, but is not limited to, the Confederation Bridge, the Charlottetown airport, ferry terminals at Wood Islands and Souris, as well as any port, harbour, wharf, launching, beach, and any part of the provincial shoreline. 

“Dr. Morrison has been a strong leader for all Islanders through this pandemic,” said Minister Thompson. “Putting this order through today, and further engaging the Emergency Measures Organization and law enforcement, will give her more tools at her disposal to do what is needed to protect the health and safety of Islanders. Let’s continue doing what she asks of us every day so that we can come out of this on top.”

During the period of the state of emergency, individuals travelling to Prince Edward Island will be required to disclose the purpose of their travel to determine if it is deemed essential or not as per the direction of the Chief Public Health Office to the Emergency Measures Organization by email publicsafety@gov.pe.ca(link sends e-mail) or by phone 902-894-0385. This process will complement current border controls and screenings in place in both New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.

2020-03-12,Canada,Quebec,All,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,1.0,French,Government Website,"Québec, le 12 mars 2020 – Lors d’un point de presse tenu à l’Assemblée nationale, le premier ministre, François Legault, accompagné de la ministre de la Santé et des Services sociaux, Danielle McCann, et du directeur de la santé publique du Québec, Horacio Arruda, a annoncé de nouvelles directives à l’intention de la population du Québec.

Tout en précisant que pour le moment, la pandémie de la COVID-19 est sous contrôle au Québec, avec 13 cas confirmés, le premier ministre a fait savoir qu’il entend prendre toutes les mesures pour freiner et ralentir au maximum une contagion qui est devenue inévitable.

M. Legault a ainsi annoncé :

qu’à compter d’aujourd’hui, toutes les personnes qui reviennent d’un pays étranger ou qui présentent des symptômes associés à la grippe ou au rhume doivent se placer en isolement volontaire pour 14 jours;
que cet isolement est obligatoire pour tous les employés de la fonction publique et pour tout le personnel de la santé, de l’éducation et des services de garde, privés et publics, qui reviennent de l’étranger;
que les organisations doivent annuler tous les rassemblement intérieurs de plus de 250 personnes ou qui ne sont pas nécessaires, pour les 30 prochains jours.
Le premier ministre a tenu à rassurer les employés du secteur public qui doivent s’isoler : ils continueront d’être payés. Pour les employés du secteur privé qui devront s’absenter du travail, M. Legault a demandé aux employeurs de comprendre la situation particulière dans laquelle la société se trouve et d’être compréhensifs envers leurs travailleurs. Il a tout de même assuré qu’au cours des prochains jours, le gouvernement du Québec annoncera des mesures pour venir en aide aux employés et soutenir les entreprises qui auront des problèmes de liquidités à la suite des répercussions du coronavirus.

M. Legault a rappelé aux Québécois l’importance de suivre attentivement les consignes et les mesures d’hygiène recommandées par la santé publique du Québec pour contrer le virus, soit de se laver les mains régulièrement avec du savon ainsi que de tousser et d’éternuer dans son coude. Un site Internet a été créé, www.québec.ca/coronavirus This hyperlink will open in a new window., pour regrouper l’ensemble de l’information. La ligne téléphonique 1 877 644-4545 est également en place. Finalement, le premier ministre a réitéré sa demande de protéger les personnes aînées de la COVID-19 et de ne pas se rendre dans les centres d’hébergement si l’on a le moindrement de symptômes semblables à ceux de la grippe.

Citation :
« Aujourd’hui, tout le Québec doit se mettre en mode d’urgence. Les prochaines semaines vont être critiques. Les Québécois doivent savoir qu’on en a pour des mois. Notre grande priorité doit être la santé publique. On doit se protéger, et la meilleure façon de protéger nos proches, c’est de se protéger soi-même. Je fais appel à la solidarité et au sens des responsabilités de tous les Québécois. Tout le monde doit faire sa part. Je tiens à souligner le dévouement des personnes qui travaillent dans notre réseau de la santé. Vous êtes nos anges gardiens. Tous les Québécois vous sont extrêmement reconnaissants. On va passer au travers de cette épreuve tous ensemble. »

Il en a fait l’annonce lors du point de presse quotidien en compagnie de la ministre de la Santé et des Services sociaux, Danielle McCann, de la ministre responsable des Aînés et des Proches aidants, Marguerite Blais, et du directeur national de santé publique, Dr Horacio Arruda.

La mise en place de cette mesure exceptionnelle permettra au gouvernement du Québec de se donner tous les moyens nécessaires pour agir, par exemple de procéder sans délai à l’achat de tout matériel ou de conclure tout contrat pour protéger la santé de la population.

Nouvelles mesures
Le premier ministre François Legault a également annoncé une nouvelle série de mesures visant à freiner la propagation du virus.

Le premier ministre a déclaré que, dorénavant, les visites régulières dans les centres hospitaliers, les centres d’hébergement de soins de longue durée (CHSLD), les ressources intermédiaires, les ressources de type familial ainsi que les résidences privées pour aînés sont interdites sur tout le territoire québécois. Cette mesure vise à protéger les personnes les plus vulnérables. De plus, il est recommandé aux personnes âgées de 70 ans et plus de rester chez elles et de limiter leurs déplacements afin d’éviter de s’exposer au coronavirus, sauf en cas de situations exceptionnelles comme des rendez-vous médicaux importants.

Le premier ministre a aussi statué qu’à compter d’aujourd’hui, les services de santé fournis par des moyens de télécommunication, par exemple par un médecin qui fait une consultation par téléphone, seront assurés par la Régie de l’assurance maladie du Québec. Aussi, les infirmières, les médecins ou les pharmaciens à la retraite prêts à donner un coup de main n’auront pas à payer de nouvelles cotisations aux ordres professionnels.

Finalement, la consigne d’annuler les rassemblements intérieurs de 250 personnes ou plus devient obligatoire.

François Legault a profité de son point de presse pour remercier à nouveau toutes les personnes (médecins, personnel infirmier, pharmaciens, ambulanciers, préposés) qui œuvrent dans le domaine de la santé et qui sont mobilisées depuis le début de cette crise.

Tout le gouvernement du Québec mobilisé
Le gouvernement du Québec dans son intégralité est au travail et est animé par un sentiment d’urgence, a assuré François Legault. Le premier ministre a rappelé que son équipe économique est en train de mettre au point les programmes d’aide temporaire pour les travailleurs et entreprises touchés. Ses ministres de l’Éducation et de la Famille sont à l’œuvre pour organiser les services de garde pour les parents qui travaillent en santé et dans les services essentiels.

La ministre de la Santé et des Services sociaux, Danielle McCann, entend accélérer la cadence au cours des prochains jours pour ouvrir d’autres cliniques désignées pour le traitement et le dépistage de la COVID-19. Actuellement, 7 cliniques désignées sont ouvertes et 12 seront ajoutées, pour un total de 19. Le réseau de la santé et des services sociaux prend toutes les mesures nécessaires pour affronter une vague importante au cours des prochaines semaines pour le dépistage du virus.

Les Québécois doivent cesser de voyager à l’étranger
François Legault a demandé aux Québécois de cesser de voyager à l’étranger. Il est primordial de limiter le plus possible les déplacements à l’étranger, peu importe le pays de destination.

Pour ce qui est des frontières, le gouvernement fédéral doit agir avec encore plus de force. M. Legault a insisté sur la nécessité de contrôler l’état de tous les visiteurs et d’en assurer un suivi.

« Nous sommes dans une véritable course contre la montre pour freiner le virus. Il faut agir vite et de façon décisive. Je comprends bien le sentiment d’angoisse que peuvent provoquer au sein de la population les décisions que nous prenons. Si nous agissons avec autant de force aussi rapidement, c’est justement pour éviter le pire. Il n’y a aucune raison de paniquer à l’heure actuelle. Je veux remercier à nouveau les Québécois pour la compréhension, la patience et la solidarité dont ils font preuve dans le contexte. Encore une fois, ensemble, on va passer à travers cette crise. »

François Legault, premier ministre du Québec

« Aujourd’hui, nous avons 4 personnes de plus infectées au coronavirus, pour un total de 21 cas au Québec. La situation est sous contrôle, mais nous restons extrêmement vigilants. Nous travaillons sans relâche pour empêcher la propagation du virus sur notre territoire. Déjà, 7 cliniques désignées sont ouvertes et nous en ajouterons 12. La mobilisation de l’ensemble du personnel est en cours et la collaboration est totale. Je remercie d’ailleurs à nouveau le personnel du réseau de la santé et des services sociaux pour son engagement et son travail essentiel. »

Danielle McCann, ministre de la Santé et des Services sociaux

« Il devient nécessaire d’interdire les visites dans les hôpitaux, les centres d’hébergement de soins de longue durée (CHSLD), les ressources intermédiaires, les ressources de type familial ainsi que les résidences privées pour aînés. Il en va de la protection de nos personnes les plus vulnérables, mais également de celles des personnes qui travaillent dans ces milieux. C’est une mesure crève-cœur, mais que nous nous devons de mettre en place. »

The new measures will see nearly all international flights into Canada directed to the main airports in Montreal, Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver starting one minute after midnight on Wednesday morning. Flights from the U.S., Mexico and the Caribbean will not be affected.

The government is also closing the border Wednesday to non-Canadians, with some exceptions. Permanent Canadian residents, immediate family members as well as diplomats, aircrew and U.S. citizens will still be allowed into the country.

Airlines are also being told to screen passengers and bar anyone from boarding a flight to Canada if they show symptoms of COVID-19. Aircrew have also been told to notify ground controllers if someone on board a plane displays symptoms and they will be met at the gate by authorities.

And the Canada Border Services Agency has started to increase the number of border agents in airports, who Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said will be on the lookout for anyone displaying symptoms as they distribute information pamphlets to all international travellers.

Automated questionnaires administered through touchscreens at entry points have also been modified to ask everyone who is arriving from overseas whether they have coughs, difficulty breathing or are feeling feverish.

New arrivals are also required to confirm that they’re being asked to self-isolate for two weeks to keep COVID-19 from spreading.

Blair acknowledged during a news conference with other federal cabinet ministers “the many questions and concerns that have been expressed by Canadians about the activities that are taking place at our border in order to screen arriving passengers.”

But he said the new restrictions on international flights as well as the ban on most foreign travellers will ease the pressure on airports and Canada’s border agents and public health officials, who are responsible for trying to keep the disease from further getting into the country.

“Important measures that have been announced today … will make the critical work of our border officers far more effective,” Blair said. “For example, by limiting international flights to our four main airports, it allows for the concentration and efficient use of our limited resources.”

The measures follow a weekend in which some travellers reported they were not being properly screened for the respiratory illness as well as images of long lines and crowded spaces in arrival areas, contrary to instructions not to gather in large groups.

Work is underway to ensure “proper social distancing” in arrival areas, Blair said, adding: “By significantly reducing the number of non-Canadian travellers, we will see a significant reduction of those travelling to Canada and therefore a reduction in those who need to be processed.”

Concerns about the situation at local airports _ and complaints about the federal government’s efforts to screen passengers _ have sparked some provinces and municipalities to step up their own efforts.

Hours before the federal government laid out its latest plan, Montreal city officials announced they were sending civil security and public health workers to Montreal-Trudeau International Airport to remind travellers they must self-isolate upon returning to Canada.

The measures are needed because travellers arriving in the province did not appear to be taking seriously Quebec’s order requiring two weeks of isolation, said Dr. Mylene Drouin, Montreal’s director of public health.

Travellers will pass by the employees before they leave the airport and be given information sheets and asked to note their symptoms and take their temperatures twice a day during the isolation period, Drouin said.

Montreal Mayor Valerie Plante said travellers must be made aware that upon arriving in Canada, they cannot go to work, school or anywhere else for two weeks.

Alberta Premier Jason Kenney also said Sunday that he was directing provincial officials to check up on airports in the province after he visited Edmonton International Airport to investigate reports of inadequate screening of international travellers

While he didn’t address what was happening at the Montreal and Edmonton airports specifically, Trudeau said he welcomed efforts by different provinces and territories to limit the spread of COVID-19 given each “are facing different realities and risks.”

“At the same time, we also need to keep building an aligned, Canada-wide approach,” he said, later adding: “We have seen many provinces take aggressive steps to protect their communities. I want to thank them for their work. It’s time to take every precaution to keep people safe.”

Meanwhile, the union representing Canada’s border officers was set to meet with the CBSA on Monday afternoon after raising concerns last week about a lack of information and guidance to its members, one of whom has tested positive for COVID-19.

Four people in Canada have died of COVID-19, while provincial authorities had reported another 403 confirmed cases by Monday afternoon, as well as 15 presumptive cases. Ten cases have been resolved.

En compagnie de la ministre de la Santé et des Services sociaux, Danielle McCann, et du directeur national de santé publique du Québec, Dr Horacio Arruda, le premier ministre a indiqué que dans certains pays, comme la Corée et l’Italie, les jeunes ont été des agents importants de propagation du virus. Pour poursuivre ses efforts afin de limiter la propagation de la COVID-19, le gouvernement du Québec lance donc un appel à toutes celles et à tous ceux qui ont une écoute spéciale des jeunes, soit leurs idoles. Si ces personnalités publiques utilisent leurs réseaux sociaux et leurs tribunes, M. Legault est convaincu qu’elles sauront persuader les jeunes de respecter les consignes de santé publique. Le Québec en sortira ainsi gagnant.

Campagne publicitaire « Propage l’info, pas le virus »
En plus de cet appel, le premier ministre a précisé que le gouvernement du Québec lance, dès aujourd’hui, sa propre campagne de communication avec pour mot d’ordre : « Propage l’info, pas le virus ».

François Legault a rappelé aux jeunes que ce n’est pas le temps de se rassembler ni d’organiser des fêtes. C’est un effort collectif qui doit être fait pour combattre le coronavirus.

Ajout de 9 cliniques désignées, pour un total de 31
Le premier ministre a assuré que tout est fait dans le réseau de la santé pour augmenter la capacité de cueillette d’échantillons et d’analyse. Il est primordial de multiplier les tests et le nombre de cliniques, tous les jours, a insisté M. Legault. Pour y parvenir, il a annoncé que le ministère de la Santé et des Services sociaux ajoutera 9 cliniques désignées, pour un total de 31 sur le territoire du Québec.

Le premier ministre a de nouveau remercié les Québécois qui ont une expérience dans le domaine de la santé et qui sont à la retraite, qui répondent en grand nombre à la campagne « Je contribue », visant à épauler le réseau de la santé. Plus de 10 000 candidatures ont été reçues à ce moment-ci et déjà 1 800 personnes sont en voie d’être mises à contribution dans le réseau.

Travaux ajournés à l’Assemblée nationale jusqu’au 21 avril
M. Legault a également salué les chefs de l’opposition à l’Assemblée nationale, Pierre Arcand, Manon Massé et Pascal Bérubé, qui font preuve de beaucoup de grandeur dans cette crise. L’unité qui règne au Québec dans cette course contre la montre est inspirante et les Québécois ont de quoi être fiers de leur classe politique.

Mardi matin, les leaders parlementaires des différents partis politiques ont convenu d’ajourner les travaux jusqu’au 21 avril, afin de permettre aux députés d’être auprès des citoyens de leur circonscription.

Respecter les directives de santé publique
Lors de son point de presse quotidien, le premier ministre a tenu à répéter les directives des autorités de la santé publique que tous les Québécois doivent suivre pour limiter la contagion à la COVID-19, aplatir la courbe de transmission et, ultimement, sauver des vies :

Se laver les mains, régulièrement, avec du savon ;
Tousser dans son coude ;
Garder une distance de 1 à 2 mètres les uns des autres ;
Éviter tous les rassemblements qui ne sont pas nécessaires, peu importe le nombre de personnes présentes ;
S’isoler pendant une période de 14 jours si on revient d’un voyage à l’étranger, sans exception, ou si on éprouve des symptômes liés à la grippe et au rhume ;
En cas de symptôme, il faut appeler le 1 877 644-4545 ;
Pour les employeurs, il faut, dans la mesure du possible, permettre aux employés de faire du télétravail. Aussi, les employeurs doivent cesser de demander des billets médicaux à leurs employés qui doivent s’isoler, afin de ne pas engorger inutilement le réseau de la santé et des services sociaux.

« L’une de nos préoccupations concerne les jeunes. Les adolescents et les jeunes adultes ne prennent pas assez au sérieux les consignes de santé publique. C’est normal, à cet âge-là, les jeunes ont moins tendance à écouter les plus vieux. Je lance donc un appel à tous les artistes, sportifs et personnalités qui ont une écoute des jeunes : utilisez vos réseaux sociaux et toutes vos tribunes pour les exhorter à respecter les consignes de santé publique et à ne pas faire la fête! De notre côté, nous lançons une campagne de communication auprès des jeunes avec pour mot d’ordre « Propage l’info, pas le virus ». Avec notre campagne, nous voulons convaincre nos jeunes de toutes les façons possibles. Nous avons une grosse bataille devant nous. Ensemble, nous sommes capables de la gagner ! »

François Legault, premier ministre du Québec

« Concernant les tests, je veux vous dire que nous sommes en train d’augmenter de façon très importante notre capacité de cueillette d’échantillons et d’analyse. Nous devons passer de centaines de tests par jour à des milliers par jour. Nous avons actuellement 22 cliniques désignées opérationnelles et il y en aura un total de 31 sur le territoire du Québec très prochainement. Notre grande priorité à court terme, c’est d’augmenter le nombre de tests. »

1. Éviter les déplacements non essentiels d’une région à l’autre
Le premier ministre a appelé les Québécois à éviter les déplacements non essentiels d’une région à l’autre. Bien que la situation soit sous contrôle et que les mesures mises en place par les autorités de la santé publique portent leurs fruits, il faut tout faire pour éviter de propager le virus d’une région à l’autre. « Il ne faut pas lâcher », a insisté M. Legault.

2. Appel aux personnes de 70 ans et plus à éviter les rassemblements dans les centres commerciaux et les restaurants
François Legault a tenu à s’adresser particulièrement aux personnes de 70 et plus : « Évitez les rassemblements dans les centres d’achats et les restaurants. N’organisez pas de grands soupers. Restez chez vous autant que possible. » Il a rappelé que les personnes âgées représentent la catégorie de personnes la plus à risque de contracter le virus, d’où l’importance de respecter la directive de la santé publique de rester chez soi. Le premier ministre a invité les plus jeunes à appeler leurs grands-parents pour prendre de leurs nouvelles et leur demander de se protéger.

Si vous avez d’autres problèmes de santé qui ne sont pas liés au virus ou n’avez pas de symptômes : appelez votre médecin de famille
François Legault a fait savoir à nouveau que les personnes qui sont malades et qui présentent des symptômes doivent appeler au 514 644-4545 pour la région de Montréal, au 418 644-4545 pour la région de Québec et au 1 877 644-4545 ailleurs au Québec. Ces gens doivent rester à leur domicile et éviter tout contact.

« Par contre, si vous avez d’autres problèmes de santé qui ne sont pas liés au virus, appelez votre médecin de famille », a exigé M. Legault. Une entente a été conclue avec les médecins de famille, qui peuvent maintenant faire des consultations par téléphone.

Pour sa part, la ministre de la Santé et des Services sociaux, Danielle McCann, a souligné que tous les équipements nécessaires pour faire face à la pandémie, écouvillons pour les tests, masques, gants, respirateurs, visières et autres, sont disponibles et en quantité suffisante.

Remerciement spécial
Finalement, le premier ministre a tenu à remercier particulièrement toutes celles et tous ceux qui nous nourrissent : des agriculteurs jusqu’aux transformateurs, en passant par les camionneurs et les personnes qui travaillent dans nos épiceries. M. Legault leur a assuré qu’il n’y a aucune raison de s’inquiéter si toutes les mesures et précautions de base sont suivies (se laver les mains, maintenir une distance de 1 à 2 mètres les uns des autres, tousser dans son coude, etc.). « On a besoin de vous et on va avoir besoin de vous pendant toute la crise ! », a-t-il déclaré.

« Nous avons la capacité de faire 5 000 tests par jour. Je veux dire aux Québécois que c’est normal de voir le nombre de cas augmenter, étant donné qu’on augmente le nombre de tests.

2020-03-22,Canada,Quebec,All,2.0,1.0,French,Government Website,"Québec, le 22 mars 2020 – Le premier ministre du Québec, François Legault, a annoncé aujourd’hui de nouvelles mesures pour protéger les Québécois et limiter encore davantage la propagation de la COVID-19.

Fermeture prolongée pour les établissements scolaires et d’enseignement supérieur ainsi que les services de garde
Accompagné du ministre de l’Éducation de l’Enseignement supérieur, Jean-François Roberge, le premier ministre a annoncé la prolongation de la fermeture de tout le réseau de l’éducation (écoles primaires et secondaires, publiques comme privées), de l’enseignement supérieur (centres de formation, cégeps et universités, publics comme privés) et des services de garde, et ce, jusqu’au 1er mai.

Afin d’assurer le maintien des acquis, le ministère de l’Éducation offrira rapidement des activités et des vidéos pédagogiques pour faciliter la vie des parents et des élèves. En ce qui concerne les étudiants des cégeps et des universités, à compter du 30 mars, ils pourront compléter leur session en ligne.

Les services de garde d’urgence demeureront ouverts pour soutenir les travailleurs de la santé, des services sociaux et des services essentiels.

Fermeture des centres commerciaux, des salles à manger dans les restaurants ainsi que des salons de coiffure, d’esthétique et de soins personnels à compter de minuit ce soir
Afin d’accentuer les mesures de précaution, le gouvernement du Québec a pris la décision de fermer, à compter de minuit ce soir, et ce, jusqu’au 1er mai prochain :

Les centres commerciaux, à l’exception des magasins alimentaires, des pharmacies et des succursales de la SAQ qui se trouvent à l’intérieur ;
Les salles à manger des restaurants, à l’exception des services pour emporter et de livraison ;
Les salons de coiffure, d’esthétique et de soins personnels.
Il est à noter que les commerces disposant d’une porte extérieure permettant l’accès sans passer par un centre commercial peuvent demeurer ouverts.

Aidez nos aînés à rester chez eux, par exemple en faisant leur épicerie
Il faut intensifier nos efforts, a indiqué le premier ministre. Selon M. Legault, on ne le répétera jamais assez : il est important que les personnes âgées et les personnes à risque demeurent chez elles.

Le premier ministre a fait appel aux Québécois et aux proches qui les entourent afin qu’ils les aident, notamment en leur livrant l’épicerie ou d’autres biens. Rappelons que les personnes de 70 ans et les personnes ayant une condition les rendant plus à risque en cas d’infection à la COVID-19 ne doivent courir aucun risque, en restant à domicile.

Rappel des directives de la santé publique
M. Legault a rappelé que les directives de la santé publique sont claires :

Si vous avez des symptômes, restez à la maison et isolez-vous.
Même si vous n’avez pas de symptômes, vous pouvez être porteur du virus ; évitez donc tous les déplacements – à l’étranger et entre les régions – qui ne sont pas nécessaires.
Lavez souvent vos mains avec du savon.
Évitez les contacts physiques, notamment en respectant une distance de 2 mètres avec les autres.
Respectez l’interdiction de visiter les maisons de personnes âgées, sauf pour des raisons humanitaires sérieuses.
Le premier ministre a également invité toutes les personnes qui ressentent des symptômes à dire la vérité. « C’est important de dire la vérité pour ne pas mettre la vie des autres en danger, a-t-il fait savoir. Plus vite l’ensemble des Québécois se conformeront à ces consignes, plus vite le Québec sortira de l’état d’urgence. »

Équipements en quantité suffisante
Concernant les équipements, le premier ministre a réitéré que les mesures sont prises afin de disposer de quantités suffisantes pour les prochaines semaines. Des discussions sont en cours avec le gouvernement fédéral ainsi qu’avec des distributeurs et manufacturiers provinciaux, nationaux et internationaux pour s’assurer que tous les équipements nécessaires soient disponibles pour la suite de la crise. Des entreprises québécoises ont d’ailleurs été sollicitées pour fabriquer certains équipements, au cas où des commandes d’ailleurs seraient annulées.

Finalement, François Legault a de nouveau souhaité remercier tous les travailleurs du réseau de la santé, notamment les éducatrices qui prennent soin des enfants de nos anges gardiens. « L’esprit de collaboration et de solidarité qui règne au Québec depuis plusieurs jours est extraordinaire », s’est réjoui le premier ministre.

Citations :
« Tout ce que nous avons fait au Québec depuis 10 jours va faire une différence, mais nous devons absolument intensifier nos efforts. Toutes nos mesures visent à ralentir la propagation du virus.

À compter de minuit et une minute dans la nuit de mardi à mercredi, tous les services et toutes les activités économiques non essentiels au Québec devront s’arrêter. Le premier ministre a demandé à toutes les organisations qui peuvent fermer dès aujourd’hui de le faire, en soulignant que le télétravail pourra continuer et que les fermetures concernent les lieux physiques.

Pour consulter la liste des services et activités commerciales essentiels, veuillez consulter le site internet Québec.ca/coronavirus This hyperlink will open in a new window.. M. Legault a assuré que la situation sera quotidiennement réévaluée.

Le premier ministre a appelé les chefs d’entreprises et tous les entrepreneurs à profiter de cette pause pour préparer le redémarrage du Québec. Il faudra notamment qu’ils mettent en place des mesures de précaution pour les travailleurs dès la reprise des activités.

Augmentation des cas confirmés
François Legault a indiqué que le Québec entre dans une nouvelle phase dans sa bataille contre le coronavirus, soit celle d’une transmission communautaire. En date du dimanche 22 mars, à 21 h, il y avait 628 cas de personnes testées positives, 45 personnes sont hospitalisées et 20 sont aux soins intensifs. Le bilan des décès demeure inchangé, soit 4.

L’augmentation soudaine des cas découle du fait que la Direction de la santé publique a modifié sa façon de compiler les données, en considérant dorénavant les cas probables qui avaient été identifiés au cours des derniers jours comme des cas confirmés.

Confinement obligatoire pour les personnes âgées en résidences
Le premier ministre a également annoncé que, dorénavant, toutes les sorties des résidences de personnes aînées sont interdites, sauf sous supervision. Cette nouvelle directive, qui s’applique autant au privé qu’au public, est nécessaire pour rassurer les autres résidents de ces résidences et pour éviter que le virus n’entre dans ces établissements. Les visites demeurent interdites.

Pour rassurer nos aînés, le ministère de la Santé mettra en place un service afin de venir en aide à ceux n’ayant pas de proches ou ne disposant pas d’autres moyens pour faire leur épicerie et leurs achats essentiels. Aucune personne aînée ne manquera de nourriture.

François Legault a tenu à ajouter que, bien que les personnes âgées soient plus à risque que d’autres de conséquences graves, toute la population, peu importe l’âge, doit se plier aux exigences de la santé publique. « On doit tous suivre les consignes. Tout le monde », a-t-il martelé, en rappelant l’importance d’éviter les déplacements qui ne sont pas absolument nécessaires, que ce soit d’un quartier à l’autre, d’une ville à l’autre, d’une région à l’autre, et même d’une province à l’autre.

Dans 50 ans, nos enfants raconteront comment le peuple québécois était uni et comment, ensemble, on a gagné la bataille de notre vie ! »

Le premier ministre du Québec, François Legault, y est allé d’un message d’espoir, mercredi, alors que deux décès supplémentaires liés au coronavirus sont survenus au cours des 24 dernières heures, portant le bilan total des décès à six. M. Legault a offert, au nom du gouvernement du Québec, ses sincères condoléances aux familles et aux proches de ces personnes.

François Legault a rappelé que la partie est loin d’être gagnée et qu’il est essentiel que tous gardent leurs bonnes habitudes.

Avertissement aux « snowbirds » : vous devez vous isoler
Le premier ministre a profité de son point de presse quotidien pour lancer un avertissement à tous les « snowbirds » qui arrivent de Floride ou d’ailleurs à l’étranger : « Vous devez vous isoler pour 14 jours. C’est très sérieux. Vous êtes à risque et vous risquez de propager le virus. C’est très important de ne pas sortir de la maison », a déclaré le premier ministre.

Appel aux propriétaires de logements à être conciliants pour le paiement du loyer du mois d’avril
M. Legault a également demandé aux propriétaires de logements locatifs d’être conciliants et de faire preuve de patience pour le paiement du loyer. Plusieurs Québécois sont inquiets financièrement après avoir perdu leur emploi et leur source de revenus dans les derniers jours. « Notre priorité, c’est de s’assurer que tout le monde soit capable de manger et de se loger », a indiqué le premier ministre.

1 339 cas confirmés
Le premier ministre a dressé le plus récent bilan des cas de contamination à la COVID‑19 confirmés. En date du 24 mars 2020, à 21 h, 1 339 personnes étaient infectées au Québec. On dénombrait 78 hospitalisations, dont 35 personnes aux soins intensifs. « Bien qu’on déplore deux décès supplémentaires, le nombre relativement faible d’hospitalisations et de cas aux soins intensifs est encourageant », a indiqué François Legault, qui demande toutefois aux Québécois de ne pas baisser les bras et de continuer à suivre attentivement les consignes de la santé publique.

Protéger nos anges gardiens
Depuis quelques jours, le nombre de tests administrés est à la hausse. Le réseau de la santé continue d’être mobilisé et de se préparer à tous les scénarios. M. Legault a précisé que toutes les précautions sont prises pour protéger le personnel de la santé. « Des ajustements doivent être faits pour la distribution du matériel entre les établissements de santé, mais le réseau dispose de tout l’équipement de protection nécessaire », a assuré le premier ministre.

Prendre soin des plus vulnérables
M. Legault a tenu à saluer tous les Québécois qui ont décidé d’aider les groupes communautaires et les banques alimentaires. Il a assuré que le gouvernement du Québec s’occupe des sans-abri et que des mesures sont prises pour que ces personnes plus vulnérables soient installées dans d’autres endroits sécuritaires.

Finalement, le premier ministre a adressé un merci spécial à tout le personnel qui nettoie et désinfecte nos établissements de santé et aussi tous les autres lieux. Leur tâche est plus importante que jamais et ces travailleurs font eux aussi partie de cette bataille contre le virus.

Citation :
« De plus en plus de personnes respectent les consignes, aident nos personnes vulnérables. Je suis tellement fier de la solidarité des Québécois. Mais il faut continuer. Il y a encore une période difficile à passer, mais ensuite, ça va bien aller. Nous sommes une armée de 8 millions et demi pour combattre le virus. Nous sommes en train de livrer la plus grande bataille collective de nos vies. C’est un combat pacifique, mais vital.

Une ordonnance de la santé publique sera en vigueur pour les régions et territoires suivants :

le Bas-Saint-Laurent ;
l’Abitibi-Témiscamingue ;
la Côte-Nord ;
le Nord-du-Québec ;
le Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean ;
la Gaspésie–Îles-de-la-Madeleine ;
le Nunavik ;
les Terres-Cries-de-la-Baie-James.
Ainsi, à partir de 16 h, aujourd’hui, seuls les déplacements essentiels vers ces territoires seront permis. Les points de contrôle policier seront installés sur les grands axes pour retourner vers leur région d’origine les gens qui ne respectent pas ce critère.

La ministre de la Sécurité publique, Geneviève Guilbault, a expliqué que cette mesure vise à protéger ces régions et territoires, qui dénombrent actuellement moins de cas positifs et dont les populations sont parfois plus vulnérables et plus isolées. En limitant ainsi les entrées et sorties, les autorités de santé publique ont confiance de pouvoir limiter et de prévenir davantage la propagation de la COVID-19.

Mme Guilbault a rappelé à tous les Québécois que tous les déplacements non essentiels entre les régions doivent être évités.

Points de contrôle aux abords des douanes américaines
À la suite de clarifications apportées par les autorités de santé publique du gouvernement fédéral, hier après-midi, il est dorénavant obligatoire pour toute personne qui revient de l’étranger de se placer en isolement pendant 14 jours, sans sortir de son domicile. Même une simple marche n’est plus permise pour ces personnes. Elles pourront sortir uniquement pour aller passer un test de dépistage en cas d’apparition de symptômes de la COVID-19.

Afin d’assurer l’application de cette directive, Geneviève Guilbault a indiqué que depuis 9 h samedi matin, des points de contrôle ont été mis en place le long de la frontière américaine. Les policiers y informent les personnes qui reviennent de voyage de leurs obligations, en plus d’établir un contact pour qu’un suivi soit ensuite effectué auprès d’elles.

Éviter un climat de suspicion
La vice-première ministre a invité les citoyens à faire preuve de vigilance et à signaler des situations qui mettent clairement en jeu la santé de la population, comme des rassemblements dans les parcs. Elle a toutefois appelé les citoyens à faire preuve de civisme et de ne pas faire appel aux forces de l’ordre sans raison valable.

« Il faut éviter qu’un climat de suspicion s’installe au Québec. N’appelez pas la police seulement parce qu’il y a une voiture de plus dans l’entrée de votre voisin. Ce n’est pas le temps des chicanes de voisins, au contraire. C’est le temps de rester unis pour surmonter cette épreuve ensemble », a-t-elle déclaré.

Mme Guilbault a tenu à remercier les policiers, les pompiers, les employés de la sécurité civile et des services correctionnels qui assurent la sécurité des Québécois au quotidien dans ces moments difficiles.

Bilan de la journée
Le Québec compte maintenant 2 498 cas confirmés de contagion à la COVID-19 et 164 personnes hospitalisées. La vice-première ministre a également eu le regret d’annoncer 4 morts supplémentaires au cours des dernières 24 h, portant le bilan des décès à 22. Au nom du gouvernement du Québec, Mme Guilbault a offert ses sincères condoléances aux familles et aux proches.

« Le bilan d’aujourd’hui nous montre qu’on doit plus que jamais continuer nos efforts pour freiner la propagation du virus. Je sais que c’est difficile d’entendre ça, mais ça nous rappelle que nous devons tous continuer de suivre scrupuleusement les consignes de la santé publique. Chaque geste compte pour sauver des vies », a-t-elle affirmé.

Citation :
« Nous vivons une situation difficile, mais c’est important de garder le moral. Nous sommes tous ensemble là-dedans, c’est important de s’encourager et de ne rien lâcher. La situation est plus difficile à Montréal et en Estrie en ce moment, mais malheureusement aucune région n’est à l’abri. Il faut protéger nos régions et territoires les plus à risque si jamais la propagation du virus devait les toucher plus durement. C’est ce que nous faisons aujourd’hui, avec des points de contrôle policier. Encore une fois, nous invitons les Québécois à rester dans la région où ils se trouvent présentement. Ce n’est pas le moment de quitter votre domicile, à moins que ce soit essentiel. Pour gagner cette bataille-là, il faut rester unis. On va passer à travers. »

Avec 4 611 cas confirmés de contagion à la COVID‑19, 33 décès et 307 personnes hospitalisées, dont 82 aux soins intensifs – aucune augmentation en 24 h –, la situation au Québec est sous contrôle et telle qu’elle a été anticipée.

Les efforts des dernières semaines ont permis au Québec de gagner un temps précieux et de se préparer à ce qui s’en vient. En effet, M. Legault a rappelé que plus de 6 000 lits ont été libérés dans le réseau de la santé pour faire de la place aux personnes atteintes du coronavirus et qui risquent d’être hospitalisées. De plus, le Québec est l’un des premiers États en Amérique du Nord à avoir fermé toutes les entreprises et tous les commerces qui ne sont pas essentiels, et l’un des endroits au monde qui, par habitant, a fait le plus de tests pour dépister rapidement les cas.

Le premier ministre a ajouté qu’au cours des prochains jours, le gouvernement dévoilera un scénario, le plus probable, concernant la progression du virus.

Équipements pour une semaine
Concernant le matériel de protection du personnel médical, plusieurs commandes sont arrivées hier et la situation s’améliore. « Aujourd’hui, le réseau dispose d’assez d’équipements pour une semaine », a assuré François Legault.

Dans les prochaines semaines, des entreprises québécoises seront même en mesure de fabriquer et de fournir du matériel.

Protéger nos aînés
Le premier ministre ne s’en est pas caché : la situation dans les résidences et centres pour personnes âgées est sérieuse. Il rappelle que nos aînés sont très vulnérables au virus et qu’il faut respecter plus que jamais les directives. « Quand on vous dit de ne pas faire de visites dans les résidences de personnes âgées, c’est sérieux. C’est une question de vie ou de mort », a résumé M. Legault.

Le gouvernement du Québec entend d’ailleurs offrir au personnel de résidences qui peuvent le faire de loger à l’hôtel pour éviter les risques de contagion à la maison.

Nouveaux contrôles routiers
Depuis ce matin, de nouveaux contrôles routiers pour limiter les déplacements d’une région à l’autre ont été ajoutés par la Sureté du Québec, notamment dans le nord de Lanaudière, des Laurentides, de la Mauricie et de l’Outaouais. Ils ont été établis pour protéger davantage de régions qui sont actuellement moins infectées. François Legault a réitéré que les déplacements non essentiels ne sont plus tolérés.

Le premier ministre en a profité pour lancer un avertissement aux personnes qui se rassemblent encore dans des endroits publics et aux entreprises et commerçants non essentiels toujours ouverts. « C’est illégal, mais c’est surtout irresponsable. Il y a des vies qui sont en jeu »,
a-t-il rappelé.

Merci aux conjointes et aux conjoints des travailleurs essentiels
M. Legault a réservé ses remerciements du jour à toutes les conjointes et à tous les conjoints qui soutiennent nos anges gardiens, tous les parents qui s’occupent de la maison pendant que l’autre donne des services essentiels aux Québécois.

« Merci de maintenir un peu de stabilité, un peu de normalité dans cette crise. Merci de soutenir vos conjoints et conjointes, de leur offrir du réconfort et de leur donner la force de servir les Québécois », leur a témoigné le premier ministre.

Accompagné du ministre de l’Économie et de l’Innovation, Pierre Fitzgibbon, François Legault a précisé que le gouvernement du Québec travaille déjà à la réouverture de nos entreprises afin de repartir progressivement l’économie à partir du 4 mai ou dès que les autorités de santé publique le recommanderont.

Pour le moment, tous les services et activités commerciales non essentiels demeurent fermés.

Lancement de l’initiative Le Panier Bleu pour l’achat local
Le ministre de l’Économie et de l’Innovation, Pierre Fitzgibbon, a profité du point de presse quotidien pour présenter aux Québécois une toute nouvelle plateforme numérique : Le Panier Bleu.

Le Panier Bleu est un regroupement sur le Web d’un maximum de produits et services locaux fabriqués, distribués et vendus par des entreprises de chez nous, dans chacune des régions du Québec. À partir de cette plateforme innovante, les Québécois pourront être redirigés vers les sites transactionnels des entreprises québécoises dans le but de soutenir celles affectées par l’urgence sanitaire.  

« Autant que possible, il faut acheter des produits québécois d’ici pour aider les entreprises québécoises et pour aider les travailleurs québécois. Le Panier Bleu va nous aider à le faire. Achetons québécois ! Achetons local ! » a invité M. Legault.

Le Québec, premier en Amérique du Nord en matière de confinement, selon Google
Le premier ministre a témoigné de toute sa fierté de voir le Québec se distinguer de tous les États en Amérique du Nord quant au respect de la consigne de rester chez soi.

En effet, selon une étude publiée par Google, l’endroit où cette directive est la plus respectée, c’est ici. « La distanciation physique, c’est l’arme la plus puissante qu’on a pour gagner la bataille, et les Québécois ont de quoi être fiers », a félicité M. Legault.

Suivre le plan du gouvernement
Avec 7 944 cas confirmés de contagion à la COVID-19 et un bilan de 94 décès, ce n’est pas le temps de relâcher nos efforts collectifs. « Le combat est loin d’être gagné. Nous entrons dans la période décisive de ce combat », a dit le premier ministre.

Il est impératif de suivre le plan fixé par le gouvernement du Québec et les autorités de santé publique :

Éviter tout déplacement non essentiel entre les régions, les villes et même les quartiers ;
Aucun déplacement non essentiel autorisé entre les régions où des points de contrôle policier sont en place ;
Rester chez soi, sauf en cas de nécessité ou d’exception ;
Respecter une distance de 2 mètres les uns des autres ;
Se laver les mains fréquemment avec du savon.
Merci aux entrepreneurs québécois
Le premier ministre, François Legault, et le ministre de l’Économie et de l’Innovation, Pierre Fitzgibbon, ont réservé leurs remerciements du jour à tous les entrepreneurs du Québec, ceux qui ont travaillé fort pour bâtir leur entreprise, qui ont fait de nombreux sacrifices. M. Legault a assuré que le gouvernement fera tout en son possible pour les aider à repartir.

« Pour finir d’aplanir la courbe, pour sauver le maximum de vies, nous devons prolonger la pause jusqu’au 4 mai prochain. Nous espérons repartir l’économie dans quelques semaines. J’insiste toutefois sur une chose : si on relâche nos efforts, on va juste retarder le moment où on va pouvoir retrouver nos vies. La bataille n’est pas finie. En fait, on entre dans la période décisive de notre combat contre le virus. Chaque geste compte plus que jamais. Chaque geste permet de sauver des vies. »

François Legault, premier ministre du Québec

« Je sais à quel point la situation actuelle est difficile pour plusieurs entrepreneurs et entreprises du Québec.

Dès maintenant, on achète local ! »

« La situation dans les établissements et centres d’hébergement pour personnes âgées, publics comme privés, est la plus alarmante », a reconnu M. Legault, en assurant que des infirmières et des médecins y sont envoyés en renfort afin de protéger davantage nos aînés, trop nombreux à être affectés par la COVID-19 et déjà fragiles devant la maladie. « C’est vraiment ma priorité », a assuré François Legault.

Pas de rassemblements physiques à l’occasion de Pâques
Alors que la fête de Pâques est à nos portes, le premier ministre a rappelé aux Québécois qu’aucun rassemblement physique, intérieur comme extérieur, n’est permis. Ce principe est le même pour toutes les personnes, peu importe leur religion. M. Legault a demandé à tous les leaders des différentes communautés de passer le message.

« Je sais que ça fait partie des traditions que de se rassembler à l’église, à la synagogue ou en famille. Cette année, on ne doit avoir AUCUN rassemblement physique. Ce n’est pas le temps pour faire des partys de famille. On peut célébrer ensemble, mais à distance, par téléphone, par vidéo. Soyons clairs : tous les rassemblements sont interdits », a ajouté M. Legault, catégorique.

Point sur l’inventaire de réactif
Le premier ministre a indiqué que la situation est stable en ce qui a trait aux équipements de protection pour le personnel de la santé. La préoccupation actuelle est autour du matériel pour faire les tests, notamment le réactif nécessaire pour l’analyse. Le réseau en dispose d’assez pour la prochaine semaine. Le gouvernement travaille fort pour obtenir plus de réactif au cours des prochains jours.

M. Legault a aussi souligné que, selon le dernier bilan, le nombre de personnes aux soins intensifs se stabilise. Bien que ce soit un signe encourageant, la bataille n’est pas gagnée et il ne faut pas baisser la garde.

Précisions sur le port du masque
Le premier ministre a précisé que le port d’un masque peut effectivement réduire les risques de donner le virus, mais il ne faut pas qu’il vienne remplacer des mesures plus efficaces, comme le fait de toujours rester à 2 mètres des autres personnes et de se laver les mains avec du savon. Les masques doivent en priorité être destinés à nos anges gardiens dans le réseau de la santé. « Nous ne sommes pas contre le port du masque. Il faut juste être conscient de ses limites », a dit François Legault.

Essential services will be maintained and provided in accordance with the provincial government's directives.

Quick facts

●	Over the past few weeks, Gatineau has been preparing a contingency plan for the COVID-19 pandemic. This plan aims to maintain the human resources needed to ensure essential services to the public in the event of confinement.
●	In its instructions, the Government of Quebec used the concept of resources deemed essential by municipal organizations. Thus, the Province is giving municipalities the latitude to determine what they consider essential services.
●	In accordance with the Province's instructions, Gatineau identified the resources that will ensure the delivery of services deemed essential.
●	Thus, essential services will remain operational in all concerned municipal departments.
●	The services to the public that will be maintained, include:
- trash collection;
- the production of drinking water;
- wastewater treatment;
- fire services;
- police services;
- the emergency calls centre (911);
- the non-emergency calls centre (311); and
- the maintenance of municipal vehicles and infrastructures, including sewer and water supply systems.

This list of essential services will vary over time, as the situation evolves.
●	In order to respect the standards set by the Province, Gatineau is notifying the public that certain operations will be adapted:
- Pothole repairs will be slowed down given the limited availability of asphalt, as contractors' supply lines have been interrupted. The priority will be on the major arteries that require urgent intervention, and will be done with cold asphalt.
- The ecocentre on rue Pierre-Ménard will remain open for urgent needs. It should be noted that materials must be sorted. No bulky items will be accepted. As well, social distancing will have to be maintained.
- The ecocentre in the Hull sector will close today at 4 p.m.
- The on-demand home collection service for reusable bulky items will be suspended.
- The sale of tagged overflow bags will be suspended. This stems from the interruption of suppliers' operations further to the Provincial instructions. As an exception, the public will be able to use other plastic bags for any surplus garbage. In addition to the contents of the gray bins, a maximum of five bags will be accepted per collection.
- The bin repair and delivery service will be suspended. The public will have to dispose of residual materials (compost, recycling, trash) in dedicated bags until the service resumes.
●	The public is invited to use the following online services:
- consultation and payment of municipal taxes;

2020-03-31,Canada,Quebec,Gatineau,2.0,1.0,,Government Website,"Gatineau, March 31, 2020. – In order to comply with the Government's instructions on measures to reduce the propagation of COVID-19, Gatineau has had to cancel its spring culture and recreation program.

Quick facts

●	Gatineau's focus is first and foremost on public health and on complying with the Government's decisions.
●	Schools will not reopen before May 1. The centre sportif, libraries and pools remains closed until further notice.
●	As of March 15, Gatineau had already cancelled registrations for activities, without knowing whether it would be possible to resume the season.
●	It is now impossible to resume the season because it takes at least 30 days before activities can start, which would bring us to the end of it.
●	In addition, given that the swimming programs requires a minimum of six classes to pass a level, it is impossible to cut back the length of a session.
●	As a result of this cancellation, Gatineau has no choice but to reduce its staff.
- Thus, it will temporarily lay off 400 casual employees and 175 indeterminate employees in the aquatics sector.
- It is estimated that these temporary lay-offs are an exceptional measure due to the current situation with COVID-19.
●	It should be noted that this is a temporary lay-off, and all affected employees maintain their employment contract with Gatineau.
●	The lay-offs are effective April 11, 2020, and the individuals in questions will continue to be paid until that time.
●	Gatineau may recall those employees depending on resumption of municipal activities, eventual requirements and public health instructions.
●	Gatineau is taking this situation seriously, and is aware that its decision will have financial repercussions for the individuals concerned.
●	Gatineau will provide the people who are laid off any information they need to obtain income replacement benefits or monetary compensation from the Government.
●	Gatineau is continuing to work closely with the union locals on managing the situation and in anticipation of the resumption of activities.
●	As a reminder, the spring session was scheduled to take place from April 4 to May 29.
●	In regard to the next session, Gatineau is currently reviewing the situation and will make its decisions as the opportune time.",Ville de Gatineau,Government of Quebec,COVID-19 – CANCELLATION OF THE SPRING SESSION OF THE CULTURE AND RECREATION PROGRAM,https://www.gatineau.ca/portail/default.aspx?p=nouvelles_annonces/communiques/communique_2015&id=-474617114,2.0,1.0,,,,,,,,2.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At a glance:

●	The purpose of this new measure is to restrict non-essential travel between provinces and regions out of public health concerns, as announced in the instructions issued by the Province.
●	At the checkpoints, police will assess on a case by case basis whether or not the travel is essential, for instance:
- to get to work if teleworking is not an option;
- for medical appointments or care; or
- for humanitarian reasons.
●	The checkpoints are located at the:
- Masson-Angers ferry;
- Alexandra Bridge;
- Portage Bridge;
- Chaudières Bridge;
- Champlain Bridge.
●	Additional checkpoints may be added as the situation evolves.
●	The checkpoints will operate on a sporadic basis.
●	The SPVG urges the public to cooperate by respecting this new health measure introduced by the Government of Quebec. It is important to comply with the measures imposed, which are evolving day by day.
●	As you know, people who show symptoms, have travelled or have been in close contact with a person showing symptoms are not permitted to leave their home.
●	The SPVG prefers to rely on promoting public information and awareness.
- The aim is to reinforce the messages issued by government authorities and to encourage the public's cooperation.
- Although the SPVG prefers an approach based on community persuasion, its officers are prepared to turn to more coercive measures with people who refuse to cooperate.
- Fines may be imposed on people who refuse to cooperate. Under the Public Health Act, the police have the option of imposing fines ranging from $1,000 to $6,000.
- The police maintain their usual powers, and charges laid during an intervention will have the same legal consequences (i.e. criminal offence).
●	The SPVG would like to remind everyone that 911 calls should be reserved for emergencies, and not used to request information about government instructions and their application.

This is why the Service de police de la Ville de Gatineau (SPVG) is reaching out to the public and launching an awareness campaign in support of vulnerable people.
At a glance

●        Given the current need for social isolation, when people are asked to limit contact with family and close friends and remain at home to reduce the risk of propagation of COVID-19, some people find themselves in danger in their own homes:
- children at risk of mistreatment, assault or exploitation;
- victims of domestic abuse; and
- seniors vulnerable to abuse and mistreatment.
●        To that end, the SPVG is calling on the public for neighbours to keep their eyes and ears open and report any behaviour, physical or psychological violence or neglect that they may be concerned about.
●        In the current circumstances, it is imperative that Gatineau residents look out for one another.
●        The SPVG is posting images of the campaign on its Web site where everyone can access them, and invites everyone to share them throughout their community. Organizations and businesses can also help by sharing them throughout their networks. The poster and images can be downloaded from www.gatineau.ca/portail/default.…
●        The SPVG is also working with outreach agencies and local partners to deploy the campaign and reach the greatest possible number of people.

The clinic offers various services, including patient evaluation and testing. The clinic is accessible by appointment only.

If you think you have COVID-19 infection, call Info-Santé at 811 first. A nurse will assess your situation and recommend what to do next. If a medical consultation in a specialized COVID-19 clinic is required, the Info-Santé nurse will book an appointment for you. If your state of health indicates that you require hospitalization, the Jewish General (adults) and Sainte-Justine’s (children) are the hospitals designated to treat confirmed cases.

Specialized COVID-19 clinic
The specialized COVID-19 clinic, located in the former emergency room of the old Hôtel-Dieu hospital, is a complementary measure for cases that are not serious. The specialized clinic is designed to support hospitals, family medicine clinics and public health teams. It will curb overcrowding in emergency departments and prevent sick people from going to medical clinics.

At the specialized clinic, strict preventive measures are in place to protect staff, users and the general population. Individuals are checked upon entering the clinic and steps have been taken to safely transport users.

What you need to remember
The clinic is accessible by appointment only. People who have returned from a trip and think they have symptoms of COVID-19 must call 811.
Other clinics will open in other regions of Québec in the next few days, including two more in Montréal. Steps are being taken to identify two new sites, one in the east end and the other in the west end of Montréal.
À retenir
D’autres cliniques ouvriront partout au Québec dans les prochains jours, dont bientôt deux de plus à Montréal. Des démarches sont en cours dans l’est et l’ouest de l’Île pour identifier deux nouveaux lieux.
La clinique est sur rendez-vous seulement. Les personnes qui reviennent de voyage et pensent avoir des symptômes du COVID-19 doivent communiquer avec le 811.

The school, Collège International Marie de France, announced late Tuesday that a high school student may have contracted the virus.

The school is a private French college, catering to French expatriates, according to its website. It offers elementary to college-level instruction. On the advice of the French consulate in Quebec and the French ambassador to Canada, the school said it was postponing all of its secondary school classes - called premiere, seconde and terminale in the French lycee system - until the student's test returns.

The closure begins immediately, on Wednesday, March 11.

""All of the other class levels remain active and all hygiene measures are being taken to welcome your children in an appropriate environment,"" the school's statement reads. 

If the student tests negative for COVID-19, classes will resume, the school adds. If the test comes back positive, the college will remain shut for 14 days.

Accordingly, we are expending all the necessary effort to ensure that everyone feels safe inside our facilities and doing our part to limit the spread of the virus,” declared the Mayor of Saint-Laurent, Alan DeSousa. “We are implementing these measures out of consideration for the well-being of our 105,000 residents, of course, and also for that of roughly the same number of workers at our 4000 or so places of businesses,” he continued. Preventive measures and concrete actions: With respect to public hygiene, the Saint-Laurent administration has increased its sanitation workforce. Accordingly, employees have been assigned to the systematic and continuous cleaning of reception areas. Other special measures also apply to high-traffic venues including Borough Hall, the libraries, the Centre des loisirs and the Complexe sportif. Since each person can help to effectively limit the spread of the virus by using basic hygiene techniques and good habits, reminder posters have been installed in common spaces and washrooms. Front-line Borough employees will receive training and daily reminders about appropriate procedures to follow. Appeal to the business community: Due to the high number of workers that make up the Saint-Laurent business community and the economic weight it represents for Québec as a whole, the Mayor of Saint-Laurent is also urging companies on the territory to launch their back-up business continuity plans to ensure that operations continue to run smoothly. Additional prevention measures are expected for all businesses and restaurants in Saint-Laurent. In vigilance mode: The Borough will continue to closely monitor the situation and invites its residents to do the same and learn the provincial and federal government recommendations.

According to provincial health authorities, 17 cases are now confirmed in Quebec, along with 266 people “under investigation” and 798 cases that have turned up negative.

The English Montreal School Board (EMSB) reacted to Thursday’s downpour of cancellations with the following statement: “To give ourselves some time to reflect upon the directives given to us by the Quebec government and to provide a little more time for the EMSB to review protocols, we now wish to inform you that all schools and centres will be closed on Friday, March 13, 2020.” The EMSB says its central head office will remain open and that the board’s principals will work from home and remain on standby to communicate with the head office.

After Thursday’s message saying they will remain open, the Lester B. Pearson School Board  (LBPSB) changed course and cancelled its schools today as well.

“We wish to apologize at the outset of this message for its lateness, but the current situation with regards to COVID-19 is changing rapidly,” reads the website statement. “The LBPSB has made the decision to close all of its Schools, Centres, and Daycares (including the Head Office Daycare) for tomorrow, Friday, March 13.”

Chairman, Board of Directors of the MUHC",McGill University Health Centre,,NOTICE TO MUHC COMMUNITY,https://muhc.ca/news-and-patient-stories/news/notice-muhc-community,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,1.0,,Government Website,"Following the announcement regarding the City of Montréal’s decision to close its public places, the STM wants to remind everyone that the métro and bus networks remain open and are operating normally. The risk of transmission on public transit remains low.

In accordance with the recommendations of authorities issued today, the STM is requesting, whenever possible, that its customers ask for greater flexibility from their employers in organizing work schedules to allow trips to take place outside of peak periods. It is important that anyone experiencing symptoms contact 1 877 644-4545 and avoid using public transit. Frequent handwashing and cough etiquette are the best individual protection strategies.

Increased cleaning
As a precaution, the STM has reviewed and accelerated its cleaning procedures, ensuring increased cleaning frequency of trains, buses (including paratransit vehicles) and stations. The following new measures have been implemented:

Daily cleaning of the most used surfaces in stations (e.g., handrails, fare vending machines, elevators)
Daily cleaning of grab rails and poles on trains in operation 
Disinfection of poles, straps and handles on buses, with dedicated resources at each bus garage and on all shifts (day, evening, night)
A special page regarding COVID-19 is available on our website (stm.info/coronavirus), and the SIRTA system for paratransit users also specifies the measures in place.

Measures for employees
Employees are asked to follow the same health protection guidelines as customers. The STM will also distribute individual disinfecting solutions to its employees in close contact with the public. Moreover, the STM is requesting that large staff meetings be avoided as much as possible. Large internal corporate events are cancelled until further notice. Also, the STM is prohibiting all business and personal travel outside Quebec.

Teamwork
The STM is taking the situation seriously. It continues to work closely with Quebec public health authorities and is actively taking part in the City of Montréal’s civil security CCMU. The STM is urging customers to follow the applicable prevention measures and to work with it in an effort to deal with the situation.",Société de transport de Montréal,,COVID-19 – The STM remains vigilant,http://stm.info/en/press/press-releases/2020/covid-19---the-stm-remains-vigilant,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2020-03-14,Canada,Quebec,Montreal,2.0,0.0,,Accredited News Agency,"In an email sent from Deputy Provost Fabrice Labeau at 9:15 p.m., the University announced that “All classes, teaching labs, exams and other assessments are suspended for two weeks – except theses defenses.” McGill will be working on resuming teaching and academic activities online during this time.

While food services in residences will remain open, a number of other food options on campus may be closed during the next two weeks, or open with reduced hours.

Additionally, the Wellness Hub will remain closed over this coming week, but may attempt to move online after. Athletics facilities and libraries will be closed until March 30.

Due to the governmental change in classification of all outside countries as “Level 3,” McGill is recalling ALL students abroad. These students are expected to receive additional information soon, including information about academic accommodations. It is unclear at this time if McGill will be financially compensating students abroad for unexpected travel due to COVID-19.

—Original article published on Saturday, March 14, 7:30 p.m.—

In the last 72 hours, Quebecers have received a myriad of instructions from the provincial government meant to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19. At around 11:45 a.m. on Thursday, March 12, Quebec premier Francois Legault informed the public of these measures, including the barring of all indoor events with more than 250 people in attendance, the mandatory self-quarantine of all employees (in both the private and public sectors) in the health and education systems for 14 days upon return from abroad, and the request that those who have returned from other countries recently – or have flu-like symptoms – voluntarily self-isolate for two weeks.

McGill Campus Closures

Less than 24 hours later on Friday, March 13, the province announced new measures – all universities, CEGEPs, schools, and daycare centres are set to be closed for two weeks starting on March 14. Upon this announcement, McGill University sent out an email informing the community that “all student travel outside Canada for internships, student exchanges, international mobility programs, competitions or conferences is suspended until further notice” and that intake of new international students will be suspended for the time being. The exact status of future and incoming international students is unclear at this time.

In an additional administrative email sent on Saturday, March 14, Deputy Provost Fabrice Labeau confirmed that all in-person events at McGill, both on- and off-campus are canceled. Campus libraries and athletic facilities will be closed until Tuesday, March 17. The Student Wellness Hub will also be closed – and subsequently all pre-booked clinic appointments canceled – between March 15-21, as per the latest information students have received via email.

Though the details of the two-week closure have not been officially communicated to students, there are conflicting reports at this time as to what the structure of classes will be. Some professors have posted online modules and lectures, but others are claiming that no new materials or assignments will be introduced while classes are cancelled. A March 14 email from Deputy Provost Labeau stated that “the University is suspending all teaching activities until further notice.” It is unclear at this time what that means for assignments due in the next week, or if online materials will be available.

The most recent measures the provincial government announced on Saturday, March 14 include the banning of all visits to public senior homes and the request that all those who are elderly or immunocompromised avoid all non-essential outings, among other instructions.

The Status of McGill Students Abroad

For McGill students on exchange, the last couple of days have been uncertain. According to an email received by students studying abroad on Friday, those in the only countries that had been previously classified as “Level 3” (“avoid non-essential travel”) by the Canadian government – Iran, Italy, and China – had been recalled by McGill. Students in countries that had been labeled “Level 1 and 2” were told they would receive more information in the next few days. However, on Saturday, March 14, the Canadian government announced that all countries outside of Canada are to be classified as “Level 3.” As of 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, students abroad have not received updates from McGill.

The initial email received by students encouraged McGill students in those countries to leave their institution abroad and return home if they are concerned for their safety. For students that opt to leave, McGill Abroad had instructed them to inform their host institution, as well as McGill, and to ask the former about remote studying options.

William von Herff, a McGill student who was studying abroad for the Panama Field Study Semester, has left the country due to the virus’ quick spread. The number of cases in Panama has risen steadily in the past few days; the first death from COVID-19 was recorded on Tuesday, March 10, and as of March 13, the country has 36 confirmed cases of infection, three of whom are foreigners.

“The country has only 100 respirators and was down to 30 available as of yesterday,” von Herff told the Daily in a message on Friday, March 13. “We were recalled so as to not endanger ourselves nor put a burden on the Panamanian healthcare system.” The country has 2.3 hospital beds per 1,000 people, fewer than both Canada and Italy.

Von Herff thanks the program coordinator, Catherine Potvin, for the quick turnaround in getting students out of the country. Thanks to Potvin, he said, students returning to Montreal will be group-quarantined in Mont Saint-Hilaire, and once in isolation they will receive two days of groceries and three catered days of meals from McGill.

“[Potvin] is trying to get McGill to pay for some flight stuff, and if not, leftover program money will cover it,” he added.

For Sarah Gao, a McGill student on exchange at the University of Sydney in Australia, classes are still taking place in-person. If the situation escalates, however, Gao says that the University will consider a switch to online courses.

“It feels a little bit surreal because I’ve been seeing wash your hand signs everywhere since I first arrived [on February 9, 2020],” she told the Daily in a message on Friday, March 13. According to Gao, one of the student residences has shut down in order to quarantine international students who are just arriving.

“I think that students panicking and blaming McGill […] is causing more panic and more anger and so I’m just trying to stay as calm as possible and trust that they’re going to figure something out,” she concluded. Australia has reached over 200 confirmed cases of COVID-19, as of March 14, 2020, with 112 cases in New South Wales, where Gao’s university is located. There are reports that the number of testing kits available is “rapidly deteriorating.” The country’s ratio for the number of hospital beds per 1,000 people is 4.0.

Another student on exchange in the U.K. has similar thoughts. “Many of my peers are angry at McGill for not reaching out earlier, but many others (including myself) are not,” they told the Daily on Friday. “It must be very difficult for an administration with a massive body of international students to keep track of whose home country is issuing a travel ban, and whose home country is locking down entirely.”

Other students are much more concerned and dissatisfied with McGill’s response, especially in light of the change in travel levels for all countries outside Canada. The past few days have seen a flurry of social media posts from students abroad, confused as to what next steps they should take, considering that every student is now in what classifies as a Level 3 country.

In a phone interview with the Daily on Friday, March 13, SSMU President Bryan Buraga also spoke to the status of the administration’s communication with exchange students, stating that the University “is crafting plans for how best to move forward, because so many students […] are spread throughout the world.”

Though he expressed that McGill acknowledges that “each student [abroad] requires different ways of dealing with the situation,” and that there are a variety of possibilities and solutions depending on the student’s region, communication to exchange students remains general and not region-specific.

“Depending on the situation, it’s not like all of the facts can be applied widely to all students,” he said, “which is why there hasn’t been more information being sent out at the moment.”

Communications and Services

Buraga emphasized that this is a “rapidly evolving situation.” Admitting that this is a difficult time for students, he detailed his liaisons with the University administration. Speaking to the delay in communications from them, Buraga said that “because the situation changes on a daily basis, plans are being recruited to comply with government directives and regulations.”

In meetings with Deputy Provost Labeau, Buraga was told that the administration is working to ensure that “contingency plans are in place”, and that the University is “relying on the expert guidance of the Quebec Health Authority.”

“I ask the student body to be patient and to trust […] that both the SSMU and the University are working to ensure the health and safety of students,” he said. “This is, again, a very difficult time. But I know the McGill community, I know the goodness that’s in everyone – so I trust that we can all get through this together.”

According to one student in residence, members of McGill security have broken up “gatherings of any kind” in common spaces and told students to go back to their rooms, despite this not being officially mandated in any email communications. Per online communications to residents and Residence Life employees, programming is suspended until further notice, though Floor Fellows are mandated to stay on duty in residence. Students in residence have been told that McGill will not ask anyone to leave campus, and that those who are advised to self-quarantine will be provided an isolated space to do so.

MSERT will no longer be posted regularly in each residence, but is shifting to coverage in residences on a day-by-day basis, and they are updating their schedules online. They can still be reached at their regular emergency dispatch number, but recommend that students call the COVID-19 hotline (1-877-644-4545) instead if they are experiencing flu-like symptoms.

There have been more than 132,000 cases of the virus in the world, with more than 200 in Canada and more than 20 in Quebec, as of Saturday, March 14.

CORRECTION: A previous version of this article stated that SSMU President Bryan Buraga’s understanding was that incoming international students’ would not be able to attend in the upcoming fall semester until further notice.

Concordia said students are being asked to leave because it is difficult to maintain social-distancing measures while living in close quarters.

The university said its residences team is working with students to “assist in this transition” but that students must be packed up and out by end of the week.

“I want to be very clear students who can’t return home will be accommodated and that means they will get somewhere to stay and meals,” university spokesperson Vannina Maestracci said.

This change takes into account a major decrease in ridership, essential workers’ transportation needs and workforce planning. It is a temporary measure that will make it possible to ensure the continuity of services, as well as the safety of our customers and employees. These measures are constantly evolving, and will be adjusted according to our customers’ changing needs and the status of our networks. The STM therefore has the flexibility to conduct its operations and add service periodically with backup trains or buses, if necessary.

The digital information tools available for customers will reflect these changes as accurately as possible.


Regular bus network
Since ridership on buses has dropped by nearly 75%, the service offered during peak periods will be reduced on average by 20%, compared with the same period last year, while maintaining access throughout the Island of Montréal. This corresponds approximately to the level of service offered during the summer, with a few targeted improvements. The transportation needs of essential workers, in particular service to major healthcare institutions, have been taken into account, and a careful analysis of ridership on routes was conducted to pinpoint opportunities for adjustments, without increasing load levels aboard vehicles whenever possible.

Measures being implemented include:

A decrease in high-frequency lines, including the “10 minutes max” lines, when ridership observed on these lines allows it
Adjustments to lines serving the exo train stations, to take into account the decrease in commuter train service
Postponement of mitigation measures planned for the REM work
Elimination or significant reduction of services not currently in use, namely the navettes Or shuttles, bus lines for schools, and routes serving the Casino and Jean-Drapeau Park
A decrease in service on line 747
Métro network
Given that the number of customers going through the métro turnstiles has dropped by over 80%, service offered during peak periods will also be reduced by 20%.

The frequency of train departures will be decreased on average from 3 min 20 to 4 min 05 for the Orange and Green lines. Service offered on the Blue and Yellow lines remains unchanged. Please note that the métro’s operating hours also remain unchanged.

Paratransit
Paratransit service has been adjusted according to demand, which has dropped by 85%. Several safety measures are already in place to protect our customers and drivers, including increased cleaning operations and a limit of one customer per minibus or taxi.


Staying informed

Public health authorities on Sunday ordered the 4,000-person Tosh community of Boisbriand, Que., to be placed under 14-day quarantine. The group’s leadership has asked police to help enforce the directive.

Tosh leaders agree with authorities that strict measures need to be taken to stop the spread of COVID-19 in the community, even if only a small number of members have so far tested positive, the region’s public health director told reporters Monday.

Dr. Eric Goyer said he did not take the decision lightly to place the community under quarantine.

“It’s maybe the most difficult decision of my life … but it’s really to protect the members of the community and the members of the (larger) community living around them,” Goyer said.

“Restricting individual liberties is not something I like to do, but I want to provide the best protection to the members of the community, particularly the seniors.”

So far about 15 Tosh members have tested positive for COVID-19, Goyer said, adding they likely picked up the virus while travelling to New York State two weeks ago to celebrate a religious holiday. The number of positive cases is expected to rise, he said.

Boisbriand’s Tosh community, located in the greater Montreal area, is composed of many large families, which often have between six and eight children, Goyer said.

Boisbriand Mayor Marlene Cordato said Monday the order extends to about 100 families that live in town but outside the official quarantined area where most of the Tosh community is located.

“The community is fully co-operating with us, they themselves are following up on the orders that were given yesterday,” Goyer said.

Tosh members are manning a checkpoint leading into the community with the help of municipal police to ensure the quarantine is respected.

Francis Lanouette, chief of the Therese-de-Blainville police, said another main road leading into the area where the majority of the community lives is blocked off.

“We sat down with the community, and with them, we established a plan to do what is needed to be done so that people would be abiding by the public health order,” Lanouette told reporters Monday.

There’s a small grocery store and butcher within the quarantined area and Goyer said contingencies are underway to get anything else to people that need it.

Community leaders have had to translate public health directives into Yiddish as many members don’t speak English or French and eschew TV and radio.

“I can tell you they are doing a lot more than other communities in attempting to stop the spread of the virus,” Goyer said.

On Friday, Quebec's director of criminal and penal prosecutions (DPCP) authorized the two police forces to issue abridged statements of offence, with expected fines of $1,000 for indoor and outdoor gatherings.

The DPCP said they would not rule out extending the authorization to other police forces in the province. “Before allowing it we must make sure to put in place adequate logistics,” said spokesperson Jean Pascal Boucher. “It is available to the DPCP, it exists for other laws. We considered it opportune to act this way and make the decision now given the circumstances.” Before Saturday, police who intervened at a gathering could issue a general offence report, which would then be transferred to investigators and then the DPCP, who could decide whether to issue a fine between $1,000 and $6,000.

Boucher said the general offence report may still be used by police, but at least for the Service de police de la Ville de Montreal (SPVM), abridged statements are recommended.

“It will greatly facilitate our work, it will reduce the administrative burden,” said SPVM spokesperson Andre Durocher. “The way we're going to operate now is the same as if you contravened a traffic by-law or broke a municipal by-law in a park.”

Durocher said the fact the statements of offence will be given directly to offenders will have “a very dissuasive effect.” ",Quebec Director of Criminal and Penal Prosecutions ,Service de police de la Ville de Montreal,"COVID-19: Montreal, Quebec police can now directly fine physical distancing violators",https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/covid-19-montreal-quebec-police-can-now-directly-fine-physical-distancing-violators-1.4882791,2.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.0,0.0,,,,,,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,1.0,,,Government Website,"Montréal, in collaboration with the Direction régionale de santé publique, contributed to the launch of the French version of the Flatten.ca website, which collects real-time information regarding the spread of COVID-19 locally and across the country.

These measures are in line with the government of Québec decision to ban all indoor and outdoor gatherings.

Generally, instructions are being followed by the city's residents, who until now have shown much discipline and their full cooperation. However, the city must take additional measures, which are effective immediately. The sunny weather on Saturday, April 4, brought out many visitors to parc du Mont-Royal, including people from outside of the city. In addition, the SPVM had to intervene at the Lachine canal on Saturday. For this reason, the Atwater crossing is closed for an indefinite period. Lastly, the high foot traffic on île Notre-Dame resulted in people not sufficiently respecting social-distancing guidelines.

Note that we strongly advise you to avoid non-essential travel. Therefore, we encourage people to frequent the parks near their homes.

The Quartier Cavendish testing centre opened last month and initially focussed on testing people who had travelled in March or had come into contact with someone who had travelled during that period and were experiencing symptoms such as a dry cough, fever or difficulty breathing. The centre’s priorities shifted in April to focus on testing people working on the frontlines, people who were at risk of being hospitalized and people whose symptoms were becoming increasingly complicated. The communities of Côte-des-Neiges—Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and Côte-St-Luc make up one of Quebec’s hot spots for the novel coronavirus. According to statistics posted on the Santé Montréal website, the densely populated borough of CDN-NDG has recorded the highest number of confirmed cases on the island: 717 as of Thursday, and Côte-St-Luc, with a population of 32,000, has the highest rate of infection, with 286 confirmed cases.

The new, appointment-only COVID-19 clinic at the JGH site is staffed by family doctors who practice in the west-central sector of the city, along with staff from the Frontline Integrated Services Directorate. (The FISD handles Info-Santé and Info-Social PRAIDA and co-ordinates a long list of activities at clinics, family medicine groups and CLSCs as well a number of social outreach and health programs.)

In a prepared statement, Dr. Lawrence Rosenberg, who heads the CIUSSS West-Central Montreal, said the hospital parking lot was chosen because it was centrally located and “easily accessible to all the residents of the CIUSSS’s catchment area and offer(ed) real advantages in terms of continuity of care, particularly if someone needs to be hospitalized.”

Article content continued
It is not necessary to be registered with a family doctor or have a health insurance card to call for an appointment. People experiencing symptoms including fever, dry cough or difficulty breathing, or flu-like symptoms such as nausea or vomiting, are asked to call 1-877-644-4545. A medical professional will ask the caller a series of questions and determine whether a visit to the clinic is necessary.

Also, if a person has consulted a family doctor and the symptoms align, the doctor will refer the patient to the assessment clinic.

A similar assessment clinic was opened in Lachine recently to serve people living within the CIUSSS de-l’Ouest-de-l’Île-de-Montréal region.

City officials outlined their intervention plan on Wednesday after community groups called for more resources and testing in a borough that now has 1,153 confirmed cases. 

That's more than any other borough or municipality on the island, accounting for 10 per cent of the city's infections and representing a rate of 132 cases per 10,000 residents.

Montréal-Nord is one of the poorest districts in Montreal, with more than 20 per cent of residents living on a low income. Borough Mayor Christine Black said she recognizes how poverty exacerbates the challenge people already face in a pandemic.

In a statement Wednesday, she vowed the city will ""do everything to ensure the physical and psychological security of our citizens.""

Her administration is setting up a working group, made up of officials from the borough, Montreal public health, the regional health agency and La Table de quartier de Montréal-Nord — a coalition of community groups. Montréal-Nord should have been a priority much sooner given the already abysmal and well-known difficulties residents face in the area, say the letter's signatories.

To successfully open the economy in the borough, the groups said, city officials must first do more testing and be more transparent about data. The letter also calls for awareness campaigns and wider pedestrian corridors.

Conditions ripe for spread of coronavirus
With tight living spaces in Montréal-Nord, people go to parks and other public spaces to spread out, said Brunilda Reyes, who runs Les Fourchettes de l'Espoir — a non-profit group that works to feed those in need.

On top of that, many women of Haitian background who live in the borough work in CHSLDs and other seniors' residences, according to Christine Guay, who heads Impulsion-Travail, an organization that helps women find work.

""Culturally, they value themselves by taking care of others,"" she said. ""They are also very comfortable with the elderly, for whom they have sympathy and interest."" Indeed, more than 40 per cent of the infections in Montréal-Nord are associated with CHSLDs or other types of long-term residences, said the director of Montreal's public health agency, Dr. Mylène Drouin, at Tuesday's news briefing.

More than 20 per cent of those infected are health-care workers, she said.

Quebec Public Health Director Dr. Horacio Arruda reiterated her comments during a provincial news briefing Wednesday, saying further studies will be done to better understand how the coronavirus spreads but it's clear health-care workers are transmitting it to the community.

As Montreal public health zeroes in on acute outbreaks like that in Montréal-Nord, Drouin said the larger strategy will be to give everybody in every neighbourhood more access to testing.

Among the planned measures:

The borough will buy and distribute 2,000 disposable masks and 5,000 reusable masks.
Outreach workers will fan out in the community on bike and on foot, to discourage public gatherings and share information about health directives.
Sidewalks will be widened to create ""health corridors"" near elementary schools and on some commercial streets.
Information posters will be placed around the borough.
An information campaign will be launched to educate businesses and residential building owners.

2020-03-26,Canada,Quebec,Quebec City,,,,,,,,,,2.0,1.0,,Government Website,"Québec, le 26 mars 2020 – La Ville de Québec informe la population qu’elle continuera à récupérer toutes les matières résiduelles, incluant le recyclage, malgré certains ralentissements à prévoir au centre de tri dans les prochaines semaines. Une partie des matières sera traitée immédiatement et vendue comme à l’habitude; le reste sera mis en ballots dans un entrepôt en attendant le retour à la normale. Toutes les matières seront donc traitées comme il se doit.

Afin de se conformer aux directives sur les activités non essentielles, les écocentres fermeront dès aujourd’hui, le jeudi 26 mars, à compter de 17 h, pour une durée indéterminée. 

« Nous comptons sur la collaboration des citoyens pour conserver leurs bonnes habitudes de tri des matières résiduelles et recyclables, a souligné le maire de Québec, M. Régis Labeaume. Cette collaboration fait la différence dans cette situation exceptionnelle. »

Rappel aux citoyens

Il est important de continuer à faire le tri des matières résiduelles, à nettoyer les contenants et à utiliser les deux bacs (ordures et matières recyclables), comme en tout temps.
Certains produits, matières et matériaux ne sont pas acceptés dans les bacs roulants, notamment la peinture, les matériaux de construction, les appareils électroniques, etc. Les citoyens doivent donc conserver ces matériaux de façon temporaire pour s’en débarrasser convenablement lorsque la situation sera rétablie. Pour plus d’information, les citoyens sont invités à consulter le Guide du tri.
Les sacs et les bacs doivent être bien fermés. Les citoyens utilisant les paniers de recyclage de 64 litres sont invités à mettre leurs matières recyclables dans des sacs. Ces gestes minimisent les risques de contamination des éboueurs.
Afin d’assurer un service de qualité, les collectes débuteront plus tôt dans la journée pour se terminer plus tard. Les citoyens doivent déposer leurs bacs et poubelles, si ceux-ci sont pleins, en bordure de route la veille. Les journées de collecte demeurent inchangées. Pour en savoir plus, la population peut consulter la section Info-Collecte du site Internet de la Ville de Québec.
Annulation des activités aquatiques printemps-été
Afin de se conformer aux directives de la Santé publique demandant de garder les équipements sportifs et communautaires fermés jusqu’au 1er mai, les activités aquatiques de la Ville de Québec de la session printemps-été sont annulées. Pour les autres activités de loisirs, les citoyens sont invités à communiquer directement avec l’organisme concerné. Les bains libres sont également annulés jusqu’au 1er mai.

Report de la journée d’accueil des nouveaux arrivants
La journée d’accueil des nouveaux arrivants, qui devait avoir lieu le samedi 18 avril au Centre Vidéotron, est reportée. Plus de détails sont à venir.

2020-04-09,Canada,Quebec,Quebec City,,,,,,,,,,2.0,1.0,,,,,,,,2.0,1.0,,Government Website,"Québec, le 9 avril 2020 – La Ville de Québec annonce le maintien des budgets de fonctionnement de plus de 400 organismes et des sommes payées jusqu’à aujourd’hui auprès des événements, activités et projets qu’elle subventionne. Cela permettra aux organismes de concentrer leurs efforts sur le retour à la normale en favorisant ainsi la vitalité économique et culturelle.

Considérant les difficultés qu’impose le climat d’incertitude à court terme, la Ville annonce également l’annulation et le report d’événements dont elle est le promoteur.

« Les organismes de toutes natures joueront un rôle majeur dans la reprise économique. Le maintien de leurs activités est essentiel et c’est pourquoi nous confirmons aujourd’hui qu’ils auront les budgets de fonctionnement attendus pour l’année 2020, a déclaré le maire de Québec, M. Régis Labeaume. Nous sommes très sensibles aux difficultés que vivent les organismes en ce moment. Nous nous assurerons de les soutenir afin qu’ils reprennent leurs activités rapidement. C’est en faisant preuve de solidarité qu’ensemble nous passerons au travers. »

Plus de 12 M$ pour quelque 160 organismes
La Ville honorera les subventions de fonctionnement promises à plus de 160 organismes sur son territoire, dont les sociétés de développement commercial et les organismes culturels, communautaires et de loisirs. C’est ainsi que les 12,5 M$ budgétés seront versés comme prévu.

Soutien financier pour les événements, les activités et les projets
La Ville maintiendra également une partie des subventions qu’elle s’était engagée à verser pour les événements, les activités et les projets sur son territoire, couvrant les dépenses payées jusqu’au 9 avril, incluant les sommes dédiées à tous les événements annulés à ce jour. Cependant, aucune dépense réalisée au-delà du 9 avril 2020 ne sera admissible au calcul des subventions pour les événements qui seront annulés.

Le remboursement des sommes excédentaires en date d’aujourd’hui devra être fait dans le respect des programmes, cadres et seuils de cumul gouvernementaux lorsque cela s’applique.

La Ville communiquera avec chacun des organismes dans les prochains jours afin de les tenir informés de la situation. Considérant les interdictions de rassemblements en vigueur, la Ville n’accordera aucune nouvelle subvention pour la tenue d’événements. Une fois le confinement levé par le gouvernement du Québec, la Ville pourra recommencer à subventionner, selon les paramètres habituels, les événements qui seront réalisés.



Annulation et report d’événements produits par la Ville
La Ville annonce l’annulation des événements suivants qu’elle devait produire
en 2020 :

Fête de Québec, le 3 juillet
Féria, du 20 juillet au début septembre
Passages insolites, du 20 juin au 13 octobre
Quant à l’événement Où tu vas quand tu dors en marchant, réalisé en collaboration avec le Carrefour international de théâtre, le report à une date ultérieure est en évaluation.

Sessions hiver et printemps 2020 des activités d’organismes de loisirs
Après consultation auprès d’organismes de loisirs, la majorité d’entre eux ont déjà pris la décision d’annuler leurs sessions d’hiver et de printemps, soit plus de 2 000 activités. De plus, considérant le confinement étendu jusqu’au 4 mai, la coordination de la reprise des activités pour une session printanière écourtée serait difficile à réaliser.

Une fois le confinement terminé, la Ville priorisera l’utilisation de ses installations pour les activités déjà prévues à la session d’été. Ces dernières auront préséance sur les réservations sporadiques qui seront également possibles.

De l'aide supplémentaire pour les personnes vulnérables
La Ville annonce également qu’elle injectera 200 000 $ dans le fonds d’urgence mis en place par Centraide visant à soutenir le réseau communautaire destiné aux personnes vulnérables. Les organismes souhaitant bénéficier de ce fonds d’urgence sont invités à contacter directement Centraide au www.centraide-quebec.com/covid-19/. 

De plus, à compter d’aujourd’hui, l’organisme La Bouchée généreuse procédera les jeudis, de 8 h 45 à 16 h, à la distribution de denrées alimentaires au Centre de foires. La Ville a aménagé un grand espace d’attente qui permet de respecter les normes de distanciation physique tout en étant au chaud.

If you have these symptoms, contact HealthLine 811 for assessment and direction.”

The active travel health notices and travel advice are available at Health Canada - Latest Travel Health Advice page at https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/latest-travel-health-advice.html.

The risk of COVID-19 to Saskatchewan residents remains low.  As of February 27, there are no laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the province.

“We can still limit the spread of COVID-19 in Canada,” Shahab said.  “Monitoring your symptoms, staying home if you are ill and practicing personal protection like good hand hygiene (and respiratory etiquette) remains vital to containing the transmission.”

Advice for Travellers:

If you have travelled to Hubei in the last 14 days, self-isolate at home for 14 days after leaving the area and actively monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 including cough, fever and difficulty breathing.  Do not go to school, university, work, daycare, sporting or social events or religious gatherings.

If you have been in close contact with someone who is ill with COVID-19, you should self-isolate for 14 days from your last contact and actively monitor for symptoms.

If you have travelled from another affected area in the last 14 days but do not have any symptoms, you should monitor your health for 14 days after leaving the area, including taking your temperature twice daily.  If you develop symptoms, call HealthLine 811 for assessment and direction.  If you do not have cough, fever or difficulty breathing, you can go to work or school.

If you do not have a travel history to/from an affected area and do not have symptoms of a cough or fever, you can go to work or to school.

Protect Yourself from Respiratory Illness:
• Wash your hands frequently;
• Do not touch surfaces and then your mouth, eyes or nose;
• Use tissues when you cough or sneeze and dispose of them immediately; and
• Stay home if you become ill and prevent the spread of the illness.

The resident is in their 60s with recent travel to Egypt.

Experiencing symptoms, the individual was tested March 9 in Saskatoon and has been well enough to self-isolate at home.  Public health officials are in regular contact with this individual.

“The province’s first case is linked to travel from a country where local transmission of COVID-19 has been reported,” Dr. Shahab said.   “This supports the expanded testing criteria of symptomatic travelers to better prepare Saskatchewan’s response to the COVID-19 event.  All travelers need to monitor their symptoms for two weeks upon return home.”

Public health’s contact investigation is underway and will connect with this individual’s close contacts.  If you do not receive a call from public health, you are not at risk of transmission of COVID-19 from this individual.

The Roy Romanow Provincial Laboratory reported the positive lab sample March 12, 2020, and has forwarded it to the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg for confirmation.

“While the risk of acquiring COVID-19 in Saskatchewan continues to be low, increased testing will assist us in detecting cases as early as possible and delaying the spread of the illness as long as possible,” Shahab said.  “But it is critical that residents take precautions to protect themselves against respiratory illness.  Wash your hands frequently, practice good cough and sneeze hygiene and stay home if you are sick.”

“The Ministry of Health and the Saskatchewan Health Authority have dedicated planning teams in place,” Saskatchewan Health Minister Jim Reiter said.  “Our government is committed to providing the resources our public health system requires to mitigate and respond to COVID-19.”

Protect Yourself from Respiratory Illness:

 Wash your hands frequently – for at least 20 seconds;
Do not touch surfaces and then your mouth, eyes or nose;
Use tissues when you cough or sneeze and dispose of them immediately, use your elbow if a tissue not available;
Practice social distancing by not shaking hands, hugging, etc.;
Stay home if you become ill and prevent the spread of the illness.
Travel Guidance:
All travellers should self-monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough or difficulty breathing) for 14 days after returning to Canada and avoid places where you cannot easily separate yourself from others if you become ill.  If you have even mild symptoms, stay home and call HealthLine 811 for advice.
Contact HealthLine 811 within 24 hours of arriving in Canada for direction.

2020-03-13,Canada,Saskatchewan,All,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,0.0,,Government Website,"Today, Premier Scott Moe, Health Minister Jim Reiter and Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Saqib Shahab announced new measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 in Saskatchewan.

The Chief Medical Health Officer of Saskatchewan has made the following order pursuant to Section 45 of The Public Health Act effective Monday, March 16:

The Chief Medical Health Officer orders that no public gathering of over 250 people in any one room take place.  This does not include settings where people are distributed into multiple rooms or buildings, such as schools, universities or workplaces.
The Chief Medical Health Officer orders that no events of over 50 people with speakers or attendees who have travelled internationally in the last 14 days take place.
Retail locations and Faith based organizations are exempt, however, they should have measures (such as crowd size monitoring) that support safe social distancing and should seek guidance from the local medical health officer if necessary.
Effective immediately, people who have travelled outside the province in the previous 14 days or have acute respiratory or flu-like symptoms should avoid visiting long term care homes and hospitals.
Additionally, the Government of Saskatchewan as an employer is imposing a number of policies regarding government employee travel, as well as self-monitoring and self-isolation procedures:

Effective immediately, international travel (including the U.S.) for government employees on government business has been prohibited.
Any out-of-province travel for government employees on government business within Canada will be restricted and is subject to approval by the Deputy Minister to the Premier.
Any government employees who are currently travelling internationally (including to the U.S.), or plan to travel internationally for personal reasons will be required to self-isolate for 14 days after returning to Canada as a precaution.  If they have or develop acute respiratory or flu-like symptoms, they should contact Healthline 811.
All government employees who are experiencing symptoms of an acute respiratory or flu-like illness will be required to stay at home.
While these measures are being implemented as a policy for Government of Saskatchewan ministries, crowns, and agencies, the Chief Medical Health Officer strongly recommends that all employers and individuals across the province adopt these measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 in Saskatchewan, protect residents from exposure to the virus and reduce the impact of COVID-19 on the health system.

In keeping with these new policies, budget day events on Wednesday, March 18, will proceed without the participation of invited guests.  Members of the Legislative Assembly, media, and a limited number of staff will gather for these events while practicing social distancing.  Further, all tours and public events at the Legislative Building are suspended and general public access to the Legislative Building will also be suspended.

Concerns regarding Healthline 811 have been heard, and following an action plan ordered by the Minister of Health, the capacity of Healthline 811 has been more than doubled effective 9 a.m. this morning, with additional capacity being added going forward.

The Ministry of Health and the Saskatchewan Health Authority continue to work together to expand testing capacity for COVID-19, including the introduction of COVID-19 assessment sites over the coming days.

“While these are significant steps that will help limit transmission of COVID-19, most important is the responsibility we all have to ensure we reduce the risk to ourselves, our families and our communities,” Moe said.  “The best way we can do this is by practicing social distancing, washing our hands often, avoiding close personal contact like handshakes or hugs, and self isolating if we feel any symptoms of illness.”

The resident is in their 60s with travel from Oregon state in the U.S.  The test was conducted in Saskatoon on March 10 and the individual has been well enough to self-isolate at home.

Public health officials have begun their contact investigation to follow up on anyone who may be at risk of developing COVID-19 because of contact with this individual.

If you do not receive a call from public health, you are not at risk of transmission of COVID-19 from this individual.  The Roy Romanow Provincial Laboratory reported the positive lab sample March 13, 2020, and has forwarded it to the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg for confirmation.

“All travelers – including those to the U.S. -- need to monitor their health for 14 days upon return to Canada and be prepared to stay home if you have a fever or cough,” Saskatchewan Ministry of Health Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Saqib Shahab said.

According to current research on COVID-19, eighty per cent of individuals who contract COVID-19 will experience only mild symptoms.  They will be able to self-isolate and recover at home.  Monitoring for symptoms and staying home when you are sick is important to prevent transmission and ensure acute care resources are reserved for those at highest risk of severe illness.

Travel Guidance

The Public Health Agency of Canada is recommending residents postpone or cancel all non-essential travel outside of Canada.  All travellers should self-monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough or difficulty breathing) for 14 days after returning to Canada and avoid places where you cannot easily separate yourself from others if you become ill.  If you have even mild symptoms, stay home.

Healthline 811

Healthline 811 can assist you in assessing your risk and advise on whether you should seek testing:

If you have travelled in the past 14 days and have developed a fever, cough or difficulty breathing.

2020-03-16,Canada,Saskatchewan,All,2.0,1.0,,Government Website,"Today, the Government of Saskatchewan announced that all classes in Saskatchewan pre K-12 Schools will be suspended indefinitely, effective March 20, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

For the period of March 16 to March 19, pre K-12 classes will wind down.  This means that parents who are able to keep children home should do so immediately, with no absence or grade impacts.  Parents with limited childcare options have a window to plan for class suspensions.

On Sunday, March 15, the Chief Medical Health Officer indicated that school closures would be based on a number of factors including:

Evidence of sustained transmission within the community;
Rapid increase of local cases; and
Transmission without a known link to travel or confirmed cases.
There continues to be no evidence that any of the above three criteria have been met.  Children remaining in schools between March 16 and March 19 face a low risk of exposure to COVID-19.  A preventative approach of proactive school closures beginning March 20 means reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission.

Every student will receive a final grade based on their current grade, and students will progress to their next grade level next year.  Every student who is eligible to graduate from Grade 12 this year will graduate.  The Ministry of Education and School Divisions will work with Saskatchewan Post-Secondary Institutions to adapt entry requirements for programs commencing in the next academic year.

Teachers and staff can work from home or in schools as scheduled during the class cancellations.  For the rest of the scheduled school year, the Ministry of Education will work with School Divisions and Saskatchewan Teachers to implement a supplemental curriculum program through distance and alternative learning methods.  While this supplemental curriculum will have no impact on final grades, it will ensure that students seeking to continue learning will have the resources necessary to do so.

These measures apply to daycares that are co-located with schools, but do not apply to licensed daycare facilities outside of schools.  Further measures regarding licensed daycare facilities are being considered and will be implemented at a later date.

Officials are currently examining options to provide childcare services for individuals that are providing essential services during the COVID-19 response.

The Royal Saskatchewan Museum (RSM) at 2445 Albert Street in Regina will be closed effective today, March 17, 2020, until further notice.

“When open to the public, the RSM welcomes visitors of all ages, backgrounds and locations including school groups and families,” Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Gene Makowsky said.  “We believe that closing the RSM is taking a proactive approach to promoting social distancing to stop the spread of this virus.  We apologize for the inconvenience and look forward to reopening in the future.”

The T.rex Discovery Centre in Eastend, Saskatchewan, which is also home to Scotty, the world’s largest T.rex, is not scheduled to open until May 16, 2020, for the summer season.

As concerns regarding the spread of the COVID-19 virus elevate, the RSM joins other public facilities in taking this action to help encourage people to stay home and avoid public places where the virus could potentially spread.  Ideally, the museum will reopen once public health authorities determine it is safe to do so.

During the physical closure of the RSM, social media and website updates will keep followers engaged on https://royalsaskmuseum.ca/, Facebook (@Royal.Saskatchewan.Museum), Twitter (@royalsaskmuseum) or Instagram (@RoyalSaskMuseum).

This includes measures like the ability to limit travel to or from a community or region of the province and directing that property or equipment be deployed to address the COVID-19 pandemic.

The government, in consultation with the Chief Medical Health Officer, also made a number of new orders to reduce the risk to Saskatchewan people, prevent transmission and ensure that acute care services are preserved for residents most at risk for severe illness.

The following measures are effective immediately:

Public gatherings larger than 50 people are prohibited.
All restaurants, bars and event venues must limit their seating to 50 per cent of capacity or up to a maximum of fifty people, whichever is lesser.  All must be able to ensure social distance of one to two metres between customers.  Retail spaces including grocery stores, pharmacies and gas stations are exempted from this policy but must have processes to maintain a one to two metre separation.
All gyms, fitness centres, casinos and bingo halls are ordered to close until further notice.
Residents are advised to limit any non-essential travel outside of Saskatchewan, with the exception of people who live in border communities and are commuting for work.
Any licensed restaurants and taverns in Saskatchewan will be permitted to sell alcohol as an offsale according to SLGA regulations indefinitely.
All crown utilities will implement bill-deferral programs allowing a zero-interest bill deferral for up to six months for Saskatchewan residents whose ability to make bill payments may be impacted by the COVID-19 restrictions.
All Government of Saskatchewan ministries, agencies and Crown corporations will implement a phased-in work from home policy effective Monday, March 23, applicable to employees deemed non-essential.  This means that any employees able to work from home should do so immediately, while providing managers a period to plan for work-force continuity.
The Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) will be discontinuing all non-urgent/elective surgeries, procedures and diagnostics as of March 23.  This action will allow the SHA the ability to redeploy nurses and other staff and ensure medical supplies and personal protective equipment are available when needed and reduce risk of further exposure to our care providers and patients.

The SHA will continue to provide services to patients who require emergent and urgent care.  Cancer, urgent and emergent surgeries will continue as planned.  Patients will be contacted regarding their scheduled service.

Parents with children in daycares should be preparing for further restrictions.

This includes measures like the ability to limit travel to or from a community or region of the province and directing that property or equipment be deployed to address the COVID-19 pandemic.

The government, in consultation with the Chief Medical Health Officer, also made a number of new orders to reduce the risk to Saskatchewan people, prevent transmission and ensure that acute care services are preserved for residents most at risk for severe illness.

The following measures are effective immediately:

Public gatherings larger than 50 people are prohibited.
All restaurants, bars and event venues must limit their seating to 50 per cent of capacity or up to a maximum of fifty people, whichever is lesser.  All must be able to ensure social distance of one to two metres between customers.  Retail spaces including grocery stores, pharmacies and gas stations are exempted from this policy but must have processes to maintain a one to two metre separation.
All gyms, fitness centres, casinos and bingo halls are ordered to close until further notice.
Residents are advised to limit any non-essential travel outside of Saskatchewan, with the exception of people who live in border communities and are commuting for work.
Any licensed restaurants and taverns in Saskatchewan will be permitted to sell alcohol as an offsale according to SLGA regulations indefinitely.
All crown utilities will implement bill-deferral programs allowing a zero-interest bill deferral for up to six months for Saskatchewan residents whose ability to make bill payments may be impacted by the COVID-19 restrictions.
All Government of Saskatchewan ministries, agencies and Crown corporations will implement a phased-in work from home policy effective Monday, March 23, applicable to employees deemed non-essential.  This means that any employees able to work from home should do so immediately, while providing managers a period to plan for work-force continuity.
The Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) will be discontinuing all non-urgent/elective surgeries, procedures and diagnostics as of March 23.  This action will allow the SHA the ability to redeploy nurses and other staff and ensure medical supplies and personal protective equipment are available when needed and reduce risk of further exposure to our care providers and patients.

The SHA will continue to provide services to patients who require emergent and urgent care.  Cancer, urgent and emergent surgeries will continue as planned.  Patients will be contacted regarding their scheduled service.

Parents with children in daycares should be preparing for further restrictions.

All travelers returning from international destinations - including the U.S. - are subject to a mandatory self-isolation order.  Anyone identified by a Ministry of Health Official as a close contact of someone with COVID-19 shall go into mandatory self-isolation for 14 days from the date of having been exposed.

Do not go to work or school.
Do not go to public areas, including places of worship, stores, shopping malls and restaurants.
Cancel or reschedule non-urgent appointments; let them know you are on self-isolation.
Do not take buses, taxis or ride-sharing where you would be in contact with others.
Do not have visitors in your home.
Ask family/friends to drop off food or use delivery/pick-up services for errands such as grocery shopping.
You may go outdoors - use your backyard, walk on your street or exercise outdoors - but only if you have no symptoms and can maintain the required social distance of two metres at all times.  You must maintain proper hand hygiene and avoid contact with shared surfaces like handrails, pedestrian crosswalk buttons and outdoor playground equipment.  Avoid all common spaces within shared accommodations like apartments and condominiums (ie. elevators, hallways) and public places where you cannot maintain this distance..

With even mild symptoms of a cough, you must self-isolate indoors to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Additionally, clarity is being provided to Saskatchewan businesses surrounding the operations of allowable business services, in consultation with the Chief Medical Health Officer.  A list of critical public services and allowable business services has been created to inform the business community of which businesses can continue to operate in accordance with social distancing practices.  All changes are effective March 26, 2020.

“As we impose further restrictions to fight the spread of COVID-19, we know this creates challenges for businesses in Saskatchewan and we know that providing as much clarity as possible is important,” Premier Scott Moe said.  “We are already seeing the creation of a social distancing economy in Saskatchewan as many businesses adapt their service delivery to prevent the spread of COVID-19.”

Critical Public Services and Allowable Business Services

The government is releasing a comprehensive list of critical public services and business services that will be allowed to continue operating during the COVID-19 response and maintaining critical services to the public and industry to prevent supply chain disruption.

The list includes: health care and public health workers; law enforcement, public safety and first responders; production, processing and manufacturing and the supporting supply chains; transportation and logistics; government and community services; media and telecommunications; construction including maintenance and repair; select retail services; and banking and financial services.

The full list is available in the attached backgrounder.

Non-Allowable Business Services

Effective March 26, non-allowable business services will be unable to provide public-facing services.  While closure of non-allowable business services prevents certain businesses from providing public facing services, it does not preclude opportunities for non-allowable business services to expand into online retailing, or providing pick-up or delivery services.

Examples of non-allowable business services that will be prohibited from providing public-facing services includes: clothing stores; shoe stores; flower shops; sporting good and adventure stores; vaping supply shops; boats, ATV, or snowmobile retailers; gift, book, or stationary stores; jewelry and accessory stores; toy stores; music, electronic and entertainment stores; pawn shops; and travel agencies.

This is in addition to the following business services that were ordered closed on March 23:

Restaurants, food courts, cafeterias, cafes, bistros and similar facilities.  Exceptions are take-out with two metre distancing between customers during pick-up; drive through food services; delivery of food products; soup kitchens, not-for-profit community and religious kitchens with two metre distancing between tables.

Personal service facilities including tattooists, hairdressers, barbers, acupuncturists, acupressurists, cosmetologists, electrologists, estheticians, manicurists, pedicurists, suntanning parlours, relaxation masseuses, facilities performing body piercing, bone grafting or scarification services.

All recreational and entertainment facilities including fitness centers, casinos, bingo halls, arenas, curling rinks, swimming pools, galleries, theatres, museums and similar facilities.

Public and Private Gatherings Restricted to 10 Person Maximum

Effective March 26, public and private gatherings of more than 10 people in one room are prohibited. Exceptions are provided where two metre distancing between people can be maintained, such as: workplaces and meeting settings where people are distributed into multiple rooms or buildings; and retail locations deemed essential.

The two fatalities represent the first deaths in Saskatchewan tied to the COVID-19 pandemic.

One was related to travel.  Both people were in their 70s.

As of March 30, 2020, the province of Saskatchewan has 20 new, confirmed cases of COVID-19, bringing the provincial total to 176.

Five people are in hospital across the province, including four in acute care and one in the intensive care unit (ICU):

One inpatient case is located in the north, and three in Saskatoon.
One ICU case is located in Regina.
At least eight cases are a result of local transmission.  The rest are travel-related or cluster-related due to exposure at mass gatherings.
Five cases concern individuals 19 years of age and under; all other cases are adults.
80 cases are in the 20-44 age range; 62 are in the 45-64 range; and 29 are in the 65-plus range.
55 per cent of the cases are males and 45 per cent are females.
Six more people have recovered from the virus, bringing the provincial total to 14.
There may be more cases yet to be reported to Public Health.

To date, 9,651 COVID-19 tests have been performed in Saskatchewan, an increase of 565 from yesterday’s update.

The province continues to be a national leader in testing, with an aggressive strategy aimed at identifying and preventing the spread of the virus as quickly and effectively as possible.  Case surveillance and testing information, including regional locations of confirmed/presumptive cases is available at www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19.

Government Redeploying Staff to Focus on Priorities

The Government of Saskatchewan is taking steps to identify key skill sets in all ministries in an effort to deploy additional staff to critical function areas.  Supplemental resources are required to handle contact tracing needs, staff call centres and public inquiries.  The province will continue to allocate as many resources as possible to address the COVID-19 challenge.

The Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) already has up to 150 people involved in contact tracing.  Over the coming days, 50 additional staff from across government will be moved into this key role.  The need for additional resources will be assessed as the situation evolves.

Multiple Testing Sites Open Across the Province

As of March 30, there are more than 40 communities in Saskatchewan where COVID-19 testing is available.  Testing locations will continue to be expanded as demand warrants.  The current list of communities where testing is available can be found on www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19 under Testing Information.  Testing is by referrals only.

If you are experiencing COVID-19-related symptoms (fever, cough or breathing issues), please use the online self-assessment tool at www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19 and call 811 or your family physician.

“With the risk of COVID-19 within the province, we are encouraging everyone to download the SaskAlert App,” SPSA President Marlo Pritchard said.  “The app will provide urgent, critical information about how individuals and families can protect themselves.”

The SaskAlert App allows users to choose to receive emergency public alerts for the entire province, a particular municipality or a First Nation community.  The app can target residents in a geographic area if urgent information is specific to one region or municipality within the province.

In case of an emergency, a tone will sound, similar to receiving a normal text message notification – even when the app is closed.  Individuals can then open the app to find information on the emergency and instructions on any actions you are required to take.

“Using the SaskAlert App to push out emergency notifications is not meant to replace the normal methods of getting your news,” Pritchard said.  “However, it is an effective method of pushing out urgent information province-wide, or to a localized area.”

The app is available for download on Android and Apple devices at http://emergencyalert.saskatchewan.ca/.

Following consultation with the Mayor of La Loche and other northern leaders, Saskatchewan’s Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Shahab today signed a Public Health Order restricting all non-critical travel into northern Saskatchewan, specifically the Northern Saskatchewan Administration District (see map attached).  Dr. Shahab is also issuing a strong recommendation against non-essential travel between communities within northern Saskatchewan.

This action is being taken in addition to a number of other actions the government has taken to address the outbreak in La Loche and protect northern residents.

Premier Scott Moe said there are unique challenges when an outbreak occurs in a remote northern community.

“Our government has already taken significant action to respond to the situation in La Loche and we are taking further action today,” Moe said.  “I have spoken with La Loche Mayor Robert St. Pierre and several other people in the community and we will continue to work closely with northern leaders to protect the north.”

Checkpoints have been established by northern leadership along all highways leading into northern Saskatchewan.  Today’s order provides the full legal authority to enforce travel restrictions into the north.

Staffing of the checkpoints will continue to be directed by northern leadership   The provincial government has offered fire suppression staff to support the checkpoints and to provide any other support required.

Moe said the requirement to self-isolate may also be a challenge for some residents.

“Social housing units are already being provided for individuals who need to self-isolate,” Moe said.  “I have directed that the school in La Loche also be made available for this purpose and that the Public Safety Agency provide mobile housing units – work-camp trailers – for individuals who need to self-isolate.”

Actions taken to date include:

An outbreak was declared at La Loche Health Centre LTC, which immediately initiated strengthened protections and protocols around infection control like limiting resident movement, additional precautions around use of PPE and enhanced daily cleaning schedules;
A new portable GeneXpert testing unit has been provided for use in La Loche, which will result in significantly expanded testing capacity and shorter turnaround time;
The Saskatchewan Health Authority has provided additional personal protective equipment (PPE) to the La Loche Health Centre and the province is actively working with the federal government to obtain additional PPE;
On April 18, regional medical health officers advised against all non-essential travel between northwest Saskatchewan and northern Alberta;
Regular COVID updates and information are being provided on radio across the North in four languages - English, Cree, Dene and Michif;
Two Emergency Services Officers from the Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency have been deployed to the community; and
The Public Safety Agency is providing assistance with emergency planning including training local emergency officers.
“As I noted yesterday, even though Saskatchewan has successfully reduced the spread of COVID-19, unfortunately we can expect to experience isolated outbreaks,” Moe said.  “Our health system and our government is prepared to take immediate action to respond to these outbreaks and that’s what we are doing today in the north.”

Public inquiries regarding the restriction of all non-critical travel into and out of Northern Saskatchewan Administration District (NSAD) can be directed to the Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency toll-free line at 1-855-559-5502.

Also included was immediate funding of $370,000 targeted to combating COVID-19 in the province’s Far North region, and the addition of seasonal businesses to the Saskatchewan Small Business Emergency Payment, including northern outfitters.

“Our government recognizes the unique challenges that northern communities are facing in fighting the spread of COVID-19,” Premier Scott Moe said.  “We are providing direct supports to northern communities and businesses to ensure the necessary resources are available, while imposing further restrictions to ensure the necessary steps are being taken to reduce the spread and flatten the curve in the north.”

Travel Restrictions Tightened Across Northern Saskatchewan

After further consultation with Northern leaders by Government Relations Minister Lori Carr, the province is announcing tighter travel restrictions for the province’s north to help stop the spread of COVID-19.  An updated public health order has been issued by Saskatchewan's Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Saqib Shahab to impose further restrictions, including:

Restricting all non-critical travel (including those with primary residences) into and out of the NSAD, as well as restricting all non-critical travel between northern communities.
Northern residents are ordered to remain in their local communities and to practice appropriate social distancing.  Exceptions will be made only for critical items like collecting groceries and medical appointments.
Travel related to the delivery of essential services will continue to be permitted.   For a complete list of approved travel visit https://publications.saskatchewan.ca/#/products/104577.
The NSAD is a large geographic area covering almost half of the province but containing less than 4.0 per cent of the provincial population.  Given the uniqueness of the north, case-by-case exemptions to the Order were evaluated upon the request of a community.  To date, the municipalities of La Ronge and Stony Rapids have been granted exemptions.  This means that travel to and from La Ronge and Stony Rapids from outside the NSAD is allowed, but individuals are not permitted to stop in any other community.

$370,000 Targeted to Communities Combating COVID-19 in Northern Saskatchewan

The Government of Saskatchewan is providing immediate funding of $370,000 targeted to combating COVID-19 in province’s Far North region.

Of the investment, $350,000 will be provided through the Ministry of Government Relations directly to New North, the province’s northern communities association.  Funding will help establish, staff and maintain community checkpoints as part of a recent public health order to address COVID-19 in the province’s far north.

The Northern Village of La Loche will receive $20,000 directly.  These funds will be used to support local public safety, food security and educational initiatives organized by the community to encourage physical distancing and self-isolation of residents.

Supports for Outfitters and Businesses Operating in Provincial Parks 

The Government of Saskatchewan also announced new supports for northern outfitters and businesses operating in provincial parks.  Amendments to the Saskatchewan Small Business Emergency Payment (SSBEP) program will ensure these small businesses are eligible for grants up to $5,000.

Announced on April 9, the SSBEP is a $50 million program providing financial support as a one-time grant to small and medium-sized businesses that have had to temporarily close or significantly curtail operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The grants are paid based on 15 per cent of a business’ monthly sales revenue, to a maximum of $5,000.

This is in addition to measures taken by the Ministry of Environment to waive lease fees for outfitters for the 2020 season and providing flexible licensing arrangements for those suspending outfitting activities.

A modified application will be available in the coming days and can be accessed by visiting www.saskatchewan.ca/covid19-businesses.

“This run is intended to be a fun, active celebration of our city and its people,” said Regina Mayor Michael Fougere. “It is clear that we will not be able to carry out the event while observing proper social distancing protocols and the limits on public gatherings, and we must ensure the health and safety of participants, volunteers, and organizers.”
While a date for 2021 has not yet been scheduled, registrants will receive direct communication from Run Regina about their registration fees.
“The race community across Canada is dealing with the difficult realities presented by COVID-19,” said Shawn Weimer, Race Director for Run Regina. “We are confident Regina runners will stay active during this trying time while maintaining proper social distancing and be ready to join us for the relaunched I Love Regina Run in 2021.”
Donations made through the registration process will be provided to race partner UnderstandUs, a Regina-based non-profit organization that creates awareness campaigns to spark positive conversations about mental health.

This includes the National Indigenous Peoples Day celebrations held in Victoria park every June.
This would have been the City’s eighth year celebrating National Indigenous Peoples Day.
“National Indigenous Peoples Day is a tradition in Regina and it will return,” says Mayor Michael Fougere. “It has been a point of pride to see more people and organizations coming together each year as a community to celebrate and acknowledge the unique heritage, diverse cultures and outstanding achievements of First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples in Canada.”
The City of Regina’s top priority is the health, safety and well-being of the community and our employees. The City continues to work with internal and external partners, including the Saskatchewan Health Authority, the Ministry of Health and the Public Health Agency of Canada on a proactive approach to deal with COVID-19, including limiting indoor and outdoor gatherings to no more than 10 people, except for families in the same household, and where critical public and business services are conducted.

Through our collaborative discussions and with input and guidance and the full support of our trusted partners, including the Province of Saskatchewan, the City of Saskatoon,Tourism Saskatoon, Saskatchewan Health Authority and Saskatchewan Ministry of Health, it is with an incredibly heavy heart that we collectively confirm the cancellation of the 49th Annual JUNO Awards and JUNO Week activities in Saskatoon due to concerns surrounding COVID-19. 

We are devastated to cancel this national celebration of music, but at this time of global uncertainty, the health, safety and well-being of all Canadians must stand at the forefront of any decisions that impact our communities. We know this is the right decision based on the information we currently have and are continuing to receive. The situation surrounding COVID-19 continues to evolve rapidly and we urge everyone to follow the guidelines and protocols put forth by public health officials.

We salute and appreciate all the 2020 nominees. CARAS will continue to explore options to coordinate an alternative way to honour this year’s JUNO Award winners and Special Award Recipients and support the creators and participants that so greatly benefit from the work done by CARAS and the JUNOS.",City of Saskatoon,,"Joint Statement Regarding JUNO Week 2020

2020-03-16,Canada,Yukon,All,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.0,1.0,,Government Website,"Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health is telling all individuals who have travelled outside of Canada in the last 14 days to self-isolate. This includes travel to Alaska.

Individuals who have travelled outside of Yukon in the last 14 days, or who are feeling sick, are banned from visiting hospitals.

Long-term care facilities are closed to visitors and volunteers, unless family members are at the end of life or gravely ill regardless of travel.  

These restrictions are accompanied by several others including the following:

Mass gatherings of more than 50 people are banned, including at houses of worship.
Parents or caregivers who are able to keep their children home from spring break daycamps, or daycare, are requested to do so. Fewer children in camps or daycares will help to limit any spread.
People who can work from home are requested to do so. Employers are asked to look for ways to support employees to work from home where possible.
Many of us are interested in how COVID-19 is spread from one person to another.  As an emerging disease, there are many uncertainties about its characteristics.  The information that we communicate today is the best knowledge at this time.  This knowledge does change and get out of date rapidly, and we are keeping updated and adjusting our response accordingly. We must all be cautious and patient as the information changes.

Current evidence supports that the main route of COVID-19 spread is from person-to-person through respiratory droplets when an infected person sneezes or coughs. The risk of transmission is believed to be highest when the person is most symptomatic. However recent evidence and modelling suggests that transmission may occur prior to symptoms being present.  Major uncertainties remain in the role that asymptomatic transmission may play in the spread of COVID-19.

At this time in Yukon, we are recommending self-isolation for all travellers from international destinations, even those without symptoms.  This precautionary measure is important as we are working with an illness that is not fully understood. 

All people returning from international travel should self-isolate for 14 days.  This means that they should stay home or in the outdoors where they can be 2 metres away from other people. See the Government of Canada webpage for more information.

We are asking all people throughout Yukon to do their part to keep Yukon healthy.  Please continue to practice good hand hygiene and cough etiquette. Please be especially considerate of people over 65 years old and people who have underlying medical conditions who are at highest risk of severe complications of respiratory infections including influenza and COVID-19.

Persons who are returning from travel outside Canada and have any cough or sensation of fever, even mild, should consider themselves infectious and be extra cautious with their self-isolation and distancing from those at highest risk of severe infection.  In that case please self-isolate and call YCDC at 867-667-8323 or 1-800-661-0408 ext. 8323.

The situation with COVID-19 is fluid and we continue to update our guidance based on the latest information.  We will continue to provide the public regular updates as the situation continues to evolve.

As of today, March 22, at 7 p.m. there are 2 cases of COVID-19 in Yukon.

COVID-19 test results
Yukon is now seeing a faster turnaround time on COVID-19 test results. By early this coming week, the number of completed tests on Yukon.ca will be updated 3 times a week.

Non-essential travel outside of territory and into rural Yukon
In an effort to limit the spread of COVID-19 and to protect Yukon’s most vulnerable citizens, Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health strongly advises the suspension of all non-essential travel into and out of Yukon. All Yukoners planning to return home in the next 30 days are advised to return now.

In view of the need to protect remote areas with limited medical resources, Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health strongly advises the suspension of any non-essential travel to Yukon’s rural communities,

Self-isolation required for all travellers
All Yukoners returning home and all visitors to the territory are required to self-isolate for 14 days. This includes anyone returning home from other provinces and territories by road or air, as well as Yukoners returning home by road from Alaska. We are putting mechanisms in place to monitor and ensure travellers are self-isolating.

If you cannot safely self-isolate at home, email covid19info@gov.yk.ca for information and advice. All Yukoners who return home and have respiratory symptoms (cough, fever, or difficulty breathing) are asked to phone 811 to get advice on COVID-19 testing.

Restaurants and bars
Restaurants must immediately reduce their seating capacity to 50%, space people 2 metres apart, and prepare to offer take-out and delivery service only as of opening on March 26. As of closing time tonight, March 22, all bars must close until further notice.

All personal service establishments must close by end of day, Wednesday, March 25. This includes hair salons, barber shops, tattoo parlours, nail salons, and massage therapists.

Gatherings
Gatherings of more than 10 people are banned. Smaller gatherings should ensure spacing of 2 metres between people. Yukoners should not attend any social gatherings, even those with fewer than 10 people if:

In view of the need to protect remote areas with limited medical resources, Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health strongly advises the suspension of any non-essential travel to Yukon’s rural communities,

Self-isolation required for all travellers
All Yukoners returning home and all visitors to the territory are required to self-isolate for 14 days. This includes anyone returning home from other provinces and territories by road or air, as well as Yukoners returning home by road from Alaska. We are putting mechanisms in place to monitor and ensure travellers are self-isolating.

If you cannot safely self-isolate at home, email covid19info@gov.yk.ca for information and advice. All Yukoners who return home and have respiratory symptoms (cough, fever, or difficulty breathing) are asked to phone 811 to get advice on COVID-19 testing.

Restaurants and bars
Restaurants must immediately reduce their seating capacity to 50%, space people 2 metres apart, and prepare to offer take-out and delivery service only as of opening on March 26. As of closing time tonight, March 22, all bars must close until further notice.

All personal service establishments must close by end of day, Wednesday, March 25. This includes hair salons, barber shops, tattoo parlours, nail salons, and massage therapists.

Gatherings
Gatherings of more than 10 people are banned. Smaller gatherings should ensure spacing of 2 metres between people. Yukoners should not attend any social gatherings, even those with fewer than 10 people if:

COVID-19 cases and test results
As of today, March 27, at 3 p.m. there are four cases of COVID-19 in Yukon. All four people are doing well at home.

Information about COVID-19 tests is published regularly on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending and the total number of tests.

Managing COVID-19 cases
As new cases of COVID-19 occur, those who are connected to infected people will continue to be traced and informed so they can take the necessary measures of monitoring themselves for symptoms for up to 14 days.

Yukoners are urged to behave as if COVID-19 is already in their community. They should continue to keep a physical distance of two meters or six feet from each other and practice greater hygiene.

Yukoners are also strongly advised to avoid passing on inaccurate information they may hear about cases of infection. This creates additional anxiety at a time when many people are already struggling to maintain their mental health. 

Federal quarantine measures
As many Yukoners will know, the Government of Canada now requires mandatory 14-day self-isolation for everyone entering Canada even if they do not have COVID-19 symptoms.

Yukoners flying into Canada with symptoms must quarantine at their arrival destination. Yukoners flying into Canada who do not have symptoms may travel home to the territory where they must then follow Yukon requirements and self-isolate for 14 days.

Dental services
The Chief Medical Officer of Health is from today ordering the territory’s dental practices to suspend all non-urgent treatment until further notice. This is to protect Yukoners as well as dental care providers from the spread of infection.

Patients with queries should contact their dental clinic.

Mining industry guidance
Everyone arriving in Yukon must self-isolate for 14 days, including workers at placer or hard rock mines, exploration camps or conducting any other business or duty associated with the mining and exploration industry. Workers cannot carry out their regular duties in a camp or at a mine while they’re self-isolating.

COVID-19 cases and recoveries

As of today, April 1, at 3 p.m. there are 6 cases of COVID-19 in Yukon. The new case is linked to international travel. The person followed all proper protocols, self-isolated and is recovering at home.

3 of the 6 people who contracted COVID-19 have now recovered and all others are doing well on home isolation.

Information about COVID-19 tests is published regularly on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered.

Air travellers

Air North staff are greeting all travellers arriving at Erik Neilson Whitehorse International Airport with any airline to give them guidance and instruct them that they must self-isolate for 14 days and monitor themselves for symptoms. Passengers also receive guidance before they deplane and COVID-19 information is displayed on airport screens.

All people arriving in Yukon are ordered to go straight home and into self-isolation for 14 days. If they cannot safely self-isolate at home, they should contact COVID19info@gov.yk.ca to be linked with the team supporting people who cannot self-isolate at home.

Support for vulnerable people

Several measures are in place at the Government of Yukon’s Whitehorse Emergency Shelter to help keep guests and staff safe during the pandemic. This includes actively monitoring guests for symptoms of COVID-19 and reducing the number of people gathering in the shelter at the same time, while still providing essential services and prioritizing people who are most in need.

Whitehorse Emergency Shelter staff are also carrying out safe spacing and additional cleaning to prevent the spread of infection and are educating guests about physical distancing, increased hygiene and coughing etiquette. Staff have accommodation ready for guests who may need to isolate and are helping people who don’t require additional support to find alternative, temporary accommodation.

In addition, the Government of Yukon is sharing guidance and resources such as a screening tool with non-governmental organizations across the territory that provides services for homeless people and those at risk of homelessness so they can help protect clients, staff and volunteers.

Work camp guidelines

Guidelines have been issued for work camps during the pandemic, including how to help staff who have symptoms or who are required to self-isolate, how to practice safe spacing and enhanced hygiene, and how to handle food.

It is recommended that employers pay staff who need to self-isolate as this will help ensure that staff report any COVID-19 symptoms and follow isolation protocols. Mining camp workers arriving in Yukon are reminded that they are required to self-isolate for 14 days before they start work.

COVID-19 cases and recoveries
As of today, April 3, at 3 p.m. the number of cases of COVID-19 in Yukon remains at six.

Four of the six people who contracted COVID-19 have now recovered and all others are isolating and doing well at home. No Yukon cases have required medical treatment.

Yukon continues to have no documented cases of community transmission. All identified infections in the territory so far are connected to travel outside Yukon or to known contacts. Community transmission occurs when it is no longer possible to trace how somebody became infected. Physical spacing measures are people’s best protection against unknown community transmission.

Information about COVID-19 tests is published regularly on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered.

Legal orders
As announced by the Government of Yukon on April 2, 2020, Yukoners should be aware that all orders put in place by the Yukon Chief Medical Officer in response to the pandemic are enforceable by law. This announcement about enforcement measures was in recognition of the vulnerability of communities throughout Yukon and will help clarify the rules for anyone who is uncertain about what they and others can and cannot legally do.

The enforceable orders require that: everyone who enters Yukon must self-isolate for 14 days; all essential services workers must self-isolate in a place other than a work camp or mine; all people entering Yukon must provide contact information and details of their self-isolation plan and declare they don’t have any COVID-19 symptoms; no more than 10 people can gather in the same place unless they live together; all restaurants that remain open must only provide take out; all bars must close; dental visits are limited to emergency only; and all personal service businesses such as hair salons, tattoo parlours and massage therapy must close.

Special provisions and requirements are now in place for critical service providers, people travelling through Yukon and people who live in the BC-Yukon border area who haven’t travelled out of the territory or border area in the last 14 days. Travellers are only allowed to be in Yukon for 24 hours as they pass through.

Recommendations
To help protect Yukoners since the start of the pandemic, the Chief Medical Officer of Health has made several strong recommendations as well as orders. These recommendations include: not travelling to rural communities or outside the territory unless it’s essential; practicing greater hygiene and always keeping at least two meters apart from others unless they’re part of the same household; working from home when possible; and avoiding non-essential treatment at hospitals. 

Hospital care
Yukoners are reminded that hospitals are still very safe places to seek care. If people need to see a doctor for their illness, medical condition or injury they should call 811 first. If they’re advised to go to Emergency then they should do so.

Yukoners should also be aware that no hospital visitors are allowed except in limited circumstances and that active screening is in place at the entrances to all hospitals. Screeners have the difficult but important job of ensuring people have access to urgent care and keeping everyone safe. This means they may have to redirect people to other health service or turn away visitors. This is not an easy measure to enforce and Yukoners are asked to be understanding that these steps are being taken to ensure everyone’s safety.

Rural communities
To help protect rural communities in Yukon from the pandemic, the Chief Medical Officer of Health also now strongly recommends that all service providers engage with local or municipal and First Nations governments before they enter any communities. A Government of Yukon team is being established to support this engagement.

Work is also underway to help ensure that Yukoners across the territory are kept up to date with COVID-19 developments and advice in a range of ways, in recognition that not everyone has easy access to online information.

Critical and essential services
To support orders and recommendations made by Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health during the pandemic, the Government of Yukon has published guidelines that explain what critical and essential services are in the context of the pandemic and state the measures that businesses and workers must take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the territory.

Critical workers are defined as those whose services are necessary to preserve life, health and the basic running of society, such as health care, emergency services, energy, water and food.

Essential workers are defined as those whose services support the infrastructure needed for the health, safety and economic wellbeing of Yukoners, such as transportation, construction, and information and communication technologies.

The new guidelines also identify other services that are essential, for example, long-term care facility workers, child care workers, veterinarians and cleaning services.

Guidance on self-isolating
Yukoners who are self-isolating are reminded that they may go outdoors for fresh air or exercise and to carry out urgent errands such as collecting medication if no one else can do this for them, as long as they keep a distance of at least two meters – or six feet – from other people.

Safe spacing is not a law in Yukon but a strong recommendation and common sense during the pandemic. All Yukoners have a responsibility to help stop the spread of COVID-19 with the territory.

Student learning will continue through alternative learning opportunities starting on April 16 for the remainder of the school year. Yukon Learning Continuity Requirements have been developed and shared with Yukon schools to inform plans for at-home learning throughout the territory. The Department of Education worked with the British Columbia Ministry of Education and a committee of educators and central administration staff to develop the new requirements.

School principals and teachers are using these requirements to identify essential learning that needs to be covered for the remainder of the school year, develop learning plans to ensure continued learning and communicate with students and families. Schools are currently planning how to deliver at-home student learning with traditional and online resources.

Learning plans are being tailored to the unique needs of each individual school community and will incorporate a variety of ways to provide learning opportunities, including for families who may not have access to technology. These plans may look different in each Yukon school.

Each school will work with families before April 15 on how they will deliver at-home learning and complete the most essential learning starting April 16 through the remainder of the school year.

The health and safety of students, staff and communities is our first priority. The dedicated staff in Yukon schools are working diligently to adapt and ensure student learning continues during this unprecedented time. I want to acknowledge and thank the educators, principals and central administration staff for all their efforts to support student learning. I also want to thank and acknowledge the efforts of students, parents and families for their patience and understanding as we all adjust to new realities. Together we will continue to meet the learning needs of Yukon students.

Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee

I have worked closely with the Department of Education to reach the best decision for the protection of students and staff. Learning and health will always be partners. Even as face to face classes are suspended, the learning will continue.  It will be challenging for all, for teachers, students and parents and guardians, but by taking this step now, we are protecting the future.

Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley

Quick facts 
Schools will prioritize essential learning for the remainder of the school year based on the following principles for each grade level:

Learning Together and Early Kindergarten (K4):
Provide opportunities and resources for students to engage in learning through play, inquiry and hands-on experiences while supporting gross and fine motor development, oral language and social skills.
Assign about three hours for each student per week to engage in this type of learning.
Kindergarten to Grade 6:
Provide opportunities and resources for students to engage in building literacy and numeracy skills across the subject areas and the personal and social competencies of the curriculum.
Assign about five hours of work per week for each student.
Grades 7 to 9:
Provide opportunities and resources for students to engage in building literacy and numeracy skills across the subject areas and the personal and social competencies of the curriculum.
Assign about ten hours of work per week for each student.
Grades 10 to 12:
Provide activities, resources and supports for students to develop the learning standards’ competencies and understandings prioritized so students have the opportunity to be successful in all their current courses.
Assign about three hours of work per course for each student each week.
Work with Grade 12 students to identify those who need to complete the Grade 10 numeracy assessment and ensure they meet this requirement.
Yukon schools continue to be used by teachers and staff, but remain unavailable to students and user groups at this time.

At this time, there are no changes to the 2019–20 or 2020–21 school calendars. The 2020–21 school calendars are now posted on Yukon.ca/school-holiday-dates and are being shared with schools.

Minister of Community Services John Streicker signed the Ministerial Order under the Civil Emergency Measures Act as a means to ensure that enforcement officers stationed at Yukon’s borders have the legal authority and tools needed to deny entry to non-essential travelers while still permitting essential and critical services and people to return home.

The new orders specify whom and under what circumstances entry will be permitted, and require travelers entering Yukon to produce appropriate identification, documentation and a detailed self-isolation plan.

These orders will not impact the delivery of critical and essential services, or the ability of people to transit through Yukon to another destination within 24 hours. Access to Yukon will need to be justified, based on purpose of travel, and the ability to meet requirements set by Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health.

Quick facts 
Entry into Yukon is permitted for individuals providing acceptable evidence to an enforcement officer that they are:

Yukon residents
Non-resident family members of Yukon residents
Delivering a critical or essential service
Transiting through Yukon to a neighbouring jurisdiction (24-hour limitation);
Exercising an aboriginal or treaty right (for the time needed to exercise the right).

Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley has the following updates for the Yukon public on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

COVID-19 cases and recoveries
As of today, April 17, at 3 p.m. there is one new case of COVID-19 in the territory, bringing the total number of cases to nine. The new case is in Whitehorse and related to international travel. Contact tracing is underway.

Seven of the nine people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered and no one has had to go to a hospital.

Each case in Yukon so far can be traced to its origin and there continues to be no known community transmission in the territory. Community transmission is assumed to have occurred when it is no longer possible to trace how somebody became infected.

Information about COVID-19 tests is published on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered.

Testing for COVID-19
Starting today, information about COVID-19 tests will be published daily on Yukon.ca.

Yukon continues to have an aggressive strategy for testing for COVID-19 but as the incidence of influenza and other respiratory illnesses lessens in the territory, fewer individuals need to be tested. Also, with fewer people coming into Yukon than before due to border restrictions, the risk of imported COVID-19 has substantially decreased.

The Chief Medical Officer of Health office is continually re-examining the testing strategy for Yukon to ensure there are mechanisms in place to protect the territory’s most vulnerable citizens as well as to look for signs of community transmission.

Rapid test kits
Within the next couple of weeks Yukon expects to have a GeneXpert rapid test kit set up and running.  This will be for testing within a  hospital setting rather than for general use and can provide results quickly on site. New Spartan Cube machines are also expected to arrive in Yukon around the end of May for portable, rapid testing in different health care settings around the territory.

The Government of Yukon will also continue to send tests to the BC Centre for Disease Control by air transport.

Communal living guidance
The Government of Yukon has produced a new guide to help operators prevent and manage COVID-19 in communal settings such as homeless shelters, women’s shelters, youth shelters, transition homes, group homes and hostels. The guidance includes topics such as education, cleaning, personal protective equipment and monitoring and reporting.

The document is called Guidance for the Prevention and Management of COVID-19 in Communal Living Settings and is now on Yukon.ca.

Keeping COVID-19 at bay
Yukoners have succeeded in creating an environment where COVID-19 has not spread and are strongly advised to keep it that way by following the six steps to staying safe. The six steps are: physical distancing; regular hand washing; staying home when sick; not gathering in groups of 10 or more; avoiding travel to communities and self-isolating when required.
