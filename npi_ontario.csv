province's supply chain and make sure the heroes on the front lines have
 the essential goods and services they need in the fight against 
COVID-19 like ventilators, masks and swabs.
                                ""COVID-19 is impacting supply chains across Canada, and around 
the world,"" said Lisa Thompson, Minister of Government and Consumer 
Services. ""That's why we are proclaiming the Supply Chain Management Act
 to make sure we can deploy critical supplies, equipment and services to
 where they are needed most."" These regulations will enable the 
Ministry of Government and Consumer Services and the Ministry of Health 
to centrally manage public sector supply chains. It will allow the 
collection of key data on inventories, orders and supply constraints and
 the development of a virtual inventory tool so that demand for crucial 
supplies are visible and trackable. With these measures in place, the 
government can prioritize buying what is needed most, deploying them, 
and allocating them on a priority basis to support the delivery of 
essential services to Ontarians. Support will also be available 
to other public entities, such as publicly funded social service 
agencies and municipalities if they choose to participate. ""Ontario
 is implementing critical and necessary measures to ensure that we are 
able to protect the health and well-being of Ontarians,"" said Christine 
Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""This includes working 
with innovators and businesses across the province who can supply 
emergency products and cutting-edge solutions to support ongoing efforts
 to contain COVID-19."" Ontario has also launched Ontario Together,
 a new website that is helping businesses work with the province to meet
 the challenges of COVID-19. This removes barriers allowing Ontario's 
manufacturing sector to redeploy capacity towards the production of 
essential equipment.

issued the following statement in response to two deaths in Ontario 
long-term care homes related to COVID-19:
                                ""I am deeply saddened to report to Ontarians that there have been
 two deaths related to COVID-19 in our province's long-term care system. On
 Monday, March 23, a woman in her 90s passed away after testing positive
 for COVID-19 and being rushed to Lakeridge Health in Oshawa. She was a 
resident at Hillsdale Terraces, a long-term care home in Oshawa. This
 morning, an 80-year-old woman passed away at St. Joseph's Hospital in 
Hamilton, where she had been in isolation since being admitted to the 
hospital on March 16. She was a resident of Heritage Green Nursing Home 
in Stoney Creek. I offer my condolences to the families, friends 
and loved ones of these individuals, and to their long-term care 
communities. My thoughts are with you at this devastating time. We
 will not stop our fight against COVID-19. These deaths speak to the 
severity of this outbreak and emphasize why our government is taking 
extensive action to keep long-term care residents and staff safe. We have introduced enhanced measures
 in long-term care homes to enforce social and physical distancing and 
contain the spread of COVID-19, increased bed availability and ensure 
homes are able to provide isolation rooms, ensure sufficient nursing and
 personal support care staff are available, and as of today, put in 
place a temporary order under the March 17, 2020 declaration of 
emergency that gives homes the flexibility they need to deploy staff 
when and where they are needed. These and more enhanced safety measures 
are outlined here. The
 health and well-being of all Ontarians, including long-term care 
residents, their families, and staff is, as always, our government's 
number one priority. We will continue to put in place any process
 necessary to our fight against this outbreak so that we can protect our
 province's most vulnerable."""

situation, the Government of Ontario is providing immediate electricity 
rate relief for families, small businesses and farms paying time-of-use 
(TOU) rates.
                                For a 45-day period, the government is working to suspend 
time-of-use electricity rates, holding electricity prices to the 
off-peak rate of 10.1 cents-per-kilowatt-hour. This reduced price will 
be available 24 hours per day, seven days a week to all time-of-use 
customers, who make up the majority of electricity consumers in the 
province. By switching to a fixed off-peak rate, time-of-use customers 
will see rate reductions of over 50 per cent compared to on-peak rates. To
 deliver savings as quickly and conveniently as possible, this discount 
will be applied automatically to electricity bills without the need for 
customers to fill out an application form. ""During this 
unprecedented time, we are providing much-needed relief to Ontarians, 
specifically helping those who are doing the right thing by staying home
 and small businesses that have closed or are seeing fewer customers,"" 
said Premier Doug Ford. ""By adopting a fixed, 24/7 off-peak rate, we are
 making things a little easier during these difficult times and putting 
more money in people's pockets for other important priorities and 
necessities."" The Government of Ontario issued an Emergency Order
 under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act to apply the 
off-peak TOU electricity rate for residential, small businesses, and 
farm customers who currently pay TOU rates. ""Ontario is fortunate
 to have a strong electricity system we can rely on during these 
exceptional times, and our government is proud to provide additional 
relief to Ontarians who are doing their part to stay home,"" said Greg 
Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines. ""We
 thank the Ontario Energy Board and our partners at local distribution 
companies across the province for taking quick action to make this 
change and provide immediate support for hardworking people of Ontario,""

                                                The Ontario Energy Board sets time-of-use electricity rates for residential and small business customers through the Regulated Price Plan.Time-of-use prices as of November, 2019 ― Off-Peak: 10.1₵/kWh, Mid-Peak: 14.4₵/kWh, On-Peak: 20.8₵/kWhDepending on billing cycles, some customers will see these 
changes on their next electricity bill. TOU customers whose billing 
cycle ended before their local distribution company implemented this 
change will receive the reduced rate as a credit on a future bill.The Ontario Electricity Rebate
 (OER) will continue to provide a 31.8 per cent rebate on the sub-total 
bill amount for all existing Regulated Price Plan (RPP) consumers.There are approximately five million residential consumers, 
farms and some small businesses billed using time-of-use (TOU) 
electricity prices under the RPP.The Ontario Energy Board has extended the winter ban on disconnections to July 31st.

 workers, including those that work in the long-term care sector, are 
available, where and when they are needed. These enhanced measures will 
support the province's extensive efforts to contain the spread of 
COVID-19. 
                                On March 23, Ontario enacted a new order under the March 17, 2020
 declaration of emergency to ensure personnel are properly deployed to 
help prevent the spread of COVID-19 to keep staff, volunteers and 
residents in long-term care homes safe. This temporary order would give 
long-term care homes the ability to free-up valuable staff, identify 
staffing priorities, and develop, modify and implement redeployment 
plans. Under this temporary order long-term care homes will be 
able to respond to, prevent and alleviate an outbreak of COVID-19 by 
carrying out measures such as: Redeploying staff within different locations in (or between) facilities of the health service provider;Changing
 the assignment of work, including assigning non-bargaining unit 
employees or contractors to perform bargaining unit work;Changing the scheduling of work or shift assignments;Deferring
 or cancelling vacations, absences or other leaves, regardless of 
whether such vacations, absences or leaves are established by statute, 
regulation, agreement or otherwise;Employing extra part-time or temporary staff or contractors, including for the purpose of performing bargaining unit work;Using volunteers to perform work, including to perform bargaining unit work; andProviding appropriate training or education as needed to staff and volunteers to achieve the purposes of a redeployment plan. Dr.
 David Williams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, has also 
issued a new directive for long-term care homes under the Long-Term Care Homes Act, 2007
 that restricts residents from leaving a home for short visits with 
family and friends. In doing so, the province is ensuring residents do 
not inadvertently contract COVID-19 while out of the home and spread the
 virus upon their return. Instead, residents who want to go outside will
 be able to remain on the home's property and maintain safe social 
distancing from any family and friends who visit them. ""Ontario 
is implementing critical and necessary measures to ensure that we are 
able to protect the health and well-being of Ontarians, in particular 
our seniors,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of 
Health. ""We have been working for several months now, with all our 
partners across the system, from public health to hospitals and 
long-term care operators, to put processes in place to contain this 
virus and be ready to respond to any scenario."" ""The health and 
well-being of all Ontarians, including long-term care residents, their 
families, and staff will continue to be our government's number one 
priority,"" said Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""Our
 government is taking all the necessary precautions to ensure our loved 
ones in Ontario's long-term care homes are safe and secure."" To 
help maintain the health and safety of residents, staff and essential 
visitors, Ontario is also increasing long-term care bed availability to 
ensure homes are able to provide isolation rooms when required, as well 
as providing long-term beds for people on the long-term care waitlist. 
In particular, patients in the hospital who no longer require hospital 
services will benefit from this increased long-term care bed capacity, 
and their placement into long-term care will also free up hospital beds 
to treat acute patients. In addition, Ontario is making necessary
 adjustments to ensure both resident and families' wishes are taken into
 account, and a sufficient number of staff are available to support 
long-term care home residents. Updated procedures will bring further 
clarity around admitting, discharging, and readmitting long-term care 
home residents at a time when homes are trying their best to prevent the
 spread of COVID-19 among residents, staff and essential visitors. Lastly,
 the province is ensuring sufficient nursing and personal support care 
staff are available to support long-term care home residents. All new 
nurses and personal support workers hired to help long-term care homes 
cope with COVID-19 will be screened to ensure they are qualified and 
present no risk to long-term care home residents. These critical 
steps add to the protocols that have recently been implemented to ensure
 a safe and secure environment for residents. Long-term care 
homes continue to restrict non-essential visits and actively screen 
essential visitors, staff, students, volunteers, residents moving into a
 long-term care home and residents returning to a long-term care home. As
 of March 9, 2020, when long-term care homes submit samples for standard
 respiratory testing, they are also being tested for COVID-19 
automatically to ensure the province identifies potentially unknown 
cases.

under the new order temporarily supersede the provisions of a collective
 agreement, including lay-off, seniority/service or bumping provisions.As part of the ongoing government effort to prevent and 
contain the spread of COVID-19 across the province, the government has 
provided initial emergency funding to the long-term care home sector of 
$50 million effective immediately.

                                The province will be providing municipalities and organizations

hire additional staff, and find ways to promote social distancing and 
self-isolation to keep clients safe and healthy. Ontario's municipal

individuals who do not qualify for emergency financial supports under 
federal programs. The government is putting in place an expanded 
Emergency Assistance program administered through Ontario Works (OW) to 
cover these individuals' needs such as food, rent, informal childcare, 
and services. There will also be discretionary benefits available to 
those who already receive social assistance. This new funding 
will help individuals and families in financial crisis who are not able 
to access federal assistance to cover needs such as food, rent, 
medicine, transportation and other services during this public health 
crisis. Funding will also be made available to organizations delivering 
social services to vulnerable First Nations individuals and families. 
Individuals can apply online at Ontario.ca/community. ""Protecting
 our most vulnerable is an absolute priority, as the COVID-19 crisis 
continues to develop,"" said Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community 
and Social Services. ""We're expanding access to temporary emergency 
assistance so that individuals who have no other means of financial 
support can stay safe and healthy."" This fund will also help 
local communities support their shelter systems during this health 
crisis. The province's 47 municipal service managers will deliver this 
funding, ensuring clients are receiving the support they need, and will 
make local decisions on community funding. ""We are acting quickly
 to support those who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless 
during this unprecedented time,"" said Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal
 Affairs and Housing. ""This funding will go straight to communities, who
 know best what the immediate needs are on the ground in their local 
shelters."" ""This new funding will provide much needed support to 
our province's most vulnerable as we continue to take decisive action to
 contain the spread of COVID-19,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier

questions to inform those who are concerned they may have contracted 
COVID-19. In a matter of seconds, this tool will help people determine 
if they are negative or it will provide them with guidance on where to

choices about what to do, while the province collects real-time data to 
enhance our ongoing response."" The tool guides individuals 
through a series of questions and, based on their responses, users are 
provided clear direction on what action to take. These next steps could 
include: continue to practice social distancing; self-isolate; call a 
primary care provider or Telehealth Ontario; or in the case of symptoms 
such as severe difficulty breathing or severe chest pain, call 911 or go
 to the emergency department. Those people whose self-assessment 
shows they may have COVID-19 will be advised to call their primary care 
provider, who can conduct a virtual assessment by phone or other 
technology. People can also call Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000 
(24/7), where they can speak to a health care professional about their 
symptoms. As announced last week, the province is rapidly expanding 
service capacity to ensure timely responses and has increased 
Telehealth's line capacity to more than 2,000 to help manage the high 
daily call volume. In some cases, based on the virtual 
assessment, individuals may be referred by their primary care provider 
or Telehealth Ontario to one of the province's 58 assessment centres for
 an in-person assessment. These centres, which are by referral only, are
 helping to ease the pressures on hospital emergency departments using 
innovative care models, including in some cases drive-thru testing. As
 part of the investment of up to $304 million to enhance the province's 
response to COVID-19, Ontario will be establishing additional assessment
 centres across the province. The centres are located in dedicated 
spaces, which will facilitate high-quality care to protect broader 
patient populations. The 58 centres that have already opened are in 
several municipalities across the province.  Visit Ontario's website to learn more about how the province continues to protect Ontarians from COVID-19.

during this COVID-19 outbreak, Ontario plans to exempt certain child 
care centres from the order to close all licensed child care centres pursuant to the state of emergency declared earlier this week. This initiative is being done in partnership with service system managers and First Nations partners.
                                ""We need to help our nurses, doctors and frontline care workers 
to be able to focus on protecting the health and well-being of all 
Ontarians,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of 
Health. ""By allowing select child care centres to open their doors 
during these challenging times, our province's courageous frontline 
workers can rest assured knowing that their families are also being 
looked after.""  Health care and other frontline workers, 
including doctors, nurses, paramedics, firefighters, police, and 
correctional officers, will be able to access safe, 
local emergency child care. These child care centres will be required to
 follow existing health and safety requirements and have a plan in place
 should any staff, children or parents be exposed to the virus. ""During
 this unprecedented situation, we need to do everything we can to ensure
 our health care and other frontline staff have the support they need to
 continue to work,"" said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education. ""At the 
same time, we need to protect the safety of the staff and children at 
these centres. For that reason, we are putting strict measures in place,
 such as restricting the types of centres that can re-open and keeping 
the number of children in any one centre low.""  Once emergency child care centres open, a list of locations will be made available on ontario.ca/coronavirus.

the March 17, 2020 declaration of emergency to ensure health care 
resources are available to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and keep 
individuals and families safe. This temporary order would give hospitals
 the ability to cancel and postpone services to free-up space and 
valuable staff, identify staffing priorities, and develop, modify and 
implement redeployment plans.
                                ""On the best advice of Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health,
 and in response to clear and urgent requests from our frontline health 
service providers, the province is taking decisive action to ensure we 
can continue to be responsive and nimble as the number of confirmed 
COVID-19 cases grows,"" said Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General. ""While 
normal protocols are important in routine times, these extraordinary 
steps will ensure our health sector workers are there, where and when 
they are needed, to care for Ontarians and support our extensive efforts
 to contain this virus."" Under this temporary order hospitals 
will be able to respond to, prevent and alleviate an outbreak of 
COVID-19 by carrying out measures such as:  Redeploying staff within different locations in (or between) facilities of the hospital;Redeploying staff to work in COVID-19 assessment centres;Changing
 the assignment of work, including assigning non-bargaining unit 
employees or contractors to perform bargaining unit work;Changing the scheduling of work or shift assignments;Deferring
 or cancelling vacations, absences or other leaves, regardless of 
whether such vacations, absences or leaves are established by statute, 
regulation, agreement or otherwise;Employing extra part-time or temporary staff or contractors, including for the purpose of performing bargaining unit work;Using volunteers to perform work, including to perform bargaining work; andProviding appropriate training or education as needed to staff and volunteers to achieve the purposes of a redeployment plan. When
 utilized by hospitals, these redeployment plans temporarily supersede 
the provisions of a collective agreement, including lay-off, 
seniority/service or bumping provisions. For example, currently a 
hospital would be required to post a lay-off notice and wait a period of
 time before being able to move a nurse or other unionized employee from
 an emergency department to a COVID-19 assessment centre. These measures
 would allow for the redeployment of staff to address the containment of
 COVID-19 without restriction or delay. ""I want to once again 
thank our nurses, doctors and frontline care workers for their 
extraordinary dedication and commitment as we continue to work together 
to protect the health and well-being of Ontarians,"" said Christine 
Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""These temporary 
measures are necessary to ensure hospitals are able to effectively 
deploy personnel to where help and support is needed most in their 
facilities."" This time-limited order is valid for 14 days unless revoked or renewed in accordance with the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act.

with people outside of your immediate families.If you are returning from travel outside of Canada or if you

locally, Ontario is taking decisive and swift action to ensure the 
province continues to protect the health and well-being of Ontarians.
                                To ensure that anyone in need of care can receive it, Ontario is 
waiving the three-month waiting period for Ontario Health Insurance Plan
 (OHIP) coverage. Additionally, the province will cover the cost of 
COVID-19 services for uninsured people who do not meet the criteria for 
OHIP coverage. Together, these measures will ensure that no one will be 
discouraged from seeking screening or treatment for COVID-19 for 
financial reasons.""The health and well-being of Ontarians 
continues to be our government's number one priority,"" said Christine 
Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""That's why we're 
working to guarantee that anyone who needs screening or care for 
COVID-19 will get it. In doing so, we can further help ensure we contain
 the spread of this virus."" These measures are in addition to Ontario's recent announcement that Ontarians with expiring and expired health cards will continue to have access to insured health services. Ontario
 is continuing to work with all partners across the system, from public 
health to hospitals and community care, to do everything we can to 
contain COVID-19 and ensure that the system is prepared to respond to 
any scenario. Visit Ontario's website to learn more about how the province continues to protect Ontarians from COVID-19.

with people outside of your immediate families.If you are returning from travel outside of Canada or if you
 believe you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 symptoms, you 
should begin to self-isolate for a period of 14 days, including social distancing and tracking your symptoms and how you feel.

Health, and Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General, issued the following 
statement regarding regulatory changes to temporary absences and parole 
at Ontario's adult correctional facilities as a further precautionary 
response to COVID-19:
                                ""As Ontario continues to act to slow the spread of COVID-19, we 
are making further changes to protect our frontline workers and our 
health care system from the burden an outbreak in our correctional 
system could cause. On March 13, we announced measures to protect
 Ontario's adult correctional facilities from COVID-19 by granting 
intermittent inmates, who serve time on the weekends, temporary absences
 from custody, and temporarily halting personal visits. Intermittent 
inmates have already been deemed low-risk by the courts and remain in 
the community Monday to Friday to live and work. Building on these changes, Ontario is implementing amendments to Regulation 778 under the Ministry of Correctional Services Act to
 allow senior corrections officials to expand the use of temporary 
absences and for the Ontario Parole Board to use alternatives to 
in-person meetings. Going forward, correctional services will 
have the option to issue temporary absences beyond the current 72-hour 
maximum. This means those serving intermittent sentences, who have been 
granted a temporary absence will not have to report to a correctional 
facility every weekend, which will avoid cycling individuals back and 
forth between the community and a correctional facility.  In 
addition, the longer-term temporary absences will allow for early 
release of those inmates who are near the end of their sentence. To 
ensure public safety, inmates would be carefully assessed to ensure they
 are a low risk to reoffend. Those inmates who have been convicted of 
serious crimes, such as violent crimes or crimes involving guns, would 
not be considered for early release. A second regulatory 
amendment will allow the Ontario Parole Board to conduct hearings by 
electronic or written means, rather than solely in-person, providing 
alternate options for hearings. We continue to evaluate all 
options to limit the possible spread of COVID-19 within our correctional
 system. These regulatory amendments will help us preserve the integrity
 of our health care system, protect our frontline workers and help keep 
our communities safe."""

prepaid testing fees due to the current situation. If you have a road 
test scheduled and would like to reschedule please do so in advance of 
your appointment date. This direction will be in place until 
further notice, based on the advice of Ontario's Chief Medical Officer

respond to COVID-19 by convening an emergency sitting of the legislature
 and passing two pieces of legislation which will protect the jobs of 
employees who self-isolate or quarantine, help keep store shelves 
stocked and give municipal councils the flexibility to continue 
operations while maintaining social distance.
                                The legislation passed with unanimous consent by only 26 MPPs. 
The number of members participating in this extraordinary session was 
intentionally kept small in order to practice social distancing and help
 prevent the spread of COVID-19. A first in Ontario history. ""I 
want to thank all parties for coming together to pass this important 
legislation so we can deliver immediate relief to Ontario workers and 
families,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""The health and safety of the people 
of Ontario is our number one priority and that's why we are protecting 
the jobs of workers and making sure that essentials like groceries, 
household basics, and medicine can arrive on store shelves. We must work
 together as Team Ontario to slow the spread of COVID-19 and flatten the
 curve."" The Employment Standards Amendment Act (Infectious Disease Emergencies),
 2020 provides job-protected leave for employees who are in isolation or
 quarantine due to COVID-19, or those who need to be away from work to 
care for children because of school or day care closures or to care for 
other relatives. These measures are retroactive to January 25, 2020, the
 date the first presumptive COVID-19 case was confirmed in Ontario. The 
legislation will also make it clear employees cannot be required to show
 sick notes. ""During this time of great uncertainty, the last 
thing employees should have to worry about is job security,"" said Monte 
McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""People
 can't be punished for following the advice of our leading medical 
health professionals."" The Municipal Emergency Act, 2020
 will ensure that for the near future, the delivery of goods to 
Ontario's businesses and consumers isn't impacted by municipal noise 
by-laws that may unintentionally be impeding such deliveries when they 
are most urgently needed. The legislation also gives municipalities the 
ability to fully conduct Council, local board and committee meetings 
electronically when faced with local and province-wide emergencies, 
empowering the government's municipal partners to respond quickly when 
in-person meetings cannot be held. ""These changes will assist in 
getting goods to market in a more expeditious manner. Our government 
wants to do everything we can to help connect distribution centres with 
grocery stores and pharmacies to replenish empty shelves more quickly,"" 
said Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. ""As well, 
we are helping communities respond to this crisis by allowing councils 
to conduct meetings remotely. These changes empower municipalities to

respond to COVID-19 by convening an emergency sitting of the legislature
 and passing two pieces of legislation which will protect the jobs of 
employees who self-isolate or quarantine, help keep store shelves 
stocked and give municipal councils the flexibility to continue 
operations while maintaining social distance.
                                The legislation passed with unanimous consent by only 26 MPPs. 
The number of members participating in this extraordinary session was 
intentionally kept small in order to practice social distancing and help
 prevent the spread of COVID-19. A first in Ontario history. ""I 
want to thank all parties for coming together to pass this important 
legislation so we can deliver immediate relief to Ontario workers and 
families,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""The health and safety of the people 
of Ontario is our number one priority and that's why we are protecting 
the jobs of workers and making sure that essentials like groceries, 
household basics, and medicine can arrive on store shelves. We must work
 together as Team Ontario to slow the spread of COVID-19 and flatten the
 curve."" The Employment Standards Amendment Act (Infectious Disease Emergencies),
 2020 provides job-protected leave for employees who are in isolation or
 quarantine due to COVID-19, or those who need to be away from work to 
care for children because of school or day care closures or to care for 
other relatives. These measures are retroactive to January 25, 2020, the
 date the first presumptive COVID-19 case was confirmed in Ontario. The 
legislation will also make it clear employees cannot be required to show
 sick notes. ""During this time of great uncertainty, the last 
thing employees should have to worry about is job security,"" said Monte 
McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""People
 can't be punished for following the advice of our leading medical 
health professionals."" The Municipal Emergency Act, 2020
 will ensure that for the near future, the delivery of goods to 
Ontario's businesses and consumers isn't impacted by municipal noise 
by-laws that may unintentionally be impeding such deliveries when they 
are most urgently needed. The legislation also gives municipalities the 
ability to fully conduct Council, local board and committee meetings 
electronically when faced with local and province-wide emergencies, 
empowering the government's municipal partners to respond quickly when 
in-person meetings cannot be held. ""These changes will assist in 
getting goods to market in a more expeditious manner. Our government 
wants to do everything we can to help connect distribution centres with 
grocery stores and pharmacies to replenish empty shelves more quickly,"" 
said Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. ""As well, 
we are helping communities respond to this crisis by allowing councils 
to conduct meetings remotely. These changes empower municipalities to 
respond quickly and continue to function when in-person meetings cannot 
be held, and council decisions need to be made."""

                                As part of the province's enhanced measures, the Ministry of 
Transportation and Ministry of Health, in cooperation with the Ministry 
of Government and Consumer Services and ServiceOntario, is extending the
 validity period of driving products, services and health cards. These 
changes reduce the need for in-person visits to ServiceOntario, 
International Registration Plan offices and DriveTest centres during the
 COVID-19 outbreak, helping to promote social distancing and contain the
 spread of the virus. These new regulations include extensions 
for driver licences, licence plate validation, Ontario Photo Cards, 
and Commercial Vehicle Operator Registration certificates, among others.
 Expiring and expired health cards will continue to provide access to 
health services. The Ministry of Transportation is 
also automatically extending the due dates for medical or vision 
reports, which both reduces the need for in-person visits, but also 
ensures that patients do not need to visit their doctors, helping the 
health system to focus on containing COVID-19. ""We have a 
responsibility to Ontarians to ensure that we take every possible step 
to enable social distancing and stop the spread of COVID-19,"" said 
Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""By 
implementing these additional measures, Ontarians can avoid putting 
themselves at risk and will continue to have access to the services that
 they need, when they need them."" This extension will be in place
 until such time that, based on the advice of Ontario's Chief Medical 
Officer of Health and public health officials, the current situation 
improves. ""We're working with all partners across the system to 
do everything we can to contain this virus and ensure that the system is
 prepared to respond to any scenario,"" said Caroline Mulroney, Minister 
of Transportation. ""These changes will help relieve the burden already 
faced by Ontarians and businesses by providing more time to renew 
their licences and permits without being penalized, while 
also reducing the need for in-person visits."" The Ministry of 
Transportation will continue to deliver time-critical services, 
including Motor Vehicle Inspection Station Stock orders and Single-Trip 
Oversize/Overweight permits. ""We urge our customers not to visit a
 ServiceOntario centre unless absolutely necessary,"" said Lisa Thompson,
 Minister of Government and Consumer Services. ""We encourage people to 
complete transactions online or use the extended validation period, and 
to follow the advice of our medical professions and stay at home."" As
 per advice from the Chief Medical Officer, we are encouraging everyone 
to take appropriate measures to protect themselves from the novel 
coronavirus. This includes staying home if you are sick and avoiding 
contact with people who are sick.

Health, and Doug Downey, Attorney General, issued the following 
statement in response to COVID-19 and the government's commitment to 
keep communities safe while continuing to hold offenders accountable:
                                ""The health and well-being of Ontarians is our government's 
number one priority. This commitment extends across the vast network of 
justice partners and individuals who interact with the justice system on
 a daily basis. We are working around the clock with our partners
 to respond to this constantly evolving public health issue. Adjustments
 are being made throughout the justice system to minimize disruption and
 continue to provide seamless, responsive justice services to all 
Ontarians, particularly the most vulnerable members of our communities. Technology Solutions and Prioritizing Urgent Matters To
 sustain these efforts and to address health and safety concerns raised 
by legal service professionals, Ontario courts and tribunals are 
limiting in-person proceedings and making use of audio and video 
conferencing to hear priority matters remotely, where possible. Justice 
partners are working collaboratively to develop and deploy technology 
solutions and other innovative tools across the province to ensure 
urgent matters can be heard without needing to appear in person. This 
approach will also help to mitigate the potential impacts of possible 
service disruptions. Courts and tribunals are also deferring non-urgent 
matters until they can be managed safely and securely.  Ontario's
 judges and justices of the peace continue to prioritize critical 
matters such as criminal and child protection proceedings. There is 
strong collaboration across the system to ensure that urgent and 
priority legal matters continue to be heard before our courts and 
tribunals. All Tribunals Ontario in-person proceedings, including
 at the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal, Landlord and Tenant Board and 
Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, are postponed and will be rescheduled 
at a later date. Where feasible, alternative hearing options such as 
written and telephone hearings will be considered. Front-line counter 
services will be closed until further notice. We are also working
 very closely with our partners and colleagues in Ontario's court 
systems to ensure Ontarians can see justice done while also prioritizing
 the protection of public health in the province. The following actions 
have been taken across the justice system:  The Superior 
Court of Justice has suspended all regular court operations until 
further notice, while continuing to hear urgent matters during this 
emergency period.All sittings of the Small Claims Court in Ontario are suspended until further notice.  The
 Ontario Court of Justice has established procedures to reduce the 
number of people who attend court in-person for criminal and family 
matters. All non-urgent matters have been adjourned.All Provincial Offences Act
 matters scheduled up to and including April 3, 2020 will be adjourned 
and rescheduled to a later date. Tickets, fines or other court business 
may be handled online.  The Court of Appeal has suspended all
 scheduled appeals until April 3, 2020. During this period, urgent 
appeals will be heard based on either the written materials or remotely.
  Keeping People Safe We are 
committed to ensuring Ontarians remain safe and secure during this 
challenging time and are looking at all tools to help individuals and 
families stay in their homes. As part of this approach, the Ministry of 
the Attorney General has been granted an order suspending the 
enforcement of residential evictions until ordered otherwise by the 
court. Tribunals Ontario will not issue any new eviction orders until 
further notice. Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any 
scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week. We
 want to thank our partners at the Superior and Ontario Courts of 
Justice, Tribunals Ontario, and the front-line workers across our 
justice system who are working hard to keep everyone safe and healthy 
while maintaining the administration of justice in our province. Ontario
 takes the health and safety of court users, staff and the judiciary 
very seriously. As this public health situation evolves, the government 
is committed to providing Ontarians with safe and reliable access to 
critical front-line services, including supporting the delivery of 
justice at its courthouses and tribunals. We are closely monitoring 
developments and will continue to provide updates as the situation 
evolves.""

provided him excellent care. This death is further evidence of 
the increasingly seriousness of the situation we are in, which is why 
the province has been taking decisive steps to manage the spread of

every day lives, but they are necessary to ensure that we can slow the 
spread of COVID-19 and protect our people. We're working with all 
partners across the system, from public health to hospitals and

Premier and Minister of Health, issued the following statement about 
ongoing and extensive efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19:
                                ""Since we first learned of COVID-19, Ontario has actively 
monitored the developing situation and has acted decisively to contain 
the spread of this new virus to protect the health and well-being of all
 Ontarians. Given the latest developments both internationally 
and here at home, including growing evidence of community spread, the 
province is taking further action to help prevent the spread of 
COVID-19. Based on advice from Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of 
Health, Dr. David Williams, Ontario is responding to the evolving 
situation by moving forward with new measures to help contain the virus,
 including the recommended closure of all recreational programs and 
libraries, private schools, daycares, churches and other faith settings,
 as well as bars and restaurants, except those that may only offer 
takeout or delivery. These closures would be in line with the updated 
guidance to avoid large gatherings of over 50 people. We 
recognize that these measures will significantly impact the lives of 
many Ontarians. However, as the number of cases in Ontario continues to 
grow, we must heed the advice of our public health experts and take 
decisive action to protect the health and safety of the public, our 
government's top priority. As this situation continues to evolve,
 we are prepared to continue to respond quickly and effectively to any 
scenario to keep Ontarians safe."" Read the latest recommendations

issued the following statement detailing enhanced public health measures
 to help contain the spread of COVID-19:
                                ""Following a number of significant 
announcements regarding travel and public health measures over the past 
72 hours, and after further consultations with my colleagues across 
Canada, I would like to take the opportunity to clarify my guidance to 
Ontarians on COVID-19. This is an evolving situation, and your 
role in helping to manage the spread of COVID-19 in Ontario is critical.
 It is imperative that we take steps now and take steps together to 
reduce opportunities for transmission. I am asking for your cooperation 
in following the advice below as best you can over the coming weeks. By 
working together, we can make a difference in this outbreak and protect 
those among us who are most vulnerable to COVID-19. The symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, new cough and difficulty breathing, and these may occur within 14 days of an exposure to another case.  Additional closures I
 am strongly recommending a further limitation to public gatherings from
 my advice on March 12, 2020. I am further advising Ontarians to avoid large gatherings of over 50 people. In addition, I am specifically requesting the closure of the following settings as soon as possible:  All recreational programs and librariesAll private schoolsAll daycaresAll churches and other faith settingsAll bars and restaurants, with the exception of restaurants that can shift to takeout/delivery mechanisms If you do not have any symptoms of COVID-19 Everyone
 in Ontario should be practicing social distancing to reduce their 
exposure to other people. This means that you can carry out daily 
activities, such as going to work (if you cannot work from home) and 
doing necessary shopping and appointments.   I ask that 
everyone in Ontario does their best to avoid close contact with people 
outside of their immediate families. Close contact includes being within
 2 meters of another person.  In addition: If you believe you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 symptoms, I recommend that you begin to self-monitor
 for a period of 14 days. This means that, in addition to social 
distancing, you should track how you feel. You should take your 
temperature daily and log any other symptoms that develop (e.g., sore 
throat, new cough). You can share these records with your primary care 
provider over the phone if you seek assessment services.   All persons over 70 years of age and individuals who are immunocompromised are advised to self-isolate
 for a period of 14 days. This means that you should only leave your 
home or see other people for essential reasons.  Where possible, you 
should seek services over the phone or internet or ask for help from 
friends, family or neighbours with essential errands.  If you have travelled outside of Canada in the last 14 days If you have travelled and are not a healthcare worker or another essential service worker, I ask that you self-isolate for 14 days since your arrival in Canada. People who are self-isolating should not go to work. In addition:  Workers
 who have travelled and are part of workplaces that are essential to 
daily living are able to return to work as long as they are 
asymptomatic. However, they should self-monitor 
for a period of 14 days and identify themselves to their employer so 
that a plan can be put into place to ensure the protection of those 
workplaces.Children under the age of 16 years who have travelled outside of Canada should also self-isolate
 for a period of 14 days. Parents should actively monitor their 
children's symptoms. Children who are self-isolating should stay at home
 and avoid social gathering points such as community centres or parks.  Public Health Ontario has excellent fact sheets on how to self monitor and self isolate. If you start to feel symptoms of COVID-19 I am requesting anyone who begins to feel unwell (fever, new cough or difficulty breathing) to return home and self-isolate
 immediately. People who are self-isolating should seek clinical 
assessment over the phone - either through TeleHealth Ontario 
(1-866-797-0000) or by calling their primary care provider's office. If 
you need additional assessment, your primary care provider or TeleHealth
 will direct you to in-person care options. If you are in medical 
distress and need urgent care, you should call 911 and let them know 
what you are self-isolating because of COVID-19. If you are an employer I
 am asking all employers in Ontarians to facilitate virtual work 
arrangements to enable employees to work from home where possible to 
enable workers to limit their activities, care for children and to self 
isolate. However, I recognize that there are a number of workplaces 
where this is not possible. I would ask those employers to use their 
judgement to sustain operations in a manner that maintains social 
distancing. If need to seek health care for COVID-19 If you are unwell and need to seek health assessment for COVID-19 there are three options to available:    A Self Assessment Tool available at: https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirusTelehealth Ontario at: 1-866-797-0000 (24/7)Your
 primary care provider - you should call your primary care provider and 
they will provide virtual assessment by phone or other technology. You 
should not book an in-person visit for COVID-19 assessment without first
 having a virtual assessment.  If you require an 
in-person health assessment, you will be referred to an appropriate 
location for in-person health assessment.  Only people with COVID-19 
symptoms will be tested.   I want to remind all Ontarians 
that there are important actions that they should be taking every day in
 order to protect your health. These include:       washing your hands often with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizersneezing and cough into your sleeveavoid touching your eyes, nose or mouthavoid contact with people who are sickstay
 at home if you are sick. In particular, do not visit a long-term care, 
retirement home or other congregate living situation.  Thank
 you for all of your support. These are difficult times, but together we
 will move through and protect the most vulnerable among us."""

                                ""Following a number of significant 
announcements regarding travel and public health measures over the past 
72 hours, and after further consultations with my colleagues across 
Canada, I would like to take the opportunity to clarify my guidance to 
Ontarians on COVID-19. This is an evolving situation, and your 
role in helping to manage the spread of COVID-19 in Ontario is critical.
 It is imperative that we take steps now and take steps together to 
reduce opportunities for transmission. I am asking for your cooperation 
in following the advice below as best you can over the coming weeks. By 
working together, we can make a difference in this outbreak and protect 
those among us who are most vulnerable to COVID-19. The symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, new cough and difficulty breathing, and these may occur within 14 days of an exposure to another case.  Additional closures I
 am strongly recommending a further limitation to public gatherings from
 my advice on March 12, 2020. I am further advising Ontarians to avoid large gatherings of over 50 people. In addition, I am specifically requesting the closure of the following settings as soon as possible:  All recreational programs and librariesAll private schoolsAll daycaresAll churches and other faith settingsAll bars and restaurants, with the exception of restaurants that can shift to takeout/delivery mechanisms If you do not have any symptoms of COVID-19 Everyone
 in Ontario should be practicing social distancing to reduce their 
exposure to other people. This means that you can carry out daily 
activities, such as going to work (if you cannot work from home) and 
doing necessary shopping and appointments.   I ask that 
everyone in Ontario does their best to avoid close contact with people 
outside of their immediate families. Close contact includes being within
 2 meters of another person.  In addition: If you believe you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 symptoms, I recommend that you begin to self-monitor
 for a period of 14 days. This means that, in addition to social 
distancing, you should track how you feel. You should take your 
temperature daily and log any other symptoms that develop (e.g., sore 
throat, new cough). You can share these records with your primary care 
provider over the phone if you seek assessment services.   All persons over 70 years of age and individuals who are immunocompromised are advised to self-isolate
 for a period of 14 days. This means that you should only leave your 
home or see other people for essential reasons.  Where possible, you 
should seek services over the phone or internet or ask for help from 
friends, family or neighbours with essential errands.  If you have travelled outside of Canada in the last 14 days If you have travelled and are not a healthcare worker or another essential service worker, I ask that you self-isolate for 14 days since your arrival in Canada. People who are self-isolating should not go to work. In addition:  Workers
 who have travelled and are part of workplaces that are essential to 
daily living are able to return to work as long as they are 
asymptomatic. However, they should self-monitor 
for a period of 14 days and identify themselves to their employer so 
that a plan can be put into place to ensure the protection of those 
workplaces.Children under the age of 16 years who have travelled outside of Canada should also self-isolate
 for a period of 14 days. Parents should actively monitor their 
children's symptoms. Children who are self-isolating should stay at home
 and avoid social gathering points such as community centres or parks.  Public Health Ontario has excellent fact sheets on how to self monitor and self isolate. If you start to feel symptoms of COVID-19 I am requesting anyone who begins to feel unwell (fever, new cough or difficulty breathing) to return home and self-isolate
 immediately. People who are self-isolating should seek clinical 
assessment over the phone - either through TeleHealth Ontario 
(1-866-797-0000) or by calling their primary care provider's office. If 
you need additional assessment, your primary care provider or TeleHealth
 will direct you to in-person care options. If you are in medical 
distress and need urgent care, you should call 911 and let them know 
what you are self-isolating because of COVID-19. If you are an employer I
 am asking all employers in Ontarians to facilitate virtual work 
arrangements to enable employees to work from home where possible to 
enable workers to limit their activities, care for children and to self 
isolate. However, I recognize that there are a number of workplaces 
where this is not possible. I would ask those employers to use their 
judgement to sustain operations in a manner that maintains social 
distancing. If need to seek health care for COVID-19 If you are unwell and need to seek health assessment for COVID-19 there are three options to available:    A Self Assessment Tool available at: https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirusTelehealth Ontario at: 1-866-797-0000 (24/7)Your
 primary care provider - you should call your primary care provider and 
they will provide virtual assessment by phone or other technology. You 
should not book an in-person visit for COVID-19 assessment without first
 having a virtual assessment.  If you require an 
in-person health assessment, you will be referred to an appropriate 
location for in-person health assessment.  Only people with COVID-19 
symptoms will be tested.   I want to remind all Ontarians 
that there are important actions that they should be taking every day in
 order to protect your health. These include:       washing your hands often with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizersneezing and cough into your sleeveavoid touching your eyes, nose or mouthavoid contact with people who are sickstay
 at home if you are sick. In particular, do not visit a long-term care, 
retirement home or other congregate living situation.  Thank
 you for all of your support. These are difficult times, but together we
 will move through and protect the most vulnerable among us."""

following statement in response to the impact of COVID-19 on Ontario's 
finances and economy:
                                ""The events of recent weeks have caused anxiety for individuals, 
families and businesses across our province and around the world. As I 
said last week, these developments are the latest reminder that Ontario 
is part of an integrated global economy. As Premier Ford has made clear,
 our government will ensure the necessary resources are in place to 
protect the health of people and our economy in this province. Circumstances
 have changed rapidly in recent days. Markets around the world are 
volatile.  Employers and workers are feeling the economic impacts. The 
World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. 
During that time, I have been in frequent conversations with various 
experts, my fellow finance ministers, business and union leaders, and my
 colleagues at Queen's Park.  At the request of Premier Ford, I 
have convened a regular meeting of the ministers in our government who 
share economic responsibilities. The work of that committee includes 
reaching out on a daily basis to leaders at businesses big and small, 
including at our financial institutions, as well as unions, to ensure we
 have the latest information, and that there is an open line of 
communication as the government works to address COVID-19's impact on 
the economy.   In response to events here at home and around the 
world, private-sector economists have revised the economic outlook used 
to develop the 2020 Ontario Budget scheduled to be released next Wednesday.   As
 Ontario's Minister of Finance, it is important that I introduce a 
financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the
 dynamic situation. So instead of a full Budget, I will release an 
economic and fiscal update on March 25 based on our best understanding 
of the current situation.  This update will include a realistic 
one-year outlook based on current economic projections. It will provide 
certainty to hospitals, schools, municipalities, and other partners for 
the year to come. Our approach will include increased resources for our 
healthcare system, direct support for people, and action to protect jobs
 and our economy. This is a responsible course that maintains confidence
 and stability, while providing the flexibility to respond quickly to 
changing events.  We will build on our record of transparency, 
with regular financial updates as the situation evolves.  We will ensure
 the people of Ontario are informed by the most up-to-date information 
that is available. And as you all know, that information is changing 
rapidly.  It will also allow for close collaboration with our 
partners, including the federal government, to protect Ontario's 
economy. Experience has shown this work is most effective when 
governments collaborate. This is exactly what I have proposed to the 
federal government.   I was pleased to sit down with my 
colleague, Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau in Ottawa last week. We
 have stayed in close contact over the weekend and I'll be participating
 in a call with all of the provincial finance ministers later today.  Our
 government will make additional resources available to ensure Ontario's
 health-care system is able to respond to any scenario.  Our health-care
 professionals have our backs. They can be confident their government 
has theirs. Finally, I want to reiterate Premier Ford's 
commitment to support people throughout this crisis. From washing your 
hands to checking in on the most vulnerable among us, the people of 
Ontario are acting responsibly and doing their part during this global 
pandemic. Their government will do its part as well. Premier Ford and Minister McNaughton just spoke about some important measures in that regard.  Ontario's
 has strong economic fundamentals. We have more fiscal flexibility to 
respond to these sort of global events through actions we've taken over 
the previous 18 months. I'm confident that by acting decisively, and 
working together with our partners, Ontario is well positioned to 
weather the challenges ahead.""

during the COVID-19 crisis. Today, Premier Doug Ford and Monte 
McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development, 
announced that the government intends to introduce legislation that, if 
passed, would immediately provide job-protected leave to employees in 
isolation or quarantine due to COVID-19, or those who need to be away 
from work to care for children because of school or day care closures.
                                ""While everyone's concerns about their health and safety is top 
of mind, the last thing we need is anyone worrying about job security as
 the COVID-19 situation evolves,"" said Premier Ford. ""That's why I 
directed the Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development to 
draft legislation that will protect workers and their families during 
this difficult period."" ""Mothers and fathers who need to care for
 children or dependants shouldn't have to worry about losing their job,""
 said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills 
Development. ""The same goes for people who receive medical or public 
health advice and are required to take precautions as a result. They 
shouldn't have to worry about losing their job. In this time of 
uncertainty, we need to support employees who must isolate or quarantine
 themselves, or who need to care for a loved one."" The proposed legislation would, if passed, provide job protection for employees unable to work for the following reasons: · The employee is under medical investigation, supervision or treatment for COVID-19. · The employee is acting in accordance with an order under the Health Protection and Promotion Act. · The employee is in isolation or quarantine. · The employee is acting in accordance with public health information or direction. · The employer directs the employee not to work. · The employee needs to provide care to a person for a reason related to COVID-19 such as a school or day-care closure. The
 proposed legislation would also make it clear that an employee will not
 be required to provide a medical note if they take the leave. The 
measures would be retroactive to January 25, 2020, the date that the 
first presumptive COVID-19 case was confirmed in Ontario. Many 
workers will be eligible for Employment Insurance sickness benefits. As 
well, we are reviewing current access and eligibility to emergency 
assistance which is available through the Ontario Works (OW) program to 
support individuals who are impacted by the coronavirus and who are not 
able to meet their basic living expenses. ""The health and 
well-being of Ontarians continues to be our government's number one 
priority,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of 
Health. ""We are actively working with our partners at all levels in the 
health care system and implementing enhanced and comprehensive measures 
to prevent the spread of this virus and protect the health of all 
Ontarians."" ""These job protections could also contribute 
significantly to limiting the spread of COVID-19,"" said Rod Phillips, 
Minister of Finance. ""We are giving everyone the tools they need to put 
their health and the health of others first, without fear of losing 
their jobs."" Visit Ontario's website to learn more about how the province continues to protect Ontarians from COVID-19.

the advice of Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, and to ensure a
 safe and secure environment for all, the province is recommending that,
 where feasible, our service providers consider only allowing essential 
visitors until further notice. We are also asking that they undertake a 
screening process at all locations. We have prepared a toolkit including
 a screening checklist and signage to aid in ensuring these measures can
 be implemented.  The following measures have been put into place in provincially operated youth justice centres: Suspending
 all personal visitors and cancelling volunteer activities. Professional
 visits including legal counsel will continue however, though 
consideration should be given to alternative options such as the use of 
teleconferences.Approved personal visitors will be able to 
continue to maintain contact with youth by phone. Enhanced technology, 
such as video calling, where operationally available and operationally 
feasible, can be used to allow virtual visits with family.All
 non-essential reintegration leaves will be restricted until further 
notice. Reintegration leaves help youth in custody to reintegrate back 
into the community and support their rehabilitation by allowing them to 
leave a facility for medical, humanitarian/compassionate, employment 
and/or educational reasons for a specified time while following set 
terms and conditions, including staff escorts.
   We 
have also provided each of our community partners the most recent update
 and recommendations for enhanced public health measures from Ontario’s 
Chief Medical Officer of Health. We encourage all community partners to 
also seek direction from their local public health units.  We 
will continue to actively monitor the situation and take any necessary 
steps to ensure the safety of staff and those in our care.”  Visit Ontario’s website to learn more about how the province continues to protect Ontarians from COVID-19."

globally, Ontario is taking further action to ensure the province's 
health care system is prepared to continue to protect the health and 
well-being of Ontarians.
                                Working closely with Telehealth Ontario, 
the province is rapidly expanding service capacity to ensure timely 
responses. This is a critical step to help address the increased daily 
call volumes and reduce call wait times. ""By immediately 
expanding Telehealth's resources, we can significantly reduce the time 
it takes for Ontarians to receive the information they need to stay safe
 and healthy,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of 
Health. ""We are also initiating further discussions with our nursing 
partners to ensure there are Telehealth resources in place moving 
forward as COVID-19 continues to evolve. We will be ready for any 
scenario."" Phase 1: Immediately Increase Resources to Reduce Call Wait Times Yesterday,
 the province and Ontario Health started to deploy approximately 130 
nurses to conduct symptom assessments and referrals among callers who 
request a callback. Nurses will work from existing regional offices to 
provide immediate support and respond to callers seeking a callback to 
help mitigate current wait times. To onboard these additional 
nursing resources, Telehealth has developed a specific training package 
for newly added nurses to expedite their ability to provide callback 
support immediately. Telehealth will also increase intake staff to 
reduce wait times for initial contact with a Telehealth representative. Telehealth
 has been providing valuable support to the Ministry's Emergency 
Operations Centre (MEOC) since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in
 mid-January. In February, Telehealth began to add additional resources 
to manage increased daily call volumes, including seven full-time 
Registered Nurses and 10 customer service representatives. Phase 2: Continue to Manage COVID-19 Call Volumes While
 implementation of Phase 1 is currently underway, Ontario and Telehealth
 have already begun planning rollout of Phase 2. To further increase 
intake and nursing capacity over the coming days and weeks, Ontario is 
actively working with the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario 
(RNAO) to identify support for Telehealth from its 44,000 registered 
nurse members. The province has also started to explore existing 
non-clinical resources within the Ontario Public Service and other 
broader public sector organizations to support Telehealth's call 
volumes. In order to be prepared to be nimble and effective in 
any scenario, Ontario is also exploring a partnership with organizations
 which have existing health care call centres to provide symptom 
assessment for COVID-19 to callers requesting a callback.  ""We 
understand that people are anxious to get the advice about next steps as
 soon as possible, which is why the capacity of Telehealth is being 
enhanced,"" says Dr. David Williams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of 
Health. ""But unless you are experiencing severe symptoms or a medical 
emergency, the best place for you to stay is at home until you receive 
advice, which will often be to stay home and self-monitor.""  In
 addition to enhancing capacity at Telehealth, Ontario has approved new 
physician billing codes to enable doctors to continue to provide routine
 health care services by video and telephone, including assessment of 
possible COVID-19 symptoms. This will help keep patients at home rather 
than in their doctor's office where they would be in close contact with 
others. Ontario has also established dedicated assessment centres
 in areas experiencing significant growth in COVID-19 testing, with 
additional centres being established across the province in the coming 
weeks. Before visiting an assessment centre, individuals should first 
seek guidance on whether it is appropriate for them to do so. Ontarians 
can do so by using a new online self-assessment tool,
 calling Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000 or calling their local 
public health unit. People should not go to an assessment centre unless 
they have symptoms of the COVID-19. 


                                        
                                                Quick Facts
                                                Telehealth Ontario is a free, confidential, provincial 
service that provides 24/7 access to health advice and information from a
 Registered Nurse to all Ontarians in 300 languages. During this COVID-19 outbreak, Telehealth triages callers, 
provides information, assessment and depending on symptoms will inform 
patients on how to self-isolate.To date, there have been more than 8,000 COVID-19 related calls.

                                ""Since we first learned of COVID-19, Ontario has been diligently 
monitoring and taking decisive action to contain the spread of this new 
virus and ensure the province's health care system is ready for any 
scenario. At the same time, we must also carefully consider how to best 
maximize resources and prioritize services.   After consultation 
with the Ontario Hospital Association, and with the support of Dr. David
 Williams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, the province is 
requesting that all hospitals further implement pandemic plans by 
carefully ramping down elective surgeries and other non-emergent 
clinical activity. In doing so, hospitals can preserve capacity as cases
 of COVID-19 continue to grow in Ontario. As hospitals move 
forward with the implementation of their pandemic plans and decisions on
 their operations, we are asking them to follow three guiding 
principles:   Use an ethical framework to guide decision-making;Prevent high risk and occult transmission; and Develop and preserve capacity within our system. The
 approach that we are taking will provide the necessary discretion for 
hospitals to make decisions based on local circumstances, while 
preserving the ability for the province to take a more prescriptive 
approach, should it be warranted based on evidence.   I
 would once again like to thank all of Ontario's health care providers 
who are working tirelessly each day to ensure that the health and 
well-being of Ontarians is being protected."""

Ontario is taking further action to ensure the province's health care 
system is positioned to continue to safeguard the health and well-being 
of Ontarians.
                                Since being formally constituted, Ontario's new Command Table has
 been refining and finalizing plans for the implementation of enhanced 
measures to ensure the province is prepared to respond quickly and 
effectively to any scenario, including: Enhanced access to screening;Expanding lab-testing capacity; andImplementing new initiatives to keep the public and frontline workers safe. ""Ontario's
 public health system continues to demonstrate remarkable responsiveness
 to COVID-19,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of 
Health. ""While we have so far effectively contained new cases of this 
virus, we are relentlessly focused on planning for any scenario. We are 
actively working with our partners at all levels in the health care 
system to implement enhanced measures to ensure that we are prepared to 
protect the health of all Ontarians.""  Enhanced Access to Screening To rapidly expand screening and ease pressures on hospital emergency departments, Ontario will immediately establish a number of dedicated assessment centres
 in areas experiencing significant growth in testing. Some of the first 
wave of assessment centres will open in the next several days, including
 at William Osler Health System - Peel Memorial site, The Ottawa 
Hospital, North York General Hospital, Mackenzie Health, Scarborough 
Health Network, and Trillium Health Partners. These centres are located 
in dedicated spaces that will facilitate high-quality care, to protect 
broader patient populations.  Additional assessment centres will 
be established across the province in the coming weeks. Regions without 
an assessment centre will continue to be serviced by their local 
hospital or primary care settings. Ontario has also approved new physician billing codes
 for telephone assessments, enabling doctors to conduct more assessments
 over the phone rather than in their clinic, helping to keep patients at
 home rather than in primary care settings where they would co-mingle 
with others. In the coming days, the province will also launch a new COVID-19 self-assessment tool on its dedicated web page (Ontario.ca/coronavirus).
 This new tool will take the public through a series of questions to 
help inform those who are concerned about having contracted COVID-19 
about how they can seek care based on their needs. Ontario is working
 closely with Telehealth to ensure adequate support to handle increased 
call volumes and is committed to allocating additional resources as 
needed to ensure timely responses for Ontarians. In addition to
 continuing to review virtual care capacity, including further expanding
 Telehealth and encouraging virtual care uptake, the Command Table has 
initiated early planning for the implementation of at-home testing, all 
of which will support caring for people at home. Expanding Lab-Testing Capacity Working with Public Health Ontario and Ontario Health, the province is working to enhance laboratory testing capacity across the province to rapidly mobilize, monitor and coordinate COVID-19 testing. Laboratory
 testing is also being conducted on other respiratory samples from 
hospital emergency departments and long-term care homes in order to 
identify and quickly respond to any unknown cases of COVID-19. Protecting the Public and Frontline Workers To
 ensure Ontarians have access to credible and up-to-date information on 
how to maintain their health and the health of their families, Ontario 
has launched a provincewide public education campaign. 
The campaign, which includes search, social, print and radio ads on 
every-day steps Ontarians can take to keep themselves safe, is in 
addition to the resources available on Ontario.ca/coronavirus. This 
dedicated web page is now being updated twice a day (10:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. EST), seven days a week, with relevant information on any new cases and includes fact sheets translated in nearly 30 distinct languages. As the global and local situation evolves, the Command Table will continue to evaluate the latest evidence to provide ongoing guidance to the public and providers. Ontario has issued updated guidelines to long-term care homes
 to ensure active screening for all staff, volunteers, family members, 
as well as new and returning residents, and will do so for retirement 
homes shortly. Ontario will continue to update guidelines for other 
health care facilities in response to the evolving situation. In 
addition to these extensive planning measures, Ontario is providing 
stability to municipalities as they complete 2021 budget planning by 
committing to extending one-time mitigation funding for an additional calendar year for
 the province's public health units. This action ensures that historical
 municipal adjustments remain capped at 10 per cent, and recognizes the 
considerable time and resources necessary for public health units to 
effectively respond to COVID-19. Extending mitigation funding would keep
 municipal funding levels for public health units in calendar year 2021 
at the same level as calendar year 2020. This is in addition to the up 
to $100 million COVID-19 Contingency Fund announced yesterday.

with others. In the coming days, the province will also launch a new COVID-19 self-assessment tool on its dedicated web page (Ontario.ca/coronavirus).
 This new tool will take the public through a series of questions to 
help inform those who are concerned about having contracted COVID-19 
about how they can seek care based on their needs. Ontario is working
 closely with Telehealth to ensure adequate support to handle increased 
call volumes and is committed to allocating additional resources as 
needed to ensure timely responses for Ontarians. In addition to
 continuing to review virtual care capacity, including further expanding
 Telehealth and encouraging virtual care uptake, the Command Table has 
initiated early planning for the implementation of at-home testing, all 
of which will support caring for people at home. Expanding Lab-Testing Capacity Working with Public Health Ontario and Ontario Health, the province is working to enhance laboratory testing capacity across the province to rapidly mobilize, monitor and coordinate COVID-19 testing. Laboratory
 testing is also being conducted on other respiratory samples from 
hospital emergency departments and long-term care homes in order to 
identify and quickly respond to any unknown cases of COVID-19. Protecting the Public and Frontline Workers To
 ensure Ontarians have access to credible and up-to-date information on 
how to maintain their health and the health of their families, Ontario 
has launched a provincewide public education campaign. 
The campaign, which includes search, social, print and radio ads on 
every-day steps Ontarians can take to keep themselves safe, is in 
addition to the resources available on Ontario.ca/coronavirus. This 
dedicated web page is now being updated twice a day (10:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. EST), seven days a week, with relevant information on any new cases and includes fact sheets translated in nearly 30 distinct languages. As the global and local situation evolves, the Command Table will continue to evaluate the latest evidence to provide ongoing guidance to the public and providers. Ontario has issued updated guidelines to long-term care homes
 to ensure active screening for all staff, volunteers, family members, 
as well as new and returning residents, and will do so for retirement 
homes shortly. Ontario will continue to update guidelines for other 
health care facilities in response to the evolving situation. In 
addition to these extensive planning measures, Ontario is providing 
stability to municipalities as they complete 2021 budget planning by 
committing to extending one-time mitigation funding for an additional calendar year for
 the province's public health units. This action ensures that historical
 municipal adjustments remain capped at 10 per cent, and recognizes the 
considerable time and resources necessary for public health units to 
effectively respond to COVID-19. Extending mitigation funding would keep
 municipal funding levels for public health units in calendar year 2021 
at the same level as calendar year 2020. This is in addition to the up 
to $100 million COVID-19 Contingency Fund announced yesterday.

 Utah Jazz player tested positive Wednesday for the coronavirus, a move 
that came only hours after the majority of the league's owners were 
leaning toward playing games without fans in arenas.  ""What we 
determined today is that this hiatus will be, most likely, at least 30 
days,"" commissioner Adam Silver said while appearing on the NBA on TNT 
on Thursday. ""We don't know enough, as you've all said, to be more 
specific than that.""  Now
 there will be no games at all, at least for the time being. A person 
with knowledge of the situation said the Jazz player who tested positive
 was centre Rudy Gobert. The person spoke to The Associated Press on 
condition of anonymity because neither the league nor the team confirmed
 the presumptive positive test. A second person with knowledge told AP 
on Thursday that Gobert's Utah teammate, Donovan Mitchell, tested 
positive as well.  The test result, the NBA said, was reported 
shortly before the scheduled tip-off time for the Utah at Oklahoma City 
game on Wednesday night was called off. Players were on the floor for 
warmups when they were told to return to their locker rooms. About 30 
minutes later, fans were told the game was postponed ""due to unforeseen 
circumstances.""  WATCH | Thunder, Jazz game postponed:

The NBA has suspended its
 season ""until further notice"" after Utah Jazz player is diagnosed with 
COVID-19. Jazz-Thunder game stopped just before tip-off. 0:35  Those
 circumstances were the league's worst-case scenario for now — a player 
testing positive. A second person who spoke to AP on condition of 
anonymity said the league expects the shutdown to last a minimum of two 
weeks, but cautioned that timeframe is very fluid.  The Utah Jazz hosted the Toronto Raptors in a 101-92 defeat on Monday.  Gobert
 played a total of 32 minutes before he was ejected along with Toronto 
forward OG Anunoby after the pair engaged in an on-court altercation.  Raptors overcome early Norman Powell exit to earn 4th consecutive winList of sporting events affected by the coronavirus pandemic  For
 most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, 
such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people 
with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, 
including pneumonia.  The vast majority of people recover. 
According to the World Health Organization, which declared a pandemic on
 Wednesday, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while 
those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks. In mainland 
China, where the virus first exploded, more than 80,000 people have been
 diagnosed and more than 58,000 have so far recovered.  Charlotte
 Hornets coach James Borrego, speaking before his team played at Miami 
on Wednesday — where news of the shutdown broke during the fourth 
quarter — said ""these are scary times.""  WATCH | Mark Cuban interviewed after league suspended:

 National Hockey League released a statement saying it was aware of the 
NBA's decision to suspend its season and expects to provide a further 
update on Thursday.  Earlier, the NCAA announced that the men's 
and women's Division I tournaments would be played without fans — except
 for a few family members — permitted inside to watch.  ""People 
are clearly taking the measures that they feel they need to take for 
safety,"" said Miami Heat guard Duncan Robinson, who played in both the 
Division I and Division III national championship games during his 
college days at Michigan and Williams.  ""We love playing in front
 of our fans and we feel like that gives us an advantage. But at the 
same time the NBA has to protect its players in the league and the 
fans,"" he said.  Things have been trending toward empty arenas 
for some time. On Wednesday morning the director of the National 
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told a U.S. Congressional 
committee that he would recommend the NBA not allow fans at games in 
response to the coronavirus.  WATCH | NBA suspends season indefinitely amid COVID-19 concerns:

 was revealed one of their players tested positive for the coronavirus. 
Jamie Strashin also provides an update from Blue Jays' spring training 
and how they've been impacted by the virus. 2:37  ""We would recommend that there not be large crowds,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, responding to a question about the NBA's reaction.  ""If
 that means not having any people in the audience when the NBA plays, so
 be it. But as a public health official, anything that has crowds is 
something that would give a risk to spread.""  At the time of the 
league's announcement, the Dallas Mavericks' home game against the 
Denver Nuggets was midway through the third quarter.  Two other 
games — the New York Knicks at the Atlanta Hawks and the Charlotte 
Hornets at the Miami Heat — were late in the fourth quarter.  All three games were allowed to finish before the suspension took effect.  The
 last game of the night's six-game slate, New Orleans at Sacramento, was
 called off as well because one of the referees assigned to work that 
Pelicans-Kings game, Courtney Kirkland, worked the Jazz-Raptors game on 
Monday.  ""The game was cancelled out of an abundance of caution,"" the NBA said."

Health, and Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care, issued 
the following statement related to long-term care and COVID-19 in 
Ontario:
                                ""The health and well-being of Ontarians, including long-term care
 residents, their families, and staff, is our number one priority. 
Ontario recently announced that the province is implementing an enhanced
 response structure to COVID-19 that brings together a wide range of 
partners to strengthen and implement provincial and regional plans. The
 structure involves the creation of a number of tables - or expert teams
 - including a new Command Table that will serve as a single point of 
oversight. Senior leadership from across government and the health 
sector are now providing clear strategic direction to guide Ontario's 
ongoing response to COVID-19. Through a Collaboration Table, 
stakeholders from the long-term care sector have the opportunity to 
provide valuable advice. Our government has also recently 
instructed long-term care homes to begin active screening of staff, 
students, volunteers, visitors, residents moving into a long-term care 
home and residents returning to a long-term care home. These individuals
 will now be proactively checked for symptoms and asked about recent 
travel history and contacts. Outbreaks can occur in long-term 
care homes throughout the year and, as it is flu season, homes currently
 have respiratory infection outbreak protocols in place. When long-term 
care homes submit samples for standard respiratory testing, they will 
now also be tested for COVID-19 automatically to ensure the province 
identifies potentially unknown cases. Ontario continues to work 
directly with our partners at the Public Health Agency of Canada and 
local public health units to monitor the situation closely. Newly 
strengthened protocols for identification and control are in place to 
keep the public safe. These protocols and processes continue to 
be effective and the risk to Ontarians taking precautions to keep 
themselves and their families safe remains low. There are everyday 
actions that residents, staff and family members should continue to take
 to reduce exposure to the virus and help prevent the spread of germs: wash your hands often with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer;sneeze and cough into your sleeve;avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth;avoid contact with people who are sick;stay home if you are sick; anddo not visit a long-term care home if you are feeling ill. Ontario's
 commitment to the safety, quality of care and quality of life of 
long-term care home residents is safeguarded by regulations and 
requirements in the Long-Term Care Homes Act, 2007. Long-term 
care homes enforce rigorous provincial standards for all public health 
concerns, including outbreak management systems for detecting, managing,
 and controlling infectious disease outbreaks. The Ministry of 
Health and the Ministry of Long-Term Care are working together in close 
cooperation with our partners in both the long-term care and other 
health care sectors to ensure the continued safety and well-being of 
residents, families and staff."" Visit Ontario's website to learn more about how the province continues to protect Ontarians from COVID-19."

inform the public on the status of the virus across the province.
                                Ontario has been monitoring and reporting on the development of 
COVID-19 since initial cases of a viral pneumonia were reported in China
 in late December 2019. Every weekday at 10:30 a.m. Ontario has been 
updating its dedicated web page with
 the most up-to-date information on the status of cases in Ontario, 
including: the number of cases currently under investigation; and the 
number of confirmed positive, negative and resolved cases. To enhance these efforts, the web page will
 now be updated twice a day (10:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. EST), seven days a
 week. The web page will also now include general information on each 
new confirmed case of COVID-19, including gender, age, public health 
unit, hospital (if applicable), where acquired and status. The 
information provided will reflect what has been confirmed by local 
public health authorities at that time. This information will be 
provided in lieu of the news releases the province has been issuing and 
will be supplemented by additional details provided by individual public
 health units. ""The health and well-being of the people of 
Ontario is our top priority,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and
 Minister of Health. ""Although the risk remains low, we are enhancing 
our reporting protocols as we continue to take decisive steps to protect
 the public. Ontarians can be fully confident that we are providing the 
information they need in order to protect themselves and their 
families."" Currently, the virus is not circulating locally. However, given the global circumstances, last week Ontario implemented an enhanced response structure to
 formally bring together experts across the health sector to provide 
clinical expertise and experience to implement provincial and regional 
plans. This will ensure the province is ready to contain and respond to a
 COVID-19 outbreak. In addition to the daily updates to the website, Dr. David Williams, Chief Medical Officer of Health, will continue to provide updates on COVID-19 at the regularly scheduled media briefings every Monday and Thursday at 3 p.m. at the Queen's Park media studio.

 for confirmation.  Given the individual's clinical 
assessment and history, there is a low risk that she was infectious. The
 individual followed all protocols and wore a mask throughout her 
travels back to Toronto and, since landing, the woman has had very 
limited exposure to other individuals. The province is coordinating with
 local public health units to ensure that passengers in close proximity 
to the woman on the plane are contacted and monitored. ""Because 
of all the proper protocols and procedures that are in place to contain 
this virus and exposure to others was limited, I want to assure the 
public that the risk to Ontarians remains low,"" said Dr. Williams. 
""Protecting the health and well-being of individuals and families across
 the province remains our top priority and we continue to vigilantly 
monitor for and contain any and all new cases.""  Dr. David
 Williams and Dr. Barbara Yaffe, Associate Chief Medical Officer of 
Health, will be joined by Dr. Eileen de Villa, Medical Officer of Health
 for Toronto, to provide an update on the situation at a 9:00 a.m. 
briefing tomorrow (February 24) at the Queen's Park media studio. Visit Ontario's website to learn more about how the province continues to protect Ontarians from COVID-19."

 confirmed Ontario's third case of 2019 novel coronavirus. The case is 
located in London, Ontario.
                                Given the newness of the 2019 novel coronavirus and as part of 
the continuing cooperative efforts between Public Health Ontario (PHO) 
and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), Ontario has been sharing 
all test samples with the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg. As part
 of the National Microbiology Lab's efforts to ensure quality control, 
additional testing was performed on the samples provided. As a result of
 this additional testing, a case that was previously deemed negative by 
PHO's lab has now been found to be positive by the National Microbiology
 Lab, which uses a more sensitive test that can identify the smallest 
trace presence of the virus. The majority of cases previously considered
 negative have been confirmed as negative by the National Microbiology 
Lab.  To provide the public with the greatest certainty, 
Ontario's reporting will now include a new category that more accurately
 reflects the province's status: presumptive negative. That said, for 
any person found presumptively negative by the PHO lab, there is an 
extremely low risk of transmitting the virus. The newly confirmed
 case, a female in her 20s, arrived asymptomatic in Toronto on January 
23, 2020 and was transported to London by way of a private vehicle. On 
January 24, 2020, the individual started to exhibit symptoms and that 
same day was assessed and tested at London Health Sciences Centre. She 
was released with follow up by the Middlesex-London Health Unit. This 
individual has had limited exposure to other individuals and has 
otherwise been in isolation since January 24, 2020, with regular contact
 by the Middlesex-London Health Unit to monitor her condition. She is 
now recovered and is well.  ""I want to re-emphasize that the risk
 to Ontarians remains low,"" said Dr. Williams. ""It is clear that we are 
learning more and more about the coronavirus each day, and our testing 
procedures are evolving and getting more and more precise, which is good
 news for everyone throughout Ontario and Canada. By working 
hand-in-hand with our partners across the health care system we are in a
 very good position to contain the virus and better protect the health 
and wellbeing of individuals and families across the province.""  While
 requiring validation by the National Microbiology Lab, PHO's lab will 
continue to offer the province's public health system an early 
indication of a case's status, allowing the province and local public 
health officials to quickly and effectively implement all necessary 
protocols to contain and treat any individuals who have 2019 novel 
coronavirus."

 case. ""All appropriate infection prevention and control measures
 were followed by both paramedics and the hospital,"" said Dr. Williams. 
""Toronto Public Health is conducting case and contact management and 
Ontario is in touch with our federal counterparts to help determine 
exposure to other individuals on the flights."" Recently, to 
strengthen the province's ability to monitor any coronavirus cases, the

                                 ""While there remain no confirmed cases of the virus in 
Canada, the federal government is putting in place enhanced screening 
and detection measures at Toronto Pearson International Airport to 
further protect the health of the public from the Wuhan novel 
coronavirus. Today, I joined Patty Hajdu, Minister of Health for 
Canada, and my ministerial colleagues from each of the provinces and 
territories to share important information and further coordinate our 
joint efforts to protect the health and well being of all Canadians, 
including Ontarians, from the emerging issues of the Wuhan novel 
coronavirus. The federal government outlined their enhanced measures, 
which now include:  Screening questions at border 
kiosks will now include questions about previous travel to Wuhan, China 
in the past 14 days. A positive response would trigger an enhanced 
screening process, including sending the traveller to a Canadian border 
agent for further questioning about their health status. The border 
agent will determine whether the traveller needs to seek immediate 
medical assessment and treatment and, if so, EMS will transport the 
traveller from the airport directly to hospital. This screening will be 
done in Vancouver and Montreal as well.Fact sheets are also 
being developed in English, French and Chinese for people who have 
travelled to China and are not currently exhibiting signs of illness. 
These fact sheets will outline the symptoms that individuals should 
watch for and any next steps should they experience symptoms, including 
seeking an immediate medical assessment. The federal
 government's enhanced screening measures build on Ontario's robust and 
comprehensive protocols in place to actively monitor for, detect and 
contain any suspected cases of Wuhan novel coronavirus. The federal 
government's measures will further support my ministry, in collaboration
 with Public Health Ontario, local health units, hospitals and health 
care providers, to monitor the Wuhan novel coronavirus and contain any 
cases, should one present in Ontario. While the risk to Ontarians
 remains low, we will continue to be in close contact with the Public
