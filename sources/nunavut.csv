Department of Community and Government Services - May 28, 2020 Minister of Community and Government Services update Ullaakkut, With the construction season upon us the Government of Nunavut (GN) has undertaken necessary preparations for construction projects to proceed during the summer and fall of 2020 in 19 Nunavut communities. This includes over 50 capital projects valued at approximately $600 million. Given the significant size of our construction program, we rely on a certain level of skilled workers from southern Canada to work on these projects alongside our Inuit and Northern labour. In consultation with Dr. Patterson, arrangements have been made to ensure that all southern workers comply with the strict requirement of the 14-day isolation period before travelling to Nunavut. The GN will control and monitor these measures at the isolation facilities in the south during the 14 days including up until workers board their flights. This follows the procedures for residents and medical travellers already in place. We need to balance the long-term infrastructure needs of communities with the current COVID-19 restrictions and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the municipalities, especially our mayors and councillors, for taking an active role in the decision to proceed with these projects during the 2020 construction season. I also would like to acknowledge the construction companies for their understanding of, and the need to respect, the directives set by Dr. Patterson to ensure that the construction projects move ahead with an understanding of maintaining the health and well-being of the workers and all Nunavummiut. Despite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are looking forward to a safe and productive construction season this summer. Thank you.   Department of Community and Government services - April 30, 2020  Critical services will be maintained in Pond Inlet, and plans are in place to ensure that access to services such as heat, power, water, sewer, and communications will not be interrupted. Community and Government Services (CGS), along with the municipality, has a plan in place for a water intake/pumping solution to ensure the community has ongoing access to water The temporary pumping system will include: A pump set up on the shore of the reservoir, Suction hose put through a drilled hole in the ice, A discharge hose to supply water into the back of the water truck, Manual chlorination into the back of the truck, and, The pump will be set up in a temporary porta-tank to provide containment for fuel refilling. 		  This solution can be managed by municipality staff. CGS is actively working on a permanent solution to be implemented later this summer. Department of Community and Government services - April 20, 2020  The Department of Community and Government services is providing an additional $2 million to municipalities to cover expenses related to COVID-19. This additional funding will ensure that hamlets are able to provide unforeseen services in response to the pandemic.  Eligible expenses include but are not limited to the purchase of cleaning materials, hiring additional staff, expenses for additional road clearing, by-law and enforcement patrols, and to cover lost revenues resulting from facility closures. Municipalities can contact their CGS regional community development office for more information.

2,2020-10-26,Canada,Nunavut,,https://gov.nu.ca/education/news/covid-19-department-education-services-update,Government Website,COVID-19 Department of Education Services update,"   26 October 2020  Department of Education Update - October 26, 2020 With the funding provided by the Government of Canada’s Safe Restart Agreement, the Department of Education purchased 1600 digital devices for Nunavut schools in the event of school closures due to an active case of COVID-19 in a community. Of these 1600 purchased devices, 800 iPads have already been delivered to the department for formatting.1400 more devices will be ordered soon, thanks to funding from the Government of Canada’s Safe Return to Class fund. The Department of Education is also ensuring that learning will continue even if schools are closed due to COVID-19, by testing the use of an online learning platform called Edsby. Edsby is a comprehensive digital learning system designed to support both in-class and remote learning. The easy-to-use interface, similar to social media sites, is intended for students from Kindergarten to Grade 12, teachers, and parents. It can be accessed from almost any digital device such as a laptop, a tablet, or a smartphone. Finally, the Department of Education has secured additional cleaning and health and safety supplies so schools can continue to meet the enhanced cleaning standards and health and safety measures that came into effect due to the COVID-19 pandemic.     Department of Education Update - October 19, 2020 School action plans All schools are developing an action plan for each stage of COVID-19 risk. Action plans for stages 2, 3, and 4 will focus on supporting remote instruction and alternatives to in-class learning 				The Department of Education has provided guidelines and toolkits to support schools as they develop these action plans, which include: 						A plan for a staff member to have daily contact with each student they have a relationship with. How students will be supported if they do not have access to digital or computer technology at home, using alternatives such as telephone, radio, package delivery, etc. Development of “ready to go” learning and well-being packages for each student, in case a community enters stages 2, 3, or 4. Instruction and support for students on Individual Student Support Plans (ISSPs) will continue to be in place at all stages. Details on how schools will operate during each stage, including fire drills, food programs, and administrator classroom visits.  Most schools have completed their action plans for stage 1 and are working on completing their stage 2, 3, and 4 action plans. Regional School Operations staff are working closely with school leaders to review and approve draft plans. 21 out of 45 schools have completed and submitted final action plans for all stages. Some schools have developed additional wellness support tools, for example Qiqirtaq High School in Gjoa Haven has a student wellness survey as part of their action plan.  Learning Packages Learning packages have been developed for each student as part of the stage 1 action plan. These packages are adapted to fit the varied needs of each student. Learning packages will be continually updated with new and revised material as students progress through the curriculum. These will be used, as needed, when a community moves from stage 1 to stage 2, 3, or 4.   Department of Education Update - October 8, 2020 On October 7, 2020, Minister Joanasie and the Government of Canada’s Minister of Families, Children and Social Development, Ahmed Hussen, announced additional support for early learning, childcare and schools in Nunavut (the Canada-Nunavut Early Learning and Child Care Bilateral Agreement ($2.4 million) and the Safe Restart Agreement ($2.6 million). The Canada-Nunavut Early Learning and Child Care Bilateral Agreement will support and maintain access to affordable early learning and child care programs through operations funding, create child care spaces in underserved communities, promote training and professional development opportunities for early childhood educators, and develop teaching resources and programming materials in all of Nunavut’s official languages. The Safe Restart Agreement will provide enhanced custodial training and supplies for child care facilities and K-12 schools across Nunavut, and be used to purchase laptops, tablets, and internet capacity to support remote learning on an as-needed basis if a community is at a higher risk for COVID-19. 			          Department of Education Update - July 27, 2020 On Friday, July 24, the Department of Education release the 2020-21 Opening Plan for Nunavut Schools: Health and Safety.  Because there are no confirmed or probable cases of COVID-19 in Nunavut, all schools will open, as scheduled, for the new school year, unless otherwise directed by Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO). To see when your school opens and the Department of Education’s 2020-21 Opening Plan for Nunavut Schools, visit: https://gov.nu.ca/education/information/2020-21-opening-plan-nunavut-schools Planning for 2020-21 School Year All schools will open, as scheduled, for the new school year, unless otherwise directed by CPHO. 4 stages have been developed to direct school operations depending on the impacts of COVID-19 in each community. The CPHO will determine when a community moves from stage to stage. For updates, check the Department of Education website and listen to GN press conferences. Educators/School Staff Educator recruitment is on track for the 2020-21 school year. 									There are currently 30 open educator positions across the territory.  Teachers and school staff are not defined as critical workers and are required to follow the same isolation process as other Nunavummiut returning to the territory. The department worked with the Department of Health to secure reservations in the hubs and return travel dates and ensure out of territory school staff could return for the start of the school year. Health and Safety Restrictions Health and safety restrictions are different in schools than everywhere else for several reasons: 									It is critical to balance the risk of direct infection and transmission of COVID-19 in children with the harms of school closure on their physical and mental health.  Current evidence suggests that children may be less susceptible to COVID-19 infection and may be less likely to transmit the virus to others. Schools are controlled environments, and any potential spread of the virus can be managed and tracked more easily.  The Department of Education, the CPHO, and DEAs/CSFN were involved in the development of the health and safety plans. Cleaning will be enhanced in all schools, and custodians will receive guidelines and training. Learning and Instruction The focus in the first several months of school will be on learning recovery, assessment, and instruction. School staff will receive guidelines and a toolkit for learning, instruction, and assessment, including information on remote instruction, and expectations for communicating with students. Physical distancing and masks Physical distancing requirements depend on the stage a community is in. Adjusting the percentage of students in school will help support limited contact between students, as needed. The department will work with schools and DEAs in Stages 2 and 3 regarding physical distancing requirements, including organizing students by cohort. In general, the use of masks is not recommended for children. 									At the discretion of the CPHO, there may be some instances where students should wear masks. Some school staff may wear masks, if they are unable to physically distance when required by the CPHO.  School assemblies will be avoided so as not to mix classroom cohorts.   Department of Education Services, July 20, 2020 The Department of Education will be releasing the 2020-21 Opening Plan for Nunavut Schools at the end of July.  Keeping our staff and students safe is the Department of Education’s highest priority. By working closely with the Chief Public Health Officer, and providing clear guidelines around health and safety, the Department of Education can ensure that our students are learning in a safe, supportive environment.   Department of Education Services, July 13, 2020  Since March 17, when schools were closed to students, the Department of Education has been working diligently in preparation for the upcoming 2020-21 school year, specifically addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. Information on plans and guidelines for opening schools will be made available to the public as they are finalized. These will include detailed guidelines on health and safety, as well as recovery learning and assessment, and student and staff wellbeing. The Department of Education will be releasing the first document of its school opening plan later this month, after it has been reviewed by the Chief Public Health Officer and the department has heard from education stakeholders. Keeping our staff and students safe is the Department of Education’s highest priority. By working closely with the Chief Public Health Officer, and providing clear guidelines around health and safety, the Department of Education can ensure that our students are learning in a safe, supportive environment. On Wednesday, July 15, David Joanasie, Minister of Education, and Dr. Michael Patterson, Chief Public Health Officer, will be teleconferencing with District Education Authorities, the Commission scolaire francophone du Nunavut, and the Coalition of Nunavut District Education Authorities to discuss health and safety considerations related to the Department of Education’s school opening plan.   Department of Education Services, July 6, 2020  Since March 17, when schools were closed to students, the Department of Education has been working diligently in preparation for the upcoming 2020-21 school year, specifically addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Department of Education will be connecting with all licensed child-care facilities in the coming days.     Department of Education Services, May 8, 2020  Child Care Facilities From March 17 to April 21, 2020, the Government of Nunavut provided licenced child care facilities $885,000 to cover parental fees. This funding enabled facilities to continue paying staff while transitioning to financial assistance programs offered by the Government of Canada, such as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the Canadian Wage Subsidy Program. The Canadian Wage Subsidy Program covers 75% of staff’s wages and has now been extended beyond June. The Department of Education provides licenced child care facilities with 				$4.2 million annually in operation and maintenance funding. This funding will continue while facilities are closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Department of Education continues to provide licencing for child care facilities, training for staff, and create and distribute educational resources. The Government of Nunavut continues to work with the Government of Canada, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., the regional Inuit organizations, and other stakeholders to support child care facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Department of Education Services, April 30, 2020  Schools in Pond Inlet are closed to the community, including school staff, until further notice. The physical distribution of student learning packages in Pond Inlet has been suspended until further notice. All Department of Education staff, including school staff, are to work from home if possible. These measures are to ensure the health and safety of Pond Inlet students, families, and staff. The Department of Education will provide support to other Government of Nunavut departments as needed. Department of Education Services, April 29, 2020 Student Learning Packages Many students have already received an initial learning package from their teachers. 		Most packages include learn-at-home work and activities for one or two weeks at a time. Learning packages are focused on strengthening skills in literacy, numeracy, and health and wellbeing. There is a mix of paper and electronic-based work, depending on the student and their circumstance.  Students and families should expect to receive learning packages for the rest of the school year. Learning packages are designed to reinforce the skills students have already learned and will not be expected to be assessed by teachers toward final grades. The department has provided continuity of learning guidelines for all school staff, which outline a number of ways that school staff can communicate with students and families. The department would like to thank all school staff for supporting their students and their families during these unprecedented times. Early Learning and Child Care Support Following direction from the Chief Public Health Officer, all child care facilities must remain closed to children until further notice. During this closure, the Department of Education has and will continue to pay all regular O&M funding to licensed child care facilities. 		This should account for a significant portion of the monthly operating costs of a facility. Because the day care closures were sudden and unexpected, the department paid parental fees temporarily to ensure facilities could continue to pay their staff, and to allow time for facilities to apply for federal subsidies, such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy. The total cost of this funding provided was $885,000.  Department of Education staff are ready to support child-care facilities in their applications to these federal programs, and we have been communicating with all facilities around this. The department continues to explore further options to support child care facilities, including possible use of federal funds.   Department of Education Services, April 17, 2020 Minister of Education update: Ullukkut, The well-being and success of Nunavut’s children and youth is the top priority of the Department of Education. In these uncertain times, we want to make sure students have the opportunity to thrive, and to pursue any future path they desire. With students’ well-being in mind, I am announcing that as of today, all schools in Nunavut will be closed to students for the rest of the 2019-20 school year. This closure is supported by the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO). Because students have already missed over a month of class time, it is even more important that all school staff report to work on April 21, 2020. As in other provinces and territories, Nunavut’s school staff are vital to ensuring our students do not fall behind in their education. The Department of Education has developed guidelines to help school staff prepare learning packages to meet the specific needs of their students. Staff will work with students and their families to determine how best to support learning. This means that for our students in Kindergarten to Grade 9, teachers will prioritize literacy and numeracy, while strengthening the skills and knowledge that have been taught so far this school year. For high school students, teachers and administrators will evaluate their individual situations. Some students may already have completed the credits they need to graduate. Others may need to complete specific courses to be eligible to graduate. Teachers may provide opportunities for students to upgrade their marks or earn the credits they need by completing suggested assignments and projects. Teachers will review their students’ outcomes to date, align them with skills that need to be strengthened, and take into consideration what is possible for them to accomplish at home. There will be a strong focus on supporting health and wellness, literacy, and numeracy for all students. This includes household projects and activities that allow families to learn together, such as reading together, journal writing, and projects that draw on the creativity of students. The Department is also aware that many families are currently on the land and may not be able to receive student learning packages. On-the-land activities like hunting and fishing complement student learning, and the department encourages these activities. Realizing Nunavut’s technology limitations, especially in some of our smaller communities, students’ continued learning will not be entirely online. This means that students’ learning packages will take many forms -- some will be paper-based, some will be activity-based, and some will be electronic. However, all of them will give students an opportunity to further their learning. Wherever possible, teachers will be asked to check in with families weekly, to see how they are progressing and if they need any extra support or resources. The best way to communicate -- either by phone, text, GN email, or through other online portals -- will be determined with students and families. Beyond creating student learning packages, staff also will be supporting students by assessing their work prior to the school closure to determine final grades, and preparing year-end report cards. To Nunavut’s high school students and their families, a reminder that all departmental exams are cancelled for the school year. For those Grade 12 students on track to graduate, I want to assure you that principals and teachers will work with you to ensure you complete any necessary requirements. We are here to help you succeed and realize your goals. Finally, school staff will also plan and prepare for the 2020-21 school year, particularly with the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic in mind. For school staff who have voluntarily returned to work and have already been preparing learning packages, many students and families recognize your hard work and expressed their appreciation. As a parent, and as Minister of Education, I want to express my sincere gratitude to you for your dedication and enthusiasm. Thank you for your efforts and commitment to Nunavut’s students. We all want the best for our children and youth. The Department of Education appreciates the support and patience Nunavummiut and our education partners have shown during these unprecedented times. The uncertainty has not been easy, but we will make it through, together. Stay safe everyone. Qujannamiik, quana, thank you, merci. Department of Education Services Students in Nunavut will not have class for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year. School staff will continue to work to support learning at home until the end of the school year. Students will be receiving learning packages from their schools to support learning at home. School staff will connect with families over the coming weeks. All high school diploma exams for this year are cancelled, and high school marks will be based on course work only. All students will receive a year-end report card. Department of Education Services, April 15, 2020 To ensure staff at licenced child care facilities continue to be paid, the Department of Education will fund parental fees for all licensed child care facilities up to April 21, 2020. The Government of Nunavut has taken strict measures to minimize the spread of COVID-19, this is why child care facilities must remain closed until further notice. Department of Education Services, April 8, 2020 Minister of Education update Yesterday, the Department of Education sent a letter to all school staff about returning to work in their home communities on April 21, 2020. This is specific to STAFF ONLY, so that they can prepare and develop continuity of learning plans in the case the school closure is extended. I want to clarify the numbers I provided yesterday – there are 1,185 staff who work in schools across the territory. Ninety-three (93) of these staff are currently out of the territory, making their way back to their home communities. This represents eight per cent (8%) of all school staff. Teachers across the country are working hard to support learning at home for students so that they are not disadvantaged by the school closure. Our students deserve the same supports, and this is why we are asking teachers to work during this time. Teachers returning to work will focus on supporting students in their education and their wellbeing by developing learning packages. This is particularly important for those students that do not have access to online resources and those who are on specialized learning plans. School staff who may have travelled out of territory must undergo a mandatory 14-day isolation period in a GN-designated isolation hub in the south before returning to Nunavut. This is the same process that all Nunavut residents, FANS students, and medical travel patients returning to Nunavut have been following. This process was established under the orders of the Chief Public Health Officer. Nunavut residents, including school staff, are responsible for their travel costs to return home to Nunavut. The GN is covering the cost of the isolation hubs for all Nunavut residents, including school staff. All GN staff, including teachers, are expected to work from within the territory. We will address any requests from staff who currently are out-of-territory to work remotely on a case-by-case basis. The Department of Education has been in continuous contact with the Nunavut Teachers’ Association (NTA) and the Coalition of Nunavut DEAs. They both support the decision to bring teachers back to work to ensure that students can continue to learn and are supported during school closures. Schools will only be reopened to students once the Chief Public Health Officer determines it is safe to do so. However, we need our staff back at work by April 21 to prepare for our students’ success and progress, whatever the next step may be. Department of Education Services, April 7, 2020 As of April 7, teachers currently in-territory can go back to school on a voluntary basis, in order to start developing learning packages for students. Guidelines on the delivery of those packages to students are being finalised by the Department of Education. All school staff are expected to return to work in their home communities on April 21, 2020. Teachers that are currently out of territory must undergo a 14-day isolation period in a designated isolation hub before returning to Nunavut. If teachers cannot begin their 14-day isolation period in time for their return on April 21, they must contact their principal and provide information on travel plans and correspondence with the isolation hubs to support any expected delays. On April 21, a decision will be made according to the recommendation of the Chief Public Health Officer. If school closures persist: School staff will be required to resume operations and will be asked to develop continuity of learning plans for all students. Teachers will be provided with clear guidance on how assessments, final report cards, and grade progression will be achieved. If schools re-open: School operations will resume as normal. In both cases, departmental exams for high school students have been cancelled until the end of June. Department of Education Services, April 3, 2020 On Tuesday, April 7, school staff will be able to access schools on a voluntary basis should they wish to prepare learning packages for students. The department has a working group developing guidelines for teachers identifying grade-specific areas of focus for learning packages. Packages may look different for each student. School access is for operational purposes only and not for recreation or other non-education-related activities. The department has also provided all schools with health and safety protocols related to COVID-19, including respiratory etiquette, hand washing, and physical distancing. Department of Education Services, March 31, 2020 Minister of Education update: Since March 17, Nunavut schools have been closed to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. As a result, parents and caregivers have been asking for educational resources to help their children continue to learn. Today I am announcing that the Department of Education has developed a learn-at-home website, Angirrami Ilinniarniq (angirrami.com). This website offers free access to some of the same educational resources used in our schools. These include downloadable books and e-books for pre-school ages and up; educational audiobooks and animated videos; tips and activities for learning; and resources for managing stress and mental health. There will also be links to download the department’s Inuktut language learning apps: Uqausiit Pinnguarutiit has fun activities that support Inuit language shape and sound recognition, and vocabulary development. Titirariuqsauti introduces Inuit language symbol sounds and printing paths.  Qimirrunaut is the department’s new Inuktut e-book library app. These apps are available for Android and iOS devices and can be downloaded from the Google Play or Apple App stores. Angirrami Ilinniarniq provides links to other online educational resources on subjects such as science, math, history, and social studies.  I want to also note that although the website launches today, new resources will be regularly added. The priority is to get our Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun resources online as quickly as possible. English and French resources will follow soon after. All the resources found on this site were created by the Department of Education and its partners, including the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and the Representative for Children and Youth’s Office, as well as the Departments of Family Services, Health, Environment, and Economic Development and Transportation. I want to thank all the students, parents, and caregivers for their patience. I know for many of you it has not been easy with schools and child care facilities closed. However, we must all do our part to prevent the spread of COVID-19. I assure you that my department has been working hard to get this website ready as quickly as possible. I encourage Nunavummiut to explore all the resources this website has to offer. Make learning a part of your daily routine! Qujannamiik, quana, thank you, merci. Department of Education Services, March 31, 2020 Today, the Department of Education Is launching a learn-at-home website, Angirrami Ilinniarniq (angirrami.com). This learn-at-home website developed by the Department of Education provides free access to help children and youth continue learning in their language during the school closure. Upon recommendation from the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO), schools and daycare facility closures for students and children will be extended until end of day April 20. At that point and time, the CPHO will reassess and provide direction. Department of Education Services, March 25, 2020 Ongoing services: Bus service contracts will continue to be paid during the three-week school closure. Department of Education Services, March 24, 2020 The Department of Education is supporting the Department of Family Services in coordinating the return of out of territory FANS students and their families to Nunavut. The Department of Education is providing funds to licensed child care facilities to cover parental fees from March 17-April 7, 2020. All licensed child care facilities in Nunavut that charge parental fees will qualify for the grant. Funding will be processed and sent to licensed child care facilities by Friday, March 27, 2020. During this time, parents will not be required to pay parental fees.

Department of Education Services update, March 20, 2020 Adjusted services: To reinforce social distancing and reduce the potential transmission of COVID-19, the Department of Education is limiting in-office work to essential employees only. Closed /Cancelled/Suspended services: All schools and child care facilities in Nunavut are closed for a three-week period, starting Tuesday, March 17, 2020. 		  Department of Education Services update - March 19, 2020 Education and several GN departments are working closely together to reduce the impact school closures have on food programs. The Department of Education will be providing funds to all licensed child care facilities. This funding will be equal to the parental fees licenced child care facilities would be normally receiving during this three-week closure. This will allow licenced child care facilities to not charge parental fees for this period but still pay their staff as normal. Closed /Cancelled/Suspended services: All schools and child care facilities in Nunavut are closed for a three-week period, starting Tuesday, March 17, 2020.    "
3,2020-10-21,Canada,Nunavut,,https://gov.nu.ca/health/news/confirmed-covid-19-case-mary-river-mine-0,Government Website,Confirmed COVID-19 case at Mary River Mine,"   21 October 2020News Release Confirmed COVID-19 case at Mary River Mine Iqaluit, Nunavut (October 21, 2020) – Dr. Michael Patterson, Nunavut’s Chief Public Health Officer, today announced a positive case of COVID-19 at the Mary River Mine, 176 km southwest of Pond Inlet. The individual is asymptomatic and in isolation. Contact tracing was initiated by mine staff according to mine protocols, and identified contacts were also placed in isolation. There is no evidence of transmission at Mary River Mine at this time. Nunavut’s Public Health team is ready to provide support and respond if, and when, it becomes necessary. As there are no Nunavut residents currently working at the Mary River Mine, the risk of COVID-19 spreading to communities due to this positive case is very low. The current public health measures, Nunavut’s Path and the Common Travel Areas with Churchill, Manitoba and the Northwest Territories remain unaffected.

On September 28, the Department of Health activated its Rapid Response Team to contain an outbreak of COVID-19 at TMAC Resources’ Hope Bay mine. TMAC Resources contacted my office on September 26 about an employee developing symptoms consistent with COVID-19. The individual and identified contacts were swabbed and the samples sent to Rankin Inlet for testing. Seven of the samples yielded positive results, and all were sent to a southern lab for confirmatory testing. Two of those tests have since been confirmed. As the test results indicated transmission of COVID-19 at the mine site, we initiated our rapid response plan to assist in containing the virus. All non-critical travel to and from the mine was also halted. The Rapid Response Team has been conducting additional contact tracing and taking samples. As of last night, five more swabs were flown to Rankin Inlet for testing on the GeneXpert or BioFire devices, one has tested positive and will be sent for confirmatory testing. The results of one test are still pending. Another eight swabs will be delivered to Rankin Inlet tomorrow. To accurately detect the virus, high risk contacts from the initial batch of tests have been re swabbed to ensure testing is being done at appropriate times during the incubation period. All those who tested positive and high-risk, non-critical staff contacts have been isolated. Critical staff contacts who are required to continue working for the safety of the other workers, are doing so until they can be replaced. Those staff are following strict measures to keep isolated from those around them, including wearing masks. Workers who develop symptoms will be required to isolate immediately. As of Yesterday, the two individuals who were symptomatic have had their symptoms resolve. The Rapid Response Team is currently continuing contact tracing and containment operations and are expected to be on site until the middle of next week. While the transmission of COVID-19 at the mine is concerning, the risk to Nunavummiut from this outbreak remains low. Hope Bay does not currently have Nunavummiut working on site and there is no contact from the mine to any Nunavut communities. Once the Rapid Response Team concludes its work, my office will review the incident and information gathered by the Rapid Response Team. From there, we will determine if there are enhanced measures needed to reduce the risk of another outbreak. Thank you.

With the two-week period concluded, there is no longer a concern that those individuals contracted the virus. These past weeks we have continued to improve our capacity for in-territory testing. The Biofire device in Iqaluit is now operating alongside the GeneXpert machine. Aside from the need to have increased testing capacity in-territory, we also need to improve the turn around time for test results. This week, the Department of Health is starting a pilot project using charter aircraft to transport COVID-19 samples from Baffin communities to Iqaluit. The goal is to have a system in place that will reduce the test results turn around time to five days or less. Once the system is in place and working, we will begin the same process in Rankin Inlet. Increased in-territory testing capacity combined with shorter turnaround times for tests results, will give us more flexibility with our public health measures and improve our response in case of an outbreak. However, testing is not enough. As most people know, the Public Health strategy for minimizing the risks of COVID-19 entering and spreading in the territory relies on several measures. Testing is just one component. Physical distancing, good hygiene like washing our hands, staying home when sick and in the isolation hubs, work in tandem with testing and should not be underestimated. We should also keep in mind that our public health measures are effective only because Nunavummiut, individually and collectively, follow them. We have been effective so far in reducing the risks because each and everyone of us made the conscious choice to adopt and include these measures in our daily lives. Every time we choose to ignore these measures, the risk increases. While the risk can never be zero, we know that these measures are working. Nunavut remains COVID-free. We have seen decreases in respiratory illnesses this year across the territory. It is therefore vital that, individually and collectively, we continue to make the choice to follow public health measures and remain active participants in protecting our families and communities. Thank you   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  Public Health Emergency The Public Health Emergency was extended on Sept. 3 to and is in effect until Sept. 17.

The Government of Nunavut is managing several hubs, and dealing with a large number of requests from both medical and non-essential travellers. In an attempt to help clear up some of the delays to get into the hubs, Iqaluit is being looked at as one of several options to help relieve the wait time for medical travellers in Winnipeg. This has not been finalized and we are actively looking at the possibility of creating a second hub in Winnipeg, specifically for medical travellers. Our commitment is to ensure our medical travellers are well cared for and we are prioritizing their stays above non-essential travellers. We understand the concerns raised on social media over the weekend. However, nothing has been confirmed about an Iqaluit or additional Winnipeg hub. We recognize the fear and uncertainty that comes with COVID-19. However, we need to balance that fear with facts, the best possible care for Nunavummiut and our commitment to public health and safety. When there is an official course of action on this, we will announce it with all the relevant information. As we work to relieve this backlog, we thank those waiting for a spot in the isolation hubs for their patience and understanding. We are working around the clock to keep our territory and Nunavummiut safe. Thanks to all the staff who have worked so hard to keep everyone well during COVID-19.

On July 20, all licensed establishments in the territory will be allowed to open with regular hours. Nunavut will also be extending its common travel area to include Churchill, Manitoba. This bubble is exclusive to the community of Churchill and does not extend to other regions of Manitoba. The common travel area applies to air, land and water travel and exempts travellers from isolation requirements in either Nunavut or Churchill under certain conditions: Travel must originate from Nunavut to Churchill or from Churchill to Nunavut. Travellers must have not been outside either Churchill or Nunavut for 2 weeks prior to travelling. Travellers must remain in either Nunavut or Churchill for the duration of their stay. Prior to travelling outside of Nunavut, travellers must contact the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer for Nunavut and provide: Contact information, such as an address and phone number, at the person’s regular place of residence; and A written declaration that can be obtained by emailing CPHOtravelrequests@gov.nu.ca or by going to the Department of Health’s website. When travelling by air, travellers are required to obtain a letter from the CPHO authorizing travel or they will not be permitted to board their flight. Those who leave the common travel area outside of Churchill will need to isolate for 14 days at a government isolation facility, prior to returning to Nunavut. I would like to also take this opportunity to thank all Nunavummiut for their patience as we work together to protect our territory and families from COVID-19.

We are still waiting on confirmatory results for the presumptive case detected in the Mary River Mine, with the expectation that they will be ready sometime this week. The Department of Health continues to monitor the situation at the Mary River Mine site closely, and we will provide support as needed. I want to take this opportunity and remind Nunavummiut that: Testing is only one component of the Public Health response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Testing is important, but it is not a replacement for social distancing or hand-washing. Testing is important, but it is absolutely not a replacement for 14 days of isolation. The Government of Nunavut follows testing guidelines and best practices that have been endorsed by the World Health Organization and Health Canada. We rely on diagnostic devices that have undergone rigorous validation and accreditation processes to provide dependable testing to Nunavummiut. Even under ideal conditions, and with validated equipment, testing is not always a reliable method of identifying cases of COVID-19 and halting transmission. There is strong evidence that false negatives can occur throughout the incubation period. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the overarching goal of our public health response is to identify, contain and break transmission. The Government of Nunavut will continue to look at emerging evidence and best practices set out by public health authorities, both nationally and globally, to shape our response to COVID-19, and will alter public health measures as and when appropriate.

Today marks the third bi-weekly announcement for Nunavut’s Path for moving forward during COVID-19. There are still no cases of COVID-19 detected in the territory, so once again we are in a position to alter public health measures. I’m pleased to announce the following changes under the new Order Respecting Social Distancing and Gatherings, which goes into effect today: The limit for outdoor gatherings has now been increased to 50 people. The limit for indoor gatherings has been increased to 10 people. In private dwellings, this means 10 people in addition to those who reside there. The limit for gatherings at places of worship, conference facilities, community halls, rental meeting spaces, and gatherings organized by the Government of Canada, Government of Nunavut, municipal corporation, or Regional Inuit Organizations has been set at 50 people or 50% of capacity for the facility, whichever is less. In all facilities and gatherings, it is still expected that social distancing is maintained. As we take another step forward on Nunavut’s Path, and we return to some of the activities, programs, or venues that we’ve missed, we need to remain diligent in our collective commitment to practice social distancing and good hand hygiene. If you make the choice to participate in a large gathering, or attend an indoor event, or even meet up with friends for dinner, please also choose to be responsible, and choose to take actions that will keep yourself, your community, and your territory, safe. Wash your hands. Keep six feet away from others. Avoid touching your face. Sanitize high-touch areas often. Consider wearing a mask when social distancing is difficult. If you don’t feel well, stay home. Thank you. 				   				As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  Calling Ahead at Health Centres Unless you are experiencing a medical emergency, please call your health centre first before going in.

As of today, Nunavut is resuming regular medical travel to Churchill, Manitoba. As Churchill has not had a confirmed case of COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic, we have determined that the risk of resuming medical travel operations is minimal, and it is greatly outweighed by the benefits of ensuring that Nunavummiut have access to the out-of-territory care they need. Medical travellers and their escorts who travel to Churchill for treatment and do not leave the community for the duration of their stay, will be able to return directly to Nunavut without needing to isolate at a GN designated isolation facility. If the situation changes, we will re-assess and be ready to initiate contact tracing and containment measures immediately. We have also had some inquiries from cab companies regarding their operations. Under the new Order Regarding Social Distancing and Gatherings, cab companies can collect fares from multiple households at once, under specific conditions. Whenever there are multiple passengers in the cab, everyone must wear a mask. Cab drivers must provide masks for riders who do not have them. Most importantly, cab drivers must obtain consent from all passengers before picking up multiple fares. This means that any passenger who is picked up, and all subsequent fares on that ride, must indicate that they are okay with riding in a shared cab with others. All passengers can still request that they do not share their ride with others, and, for now, cab companies must comply with this request. We want to thank all cab companies who have so readily complied with recommendations to limit passenger travel and enhance sanitation procedures in order to keep Nunavummiut safe and healthy. Finally, as restaurants, bars, and other indoor locations are permitted to open, I want to continue to emphasize to Nunavummiut the necessity of social distancing, good hand hygiene, and staying home when we are sick. We need to remember, even as we return to the activities we enjoy, that this pandemic is far from over, and small actions from everyone today add up to major impacts tomorrow.

I am pleased to say that after consultation with my counterpart in the GNWT, as of today, residents of the NWT can travel to Nunavut without isolating prior to arrival. The establishment of the common travel area by air or by land between the two territories does however come with strict conditions and expectations: Travel must originate from Nunavut to the NWT or from the NWT to Nunavut. Travellers have not been outside their respective territory for two weeks prior to their travel to the NWT or Nunavut. Travellers remain in either territory for the duration of their stay. Travellers from the NWT who wish to enter Nunavut, must write to: cphotravelrequests@gov.nu.ca and complete and sign the Nunavut and NWT Traveller’s Declaration form. Failure to do so will affect entry in Nunavut. Failure to answer truthfully will be subject to fines. This also applies for Nunavummiut who wish to return home after their stay in the NWT. My office will issue a letter of approval. Travellers will be required to present the approval letter prior to boarding any airplane entering Nunavut. Isolation before entering Nunavut is still required if You are a Nunavut resident who is returning home from travel in southern Canada via Yellowknife. In this case, you will need to complete a 14-day isolation period in the GN isolation hub in Yellowknife. You are an NWT resident who has travelled outside your territory less than two weeks before your scheduled arrival in Nunavut. In this case, you will need to complete the NWT isolation requirements before applying for travel to Nunavut. I want to re-assure Nunavummiut that should the current situation change in either territory, we will re-assess the common travel area and take all necessary measures to protect the health and safety of Nunavummiut. Further Information can be found in Travel and Isolation section of the Department of Health website at https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/travel-and-isolation. Today also marks the second of our bi-weekly announcements regarding the status of current health measures. Beginning June 22: Personal service providers will also be permitted to open for one-on-one sessions. This includes hairdressers and nail salons. Again, these facilities will be responsible for ensuring that PPE is available for both clients and service providers when requested. Bars and restaurants will be allowed to re-open and operate at half capacity. Last call for alcohol service will be at 9 p.m.. Facility operators need to ensure that patrons are respecting social distancing. Liquor Inspectors have the authority to enforce orders regarding social distancing, and they will be monitoring to ensure adherence to these conditions. Theatres and churches are also permitted to re-open on June 22. On June 29: Youth centres and day camps will be able to resume operations. Long-term care facilities will begin accepting visitors in a limited capacity; they can only allow one to two visitors per resident at a time, and these visitors can only be immediate family. Guidelines for re-opening will be available on the health website in the coming days. Though we can reasonably forecast what the next two weeks may bring, we must remain aware of the possible need to change or re-introduce public health measures. While we are in a position to ease restrictions, we remain vulnerable to the impacts of this global pandemic. Every week, new information becomes available. Every week, the situation can change. What doesn’t change is that social distancing, washing your hands and staying home when you are sick are the three main actions each and everyone of us can take to keep our families and our communities safe.

Right now, travel into Nunavut represents the single biggest risk for introducing COVID-19. The travel ban, and the 14-day isolation requirements for returning Nunavummiut, are meant to mitigate this risk and keep our territory safe. Knowing that, I’d like to take this opportunity to share information on the new process being implemented for reserving stays in GN southern isolation facilities. Moving forward, all Nunavummiut who must travel outside of the territory should contact the email address NUisolationreservations@nunavutcare.ca and submit an Isolation Reservation Request Form as soon as they know their plans for travel. From there, the travel team will work to identify room availability and reserve your stay in one of the designated isolation facilities. This new streamlined process is meant to help Nunavummiut plan for their 14-day quarantine period farther in advance and ensures that our travel team can anticipate and accommodate travellers in the coming months. More information, including intake days requirements, can also be found on the Department of Health’s website. Remember, non-essential travel outside of the territory is still not recommended. All individuals who are applying for critical worker exemption will continue to use the email address CPHOTravelRequests@gov.nu.ca. Finally, the Department of Health has made temporary amendments to the Medical Travel Policy to help keep our medical travellers and escorts safe from COVID-19. Specific provisions have been added to ensure that medical travellers and escorts abide by rules of social distancing, hand-washing hygiene, and other behaviours that help to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The amendments also more clearly outline the requirements for both medical travellers and escorts to complete 14 days of self-isolation at a designated isolation facility prior to returning to Nunavut. As we continue to look at ways of easing public health measures and returning the activities we enjoy, we must remain diligent and aware that the threat of COVID-19 has not yet passed. Please continue to maintain physical distancing and handwashing practices, and limit any non-essential travel out of the territory.

This annual event highlights the health risks associated with tobacco use, and advocates for effective policies to reduce tobacco consumption. Right now, we are all working hard to commit to our public health measures that protect us from the threat of COVID-19. We are social distancing, staying home as much as possible, and washing our hands as much as we can. These actions are keeping ourselves, our communities, and our territory safe. Quitting tobacco use is one more step we can take to guard ourselves against the impact of this pandemic. We know that COVID-19 is mainly a respiratory virus, and early evidence suggests that smoking can make symptoms worse. Smokers are also likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19, as smoking increases the likelihood of transmission from one’s face and lips. Please remember: do not share cigarettes, joints, or pipes. Do not pick up discarded cigarette or cannabis butts. Wash your hands often, and refrain from touching your face. The best thing that we can do for our health is to quit smoking. By making the decision to quit smoking, we can help to protect ourselves from COVID-19 today, and dramatically improve our health for the coming weeks, months, and years. Support is available for anyone who wants to explore options to help them quit. Message a counsellor on the Tobacco Has No Place Here Facebook page or call 1-866-368-7848 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The service is private and free. Counsellors can help you in Inuktitut, English, Inuinnaqtun and French. Nicotine replacement therapy, or NRT, is also available at no cost through the Non-Insured Health Benefits program at your local health centre or pharmacy. Call ahead, and ask your health care provider for information and options for NRT. Thank you. Chief Public Health Officer update Good morning. Today marks the start of Nunavut’s Path forward. Day cares, territorial parks, and playgrounds are permitted to re-open, and the size limit for outdoor gatherings has been increased to 25. Today will also be the first of our bi-weekly assessments concerning the modification of public health measures. As we look at altering public health measures, I want to take a moment and emphasize to all Nunavummiut the continued importance of social distancing. While we are in a position today to alter measures, we are not in a position to take social distancing for granted. We’ve noticed through the contact tracing of persons under investigation that people’s contact bubbles are becoming noticeably larger. Larger contact bubbles will make it significantly more challenging to identify and prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. COVID-19 continues to pose a risk to Nunavummiut, and we are not immune to this pandemic. We’ve made it this far thanks to our collective efforts, but those efforts absolutely have to continue. With that said, I’m pleased to announce the following modifications to public health measures that will be occurring over the next two weeks. Effective immediately, in-territory travel advisories are lifted. Travel outside of Nunavut is still not recommended. Individuals who are travelling outside of the territory need to be aware not only of the isolation procedures to return, but also of the measures that other jurisdictions may have in place to limit or discourage travel. On June 8, workplaces and retail outlets are permitted to re-open, provided that they have safety measures in place. Galleries, museums, and libraries may also be opened for individual viewing and browsing, though group sessions are still prohibited. There will also be an increased availability of in-person health assessments at health centres across the territory. On June 15, dental clinics, physiotherapy clinics, massage therapy, and chiropractic treatments are permitted to resume. Gyms and pools will also be permitted to re-open for solo workouts and lap swimming only. Please note, that all these measures are subject to alteration should conditions change.

Department of Health Services, May 28, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update Good morning. I’d like to take this opportunity to clarify the conditions required in order for us to consider altering the current border measures in place. I have previously indicated that the border restrictions currently in place will likely be among the final public health measures that are lifted. This is because right now travel into Nunavut from outside of the territory represents the highest risk. If we want to continue Nunavut’s Path, and remove additional public health measures inside the territory, then we need to maintain our strict travel measures. This is our best chance to both return to the activities we enjoy and the programs we depend on, while still protecting the health and safety of Nunavummiut. With that said, fulfillment of any of the following conditions may influence decisions to alter our border measures. Development of a vaccine for COVID-19. We’ve already discussed this, and though it is unlikely that a vaccine will be developed and readily available in the near future, it is still a factor that would greatly influence all of our public health measures; Development or discovery of an effective treatment for COVID-19; Indication that COVID-19 is under control in our neighboring jurisdictions. This means that beyond just decreasing case numbers, we would need to see evidence that community transmission in neighboring jurisdictions is minimal and contained; And finally, achievement of sustainable and on-going diagnostic capacity in every community in Nunavut. Unfortunately, many of these factors are outside of our control, but we will continue to monitor the evolving global situation. As always, our decisions surrounding the border measures will be guided by evidence and will be designed to protect and preserve the health and safety of Nunavummiut throughout this global pandemic. I would like to remind Nunavummiut that as of Monday, June 1, playgrounds, territorial parks, and daycares are permitted to open, and the size of outdoor gatherings may increase to 25. On June 1, we will also begin our bi-weekly announcements on the assessment and potential easing of additional public health measures. The reason we have chosen two weeks as our interval of choice is straightforward. All evidence suggests that 14 days is the maximum incubation time for COVID-19. So, this 14-day window will give us an opportunity to assess the situation around us and make informed decisions based on the latest information available. Please remember that if a threat is detected, we may need to react immediately. We will provide as much warning as possible, but we may need to introduce additional public health measures right away. Finally, the Department is issuing a Public Health Advisory to the community of Sanikiluaq due to the detection of pertussis, also known as whooping cough. Whooping cough is a disease of the throat or lungs that is spread easily from person to person. Anyone can get whooping cough, but the most severe cases are in young children. For that reason, the daycare in Sanikiluaq must remain closed for the time being. Thank you.  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

These past two months have not been easy, and all Nunavummiut have had to make sacrifices. However, thanks to our combined efforts, we are protecting our families, our communities, and our territory from this pandemic, and I hope that all Nunavummiut can feel a sense of pride knowing that their actions are making a deep and measurable impact on keeping Nunavut healthy and safe. It is time for us to move forward. This does not mean that this pandemic is over. This does not mean that the threat has passed. This means that we can cautiously begin our return to the activities we enjoy, knowing that at any time we may need to change our behaviour to protect ourselves from emerging threats. In the coming weeks, we will work with our stakeholders to re-introduce our businesses, our activities, and our programs in a way that is safe, sustainable, and poses the least risk to the health and safety of Nunavummiut. Know that as we begin to loosen restrictions internally, it is imperative that our strict border measures remain to minimize the risk of introducing COVID-19 into the territory. With that being said, I’m pleased to announce that as of June 1: Daycares will be permitted to open up for regular business. The size limit for outdoor gatherings will increase to 25 people. Territorial parks will be allowed to reopen for outdoor activities only, if local circumstances permit. All park buildings will remain closed. Municipal playgrounds will be allowed to re-open, again, if local circumstances permit. These particular conditions have been selected because they are deemed low risk. Moving forward, our plan is to re-assess our condition every two weeks. If the state of COVID in Nunavut is favorable, we will continue to lift public health measures, beginning with lower risk activities and programs. If our condition is stable, we may remain at the status quo until we are confident that lifting additional restrictions would not pose an undue risk to Nunavummiut. Finally, if the threat of COVID-19 increases, or eased public health measures are posing a potential public health threat to the territory, we may need to introduce or re-introduce certain conditions. I share in everyone’s desire to return to normal. We all want to know when we can confidently and safely travel within our own territory, or to our neighbouring jurisdictions. However, trying to forecast specific dates and timelines for when we can lift all of our public health measures would be inaccurate, and frankly, it would be insincere. The COVID-19 pandemic is evolving rapidly, and every single week yields new information that shapes our strategy and our public health measures. Predictions and decisions made on the basis of today’s understanding of the virus may be obsolete in a short time. For this reason, we have opted for an approach that is flexible, cautious, and adaptive to the evolving situation around us. Again, I want to thank all Nunavummiut for their continued patience and understanding. No one is left unaffected by this pandemic, but our collective accountability has kept Nunavut safe so far. This accountability and responsibility needs to continue, and, as we loosen restrictions, we must continue to practice social distancing, stay away from others when we are sick and wash our hands often. Thank you.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

I am pleased to announce several items today. The first is that Rankin Inlet now has the ability to provide testing if a positive case is confirmed in-territory. I’d like to commend the medical and laboratory staff, especially Matt Stacey and Dr. Jasmine Pawa, who have been working tirelessly to become acquainted with the GeneXpert machine, and to ensure that it can be managed safely, efficiently, and accurately. Getting this machine up and running is a significant step forward for Nunavut, as this now fulfills our criteria of obtaining reliable and effective in-territory diagnostic capacity. When coupled with the fact that we still have no confirmed cases of COVID-19 inside the territory, we have now met two of our three conditions. While the situation in southern Canada will continue to play a role in our approach moving forward, we are now in a better position to consider reducing some restrictions in the territory. I have one other piece of news I would like to share. Moving forward, Kitikmeot medical travellers receiving treatment in Yellowknife are no longer required to undergo the 14-day isolation period, and instead will be permitted to return home immediately. This decision has been made through consultation with the Northwest Territories and is contingent on there being no active cases of COVID-19 in the NWT. Please note that this is for medical travellers only, and this is only when their treatment is provided in Yellowknife. Any medical traveller who needs to leave the Northwest Territories to receive treatment in other cities in Canada will still be required to complete their 14-day isolation period. For all medical travellers to whom this new rule applies who are currently in quarantine, we are working to get you home as soon as possible. As always, our main goal is the safety, health and well being of Nunavummiut. I would like to thank you all for your patience, understanding and support as we continue to care for our families and our communities.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, May 8, 2020 Minister of Health update: It was announced at the start of this year by the World Health Organization that all of 2020 was to be recognized as the Year of the Nurse and the Midwife. This was an opportunity to celebrate the vital role of nurses and midwives in the delivery of health care services across the world. Several months later, in the midst of this global pandemic, we are not just talking about their essential role in keeping us healthy, we are experiencing it firsthand. Nurses and midwives continue to deliver vital health care services in our territory, in our country, and throughout the world. May 11 to 17 is recognized as National Nursing Week. As our nurses work tirelessly to ensure that Nunavummiut have access to the care they need, I think it’s important that we all take this opportunity to show them our immense gratitude for their service and their contribution to this territory. Nunavut has more than 300 nurses who are essential to the development and delivery of programs that keep Nunavummiut healthy. In these uncertain times, as the world battles COVID-19, our nurses are on the front line, providing care to those who need it most. This pandemic has demonstrated our nurses’ willingness to put their own health and safety at risk to protect and care for those around them. This National Nursing Week, and indeed this entire Year of The Nurse and Midwife, give us an opportunity to shine a spotlight on these essential health staff. However, our gratitude for your service is not restricted to a single week, or a single year. I would like all Nunavummiut to join me in showing our ongoing appreciation for your continued dedication to this territory. Thank you.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, May 6, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update: Since it was confirmed that the detected COVID case in Nunavut was a false positive, the territory has witnessed great displays of solidarity, support, and pride. The additional restrictions in Pond Inlet have been lifted, and I hope that the community feels a measure of relief knowing that they are still COVID-free. This is good news. As a territory, we have done well so far. However, we cannot allow our celebration to lapse into complacency. It is more important than ever that we maintain these rules that we’ve all become familiar with. The threat of COVID-19 is still very real and we need to stay the course. Practise social distancing. Avoid contact with individuals who are not a member of your household. Limit trips for errands. Purchase only the supplies that your household needs. And, of course, wash your hands. There is no combination of measures that can absolutely guarantee the prevention of COVID-19. Even as we celebrate for Pond Inlet, all Nunavummiut need to remain vigilant and cautious. Follow the rules, and encourage your friends, family, and neighbours to do the same. I want to thank all Nunavummiut for their continued patience, understanding, and cooperation. We can only get through this together.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Travel outside the territory as of May 7, 2020: The Government of Nunavut’s decision to charge $2,100 per individual and $1,050 for each additional family member during the mandatory 14-day isolation stays for residents returning to the territory has been reversed. The Government of Nunavut will continue to cover these costs as long as mandatory isolation for residents returning to the territory is in place. Please keep in mind that travel outside of Nunavut during the COVID-19 pandemic is not advised.    Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

This means that although the first test result showed COVID-19 infection, further investigation and testing have not shown any other evidence of COVID-19 infection in Pond Inlet. As I have previously mentioned, no lab test is perfect. There is always a chance of false positive or false negative results. When interpreting results and deciding on an appropriate course of action, we consider many pieces of information, of which test results are just one piece. We always aim to err on the side of caution. Diagnostic tests are part of an entire system of measures to intervene on COVID-19 infection. In these circumstances the test gave an incorrect result, but the rest of the system (public health nurses, contact tracing, surveillance) have not identified any other cases of COVID-19 infection. The information available so far includes: The individual involved has not been outside of Pond Inlet for some time. We have not identified an exposure to COVID-19. We have not found any other cases of COVID-19 in Pond Inlet. We have not noticed any increase in significant respiratory infections. 			  For all of the reasons above we believe that the individual in Pond Inlet does not, and never did have COVID-19. As a result, our rapid response team will stop operating in Pond Inlet and the members of the team will begin preparing for future deployments. All territorial orders under the Public Health Emergency remain in effect. However, the additional measures specific to Pond Inlet as a result of the positive COVID-19 case are now lifted. Effective immediately, travel between Pond Inlet and other Nunavut communities may resume, and the community-specific restrictions on businesses and services in Pond Inlet are also rescinded.      Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

The Rapid Response Team is in the community, and they are implementing containment and contact tracing. As the team completes additional testing, there is the possibility that more positive cases may be confirmed in the community. This does not necessarily mean that there is community transmission and should not be cause for alarm. What this does mean is that the Rapid Response Team is doing their job, which is finding the virus and stopping it from spreading. Containment is key, and right now it is our top priority. As this process takes place, the Government of Nunavut will continue to support the community of Pond Inlet. I also want to take a moment and thank the municipality of Pond Inlet and its residents for allowing me to answer their questions earlier today on the community radio. Moving forward, I would like to remind all Nunavummiut, using the strongest possible terms, that every single social interaction carries a degree of risk. Despite all of the Government of Nunavut’s preventative measures, and the new containment measures now in place within Pond Inlet, it is impossible to reasonably predict where or when COVID-19 may be detected next. I urge all Nunavummiut to exercise a high degree of caution, and to seriously consider these risks before participating in a gathering of any kind. If you deem it necessary to participate in gatherings, then please keep track of the people with whom you interact, as this information may be necessary in case contact tracing needs to be conducted in your community. Health staff cannot get us through this alone. How well we do, and where we go from here, depends on the actions of every single Nunavummiut. Right now, the best way of slowing the spread of COVID-19 continues to be through social distancing and effective hygiene. If everyone follows these rules together, we can put ourselves in the best position to make it through this uncertain time. It’s more important than ever that we be careful, responsible, kind, and supportive. I’d like to thank Nunavummiut for their continued cooperation and understanding. As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Travel outside the territory as of May 7, 2020 Starting May 7, 2020, Nunavummiut who chose to travel outside Nunavut while the CPHO’s travel ban is still in effect will have to cover the costs of their 14-day isolation period in one of the Government of Nunavut’s isolation sites. The fee for a single individual in a room is $2,100 for the 14-day period, and each additional family member in the room will pay $1,050. Updates will be provided as they become available. 			   Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, April 30, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update As you have seen and heard, today we have announced that a case of COVID-19 has been detected within Pond Inlet. Since the onset of the pandemic, we knew that no combination of preventative measures can absolutely guarantee the prevention of COVID-19. We anticipated that sooner or later the virus would be detected in the territory. Just as we have poured extensive effort into our prevention plan, so too have we developed a comprehensive response plan to minimize, to the greatest possible extent, the impact that COVID-19 has on Nunavut. We have been in contact with hamlet authorities and have initiated our Rapid Response Plan. A Rapid Response Team has already been deployed to Pond Inlet and is scheduled to arrive early this afternoon. That team will immediately initiate containment measures, begin contact tracing, and monitor the health and well-being of persons on home isolation orders. The Pond Inlet Health Centre is well-staffed and prepared, and health centre operations will continue. All passenger travel in and out of Pond Inlet has ceased. This includes any movement in or out of the community by land travel. This travel ban is a necessary containment measure to minimize the risk of COVID-19 spreading to multiple communities at once. Until we have determined the potential spread of the virus within the community, all non-essential offices and services will be closed. There is to be no social gatherings within dwellings, and all residents of Pond Inlet are asked to continue to maintain social distancing and good hygiene. For residents of Pond Inlet, we recognize that this news may be frightening. However, the Government of Nunavut would like to assure everyone that although travel is restricted, you are not cut off from help and support. Critical services will be maintained, and plans are in place to ensure that access to services such as heat, power, water, sewer, and communications will not be interrupted. Our primary focus now is to detect and contain the virus to prevent further transmission within the community and to other communities. Anyone who has reason to believe that they have been exposed to the virus is advised to call the COVID-19 hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. or 6 p.m. or call your community health centre. Please, do not go to the health centre in person unless you are instructed to by a health official. To all Nunavummiut, know that the preventative measures that we have all been taking are more important now than ever. Everyone needs to practise social distancing, stay home whenever possible, and avoid contact with those who are not a member of your household. Together, our efforts can slow the spread of COVID-19. Finally, I remind everyone of the importance of kindness. Now is not the time for blame, or shame. It is the time for compassion, empathy, and support of your fellow Nunavummiut. The Government of Nunavut thanks all Nunavummiut for their efforts to date. We will continue to exhaust all efforts to contain the virus, and minimize its impact on Pond Inlet, and on all the territory. Only together can we all protect our territory from the threat of COVID-19.    Department of Health Services  Residents of Pond Inlet must call their health centre first. All regular appointments at the Pond Inlet Health Centre have been cancelled. Only emergency services are available.  COVID-19 Hotline and self-assessment tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or call their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days. Nunavummiut can also use the self-assessment tool available at www.gov.nu.ca COMMUNITY TRAVEL AND GATHERINGS RESTRICTION ORDER POND INLET All travel to and from Pond Inlet is banned except: People with a letter from the CPHO Medevac patients Flight crews Nunavut Inuit exercising their hunting rights as set out in Article 5 may leave and return to Pond Inlet but not travel to any other community People travelling on a flight which must land in Pond Inlet due to weather or emergency Medevac crews must restrict movements to the airport and the health centre and must wear personal protective equipment. All businesses operating in Pond Inlet must close except for: Grocery stores Fuel and motor vehicle stations Post office Restaurants open for take out service All social gatherings shall be restricted to five persons or fewer. No social gatherings in dwellings. The order can be consulted at:https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/covid-19-novel-coronavirus   Department of Health Services, April 29, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update As many of you may know, some jurisdictions in Canada have started or will soon begin a gradual lifting of the restrictions they have implemented to flatten the COVID curve. Today I’d like to speak in more detail about what needs to happen before we can do the same. There are three conditions that need to be met before we can consider relaxing existing restrictions in the territory. They are as follows: We need to achieve in-territory diagnostic capacity. This means that we need to be able to implement a rapid, accurate, and comprehensive COVID-19 testing program here in Nunavut; There needs to be significant indication that rates of COVID-19 are decreasing in the southern jurisdictions to which Nunavummiut most often travel; and There needs to remain no active cases of COVID-19 within Nunavut. The nature of these conditions means that it is difficult to assign a specific timeline to re-opening, but fulfillment of these conditions is necessary to minimize risk to public health and safety. We need to know that Nunavummiut travelling outside of the territory can do so safely, and we need to be able to respond rapidly to any confirmed cases of COVID-19 within Nunavut. I know that people are eager to go back to work, visit loved ones, and engage in social activities. However, if we lift these restrictions too early, we will increase the risk to Nunavummiut. If we aren’t careful about how we transition back from these restrictions, then we could effectively undo all the hard work and sacrifices that we’ve made over the past seven weeks. It is as important as ever that we stay the course: maintain social distancing, stay home whenever possible, and wash your hands often. These measures continue to be the best defence against COVID-19, and the best way to protect our families, our communities, and our territory.   Department of Health Services Access to health care services will remain available in all communities seven days a week. All non-urgent requests will be triaged daily. Immediate access to urgent and emergent health care services are and will continue to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. All clients are asked to call before presenting at a health facility. In Iqaluit, public health, the emergency room and inpatient unit will remain open.

The new order adds clarity around gatherings and social distancing and provides easy to understand scenarios that will help Nunavummiut more easily follow the order. It will also help businesses understand how to adjust their operations to ensure public safety and continued operation. Finally, the changes will also assist law enforcement and peace officers to more easily interpret the intent of the order in the unlikely event there is a need for enforcement. I’d like to outline some of the new definitions and information provided in the new order. Food service establishments and licensed premises remain closed. Restaurants can still provide options for take-out or delivery, as long as they abide by the rules of social distancing while doing so. All businesses deemed as Personal Service Providers must also remain closed. These include hair dressing, barbering, massage therapy, and other similar establishments. Additionally, dentists, veterinarians, and psychologists must remain closed, except for emergencies. Public playgrounds, municipal parks, and day-use areas of territorial parks also remain closed. Though still subject to closures and limitations, the following businesses are permitted to remain open: any business large enough to maintain a two-metre social distance within the workplace, or businesses that limit customers to no more than five at a time. The five-at-a-time rule does not apply to businesses that are large enough to maintain social distancing throughout the entire premise, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and similar facilities. The order provides a definition to gatherings. All organized public gatherings of more than five people remain prohibited. This includes concerts, community events, sporting events, and ceremonies such as marriages, funerals, or memorial services. Finally, all social gatherings, including social gatherings in private dwellings, shall be restricted to five persons or fewer. This includes play groups, club meetings, and meals with individuals who do not reside together. This new order does not mean that restrictions are being loosened, or that the Government of Nunavut has re-assessed the territory’s position or tolerance for risk. Instead, the definitions under this new order have been aligned with definitions being applied in other jurisdictions. This makes restrictive measures clearer and more consistent in their application and enforcement. It is strongly recommended that Nunavummiut limit contact with anyone who is not a member of their immediate household. Any social gathering carries a degree of risk, especially when we are looking at individuals from multiple different households mingling together. Nunavummiut must still exercise caution at all times, practise social distancing to the greatest extent possible, and wash hands and all shared surfaces thoroughly and often. The previous order met the intended purpose of providing necessary tools to help protect public health. However, The Government of Nunavut recognized the need to provide clearer language and definitions. For this reason, the Department of Justice worked with the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) to prepare a new Order to ensure the language is clear and understandable while remaining true to its intent.

This resource is user-friendly, available in all four official languages, and can be accessed through the Government of Nunavut webpage at https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/covid-19-novel-coronavirus. The purpose of this self-assessment tool is to provide Nunavummiut with real-time information and recommendations based on self-reported symptoms or recent travel history. The tool will help Nunavummiut determine whether they should self-isolate, and when they should contact a health care service provider for additional follow-up or testing. This tool is meant to supplement the existing resources that are already available, and it is not a replacement for social distancing and good hygiene, such as washing regularly. Mass gatherings are still banned, and everyone is still required to follow the rules. Nunavummiut who don’t have access to online resources but believe that they are displaying COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, are encouraged to call the COVID Hotline at 1-888-975-8601. You can also ask someone with internet access to complete the self-assessment on your behalf by sharing with them your travel history and any symptoms that you may be experiencing.

This means that many Nunavummiut currently in the south are coming to the end of their mandatory 14-day isolation periods. It is time for many of these residents to return home. The mandatory rules we put in place in our isolation sites are very strict. I think it is important to remind everyone that for 14 days, residents are: Confined in their hotel rooms most of the day. Have no physical contact with other residents undergoing isolation and no physical contact with the general population. Are allowed only monitored outings on hotel grounds. Must have daily health check-ins with on-site nurses. Are held responsible if they break isolation. There are no exceptions. These measures are a first step and they ensure Nunavummiut who want to come home, as well as their families and communities, remain healthy and safe. The second step is bringing residents home. I want to take a moment and outline this process: 48 hours before anticipated departure, travellers are informed on the clearance and travel process. The day before departure, the nurses on-site review each traveller’s daily check-in logs to make sure they complied with the isolation rules. The nurses conduct a final in-person assessment to ensure travellers are healthy and show no symptoms of COVID-19. The assessments and results are sent to my office – and a decision to clear a traveller for the scheduled return home is made and a letter approving travel is issued. Residents need both the letter and a proof of residency to return to the territory. The day of departure, residents approved for travel are transported from the hotel to the airport via a private shuttle, sanitized thoroughly before use. The Government of Nunavut worked with airlines to minimize, to the greatest possible extent, the risk of anyone being exposed to COVID-19 during their travel back to the territory. Airports have enhanced cleaning, sanitation and passenger procedures throughout the check-in and security process that ensure physical distancing. As an additional precaution, residents will also undergo an airline health check prior to boarding. Until they arrive at their final destination in Nunavut, residents remain bound by the isolation agreement they signed the day they accepted to enter the isolation sites. Residents will travel to Nunavut on both chartered and scheduled flights: Residents travelling on chartered flights are shuttled directly to their airplane for boarding and take-off. Once in Nunavut, they will be chartered to their final in-territory destination. Residents travelling on scheduled flights are dropped off at the airport, where they are met and guided by airline employees to check-in, through security, to the boarding area and finally on the plane. They do not come in contact with other travellers during this process and remain bound by their isolation agreement. I want to thank our returning residents for going through these drastic measures to protect their communities and Nunavut. As we welcome back friends, family members, and loved ones, it is more important than ever to follow the rules: All social gatherings are still banned, and all Nunavummiut, including those just returning to their home communities, are expected to do their part to keep Nunavut safe. Practice strict social distancing, stay home when possible, avoid contact with individuals outside of your household, and monitor your health.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Department of Health Services Isolation Sites Those in isolation have access to cable, internet, three meals a day, fresh linens and cleaning supplies.

This equipment will be used to test mine staff for COVID-19. At this time there is no evidence that screening in this fashion is a substitute for 14 days of isolation. This is why Nunavut, and every other Canadian jurisdiction, is using 14 days of isolation after exposure or travel. As a result, I have informed management of Agnico Eagle Mines that these tests do not change the current requirement for mine staff to stay out of the town of Rankin Inlet. The Department of Health is committed to improving and protecting the health of all Nunavummiut. For COVID-19 this means having testing equipment that meets Canadian standards and can be deployed to every community in Nunavut. The equipment used by AEM does not meet these criteria. If the Department of Health were to commit to using devices like this, we would not improve access to COVID testing for all Nunavummiut. The Department of Health continues to work on acquiring diagnostic capability that can be rapidly deployed and will provide quick access to results for all Nunavummiut. The combination of machines we continue to pursue will not only allow testing in all communities but will also improve our ability to rapidly diagnose a number of other infectious diseases that threaten Nunavummiut on a regular basis. Testing for COVID-19 at the wrong time can produce incorrect results and create a false sense of reassurance.     As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Department of Health Services The Public Health Emergency has been extended until April 16.

The total number of persons followed to date is 3159. There are 523 persons currently being followed. Dr. Patterson will speak in just a moment about the situation at Hope Bay Mine. First, I want to thank everyone who has worked so hard over the last few weeks to make sure this outbreak was contained, traced and isolated. This work is invaluable in better understanding COVID-19, how it is transmitted, and how we can keep people safe – not just in Nunavut, but in other jurisdictions as well. Thank you to the Rapid Response Team, the Office of the Public Health Officer, and everyone involved in the logistics over the past few weeks and months preparing for a situation like this. We appreciate all your hard work to keep Nunavummiut safe and well. Finally, as we head into the Thanksgiving weekend, I remind everyone to stay aware and attentive in keeping food prep areas clean, frequent handwashing, keeping gatherings small and within the current limits, and to stay home if you feel sick. Thanksgiving may not be the same this year, but we still have a lot to be thankful for. As we continue to practice our public health measures and keep one another and our communities safe, please remember: Your actions. Everyone’s health.Chief Public Health Officer update Good morning. I want to begin with an update on the COVID-19 outbreak at Hope Bay Mine. To date, we have confirmed 10 positive cases of COVID-19 at the mine with 6 presumptive positive cases awaiting confirmatory testing. Since arriving at the mine site on September 29, the Rapid Response Team has been working hard to complete the test, trace and isolate protocols required to break transmission of the virus at the mine site. Best practices around the world show that testing, tracing and isolating, combined with other measures such as travel restrictions and mandatory masks protocols for example are effective in stopping further acquisition and as well as containing outbreaks. Restricting travel for the past 10 days was instrumental in containing the outbreak, and in reducing the risk of transmitting COVID-19 to other jurisdictions. The risk to Nunavummiut 	remained low throughout the outbreak. Today, based on the team’s work, I can report that there is no further evidence of transmission on site and while the risk can never be zero, we do consider the outbreak at Hope Bay Mine contained. This means that travel to and from the mine can resume. Individuals who have finished their isolation period, and individuals who were not identified as high-risk contacts can travel home. Some high-risk contacts remain in isolation and are expected to be cleared to travel within the week. The Rapid Response Team will be leaving the mine this afternoon and isolate for the next 14 days. This week we also moved forward with Nunavut’s Path and further eased public health measures in territory. Among the changes, were increased gathering limits and allowances for expanded recreation activities. We now have testing available in both Rankin Inlet and Iqaluit with a system in place to reduce the time it takes to receive test results. Our pilot project to reduce turnaround times for testing has been successful and has been fully integrated in our operations in the Baffin region. As of October 14, we are extending the project in the Kivalliq and Kitikmeot regions. As always, we will continue to monitor and assess the situation. If the risk increases, we may tighten restrictions to ensure the health and safety of all Nunavummiut. I will end on a happy note and let Nunavut’s young and young at heart know that Halloween is a go for Nunavut. To ensure trick or treating or other Halloween events are done safely, the Department of Health along with Community and Government Services Sports and Recreation have released a set of guidelines. These guidelines are available on the GN website and will be distributed to hamlets. This weekend as we celebrate thanksgiving, I ask people to follow public health guidelines and limit gatherings in homes to 15 people. Stay safe and work together with our public health measures to help reduce the risk of COVID-19 in Nunavut. Thank you.  	As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Department of Education update On October 7, 2020, Minister Joanasie and the Government of Canada’s Minister of Families, Children and Social Development, Ahmed Hussen, announced additional support for early learning, childcare and schools in Nunavut (the Canada-Nunavut Early Learning and Child Care Bilateral Agreement ($2.4 million) and the Safe Restart Agreement ($2.6 million). The Canada-Nunavut Early Learning and Child Care Bilateral Agreement will support and maintain access to affordable early learning and child care programs through operations funding, create child care spaces in underserved communities, promote training and professional development opportunities for early childhood educators, and develop teaching resources and programming materials in all of Nunavut’s official languages. The Safe Restart Agreement will provide enhanced custodial training and supplies for child care facilities and K-12 schools across Nunavut, and be used to purchase laptops, tablets, and internet capacity to support remote learning on an as-needed basis if a community is at a higher risk for COVID-19. 	   Department of Health Update  Total (all health isolation locations)   Traveler type Guests in isolation as of Oct 8 Medical 540 Public 320 Total 860 Traveller repatriation summary: Departure date # of travellers from health isolation sites Oct 8 65 Oct 9 48 Oct 10 0 Oct 11 69 Oct 12 112 Total 307 Critical Worker Requests As of Oct. 8, there were 6898 requests, 3303 of which were critical worker requests.

3,2020-10-08,Canada,Nunavut,,https://gov.nu.ca/education/news/covid-19-department-education-services-update,Government Website,COVID-19 Department of Education Services update,"   08 October 2020  Department of Education Update - October 8, 2020 On October 7, 2020, Minister Joanasie and the Government of Canada’s Minister of Families, Children and Social Development, Ahmed Hussen, announced additional support for early learning, childcare and schools in Nunavut (the Canada-Nunavut Early Learning and Child Care Bilateral Agreement ($2.4 million) and the Safe Restart Agreement ($2.6 million).

Because there are no confirmed or probable cases of COVID-19 in Nunavut, all schools will open, as scheduled, for the new school year, unless otherwise directed by Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO). To see when your school opens and the Department of Education’s 2020-21 Opening Plan for Nunavut Schools, visit: https://gov.nu.ca/education/information/2020-21-opening-plan-nunavut-schools Planning for 2020-21 School Year All schools will open, as scheduled, for the new school year, unless otherwise directed by CPHO. 4 stages have been developed to direct school operations depending on the impacts of COVID-19 in each community. The CPHO will determine when a community moves from stage to stage. For updates, check the Department of Education website and listen to GN press conferences. Educators/School Staff Educator recruitment is on track for the 2020-21 school year. 									There are currently 30 open educator positions across the territory.  Teachers and school staff are not defined as critical workers and are required to follow the same isolation process as other Nunavummiut returning to the territory. The department worked with the Department of Health to secure reservations in the hubs and return travel dates and ensure out of territory school staff could return for the start of the school year. Health and Safety Restrictions Health and safety restrictions are different in schools than everywhere else for several reasons: 									It is critical to balance the risk of direct infection and transmission of COVID-19 in children with the harms of school closure on their physical and mental health.  Current evidence suggests that children may be less susceptible to COVID-19 infection and may be less likely to transmit the virus to others. Schools are controlled environments, and any potential spread of the virus can be managed and tracked more easily.  The Department of Education, the CPHO, and DEAs/CSFN were involved in the development of the health and safety plans. Cleaning will be enhanced in all schools, and custodians will receive guidelines and training. Learning and Instruction The focus in the first several months of school will be on learning recovery, assessment, and instruction. School staff will receive guidelines and a toolkit for learning, instruction, and assessment, including information on remote instruction, and expectations for communicating with students. Physical distancing and masks Physical distancing requirements depend on the stage a community is in. Adjusting the percentage of students in school will help support limited contact between students, as needed. The department will work with schools and DEAs in Stages 2 and 3 regarding physical distancing requirements, including organizing students by cohort. In general, the use of masks is not recommended for children. 									At the discretion of the CPHO, there may be some instances where students should wear masks. Some school staff may wear masks, if they are unable to physically distance when required by the CPHO.  School assemblies will be avoided so as not to mix classroom cohorts.   Department of Education Services, July 20, 2020 The Department of Education will be releasing the 2020-21 Opening Plan for Nunavut Schools at the end of July.  Keeping our staff and students safe is the Department of Education’s highest priority. By working closely with the Chief Public Health Officer, and providing clear guidelines around health and safety, the Department of Education can ensure that our students are learning in a safe, supportive environment.   Department of Education Services, July 13, 2020  Since March 17, when schools were closed to students, the Department of Education has been working diligently in preparation for the upcoming 2020-21 school year, specifically addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Department of Education will be connecting with all licensed child-care facilities in the coming days.     Department of Education Services, May 8, 2020  Child Care Facilities From March 17 to April 21, 2020, the Government of Nunavut provided licenced child care facilities $885,000 to cover parental fees. This funding enabled facilities to continue paying staff while transitioning to financial assistance programs offered by the Government of Canada, such as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the Canadian Wage Subsidy Program. The Canadian Wage Subsidy Program covers 75% of staff’s wages and has now been extended beyond June. The Department of Education provides licenced child care facilities with 				$4.2 million annually in operation and maintenance funding. This funding will continue while facilities are closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Department of Education continues to provide licencing for child care facilities, training for staff, and create and distribute educational resources. The Government of Nunavut continues to work with the Government of Canada, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., the regional Inuit organizations, and other stakeholders to support child care facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Department of Education Services, April 30, 2020  Schools in Pond Inlet are closed to the community, including school staff, until further notice. The physical distribution of student learning packages in Pond Inlet has been suspended until further notice. All Department of Education staff, including school staff, are to work from home if possible. These measures are to ensure the health and safety of Pond Inlet students, families, and staff. The Department of Education will provide support to other Government of Nunavut departments as needed. Department of Education Services, April 29, 2020 Student Learning Packages Many students have already received an initial learning package from their teachers. 		Most packages include learn-at-home work and activities for one or two weeks at a time. Learning packages are focused on strengthening skills in literacy, numeracy, and health and wellbeing. There is a mix of paper and electronic-based work, depending on the student and their circumstance.  Students and families should expect to receive learning packages for the rest of the school year. Learning packages are designed to reinforce the skills students have already learned and will not be expected to be assessed by teachers toward final grades. The department has provided continuity of learning guidelines for all school staff, which outline a number of ways that school staff can communicate with students and families. The department would like to thank all school staff for supporting their students and their families during these unprecedented times. Early Learning and Child Care Support Following direction from the Chief Public Health Officer, all child care facilities must remain closed to children until further notice. During this closure, the Department of Education has and will continue to pay all regular O&M funding to licensed child care facilities. 		This should account for a significant portion of the monthly operating costs of a facility. Because the day care closures were sudden and unexpected, the department paid parental fees temporarily to ensure facilities could continue to pay their staff, and to allow time for facilities to apply for federal subsidies, such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy. The total cost of this funding provided was $885,000.  Department of Education staff are ready to support child-care facilities in their applications to these federal programs, and we have been communicating with all facilities around this. The department continues to explore further options to support child care facilities, including possible use of federal funds.   Department of Education Services, April 17, 2020 Minister of Education update: Ullukkut, The well-being and success of Nunavut’s children and youth is the top priority of the Department of Education. In these uncertain times, we want to make sure students have the opportunity to thrive, and to pursue any future path they desire. With students’ well-being in mind, I am announcing that as of today, all schools in Nunavut will be closed to students for the rest of the 2019-20 school year. This closure is supported by the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO). Because students have already missed over a month of class time, it is even more important that all school staff report to work on April 21, 2020. As in other provinces and territories, Nunavut’s school staff are vital to ensuring our students do not fall behind in their education. The Department of Education has developed guidelines to help school staff prepare learning packages to meet the specific needs of their students. Staff will work with students and their families to determine how best to support learning. This means that for our students in Kindergarten to Grade 9, teachers will prioritize literacy and numeracy, while strengthening the skills and knowledge that have been taught so far this school year. For high school students, teachers and administrators will evaluate their individual situations. Some students may already have completed the credits they need to graduate. Others may need to complete specific courses to be eligible to graduate. Teachers may provide opportunities for students to upgrade their marks or earn the credits they need by completing suggested assignments and projects. Teachers will review their students’ outcomes to date, align them with skills that need to be strengthened, and take into consideration what is possible for them to accomplish at home. There will be a strong focus on supporting health and wellness, literacy, and numeracy for all students. This includes household projects and activities that allow families to learn together, such as reading together, journal writing, and projects that draw on the creativity of students. The Department is also aware that many families are currently on the land and may not be able to receive student learning packages. On-the-land activities like hunting and fishing complement student learning, and the department encourages these activities. Realizing Nunavut’s technology limitations, especially in some of our smaller communities, students’ continued learning will not be entirely online. This means that students’ learning packages will take many forms -- some will be paper-based, some will be activity-based, and some will be electronic. However, all of them will give students an opportunity to further their learning. Wherever possible, teachers will be asked to check in with families weekly, to see how they are progressing and if they need any extra support or resources. The best way to communicate -- either by phone, text, GN email, or through other online portals -- will be determined with students and families. Beyond creating student learning packages, staff also will be supporting students by assessing their work prior to the school closure to determine final grades, and preparing year-end report cards. To Nunavut’s high school students and their families, a reminder that all departmental exams are cancelled for the school year. For those Grade 12 students on track to graduate, I want to assure you that principals and teachers will work with you to ensure you complete any necessary requirements. We are here to help you succeed and realize your goals. Finally, school staff will also plan and prepare for the 2020-21 school year, particularly with the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic in mind. For school staff who have voluntarily returned to work and have already been preparing learning packages, many students and families recognize your hard work and expressed their appreciation. As a parent, and as Minister of Education, I want to express my sincere gratitude to you for your dedication and enthusiasm. Thank you for your efforts and commitment to Nunavut’s students. We all want the best for our children and youth. The Department of Education appreciates the support and patience Nunavummiut and our education partners have shown during these unprecedented times. The uncertainty has not been easy, but we will make it through, together. Stay safe everyone. Qujannamiik, quana, thank you, merci. Department of Education Services Students in Nunavut will not have class for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year. School staff will continue to work to support learning at home until the end of the school year. Students will be receiving learning packages from their schools to support learning at home. School staff will connect with families over the coming weeks. All high school diploma exams for this year are cancelled, and high school marks will be based on course work only. All students will receive a year-end report card. Department of Education Services, April 15, 2020 To ensure staff at licenced child care facilities continue to be paid, the Department of Education will fund parental fees for all licensed child care facilities up to April 21, 2020. The Government of Nunavut has taken strict measures to minimize the spread of COVID-19, this is why child care facilities must remain closed until further notice. Department of Education Services, April 8, 2020 Minister of Education update Yesterday, the Department of Education sent a letter to all school staff about returning to work in their home communities on April 21, 2020. This is specific to STAFF ONLY, so that they can prepare and develop continuity of learning plans in the case the school closure is extended. I want to clarify the numbers I provided yesterday – there are 1,185 staff who work in schools across the territory. Ninety-three (93) of these staff are currently out of the territory, making their way back to their home communities. This represents eight per cent (8%) of all school staff. Teachers across the country are working hard to support learning at home for students so that they are not disadvantaged by the school closure. Our students deserve the same supports, and this is why we are asking teachers to work during this time. Teachers returning to work will focus on supporting students in their education and their wellbeing by developing learning packages. This is particularly important for those students that do not have access to online resources and those who are on specialized learning plans. School staff who may have travelled out of territory must undergo a mandatory 14-day isolation period in a GN-designated isolation hub in the south before returning to Nunavut. This is the same process that all Nunavut residents, FANS students, and medical travel patients returning to Nunavut have been following. This process was established under the orders of the Chief Public Health Officer. Nunavut residents, including school staff, are responsible for their travel costs to return home to Nunavut. The GN is covering the cost of the isolation hubs for all Nunavut residents, including school staff. All GN staff, including teachers, are expected to work from within the territory. We will address any requests from staff who currently are out-of-territory to work remotely on a case-by-case basis. The Department of Education has been in continuous contact with the Nunavut Teachers’ Association (NTA) and the Coalition of Nunavut DEAs. They both support the decision to bring teachers back to work to ensure that students can continue to learn and are supported during school closures. Schools will only be reopened to students once the Chief Public Health Officer determines it is safe to do so. However, we need our staff back at work by April 21 to prepare for our students’ success and progress, whatever the next step may be. Department of Education Services, April 7, 2020 As of April 7, teachers currently in-territory can go back to school on a voluntary basis, in order to start developing learning packages for students. Guidelines on the delivery of those packages to students are being finalised by the Department of Education. All school staff are expected to return to work in their home communities on April 21, 2020. Teachers that are currently out of territory must undergo a 14-day isolation period in a designated isolation hub before returning to Nunavut. If teachers cannot begin their 14-day isolation period in time for their return on April 21, they must contact their principal and provide information on travel plans and correspondence with the isolation hubs to support any expected delays. On April 21, a decision will be made according to the recommendation of the Chief Public Health Officer. If school closures persist: School staff will be required to resume operations and will be asked to develop continuity of learning plans for all students. Teachers will be provided with clear guidance on how assessments, final report cards, and grade progression will be achieved. If schools re-open: School operations will resume as normal. In both cases, departmental exams for high school students have been cancelled until the end of June. Department of Education Services, April 3, 2020 On Tuesday, April 7, school staff will be able to access schools on a voluntary basis should they wish to prepare learning packages for students. The department has a working group developing guidelines for teachers identifying grade-specific areas of focus for learning packages. Packages may look different for each student. School access is for operational purposes only and not for recreation or other non-education-related activities. The department has also provided all schools with health and safety protocols related to COVID-19, including respiratory etiquette, hand washing, and physical distancing. Department of Education Services, March 31, 2020 Minister of Education update: Since March 17, Nunavut schools have been closed to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. As a result, parents and caregivers have been asking for educational resources to help their children continue to learn. Today I am announcing that the Department of Education has developed a learn-at-home website, Angirrami Ilinniarniq (angirrami.com). This website offers free access to some of the same educational resources used in our schools. These include downloadable books and e-books for pre-school ages and up; educational audiobooks and animated videos; tips and activities for learning; and resources for managing stress and mental health. There will also be links to download the department’s Inuktut language learning apps: Uqausiit Pinnguarutiit has fun activities that support Inuit language shape and sound recognition, and vocabulary development. Titirariuqsauti introduces Inuit language symbol sounds and printing paths.  Qimirrunaut is the department’s new Inuktut e-book library app. These apps are available for Android and iOS devices and can be downloaded from the Google Play or Apple App stores. Angirrami Ilinniarniq provides links to other online educational resources on subjects such as science, math, history, and social studies.  I want to also note that although the website launches today, new resources will be regularly added. The priority is to get our Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun resources online as quickly as possible. English and French resources will follow soon after. All the resources found on this site were created by the Department of Education and its partners, including the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and the Representative for Children and Youth’s Office, as well as the Departments of Family Services, Health, Environment, and Economic Development and Transportation. I want to thank all the students, parents, and caregivers for their patience. I know for many of you it has not been easy with schools and child care facilities closed. However, we must all do our part to prevent the spread of COVID-19. I assure you that my department has been working hard to get this website ready as quickly as possible. I encourage Nunavummiut to explore all the resources this website has to offer. Make learning a part of your daily routine! Qujannamiik, quana, thank you, merci. Department of Education Services, March 31, 2020 Today, the Department of Education Is launching a learn-at-home website, Angirrami Ilinniarniq (angirrami.com). This learn-at-home website developed by the Department of Education provides free access to help children and youth continue learning in their language during the school closure. Upon recommendation from the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO), schools and daycare facility closures for students and children will be extended until end of day April 20. At that point and time, the CPHO will reassess and provide direction. Department of Education Services, March 25, 2020 Ongoing services: Bus service contracts will continue to be paid during the three-week school closure. Department of Education Services, March 24, 2020 The Department of Education is supporting the Department of Family Services in coordinating the return of out of territory FANS students and their families to Nunavut. The Department of Education is providing funds to licensed child care facilities to cover parental fees from March 17-April 7, 2020. All licensed child care facilities in Nunavut that charge parental fees will qualify for the grant. Funding will be processed and sent to licensed child care facilities by Friday, March 27, 2020. During this time, parents will not be required to pay parental fees.

Department of Education Services update, March 20, 2020 Adjusted services: To reinforce social distancing and reduce the potential transmission of COVID-19, the Department of Education is limiting in-office work to essential employees only. Closed /Cancelled/Suspended services: All schools and child care facilities in Nunavut are closed for a three-week period, starting Tuesday, March 17, 2020. 		  Department of Education Services update - March 19, 2020 Education and several GN departments are working closely together to reduce the impact school closures have on food programs. The Department of Education will be providing funds to all licensed child care facilities. This funding will be equal to the parental fees licenced child care facilities would be normally receiving during this three-week closure. This will allow licenced child care facilities to not charge parental fees for this period but still pay their staff as normal. Closed /Cancelled/Suspended services: All schools and child care facilities in Nunavut are closed for a three-week period, starting Tuesday, March 17, 2020.    "

Department of Community and Government Services - May 28, 2020 Minister of Community and Government Services update Ullaakkut, With the construction season upon us the Government of Nunavut (GN) has undertaken necessary preparations for construction projects to proceed during the summer and fall of 2020 in 19 Nunavut communities. This includes over 50 capital projects valued at approximately $600 million. Given the significant size of our construction program, we rely on a certain level of skilled workers from southern Canada to work on these projects alongside our Inuit and Northern labour. In consultation with Dr. Patterson, arrangements have been made to ensure that all southern workers comply with the strict requirement of the 14-day isolation period before travelling to Nunavut. The GN will control and monitor these measures at the isolation facilities in the south during the 14 days including up until workers board their flights. This follows the procedures for residents and medical travellers already in place. We need to balance the long-term infrastructure needs of communities with the current COVID-19 restrictions and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the municipalities, especially our mayors and councillors, for taking an active role in the decision to proceed with these projects during the 2020 construction season. I also would like to acknowledge the construction companies for their understanding of, and the need to respect, the directives set by Dr. Patterson to ensure that the construction projects move ahead with an understanding of maintaining the health and well-being of the workers and all Nunavummiut. Despite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are looking forward to a safe and productive construction season this summer. Thank you.   Department of Community and Government services - April 30, 2020  Critical services will be maintained in Pond Inlet, and plans are in place to ensure that access to services such as heat, power, water, sewer, and communications will not be interrupted. Community and Government Services (CGS), along with the municipality, has a plan in place for a water intake/pumping solution to ensure the community has ongoing access to water The temporary pumping system will include: A pump set up on the shore of the reservoir, Suction hose put through a drilled hole in the ice, A discharge hose to supply water into the back of the water truck, Manual chlorination into the back of the truck, and, The pump will be set up in a temporary porta-tank to provide containment for fuel refilling. 		  This solution can be managed by municipality staff. CGS is actively working on a permanent solution to be implemented later this summer. Department of Community and Government services - April 20, 2020  The Department of Community and Government services is providing an additional $2 million to municipalities to cover expenses related to COVID-19. This additional funding will ensure that hamlets are able to provide unforeseen services in response to the pandemic.  Eligible expenses include but are not limited to the purchase of cleaning materials, hiring additional staff, expenses for additional road clearing, by-law and enforcement patrols, and to cover lost revenues resulting from facility closures. Municipalities can contact their CGS regional community development office for more information.

We are still awaiting confirmatory results from the individuals tested at Hope Bay Mine. The total number of persons followed to date is 2981. There are 465 persons currently being followed. Before Dr. Patterson speaks about the situation at Hope Bay Mine, I want to take a few minutes to speak directly to Nunavummiut about our responsibilities; each and every single one of us. As we see cases rising quickly in parts of Southern Canada, it is clear we are into the second wave of this virus. COVID-19 is nowhere close to being over. It will be part of our lives for the foreseeable future and we don’t know when there will be a vaccine or effective treatment. So, we all need to make sacrifices to keep each other safe. We need to change individual actions and behaviours and show our care for neighbours and community. Please remember your actions impact everyone’s health. That’s why it’s so important to follow public health measures – handwashing often, maintaining physical distancing, frequent cleaning of high-touch surfaces, following the gathering size limits, isolating and wearing masks when you need to. Chief Public Health Officer update Good morning. On September 28, the Department of Health activated its Rapid Response Team to contain an outbreak of COVID-19 at TMAC Resources’ Hope Bay mine. TMAC Resources contacted my office on September 26 about an employee developing symptoms consistent with COVID-19. The individual and identified contacts were swabbed and the samples sent to Rankin Inlet for testing. Seven of the samples yielded positive results, and all were sent to a southern lab for confirmatory testing. Two of those tests have since been confirmed. As the test results indicated transmission of COVID-19 at the mine site, we initiated our rapid response plan to assist in containing the virus. All non-critical travel to and from the mine was also halted. The Rapid Response Team has been conducting additional contact tracing and taking samples. As of last night, five more swabs were flown to Rankin Inlet for testing on the GeneXpert or BioFire devices, one has tested positive and will be sent for confirmatory testing. The results of one test are still pending. Another eight swabs will be delivered to Rankin Inlet tomorrow. To accurately detect the virus, high risk contacts from the initial batch of tests have been re swabbed to ensure testing is being done at appropriate times during the incubation period. All those who tested positive and high-risk, non-critical staff contacts have been isolated. Critical staff contacts who are required to continue working for the safety of the other workers, are doing so until they can be replaced. Those staff are following strict measures to keep isolated from those around them, including wearing masks. Workers who develop symptoms will be required to isolate immediately. As of Yesterday, the two individuals who were symptomatic have had their symptoms resolve. The Rapid Response Team is currently continuing contact tracing and containment operations and are expected to be on site until the middle of next week. While the transmission of COVID-19 at the mine is concerning, the risk to Nunavummiut from this outbreak remains low. Hope Bay does not currently have Nunavummiut working on site and there is no contact from the mine to any Nunavut communities. Once the Rapid Response Team concludes its work, my office will review the incident and information gathered by the Rapid Response Team. From there, we will determine if there are enhanced measures needed to reduce the risk of another outbreak. Thank you.

Department of Community and Government Services - May 28, 2020 Minister of Community and Government Services update Ullaakkut, With the construction season upon us the Government of Nunavut (GN) has undertaken necessary preparations for construction projects to proceed during the summer and fall of 2020 in 19 Nunavut communities. This includes over 50 capital projects valued at approximately $600 million. Given the significant size of our construction program, we rely on a certain level of skilled workers from southern Canada to work on these projects alongside our Inuit and Northern labour. In consultation with Dr. Patterson, arrangements have been made to ensure that all southern workers comply with the strict requirement of the 14-day isolation period before travelling to Nunavut. The GN will control and monitor these measures at the isolation facilities in the south during the 14 days including up until workers board their flights. This follows the procedures for residents and medical travellers already in place. We need to balance the long-term infrastructure needs of communities with the current COVID-19 restrictions and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the municipalities, especially our mayors and councillors, for taking an active role in the decision to proceed with these projects during the 2020 construction season. I also would like to acknowledge the construction companies for their understanding of, and the need to respect, the directives set by Dr. Patterson to ensure that the construction projects move ahead with an understanding of maintaining the health and well-being of the workers and all Nunavummiut. Despite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are looking forward to a safe and productive construction season this summer. Thank you.   Department of Community and Government services - April 30, 2020  Critical services will be maintained in Pond Inlet, and plans are in place to ensure that access to services such as heat, power, water, sewer, and communications will not be interrupted. Community and Government Services (CGS), along with the municipality, has a plan in place for a water intake/pumping solution to ensure the community has ongoing access to water The temporary pumping system will include: A pump set up on the shore of the reservoir, Suction hose put through a drilled hole in the ice, A discharge hose to supply water into the back of the water truck, Manual chlorination into the back of the truck, and, The pump will be set up in a temporary porta-tank to provide containment for fuel refilling. 		  This solution can be managed by municipality staff. CGS is actively working on a permanent solution to be implemented later this summer. Department of Community and Government services - April 20, 2020  The Department of Community and Government services is providing an additional $2 million to municipalities to cover expenses related to COVID-19. This additional funding will ensure that hamlets are able to provide unforeseen services in response to the pandemic.  Eligible expenses include but are not limited to the purchase of cleaning materials, hiring additional staff, expenses for additional road clearing, by-law and enforcement patrols, and to cover lost revenues resulting from facility closures. Municipalities can contact their CGS regional community development office for more information.

8,2020-10-02,Canada,Nunavut,,https://gov.nu.ca/health/news/covid-19-department-health-services-update,Government Website,COVID-19 Department of Health Services update,"   02 October 2020        Chief Public Health Officer update Good morning. On September 28, the Department of Health activated its Rapid Response Team to contain an outbreak of COVID-19 at TMAC Resources’ Hope Bay mine. TMAC Resources contacted my office on September 26 about an employee developing symptoms consistent with COVID-19. The individual and identified contacts were swabbed and the samples sent to Rankin Inlet for testing. Seven of the samples yielded positive results, and all were sent to a southern lab for confirmatory testing. Two of those tests have since been confirmed. As the test results indicated transmission of COVID-19 at the mine site, we initiated our rapid response plan to assist in containing the virus. All non-critical travel to and from the mine was also halted. The Rapid Response Team has been conducting additional contact tracing and taking samples. As of last night, five more swabs were flown to Rankin Inlet for testing on the GeneXpert or BioFire devices, one has tested positive and will be sent for confirmatory testing. The results of one test are still pending. Another eight swabs will be delivered to Rankin Inlet tomorrow. To accurately detect the virus, high risk contacts from the initial batch of tests have been re swabbed to ensure testing is being done at appropriate times during the incubation period. All those who tested positive and high-risk, non-critical staff contacts have been isolated. Critical staff contacts who are required to continue working for the safety of the other workers, are doing so until they can be replaced. Those staff are following strict measures to keep isolated from those around them, including wearing masks. Workers who develop symptoms will be required to isolate immediately. As of Yesterday, the two individuals who were symptomatic have had their symptoms resolve. The Rapid Response Team is currently continuing contact tracing and containment operations and are expected to be on site until the middle of next week. While the transmission of COVID-19 at the mine is concerning, the risk to Nunavummiut from this outbreak remains low. Hope Bay does not currently have Nunavummiut working on site and there is no contact from the mine to any Nunavut communities. Once the Rapid Response Team concludes its work, my office will review the incident and information gathered by the Rapid Response Team. From there, we will determine if there are enhanced measures needed to reduce the risk of another outbreak. Thank you.

With the two-week period concluded, there is no longer a concern that those individuals contracted the virus. These past weeks we have continued to improve our capacity for in-territory testing. The Biofire device in Iqaluit is now operating alongside the GeneXpert machine. Aside from the need to have increased testing capacity in-territory, we also need to improve the turn around time for test results. This week, the Department of Health is starting a pilot project using charter aircraft to transport COVID-19 samples from Baffin communities to Iqaluit. The goal is to have a system in place that will reduce the test results turn around time to five days or less. Once the system is in place and working, we will begin the same process in Rankin Inlet. Increased in-territory testing capacity combined with shorter turnaround times for tests results, will give us more flexibility with our public health measures and improve our response in case of an outbreak. However, testing is not enough. As most people know, the Public Health strategy for minimizing the risks of COVID-19 entering and spreading in the territory relies on several measures. Testing is just one component. Physical distancing, good hygiene like washing our hands, staying home when sick and in the isolation hubs, work in tandem with testing and should not be underestimated. We should also keep in mind that our public health measures are effective only because Nunavummiut, individually and collectively, follow them. We have been effective so far in reducing the risks because each and everyone of us made the conscious choice to adopt and include these measures in our daily lives. Every time we choose to ignore these measures, the risk increases. While the risk can never be zero, we know that these measures are working. Nunavut remains COVID-free. We have seen decreases in respiratory illnesses this year across the territory. It is therefore vital that, individually and collectively, we continue to make the choice to follow public health measures and remain active participants in protecting our families and communities. Thank you   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  Public Health Emergency The Public Health Emergency was extended on Sept. 3 to and is in effect until Sept. 17.

The Government of Nunavut is managing several hubs, and dealing with a large number of requests from both medical and non-essential travellers. In an attempt to help clear up some of the delays to get into the hubs, Iqaluit is being looked at as one of several options to help relieve the wait time for medical travellers in Winnipeg. This has not been finalized and we are actively looking at the possibility of creating a second hub in Winnipeg, specifically for medical travellers. Our commitment is to ensure our medical travellers are well cared for and we are prioritizing their stays above non-essential travellers. We understand the concerns raised on social media over the weekend. However, nothing has been confirmed about an Iqaluit or additional Winnipeg hub. We recognize the fear and uncertainty that comes with COVID-19. However, we need to balance that fear with facts, the best possible care for Nunavummiut and our commitment to public health and safety. When there is an official course of action on this, we will announce it with all the relevant information. As we work to relieve this backlog, we thank those waiting for a spot in the isolation hubs for their patience and understanding. We are working around the clock to keep our territory and Nunavummiut safe. Thanks to all the staff who have worked so hard to keep everyone well during COVID-19.

On July 20, all licensed establishments in the territory will be allowed to open with regular hours. Nunavut will also be extending its common travel area to include Churchill, Manitoba. This bubble is exclusive to the community of Churchill and does not extend to other regions of Manitoba. The common travel area applies to air, land and water travel and exempts travellers from isolation requirements in either Nunavut or Churchill under certain conditions: Travel must originate from Nunavut to Churchill or from Churchill to Nunavut. Travellers must have not been outside either Churchill or Nunavut for 2 weeks prior to travelling. Travellers must remain in either Nunavut or Churchill for the duration of their stay. Prior to travelling outside of Nunavut, travellers must contact the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer for Nunavut and provide: Contact information, such as an address and phone number, at the person’s regular place of residence; and A written declaration that can be obtained by emailing CPHOtravelrequests@gov.nu.ca or by going to the Department of Health’s website. When travelling by air, travellers are required to obtain a letter from the CPHO authorizing travel or they will not be permitted to board their flight. Those who leave the common travel area outside of Churchill will need to isolate for 14 days at a government isolation facility, prior to returning to Nunavut.

We are still waiting on confirmatory results for the presumptive case detected in the Mary River Mine, with the expectation that they will be ready sometime this week. The Department of Health continues to monitor the situation at the Mary River Mine site closely, and we will provide support as needed. I want to take this opportunity and remind Nunavummiut that: Testing is only one component of the Public Health response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Testing is important, but it is not a replacement for social distancing or hand-washing. Testing is important, but it is absolutely not a replacement for 14 days of isolation. The Government of Nunavut follows testing guidelines and best practices that have been endorsed by the World Health Organization and Health Canada. We rely on diagnostic devices that have undergone rigorous validation and accreditation processes to provide dependable testing to Nunavummiut. Even under ideal conditions, and with validated equipment, testing is not always a reliable method of identifying cases of COVID-19 and halting transmission. There is strong evidence that false negatives can occur throughout the incubation period. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the overarching goal of our public health response is to identify, contain and break transmission. The Government of Nunavut will continue to look at emerging evidence and best practices set out by public health authorities, both nationally and globally, to shape our response to COVID-19, and will alter public health measures as and when appropriate. Thank you. 			   			As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Today marks the third bi-weekly announcement for Nunavut’s Path for moving forward during COVID-19. There are still no cases of COVID-19 detected in the territory, so once again we are in a position to alter public health measures. I’m pleased to announce the following changes under the new Order Respecting Social Distancing and Gatherings, which goes into effect today: The limit for outdoor gatherings has now been increased to 50 people. The limit for indoor gatherings has been increased to 10 people. In private dwellings, this means 10 people in addition to those who reside there. The limit for gatherings at places of worship, conference facilities, community halls, rental meeting spaces, and gatherings organized by the Government of Canada, Government of Nunavut, municipal corporation, or Regional Inuit Organizations has been set at 50 people or 50% of capacity for the facility, whichever is less. In all facilities and gatherings, it is still expected that social distancing is maintained. As we take another step forward on Nunavut’s Path, and we return to some of the activities, programs, or venues that we’ve missed, we need to remain diligent in our collective commitment to practice social distancing and good hand hygiene. If you make the choice to participate in a large gathering, or attend an indoor event, or even meet up with friends for dinner, please also choose to be responsible, and choose to take actions that will keep yourself, your community, and your territory, safe. Wash your hands. Keep six feet away from others. Avoid touching your face. Sanitize high-touch areas often. Consider wearing a mask when social distancing is difficult. If you don’t feel well, stay home. Thank you. 			   			As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  Calling Ahead at Health Centres Unless you are experiencing a medical emergency, please call your health centre first before going in.

As of today, Nunavut is resuming regular medical travel to Churchill, Manitoba. As Churchill has not had a confirmed case of COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic, we have determined that the risk of resuming medical travel operations is minimal, and it is greatly outweighed by the benefits of ensuring that Nunavummiut have access to the out-of-territory care they need. Medical travellers and their escorts who travel to Churchill for treatment and do not leave the community for the duration of their stay, will be able to return directly to Nunavut without needing to isolate at a GN designated isolation facility. If the situation changes, we will re-assess and be ready to initiate contact tracing and containment measures immediately. We have also had some inquiries from cab companies regarding their operations. Under the new Order Regarding Social Distancing and Gatherings, cab companies can collect fares from multiple households at once, under specific conditions. Whenever there are multiple passengers in the cab, everyone must wear a mask. Cab drivers must provide masks for riders who do not have them. Most importantly, cab drivers must obtain consent from all passengers before picking up multiple fares. This means that any passenger who is picked up, and all subsequent fares on that ride, must indicate that they are okay with riding in a shared cab with others. All passengers can still request that they do not share their ride with others, and, for now, cab companies must comply with this request. We want to thank all cab companies who have so readily complied with recommendations to limit passenger travel and enhance sanitation procedures in order to keep Nunavummiut safe and healthy. Finally, as restaurants, bars, and other indoor locations are permitted to open, I want to continue to emphasize to Nunavummiut the necessity of social distancing, good hand hygiene, and staying home when we are sick. We need to remember, even as we return to the activities we enjoy, that this pandemic is far from over, and small actions from everyone today add up to major impacts tomorrow.

I am pleased to say that after consultation with my counterpart in the GNWT, as of today, residents of the NWT can travel to Nunavut without isolating prior to arrival. The establishment of the common travel area by air or by land between the two territories does however come with strict conditions and expectations: Travel must originate from Nunavut to the NWT or from the NWT to Nunavut. Travellers have not been outside their respective territory for two weeks prior to their travel to the NWT or Nunavut. Travellers remain in either territory for the duration of their stay. Travellers from the NWT who wish to enter Nunavut, must write to: cphotravelrequests@gov.nu.ca and complete and sign the Nunavut and NWT Traveller’s Declaration form. Failure to do so will affect entry in Nunavut. Failure to answer truthfully will be subject to fines. This also applies for Nunavummiut who wish to return home after their stay in the NWT. My office will issue a letter of approval. Travellers will be required to present the approval letter prior to boarding any airplane entering Nunavut. Isolation before entering Nunavut is still required if You are a Nunavut resident who is returning home from travel in southern Canada via Yellowknife. In this case, you will need to complete a 14-day isolation period in the GN isolation hub in Yellowknife. You are an NWT resident who has travelled outside your territory less than two weeks before your scheduled arrival in Nunavut. In this case, you will need to complete the NWT isolation requirements before applying for travel to Nunavut. I want to re-assure Nunavummiut that should the current situation change in either territory, we will re-assess the common travel area and take all necessary measures to protect the health and safety of Nunavummiut. Further Information can be found in Travel and Isolation section of the Department of Health website at https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/travel-and-isolation. Today also marks the second of our bi-weekly announcements regarding the status of current health measures. Beginning June 22: Personal service providers will also be permitted to open for one-on-one sessions. This includes hairdressers and nail salons. Again, these facilities will be responsible for ensuring that PPE is available for both clients and service providers when requested. Bars and restaurants will be allowed to re-open and operate at half capacity. Last call for alcohol service will be at 9 p.m.. Facility operators need to ensure that patrons are respecting social distancing. Liquor Inspectors have the authority to enforce orders regarding social distancing, and they will be monitoring to ensure adherence to these conditions. Theatres and churches are also permitted to re-open on June 22. On June 29: Youth centres and day camps will be able to resume operations. Long-term care facilities will begin accepting visitors in a limited capacity; they can only allow one to two visitors per resident at a time, and these visitors can only be immediate family. Guidelines for re-opening will be available on the health website in the coming days. Though we can reasonably forecast what the next two weeks may bring, we must remain aware of the possible need to change or re-introduce public health measures. While we are in a position to ease restrictions, we remain vulnerable to the impacts of this global pandemic. Every week, new information becomes available. Every week, the situation can change. What doesn’t change is that social distancing, washing your hands and staying home when you are sick are the three main actions each and everyone of us can take to keep our families and our communities safe.

Right now, travel into Nunavut represents the single biggest risk for introducing COVID-19. The travel ban, and the 14-day isolation requirements for returning Nunavummiut, are meant to mitigate this risk and keep our territory safe. Knowing that, I’d like to take this opportunity to share information on the new process being implemented for reserving stays in GN southern isolation facilities. Moving forward, all Nunavummiut who must travel outside of the territory should contact the email address NUisolationreservations@nunavutcare.ca and submit an Isolation Reservation Request Form as soon as they know their plans for travel. From there, the travel team will work to identify room availability and reserve your stay in one of the designated isolation facilities. This new streamlined process is meant to help Nunavummiut plan for their 14-day quarantine period farther in advance and ensures that our travel team can anticipate and accommodate travellers in the coming months. More information, including intake days requirements, can also be found on the Department of Health’s website. Remember, non-essential travel outside of the territory is still not recommended. All individuals who are applying for critical worker exemption will continue to use the email address CPHOTravelRequests@gov.nu.ca. Finally, the Department of Health has made temporary amendments to the Medical Travel Policy to help keep our medical travellers and escorts safe from COVID-19. Specific provisions have been added to ensure that medical travellers and escorts abide by rules of social distancing, hand-washing hygiene, and other behaviours that help to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The amendments also more clearly outline the requirements for both medical travellers and escorts to complete 14 days of self-isolation at a designated isolation facility prior to returning to Nunavut. As we continue to look at ways of easing public health measures and returning the activities we enjoy, we must remain diligent and aware that the threat of COVID-19 has not yet passed. Please continue to maintain physical distancing and handwashing practices, and limit any non-essential travel out of the territory.

This annual event highlights the health risks associated with tobacco use, and advocates for effective policies to reduce tobacco consumption. Right now, we are all working hard to commit to our public health measures that protect us from the threat of COVID-19. We are social distancing, staying home as much as possible, and washing our hands as much as we can. These actions are keeping ourselves, our communities, and our territory safe. Quitting tobacco use is one more step we can take to guard ourselves against the impact of this pandemic. We know that COVID-19 is mainly a respiratory virus, and early evidence suggests that smoking can make symptoms worse. Smokers are also likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19, as smoking increases the likelihood of transmission from one’s face and lips. Please remember: do not share cigarettes, joints, or pipes. Do not pick up discarded cigarette or cannabis butts. Wash your hands often, and refrain from touching your face. The best thing that we can do for our health is to quit smoking. By making the decision to quit smoking, we can help to protect ourselves from COVID-19 today, and dramatically improve our health for the coming weeks, months, and years. Support is available for anyone who wants to explore options to help them quit. Message a counsellor on the Tobacco Has No Place Here Facebook page or call 1-866-368-7848 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The service is private and free. Counsellors can help you in Inuktitut, English, Inuinnaqtun and French. Nicotine replacement therapy, or NRT, is also available at no cost through the Non-Insured Health Benefits program at your local health centre or pharmacy. Call ahead, and ask your health care provider for information and options for NRT. Thank you. Chief Public Health Officer update Good morning. Today marks the start of Nunavut’s Path forward. Day cares, territorial parks, and playgrounds are permitted to re-open, and the size limit for outdoor gatherings has been increased to 25. Today will also be the first of our bi-weekly assessments concerning the modification of public health measures. As we look at altering public health measures, I want to take a moment and emphasize to all Nunavummiut the continued importance of social distancing. While we are in a position today to alter measures, we are not in a position to take social distancing for granted. We’ve noticed through the contact tracing of persons under investigation that people’s contact bubbles are becoming noticeably larger. Larger contact bubbles will make it significantly more challenging to identify and prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. COVID-19 continues to pose a risk to Nunavummiut, and we are not immune to this pandemic. We’ve made it this far thanks to our collective efforts, but those efforts absolutely have to continue. With that said, I’m pleased to announce the following modifications to public health measures that will be occurring over the next two weeks. Effective immediately, in-territory travel advisories are lifted. Travel outside of Nunavut is still not recommended. Individuals who are travelling outside of the territory need to be aware not only of the isolation procedures to return, but also of the measures that other jurisdictions may have in place to limit or discourage travel. On June 8, workplaces and retail outlets are permitted to re-open, provided that they have safety measures in place. Galleries, museums, and libraries may also be opened for individual viewing and browsing, though group sessions are still prohibited. There will also be an increased availability of in-person health assessments at health centres across the territory. On June 15, dental clinics, physiotherapy clinics, massage therapy, and chiropractic treatments are permitted to resume. Gyms and pools will also be permitted to re-open for solo workouts and lap swimming only. Please note, that all these measures are subject to alteration should conditions change.

Department of Health Services, May 28, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update Good morning. I’d like to take this opportunity to clarify the conditions required in order for us to consider altering the current border measures in place. I have previously indicated that the border restrictions currently in place will likely be among the final public health measures that are lifted. This is because right now travel into Nunavut from outside of the territory represents the highest risk. If we want to continue Nunavut’s Path, and remove additional public health measures inside the territory, then we need to maintain our strict travel measures. This is our best chance to both return to the activities we enjoy and the programs we depend on, while still protecting the health and safety of Nunavummiut. With that said, fulfillment of any of the following conditions may influence decisions to alter our border measures. Development of a vaccine for COVID-19. We’ve already discussed this, and though it is unlikely that a vaccine will be developed and readily available in the near future, it is still a factor that would greatly influence all of our public health measures; Development or discovery of an effective treatment for COVID-19; Indication that COVID-19 is under control in our neighboring jurisdictions. This means that beyond just decreasing case numbers, we would need to see evidence that community transmission in neighboring jurisdictions is minimal and contained; And finally, achievement of sustainable and on-going diagnostic capacity in every community in Nunavut. Unfortunately, many of these factors are outside of our control, but we will continue to monitor the evolving global situation. As always, our decisions surrounding the border measures will be guided by evidence and will be designed to protect and preserve the health and safety of Nunavummiut throughout this global pandemic. I would like to remind Nunavummiut that as of Monday, June 1, playgrounds, territorial parks, and daycares are permitted to open, and the size of outdoor gatherings may increase to 25. On June 1, we will also begin our bi-weekly announcements on the assessment and potential easing of additional public health measures. The reason we have chosen two weeks as our interval of choice is straightforward. All evidence suggests that 14 days is the maximum incubation time for COVID-19. So, this 14-day window will give us an opportunity to assess the situation around us and make informed decisions based on the latest information available. Please remember that if a threat is detected, we may need to react immediately. We will provide as much warning as possible, but we may need to introduce additional public health measures right away. Finally, the Department is issuing a Public Health Advisory to the community of Sanikiluaq due to the detection of pertussis, also known as whooping cough. Whooping cough is a disease of the throat or lungs that is spread easily from person to person. Anyone can get whooping cough, but the most severe cases are in young children. For that reason, the daycare in Sanikiluaq must remain closed for the time being. Thank you.  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

These past two months have not been easy, and all Nunavummiut have had to make sacrifices. However, thanks to our combined efforts, we are protecting our families, our communities, and our territory from this pandemic, and I hope that all Nunavummiut can feel a sense of pride knowing that their actions are making a deep and measurable impact on keeping Nunavut healthy and safe. It is time for us to move forward. This does not mean that this pandemic is over. This does not mean that the threat has passed. This means that we can cautiously begin our return to the activities we enjoy, knowing that at any time we may need to change our behaviour to protect ourselves from emerging threats. In the coming weeks, we will work with our stakeholders to re-introduce our businesses, our activities, and our programs in a way that is safe, sustainable, and poses the least risk to the health and safety of Nunavummiut. Know that as we begin to loosen restrictions internally, it is imperative that our strict border measures remain to minimize the risk of introducing COVID-19 into the territory. With that being said, I’m pleased to announce that as of June 1: Daycares will be permitted to open up for regular business. The size limit for outdoor gatherings will increase to 25 people. Territorial parks will be allowed to reopen for outdoor activities only, if local circumstances permit. All park buildings will remain closed. Municipal playgrounds will be allowed to re-open, again, if local circumstances permit. These particular conditions have been selected because they are deemed low risk. Moving forward, our plan is to re-assess our condition every two weeks. If the state of COVID in Nunavut is favorable, we will continue to lift public health measures, beginning with lower risk activities and programs. If our condition is stable, we may remain at the status quo until we are confident that lifting additional restrictions would not pose an undue risk to Nunavummiut. Finally, if the threat of COVID-19 increases, or eased public health measures are posing a potential public health threat to the territory, we may need to introduce or re-introduce certain conditions. I share in everyone’s desire to return to normal. We all want to know when we can confidently and safely travel within our own territory, or to our neighbouring jurisdictions. However, trying to forecast specific dates and timelines for when we can lift all of our public health measures would be inaccurate, and frankly, it would be insincere. The COVID-19 pandemic is evolving rapidly, and every single week yields new information that shapes our strategy and our public health measures. Predictions and decisions made on the basis of today’s understanding of the virus may be obsolete in a short time. For this reason, we have opted for an approach that is flexible, cautious, and adaptive to the evolving situation around us. Again, I want to thank all Nunavummiut for their continued patience and understanding. No one is left unaffected by this pandemic, but our collective accountability has kept Nunavut safe so far. This accountability and responsibility needs to continue, and, as we loosen restrictions, we must continue to practice social distancing, stay away from others when we are sick and wash our hands often.

I am pleased to announce several items today. The first is that Rankin Inlet now has the ability to provide testing if a positive case is confirmed in-territory. I’d like to commend the medical and laboratory staff, especially Matt Stacey and Dr. Jasmine Pawa, who have been working tirelessly to become acquainted with the GeneXpert machine, and to ensure that it can be managed safely, efficiently, and accurately. Getting this machine up and running is a significant step forward for Nunavut, as this now fulfills our criteria of obtaining reliable and effective in-territory diagnostic capacity. When coupled with the fact that we still have no confirmed cases of COVID-19 inside the territory, we have now met two of our three conditions. While the situation in southern Canada will continue to play a role in our approach moving forward, we are now in a better position to consider reducing some restrictions in the territory. I have one other piece of news I would like to share. Moving forward, Kitikmeot medical travellers receiving treatment in Yellowknife are no longer required to undergo the 14-day isolation period, and instead will be permitted to return home immediately. This decision has been made through consultation with the Northwest Territories and is contingent on there being no active cases of COVID-19 in the NWT. Please note that this is for medical travellers only, and this is only when their treatment is provided in Yellowknife. Any medical traveller who needs to leave the Northwest Territories to receive treatment in other cities in Canada will still be required to complete their 14-day isolation period. For all medical travellers to whom this new rule applies who are currently in quarantine, we are working to get you home as soon as possible. As always, our main goal is the safety, health and well being of Nunavummiut. I would like to thank you all for your patience, understanding and support as we continue to care for our families and our communities.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, May 8, 2020 Minister of Health update: It was announced at the start of this year by the World Health Organization that all of 2020 was to be recognized as the Year of the Nurse and the Midwife. This was an opportunity to celebrate the vital role of nurses and midwives in the delivery of health care services across the world. Several months later, in the midst of this global pandemic, we are not just talking about their essential role in keeping us healthy, we are experiencing it firsthand. Nurses and midwives continue to deliver vital health care services in our territory, in our country, and throughout the world. May 11 to 17 is recognized as National Nursing Week. As our nurses work tirelessly to ensure that Nunavummiut have access to the care they need, I think it’s important that we all take this opportunity to show them our immense gratitude for their service and their contribution to this territory. Nunavut has more than 300 nurses who are essential to the development and delivery of programs that keep Nunavummiut healthy. In these uncertain times, as the world battles COVID-19, our nurses are on the front line, providing care to those who need it most. This pandemic has demonstrated our nurses’ willingness to put their own health and safety at risk to protect and care for those around them. This National Nursing Week, and indeed this entire Year of The Nurse and Midwife, give us an opportunity to shine a spotlight on these essential health staff. However, our gratitude for your service is not restricted to a single week, or a single year. I would like all Nunavummiut to join me in showing our ongoing appreciation for your continued dedication to this territory. Thank you.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, May 6, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update: Since it was confirmed that the detected COVID case in Nunavut was a false positive, the territory has witnessed great displays of solidarity, support, and pride. The additional restrictions in Pond Inlet have been lifted, and I hope that the community feels a measure of relief knowing that they are still COVID-free. This is good news. As a territory, we have done well so far. However, we cannot allow our celebration to lapse into complacency. It is more important than ever that we maintain these rules that we’ve all become familiar with. The threat of COVID-19 is still very real and we need to stay the course. Practise social distancing. Avoid contact with individuals who are not a member of your household. Limit trips for errands. Purchase only the supplies that your household needs. And, of course, wash your hands. There is no combination of measures that can absolutely guarantee the prevention of COVID-19. Even as we celebrate for Pond Inlet, all Nunavummiut need to remain vigilant and cautious. Follow the rules, and encourage your friends, family, and neighbours to do the same. I want to thank all Nunavummiut for their continued patience, understanding, and cooperation. We can only get through this together.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Travel outside the territory as of May 7, 2020: The Government of Nunavut’s decision to charge $2,100 per individual and $1,050 for each additional family member during the mandatory 14-day isolation stays for residents returning to the territory has been reversed. The Government of Nunavut will continue to cover these costs as long as mandatory isolation for residents returning to the territory is in place. Please keep in mind that travel outside of Nunavut during the COVID-19 pandemic is not advised.    Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

This means that although the first test result showed COVID-19 infection, further investigation and testing have not shown any other evidence of COVID-19 infection in Pond Inlet. As I have previously mentioned, no lab test is perfect. There is always a chance of false positive or false negative results. When interpreting results and deciding on an appropriate course of action, we consider many pieces of information, of which test results are just one piece. We always aim to err on the side of caution. Diagnostic tests are part of an entire system of measures to intervene on COVID-19 infection. In these circumstances the test gave an incorrect result, but the rest of the system (public health nurses, contact tracing, surveillance) have not identified any other cases of COVID-19 infection. The information available so far includes: The individual involved has not been outside of Pond Inlet for some time. We have not identified an exposure to COVID-19. We have not found any other cases of COVID-19 in Pond Inlet. We have not noticed any increase in significant respiratory infections. 		  For all of the reasons above we believe that the individual in Pond Inlet does not, and never did have COVID-19. As a result, our rapid response team will stop operating in Pond Inlet and the members of the team will begin preparing for future deployments. All territorial orders under the Public Health Emergency remain in effect. However, the additional measures specific to Pond Inlet as a result of the positive COVID-19 case are now lifted. Effective immediately, travel between Pond Inlet and other Nunavut communities may resume, and the community-specific restrictions on businesses and services in Pond Inlet are also rescinded.      Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

The Rapid Response Team is in the community, and they are implementing containment and contact tracing. As the team completes additional testing, there is the possibility that more positive cases may be confirmed in the community. This does not necessarily mean that there is community transmission and should not be cause for alarm. What this does mean is that the Rapid Response Team is doing their job, which is finding the virus and stopping it from spreading. Containment is key, and right now it is our top priority. As this process takes place, the Government of Nunavut will continue to support the community of Pond Inlet. I also want to take a moment and thank the municipality of Pond Inlet and its residents for allowing me to answer their questions earlier today on the community radio. Moving forward, I would like to remind all Nunavummiut, using the strongest possible terms, that every single social interaction carries a degree of risk. Despite all of the Government of Nunavut’s preventative measures, and the new containment measures now in place within Pond Inlet, it is impossible to reasonably predict where or when COVID-19 may be detected next. I urge all Nunavummiut to exercise a high degree of caution, and to seriously consider these risks before participating in a gathering of any kind. If you deem it necessary to participate in gatherings, then please keep track of the people with whom you interact, as this information may be necessary in case contact tracing needs to be conducted in your community. Health staff cannot get us through this alone. How well we do, and where we go from here, depends on the actions of every single Nunavummiut. Right now, the best way of slowing the spread of COVID-19 continues to be through social distancing and effective hygiene. If everyone follows these rules together, we can put ourselves in the best position to make it through this uncertain time. It’s more important than ever that we be careful, responsible, kind, and supportive. I’d like to thank Nunavummiut for their continued cooperation and understanding. As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Travel outside the territory as of May 7, 2020 Starting May 7, 2020, Nunavummiut who chose to travel outside Nunavut while the CPHO’s travel ban is still in effect will have to cover the costs of their 14-day isolation period in one of the Government of Nunavut’s isolation sites. The fee for a single individual in a room is $2,100 for the 14-day period, and each additional family member in the room will pay $1,050. Updates will be provided as they become available. 		   Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, April 30, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update As you have seen and heard, today we have announced that a case of COVID-19 has been detected within Pond Inlet. Since the onset of the pandemic, we knew that no combination of preventative measures can absolutely guarantee the prevention of COVID-19. We anticipated that sooner or later the virus would be detected in the territory. Just as we have poured extensive effort into our prevention plan, so too have we developed a comprehensive response plan to minimize, to the greatest possible extent, the impact that COVID-19 has on Nunavut. We have been in contact with hamlet authorities and have initiated our Rapid Response Plan. A Rapid Response Team has already been deployed to Pond Inlet and is scheduled to arrive early this afternoon. That team will immediately initiate containment measures, begin contact tracing, and monitor the health and well-being of persons on home isolation orders. The Pond Inlet Health Centre is well-staffed and prepared, and health centre operations will continue. All passenger travel in and out of Pond Inlet has ceased. This includes any movement in or out of the community by land travel. This travel ban is a necessary containment measure to minimize the risk of COVID-19 spreading to multiple communities at once. Until we have determined the potential spread of the virus within the community, all non-essential offices and services will be closed. There is to be no social gatherings within dwellings, and all residents of Pond Inlet are asked to continue to maintain social distancing and good hygiene. For residents of Pond Inlet, we recognize that this news may be frightening. However, the Government of Nunavut would like to assure everyone that although travel is restricted, you are not cut off from help and support. Critical services will be maintained, and plans are in place to ensure that access to services such as heat, power, water, sewer, and communications will not be interrupted. Our primary focus now is to detect and contain the virus to prevent further transmission within the community and to other communities. Anyone who has reason to believe that they have been exposed to the virus is advised to call the COVID-19 hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. or 6 p.m. or call your community health centre. Please, do not go to the health centre in person unless you are instructed to by a health official. To all Nunavummiut, know that the preventative measures that we have all been taking are more important now than ever. Everyone needs to practise social distancing, stay home whenever possible, and avoid contact with those who are not a member of your household. Together, our efforts can slow the spread of COVID-19. Finally, I remind everyone of the importance of kindness. Now is not the time for blame, or shame. It is the time for compassion, empathy, and support of your fellow Nunavummiut. The Government of Nunavut thanks all Nunavummiut for their efforts to date. We will continue to exhaust all efforts to contain the virus, and minimize its impact on Pond Inlet, and on all the territory. Only together can we all protect our territory from the threat of COVID-19.    Department of Health Services  Residents of Pond Inlet must call their health centre first. All regular appointments at the Pond Inlet Health Centre have been cancelled. Only emergency services are available.  COVID-19 Hotline and self-assessment tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or call their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days. Nunavummiut can also use the self-assessment tool available at www.gov.nu.ca COMMUNITY TRAVEL AND GATHERINGS RESTRICTION ORDER POND INLET All travel to and from Pond Inlet is banned except: People with a letter from the CPHO Medevac patients Flight crews Nunavut Inuit exercising their hunting rights as set out in Article 5 may leave and return to Pond Inlet but not travel to any other community People travelling on a flight which must land in Pond Inlet due to weather or emergency Medevac crews must restrict movements to the airport and the health centre and must wear personal protective equipment. All businesses operating in Pond Inlet must close except for: Grocery stores Fuel and motor vehicle stations Post office Restaurants open for take out service All social gatherings shall be restricted to five persons or fewer. No social gatherings in dwellings. The order can be consulted at:https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/covid-19-novel-coronavirus   Department of Health Services, April 29, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update As many of you may know, some jurisdictions in Canada have started or will soon begin a gradual lifting of the restrictions they have implemented to flatten the COVID curve. Today I’d like to speak in more detail about what needs to happen before we can do the same. There are three conditions that need to be met before we can consider relaxing existing restrictions in the territory. They are as follows: We need to achieve in-territory diagnostic capacity. This means that we need to be able to implement a rapid, accurate, and comprehensive COVID-19 testing program here in Nunavut; There needs to be significant indication that rates of COVID-19 are decreasing in the southern jurisdictions to which Nunavummiut most often travel; and There needs to remain no active cases of COVID-19 within Nunavut. The nature of these conditions means that it is difficult to assign a specific timeline to re-opening, but fulfillment of these conditions is necessary to minimize risk to public health and safety. We need to know that Nunavummiut travelling outside of the territory can do so safely, and we need to be able to respond rapidly to any confirmed cases of COVID-19 within Nunavut. I know that people are eager to go back to work, visit loved ones, and engage in social activities. However, if we lift these restrictions too early, we will increase the risk to Nunavummiut. If we aren’t careful about how we transition back from these restrictions, then we could effectively undo all the hard work and sacrifices that we’ve made over the past seven weeks. It is as important as ever that we stay the course: maintain social distancing, stay home whenever possible, and wash your hands often. These measures continue to be the best defence against COVID-19, and the best way to protect our families, our communities, and our territory.   Department of Health Services Access to health care services will remain available in all communities seven days a week. All non-urgent requests will be triaged daily. Immediate access to urgent and emergent health care services are and will continue to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. All clients are asked to call before presenting at a health facility. In Iqaluit, public health, the emergency room and inpatient unit will remain open. Well baby clinics, prenatal visits and immunizations are continuing across Nunavut. Physicians will continue community visits. If this is not possible, the visits will be conducted by telehealth or by phone.   Volumes  Total (All Isolation Locations)   Traveler Type   Guests in Isolation as of April 28   Medical Travel   206   Public   136   Total   342    Traveller repatriation summary:  Departure Date   # of Travellers from Isolation Sites   April 29   38   April 30   15   May 1   19   May 2   6   May 3   14    Critical Worker Requests As of April 28, there are 786 requests, 597 of which are critical worker requests.

The new order adds clarity around gatherings and social distancing and provides easy to understand scenarios that will help Nunavummiut more easily follow the order. It will also help businesses understand how to adjust their operations to ensure public safety and continued operation. Finally, the changes will also assist law enforcement and peace officers to more easily interpret the intent of the order in the unlikely event there is a need for enforcement. I’d like to outline some of the new definitions and information provided in the new order. Food service establishments and licensed premises remain closed. Restaurants can still provide options for take-out or delivery, as long as they abide by the rules of social distancing while doing so. All businesses deemed as Personal Service Providers must also remain closed. These include hair dressing, barbering, massage therapy, and other similar establishments. Additionally, dentists, veterinarians, and psychologists must remain closed, except for emergencies. Public playgrounds, municipal parks, and day-use areas of territorial parks also remain closed. Though still subject to closures and limitations, the following businesses are permitted to remain open: any business large enough to maintain a two-metre social distance within the workplace, or businesses that limit customers to no more than five at a time. The five-at-a-time rule does not apply to businesses that are large enough to maintain social distancing throughout the entire premise, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and similar facilities. The order provides a definition to gatherings. All organized public gatherings of more than five people remain prohibited. This includes concerts, community events, sporting events, and ceremonies such as marriages, funerals, or memorial services. Finally, all social gatherings, including social gatherings in private dwellings, shall be restricted to five persons or fewer. This includes play groups, club meetings, and meals with individuals who do not reside together. This new order does not mean that restrictions are being loosened, or that the Government of Nunavut has re-assessed the territory’s position or tolerance for risk. Instead, the definitions under this new order have been aligned with definitions being applied in other jurisdictions. This makes restrictive measures clearer and more consistent in their application and enforcement. It is strongly recommended that Nunavummiut limit contact with anyone who is not a member of their immediate household. Any social gathering carries a degree of risk, especially when we are looking at individuals from multiple different households mingling together. Nunavummiut must still exercise caution at all times, practise social distancing to the greatest extent possible, and wash hands and all shared surfaces thoroughly and often. The previous order met the intended purpose of providing necessary tools to help protect public health. However, The Government of Nunavut recognized the need to provide clearer language and definitions. For this reason, the Department of Justice worked with the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) to prepare a new Order to ensure the language is clear and understandable while remaining true to its intent.

This resource is user-friendly, available in all four official languages, and can be accessed through the Government of Nunavut webpage at https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/covid-19-novel-coronavirus. The purpose of this self-assessment tool is to provide Nunavummiut with real-time information and recommendations based on self-reported symptoms or recent travel history. The tool will help Nunavummiut determine whether they should self-isolate, and when they should contact a health care service provider for additional follow-up or testing. This tool is meant to supplement the existing resources that are already available, and it is not a replacement for social distancing and good hygiene, such as washing regularly. Mass gatherings are still banned, and everyone is still required to follow the rules. Nunavummiut who don’t have access to online resources but believe that they are displaying COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, are encouraged to call the COVID Hotline at 1-888-975-8601. You can also ask someone with internet access to complete the self-assessment on your behalf by sharing with them your travel history and any symptoms that you may be experiencing.

This means that many Nunavummiut currently in the south are coming to the end of their mandatory 14-day isolation periods. It is time for many of these residents to return home. The mandatory rules we put in place in our isolation sites are very strict. I think it is important to remind everyone that for 14 days, residents are: Confined in their hotel rooms most of the day. Have no physical contact with other residents undergoing isolation and no physical contact with the general population. Are allowed only monitored outings on hotel grounds. Must have daily health check-ins with on-site nurses. Are held responsible if they break isolation. There are no exceptions. These measures are a first step and they ensure Nunavummiut who want to come home, as well as their families and communities, remain healthy and safe. The second step is bringing residents home. I want to take a moment and outline this process: 48 hours before anticipated departure, travellers are informed on the clearance and travel process. The day before departure, the nurses on-site review each traveller’s daily check-in logs to make sure they complied with the isolation rules. The nurses conduct a final in-person assessment to ensure travellers are healthy and show no symptoms of COVID-19. The assessments and results are sent to my office – and a decision to clear a traveller for the scheduled return home is made and a letter approving travel is issued. Residents need both the letter and a proof of residency to return to the territory. The day of departure, residents approved for travel are transported from the hotel to the airport via a private shuttle, sanitized thoroughly before use. The Government of Nunavut worked with airlines to minimize, to the greatest possible extent, the risk of anyone being exposed to COVID-19 during their travel back to the territory. Airports have enhanced cleaning, sanitation and passenger procedures throughout the check-in and security process that ensure physical distancing. As an additional precaution, residents will also undergo an airline health check prior to boarding. Until they arrive at their final destination in Nunavut, residents remain bound by the isolation agreement they signed the day they accepted to enter the isolation sites. Residents will travel to Nunavut on both chartered and scheduled flights: Residents travelling on chartered flights are shuttled directly to their airplane for boarding and take-off. Once in Nunavut, they will be chartered to their final in-territory destination. Residents travelling on scheduled flights are dropped off at the airport, where they are met and guided by airline employees to check-in, through security, to the boarding area and finally on the plane. They do not come in contact with other travellers during this process and remain bound by their isolation agreement. I want to thank our returning residents for going through these drastic measures to protect their communities and Nunavut. As we welcome back friends, family members, and loved ones, it is more important than ever to follow the rules: All social gatherings are still banned, and all Nunavummiut, including those just returning to their home communities, are expected to do their part to keep Nunavut safe. Practice strict social distancing, stay home when possible, avoid contact with individuals outside of your household, and monitor your health.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Department of Health Services Isolation Sites Those in isolation have access to cable, internet, three meals a day, fresh linens and cleaning supplies.

This equipment will be used to test mine staff for COVID-19. At this time there is no evidence that screening in this fashion is a substitute for 14 days of isolation. This is why Nunavut, and every other Canadian jurisdiction, is using 14 days of isolation after exposure or travel. As a result, I have informed management of Agnico Eagle Mines that these tests do not change the current requirement for mine staff to stay out of the town of Rankin Inlet. The Department of Health is committed to improving and protecting the health of all Nunavummiut. For COVID-19 this means having testing equipment that meets Canadian standards and can be deployed to every community in Nunavut. The equipment used by AEM does not meet these criteria. If the Department of Health were to commit to using devices like this, we would not improve access to COVID testing for all Nunavummiut. The Department of Health continues to work on acquiring diagnostic capability that can be rapidly deployed and will provide quick access to results for all Nunavummiut. The combination of machines we continue to pursue will not only allow testing in all communities but will also improve our ability to rapidly diagnose a number of other infectious diseases that threaten Nunavummiut on a regular basis. Testing for COVID-19 at the wrong time can produce incorrect results and create a false sense of reassurance.     As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Department of Health Services The Public Health Emergency has been extended until April 16.

All existing measures under the public health emergency order remain in effect. Symptoms of COVID-19 include a fever, cough or difficulty breathing. Nunavummiut are reminded to practice physical distancing, frequent handwashing, and to stay home if they feel unwell. Anyone who believes they have been exposed to COVID-19 should call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. EDT, or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

10,2020-09-28,Canada,Nunavut,,https://gov.nu.ca/health/news/rapid-response-team-deployed-hope-bay-mine,Government Website,Rapid Response Team deployed to Hope Bay Mine,"   28 September 2020News Release Rapid Response Team deployed to Hope Bay Mine Iqaluit, Nunavut (September 28, 2020) – The Department of Health has activated its COVID Rapid Response Team in response to seven new presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 at TMAC Resources’ Hope Bay Mine, 125 km southwest of Cambridge Bay. At this time, there is no established link between these new cases and the previous two confirmed positives at the mine. If swabs come back confirmed from the southern lab, they will count as Nunavut’s first COVID-19 cases. “These latest cases lead us to believe there is transmission of COVID-19 at the Hope Bay Mine. For the safety of all employees at the site, we have deployed our Rapid Response Team,” said Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Michael Patterson. “The team, including two nurses and a logistician, is trained to trace, track and contain the virus to help reduce the risk of further transmission.” TMAC Resources contacted the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer on September 26 about an employee developing symptoms consistent with COVID-19. The Department of Health worked with on-site medical staff to swab the symptomatic employee and contacts. The presumptive positive cases and all known contacts have been isolated. Contact tracing is on-going. In response, all non-essential travel to and from the Mine, including scheduled shift changes, is cancelled until further notice. This situation does not affect the current public health measures, Nunavut’s Path or the Common Travel Areas with Churchill, Manitoba and the Northwest Territories. “Although this is a serious situation, the risk to Nunavummiut is very low,” said Minister of Health George Hickes. “There are no Nunavut residents currently working at the Hope Bay Mine, and the site is isolated from all Nunavut communities. As we see cases on the rise in Southern Canada, I encourage all Nunavummiut to be careful, follow our public health advice and remain prepared for COVID-19.” Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. EDT, or notify their community health centre right away by phone, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days. Symptoms of COVID-19 include a fever, cough or difficulty breathing. The best protection from spreading or catching the disease is physical distancing, handwashing for at least 20 seconds, coughing and sneezing into an elbow and staying home as much as possible. ### Media Contact:  Cate Macleod 	Press Secretary to Premier Savikataaq 	867-975-5059cmacleod@gov.nu.ca Chris Puglia 	Acting Manager Communications 	Department of Health 	867-975-5949cpuglia@gov.nu.ca 	 Document(s):  2020-09_nr_36_hea_rapid_response_team_deployed_to_hope_bay_mine_-_eng.pdf  "

With the two-week period concluded, there is no longer a concern that those individuals contracted the virus. These past weeks we have continued to improve our capacity for in-territory testing. The Biofire device in Iqaluit is now operating alongside the GeneXpert machine. Aside from the need to have increased testing capacity in-territory, we also need to improve the turn around time for test results. This week, the Department of Health is starting a pilot project using charter aircraft to transport COVID-19 samples from Baffin communities to Iqaluit. The goal is to have a system in place that will reduce the test results turn around time to five days or less. Once the system is in place and working, we will begin the same process in Rankin Inlet. Increased in-territory testing capacity combined with shorter turnaround times for tests results, will give us more flexibility with our public health measures and improve our response in case of an outbreak. However, testing is not enough. As most people know, the Public Health strategy for minimizing the risks of COVID-19 entering and spreading in the territory relies on several measures. Testing is just one component. Physical distancing, good hygiene like washing our hands, staying home when sick and in the isolation hubs, work in tandem with testing and should not be underestimated. We should also keep in mind that our public health measures are effective only because Nunavummiut, individually and collectively, follow them. We have been effective so far in reducing the risks because each and everyone of us made the conscious choice to adopt and include these measures in our daily lives. Every time we choose to ignore these measures, the risk increases. While the risk can never be zero, we know that these measures are working. Nunavut remains COVID-free. We have seen decreases in respiratory illnesses this year across the territory. It is therefore vital that, individually and collectively, we continue to make the choice to follow public health measures and remain active participants in protecting our families and communities. Thank you   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  Public Health Emergency The Public Health Emergency was extended on Sept. 3 to and is in effect until Sept. 17.

The Government of Nunavut is managing several hubs, and dealing with a large number of requests from both medical and non-essential travellers. In an attempt to help clear up some of the delays to get into the hubs, Iqaluit is being looked at as one of several options to help relieve the wait time for medical travellers in Winnipeg. This has not been finalized and we are actively looking at the possibility of creating a second hub in Winnipeg, specifically for medical travellers. Our commitment is to ensure our medical travellers are well cared for and we are prioritizing their stays above non-essential travellers. We understand the concerns raised on social media over the weekend. However, nothing has been confirmed about an Iqaluit or additional Winnipeg hub. We recognize the fear and uncertainty that comes with COVID-19. However, we need to balance that fear with facts, the best possible care for Nunavummiut and our commitment to public health and safety. When there is an official course of action on this, we will announce it with all the relevant information. As we work to relieve this backlog, we thank those waiting for a spot in the isolation hubs for their patience and understanding. We are working around the clock to keep our territory and Nunavummiut safe. Thanks to all the staff who have worked so hard to keep everyone well during COVID-19.

On July 20, all licensed establishments in the territory will be allowed to open with regular hours. Nunavut will also be extending its common travel area to include Churchill, Manitoba. This bubble is exclusive to the community of Churchill and does not extend to other regions of Manitoba. The common travel area applies to air, land and water travel and exempts travellers from isolation requirements in either Nunavut or Churchill under certain conditions: Travel must originate from Nunavut to Churchill or from Churchill to Nunavut. Travellers must have not been outside either Churchill or Nunavut for 2 weeks prior to travelling. Travellers must remain in either Nunavut or Churchill for the duration of their stay. Prior to travelling outside of Nunavut, travellers must contact the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer for Nunavut and provide: Contact information, such as an address and phone number, at the person’s regular place of residence; and A written declaration that can be obtained by emailing CPHOtravelrequests@gov.nu.ca or by going to the Department of Health’s website. When travelling by air, travellers are required to obtain a letter from the CPHO authorizing travel or they will not be permitted to board their flight. Those who leave the common travel area outside of Churchill will need to isolate for 14 days at a government isolation facility, prior to returning to Nunavut. I would like to also take this opportunity to thank all Nunavummiut for their patience as we work together to protect our territory and families from COVID-19.

We are still waiting on confirmatory results for the presumptive case detected in the Mary River Mine, with the expectation that they will be ready sometime this week. The Department of Health continues to monitor the situation at the Mary River Mine site closely, and we will provide support as needed. I want to take this opportunity and remind Nunavummiut that: Testing is only one component of the Public Health response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Testing is important, but it is not a replacement for social distancing or hand-washing. Testing is important, but it is absolutely not a replacement for 14 days of isolation. The Government of Nunavut follows testing guidelines and best practices that have been endorsed by the World Health Organization and Health Canada. We rely on diagnostic devices that have undergone rigorous validation and accreditation processes to provide dependable testing to Nunavummiut. Even under ideal conditions, and with validated equipment, testing is not always a reliable method of identifying cases of COVID-19 and halting transmission. There is strong evidence that false negatives can occur throughout the incubation period. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the overarching goal of our public health response is to identify, contain and break transmission. The Government of Nunavut will continue to look at emerging evidence and best practices set out by public health authorities, both nationally and globally, to shape our response to COVID-19, and will alter public health measures as and when appropriate.

Today marks the third bi-weekly announcement for Nunavut’s Path for moving forward during COVID-19. There are still no cases of COVID-19 detected in the territory, so once again we are in a position to alter public health measures. I’m pleased to announce the following changes under the new Order Respecting Social Distancing and Gatherings, which goes into effect today: The limit for outdoor gatherings has now been increased to 50 people. The limit for indoor gatherings has been increased to 10 people. In private dwellings, this means 10 people in addition to those who reside there. The limit for gatherings at places of worship, conference facilities, community halls, rental meeting spaces, and gatherings organized by the Government of Canada, Government of Nunavut, municipal corporation, or Regional Inuit Organizations has been set at 50 people or 50% of capacity for the facility, whichever is less. In all facilities and gatherings, it is still expected that social distancing is maintained. As we take another step forward on Nunavut’s Path, and we return to some of the activities, programs, or venues that we’ve missed, we need to remain diligent in our collective commitment to practice social distancing and good hand hygiene. If you make the choice to participate in a large gathering, or attend an indoor event, or even meet up with friends for dinner, please also choose to be responsible, and choose to take actions that will keep yourself, your community, and your territory, safe. Wash your hands. Keep six feet away from others. Avoid touching your face. Sanitize high-touch areas often. Consider wearing a mask when social distancing is difficult. If you don’t feel well, stay home. Thank you. 			   			As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  Calling Ahead at Health Centres Unless you are experiencing a medical emergency, please call your health centre first before going in.

As of today, Nunavut is resuming regular medical travel to Churchill, Manitoba. As Churchill has not had a confirmed case of COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic, we have determined that the risk of resuming medical travel operations is minimal, and it is greatly outweighed by the benefits of ensuring that Nunavummiut have access to the out-of-territory care they need. Medical travellers and their escorts who travel to Churchill for treatment and do not leave the community for the duration of their stay, will be able to return directly to Nunavut without needing to isolate at a GN designated isolation facility. If the situation changes, we will re-assess and be ready to initiate contact tracing and containment measures immediately. We have also had some inquiries from cab companies regarding their operations. Under the new Order Regarding Social Distancing and Gatherings, cab companies can collect fares from multiple households at once, under specific conditions. Whenever there are multiple passengers in the cab, everyone must wear a mask. Cab drivers must provide masks for riders who do not have them. Most importantly, cab drivers must obtain consent from all passengers before picking up multiple fares. This means that any passenger who is picked up, and all subsequent fares on that ride, must indicate that they are okay with riding in a shared cab with others. All passengers can still request that they do not share their ride with others, and, for now, cab companies must comply with this request. We want to thank all cab companies who have so readily complied with recommendations to limit passenger travel and enhance sanitation procedures in order to keep Nunavummiut safe and healthy. Finally, as restaurants, bars, and other indoor locations are permitted to open, I want to continue to emphasize to Nunavummiut the necessity of social distancing, good hand hygiene, and staying home when we are sick. We need to remember, even as we return to the activities we enjoy, that this pandemic is far from over, and small actions from everyone today add up to major impacts tomorrow. Thank you.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  Calling Ahead at Health Centres Unless you are experiencing a medical emergency, please call your health centre first before going in.

I am pleased to say that after consultation with my counterpart in the GNWT, as of today, residents of the NWT can travel to Nunavut without isolating prior to arrival. The establishment of the common travel area by air or by land between the two territories does however come with strict conditions and expectations: Travel must originate from Nunavut to the NWT or from the NWT to Nunavut. Travellers have not been outside their respective territory for two weeks prior to their travel to the NWT or Nunavut. Travellers remain in either territory for the duration of their stay. Travellers from the NWT who wish to enter Nunavut, must write to: cphotravelrequests@gov.nu.ca and complete and sign the Nunavut and NWT Traveller’s Declaration form. Failure to do so will affect entry in Nunavut. Failure to answer truthfully will be subject to fines. This also applies for Nunavummiut who wish to return home after their stay in the NWT. My office will issue a letter of approval. Travellers will be required to present the approval letter prior to boarding any airplane entering Nunavut. Isolation before entering Nunavut is still required if You are a Nunavut resident who is returning home from travel in southern Canada via Yellowknife. In this case, you will need to complete a 14-day isolation period in the GN isolation hub in Yellowknife. You are an NWT resident who has travelled outside your territory less than two weeks before your scheduled arrival in Nunavut. In this case, you will need to complete the NWT isolation requirements before applying for travel to Nunavut. I want to re-assure Nunavummiut that should the current situation change in either territory, we will re-assess the common travel area and take all necessary measures to protect the health and safety of Nunavummiut. Further Information can be found in Travel and Isolation section of the Department of Health website at https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/travel-and-isolation. Today also marks the second of our bi-weekly announcements regarding the status of current health measures. Beginning June 22: Personal service providers will also be permitted to open for one-on-one sessions. This includes hairdressers and nail salons. Again, these facilities will be responsible for ensuring that PPE is available for both clients and service providers when requested. Bars and restaurants will be allowed to re-open and operate at half capacity. Last call for alcohol service will be at 9 p.m.. Facility operators need to ensure that patrons are respecting social distancing. Liquor Inspectors have the authority to enforce orders regarding social distancing, and they will be monitoring to ensure adherence to these conditions. Theatres and churches are also permitted to re-open on June 22. On June 29: Youth centres and day camps will be able to resume operations. Long-term care facilities will begin accepting visitors in a limited capacity; they can only allow one to two visitors per resident at a time, and these visitors can only be immediate family. Guidelines for re-opening will be available on the health website in the coming days. Though we can reasonably forecast what the next two weeks may bring, we must remain aware of the possible need to change or re-introduce public health measures. While we are in a position to ease restrictions, we remain vulnerable to the impacts of this global pandemic. Every week, new information becomes available. Every week, the situation can change. What doesn’t change is that social distancing, washing your hands and staying home when you are sick are the three main actions each and everyone of us can take to keep our families and our communities safe.

Right now, travel into Nunavut represents the single biggest risk for introducing COVID-19. The travel ban, and the 14-day isolation requirements for returning Nunavummiut, are meant to mitigate this risk and keep our territory safe. Knowing that, I’d like to take this opportunity to share information on the new process being implemented for reserving stays in GN southern isolation facilities. Moving forward, all Nunavummiut who must travel outside of the territory should contact the email address NUisolationreservations@nunavutcare.ca and submit an Isolation Reservation Request Form as soon as they know their plans for travel. From there, the travel team will work to identify room availability and reserve your stay in one of the designated isolation facilities. This new streamlined process is meant to help Nunavummiut plan for their 14-day quarantine period farther in advance and ensures that our travel team can anticipate and accommodate travellers in the coming months. More information, including intake days requirements, can also be found on the Department of Health’s website. Remember, non-essential travel outside of the territory is still not recommended. All individuals who are applying for critical worker exemption will continue to use the email address CPHOTravelRequests@gov.nu.ca. Finally, the Department of Health has made temporary amendments to the Medical Travel Policy to help keep our medical travellers and escorts safe from COVID-19. Specific provisions have been added to ensure that medical travellers and escorts abide by rules of social distancing, hand-washing hygiene, and other behaviours that help to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The amendments also more clearly outline the requirements for both medical travellers and escorts to complete 14 days of self-isolation at a designated isolation facility prior to returning to Nunavut. As we continue to look at ways of easing public health measures and returning the activities we enjoy, we must remain diligent and aware that the threat of COVID-19 has not yet passed. Please continue to maintain physical distancing and handwashing practices, and limit any non-essential travel out of the territory.

This annual event highlights the health risks associated with tobacco use, and advocates for effective policies to reduce tobacco consumption. Right now, we are all working hard to commit to our public health measures that protect us from the threat of COVID-19. We are social distancing, staying home as much as possible, and washing our hands as much as we can. These actions are keeping ourselves, our communities, and our territory safe. Quitting tobacco use is one more step we can take to guard ourselves against the impact of this pandemic. We know that COVID-19 is mainly a respiratory virus, and early evidence suggests that smoking can make symptoms worse. Smokers are also likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19, as smoking increases the likelihood of transmission from one’s face and lips. Please remember: do not share cigarettes, joints, or pipes. Do not pick up discarded cigarette or cannabis butts. Wash your hands often, and refrain from touching your face. The best thing that we can do for our health is to quit smoking. By making the decision to quit smoking, we can help to protect ourselves from COVID-19 today, and dramatically improve our health for the coming weeks, months, and years. Support is available for anyone who wants to explore options to help them quit. Message a counsellor on the Tobacco Has No Place Here Facebook page or call 1-866-368-7848 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The service is private and free. Counsellors can help you in Inuktitut, English, Inuinnaqtun and French. Nicotine replacement therapy, or NRT, is also available at no cost through the Non-Insured Health Benefits program at your local health centre or pharmacy. Call ahead, and ask your health care provider for information and options for NRT. Thank you. Chief Public Health Officer update Good morning. Today marks the start of Nunavut’s Path forward. Day cares, territorial parks, and playgrounds are permitted to re-open, and the size limit for outdoor gatherings has been increased to 25. Today will also be the first of our bi-weekly assessments concerning the modification of public health measures. As we look at altering public health measures, I want to take a moment and emphasize to all Nunavummiut the continued importance of social distancing. While we are in a position today to alter measures, we are not in a position to take social distancing for granted. We’ve noticed through the contact tracing of persons under investigation that people’s contact bubbles are becoming noticeably larger. Larger contact bubbles will make it significantly more challenging to identify and prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. COVID-19 continues to pose a risk to Nunavummiut, and we are not immune to this pandemic. We’ve made it this far thanks to our collective efforts, but those efforts absolutely have to continue. With that said, I’m pleased to announce the following modifications to public health measures that will be occurring over the next two weeks. Effective immediately, in-territory travel advisories are lifted. Travel outside of Nunavut is still not recommended. Individuals who are travelling outside of the territory need to be aware not only of the isolation procedures to return, but also of the measures that other jurisdictions may have in place to limit or discourage travel. On June 8, workplaces and retail outlets are permitted to re-open, provided that they have safety measures in place. Galleries, museums, and libraries may also be opened for individual viewing and browsing, though group sessions are still prohibited. There will also be an increased availability of in-person health assessments at health centres across the territory. On June 15, dental clinics, physiotherapy clinics, massage therapy, and chiropractic treatments are permitted to resume. Gyms and pools will also be permitted to re-open for solo workouts and lap swimming only. Please note, that all these measures are subject to alteration should conditions change. Thank you.     Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, May 28, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update Good morning. I’d like to take this opportunity to clarify the conditions required in order for us to consider altering the current border measures in place. I have previously indicated that the border restrictions currently in place will likely be among the final public health measures that are lifted. This is because right now travel into Nunavut from outside of the territory represents the highest risk. If we want to continue Nunavut’s Path, and remove additional public health measures inside the territory, then we need to maintain our strict travel measures. This is our best chance to both return to the activities we enjoy and the programs we depend on, while still protecting the health and safety of Nunavummiut. With that said, fulfillment of any of the following conditions may influence decisions to alter our border measures. Development of a vaccine for COVID-19. We’ve already discussed this, and though it is unlikely that a vaccine will be developed and readily available in the near future, it is still a factor that would greatly influence all of our public health measures; Development or discovery of an effective treatment for COVID-19; Indication that COVID-19 is under control in our neighboring jurisdictions. This means that beyond just decreasing case numbers, we would need to see evidence that community transmission in neighboring jurisdictions is minimal and contained; And finally, achievement of sustainable and on-going diagnostic capacity in every community in Nunavut. Unfortunately, many of these factors are outside of our control, but we will continue to monitor the evolving global situation. As always, our decisions surrounding the border measures will be guided by evidence and will be designed to protect and preserve the health and safety of Nunavummiut throughout this global pandemic. I would like to remind Nunavummiut that as of Monday, June 1, playgrounds, territorial parks, and daycares are permitted to open, and the size of outdoor gatherings may increase to 25. On June 1, we will also begin our bi-weekly announcements on the assessment and potential easing of additional public health measures. The reason we have chosen two weeks as our interval of choice is straightforward. All evidence suggests that 14 days is the maximum incubation time for COVID-19. So, this 14-day window will give us an opportunity to assess the situation around us and make informed decisions based on the latest information available. Please remember that if a threat is detected, we may need to react immediately. We will provide as much warning as possible, but we may need to introduce additional public health measures right away. Finally, the Department is issuing a Public Health Advisory to the community of Sanikiluaq due to the detection of pertussis, also known as whooping cough. Whooping cough is a disease of the throat or lungs that is spread easily from person to person. Anyone can get whooping cough, but the most severe cases are in young children. For that reason, the daycare in Sanikiluaq must remain closed for the time being. Thank you.  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

These past two months have not been easy, and all Nunavummiut have had to make sacrifices. However, thanks to our combined efforts, we are protecting our families, our communities, and our territory from this pandemic, and I hope that all Nunavummiut can feel a sense of pride knowing that their actions are making a deep and measurable impact on keeping Nunavut healthy and safe. It is time for us to move forward. This does not mean that this pandemic is over. This does not mean that the threat has passed. This means that we can cautiously begin our return to the activities we enjoy, knowing that at any time we may need to change our behaviour to protect ourselves from emerging threats. In the coming weeks, we will work with our stakeholders to re-introduce our businesses, our activities, and our programs in a way that is safe, sustainable, and poses the least risk to the health and safety of Nunavummiut. Know that as we begin to loosen restrictions internally, it is imperative that our strict border measures remain to minimize the risk of introducing COVID-19 into the territory. With that being said, I’m pleased to announce that as of June 1: Daycares will be permitted to open up for regular business. The size limit for outdoor gatherings will increase to 25 people. Territorial parks will be allowed to reopen for outdoor activities only, if local circumstances permit. All park buildings will remain closed. Municipal playgrounds will be allowed to re-open, again, if local circumstances permit. These particular conditions have been selected because they are deemed low risk. Moving forward, our plan is to re-assess our condition every two weeks. If the state of COVID in Nunavut is favorable, we will continue to lift public health measures, beginning with lower risk activities and programs. If our condition is stable, we may remain at the status quo until we are confident that lifting additional restrictions would not pose an undue risk to Nunavummiut. Finally, if the threat of COVID-19 increases, or eased public health measures are posing a potential public health threat to the territory, we may need to introduce or re-introduce certain conditions. I share in everyone’s desire to return to normal. We all want to know when we can confidently and safely travel within our own territory, or to our neighbouring jurisdictions. However, trying to forecast specific dates and timelines for when we can lift all of our public health measures would be inaccurate, and frankly, it would be insincere. The COVID-19 pandemic is evolving rapidly, and every single week yields new information that shapes our strategy and our public health measures. Predictions and decisions made on the basis of today’s understanding of the virus may be obsolete in a short time. For this reason, we have opted for an approach that is flexible, cautious, and adaptive to the evolving situation around us. Again, I want to thank all Nunavummiut for their continued patience and understanding. No one is left unaffected by this pandemic, but our collective accountability has kept Nunavut safe so far. This accountability and responsibility needs to continue, and, as we loosen restrictions, we must continue to practice social distancing, stay away from others when we are sick and wash our hands often. Thank you.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

I am pleased to announce several items today. The first is that Rankin Inlet now has the ability to provide testing if a positive case is confirmed in-territory. I’d like to commend the medical and laboratory staff, especially Matt Stacey and Dr. Jasmine Pawa, who have been working tirelessly to become acquainted with the GeneXpert machine, and to ensure that it can be managed safely, efficiently, and accurately. Getting this machine up and running is a significant step forward for Nunavut, as this now fulfills our criteria of obtaining reliable and effective in-territory diagnostic capacity. When coupled with the fact that we still have no confirmed cases of COVID-19 inside the territory, we have now met two of our three conditions. While the situation in southern Canada will continue to play a role in our approach moving forward, we are now in a better position to consider reducing some restrictions in the territory. I have one other piece of news I would like to share. Moving forward, Kitikmeot medical travellers receiving treatment in Yellowknife are no longer required to undergo the 14-day isolation period, and instead will be permitted to return home immediately. This decision has been made through consultation with the Northwest Territories and is contingent on there being no active cases of COVID-19 in the NWT. Please note that this is for medical travellers only, and this is only when their treatment is provided in Yellowknife. Any medical traveller who needs to leave the Northwest Territories to receive treatment in other cities in Canada will still be required to complete their 14-day isolation period. For all medical travellers to whom this new rule applies who are currently in quarantine, we are working to get you home as soon as possible. As always, our main goal is the safety, health and well being of Nunavummiut. I would like to thank you all for your patience, understanding and support as we continue to care for our families and our communities.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, May 8, 2020 Minister of Health update: It was announced at the start of this year by the World Health Organization that all of 2020 was to be recognized as the Year of the Nurse and the Midwife. This was an opportunity to celebrate the vital role of nurses and midwives in the delivery of health care services across the world. Several months later, in the midst of this global pandemic, we are not just talking about their essential role in keeping us healthy, we are experiencing it firsthand. Nurses and midwives continue to deliver vital health care services in our territory, in our country, and throughout the world. May 11 to 17 is recognized as National Nursing Week. As our nurses work tirelessly to ensure that Nunavummiut have access to the care they need, I think it’s important that we all take this opportunity to show them our immense gratitude for their service and their contribution to this territory. Nunavut has more than 300 nurses who are essential to the development and delivery of programs that keep Nunavummiut healthy. In these uncertain times, as the world battles COVID-19, our nurses are on the front line, providing care to those who need it most. This pandemic has demonstrated our nurses’ willingness to put their own health and safety at risk to protect and care for those around them. This National Nursing Week, and indeed this entire Year of The Nurse and Midwife, give us an opportunity to shine a spotlight on these essential health staff. However, our gratitude for your service is not restricted to a single week, or a single year. I would like all Nunavummiut to join me in showing our ongoing appreciation for your continued dedication to this territory. Thank you.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, May 6, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update: Since it was confirmed that the detected COVID case in Nunavut was a false positive, the territory has witnessed great displays of solidarity, support, and pride. The additional restrictions in Pond Inlet have been lifted, and I hope that the community feels a measure of relief knowing that they are still COVID-free. This is good news. As a territory, we have done well so far. However, we cannot allow our celebration to lapse into complacency. It is more important than ever that we maintain these rules that we’ve all become familiar with. The threat of COVID-19 is still very real and we need to stay the course. Practise social distancing. Avoid contact with individuals who are not a member of your household. Limit trips for errands. Purchase only the supplies that your household needs. And, of course, wash your hands. There is no combination of measures that can absolutely guarantee the prevention of COVID-19. Even as we celebrate for Pond Inlet, all Nunavummiut need to remain vigilant and cautious. Follow the rules, and encourage your friends, family, and neighbours to do the same. I want to thank all Nunavummiut for their continued patience, understanding, and cooperation. We can only get through this together.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Travel outside the territory as of May 7, 2020: The Government of Nunavut’s decision to charge $2,100 per individual and $1,050 for each additional family member during the mandatory 14-day isolation stays for residents returning to the territory has been reversed. The Government of Nunavut will continue to cover these costs as long as mandatory isolation for residents returning to the territory is in place. Please keep in mind that travel outside of Nunavut during the COVID-19 pandemic is not advised.    Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

This means that although the first test result showed COVID-19 infection, further investigation and testing have not shown any other evidence of COVID-19 infection in Pond Inlet. As I have previously mentioned, no lab test is perfect. There is always a chance of false positive or false negative results. When interpreting results and deciding on an appropriate course of action, we consider many pieces of information, of which test results are just one piece. We always aim to err on the side of caution. Diagnostic tests are part of an entire system of measures to intervene on COVID-19 infection. In these circumstances the test gave an incorrect result, but the rest of the system (public health nurses, contact tracing, surveillance) have not identified any other cases of COVID-19 infection. The information available so far includes: The individual involved has not been outside of Pond Inlet for some time. We have not identified an exposure to COVID-19. We have not found any other cases of COVID-19 in Pond Inlet. We have not noticed any increase in significant respiratory infections. 		  For all of the reasons above we believe that the individual in Pond Inlet does not, and never did have COVID-19. As a result, our rapid response team will stop operating in Pond Inlet and the members of the team will begin preparing for future deployments. All territorial orders under the Public Health Emergency remain in effect. However, the additional measures specific to Pond Inlet as a result of the positive COVID-19 case are now lifted. Effective immediately, travel between Pond Inlet and other Nunavut communities may resume, and the community-specific restrictions on businesses and services in Pond Inlet are also rescinded.      Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

The Rapid Response Team is in the community, and they are implementing containment and contact tracing. As the team completes additional testing, there is the possibility that more positive cases may be confirmed in the community. This does not necessarily mean that there is community transmission and should not be cause for alarm. What this does mean is that the Rapid Response Team is doing their job, which is finding the virus and stopping it from spreading. Containment is key, and right now it is our top priority. As this process takes place, the Government of Nunavut will continue to support the community of Pond Inlet. I also want to take a moment and thank the municipality of Pond Inlet and its residents for allowing me to answer their questions earlier today on the community radio. Moving forward, I would like to remind all Nunavummiut, using the strongest possible terms, that every single social interaction carries a degree of risk. Despite all of the Government of Nunavut’s preventative measures, and the new containment measures now in place within Pond Inlet, it is impossible to reasonably predict where or when COVID-19 may be detected next. I urge all Nunavummiut to exercise a high degree of caution, and to seriously consider these risks before participating in a gathering of any kind. If you deem it necessary to participate in gatherings, then please keep track of the people with whom you interact, as this information may be necessary in case contact tracing needs to be conducted in your community. Health staff cannot get us through this alone. How well we do, and where we go from here, depends on the actions of every single Nunavummiut. Right now, the best way of slowing the spread of COVID-19 continues to be through social distancing and effective hygiene. If everyone follows these rules together, we can put ourselves in the best position to make it through this uncertain time. It’s more important than ever that we be careful, responsible, kind, and supportive. I’d like to thank Nunavummiut for their continued cooperation and understanding. As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Travel outside the territory as of May 7, 2020 Starting May 7, 2020, Nunavummiut who chose to travel outside Nunavut while the CPHO’s travel ban is still in effect will have to cover the costs of their 14-day isolation period in one of the Government of Nunavut’s isolation sites. The fee for a single individual in a room is $2,100 for the 14-day period, and each additional family member in the room will pay $1,050. Updates will be provided as they become available. 		   Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, April 30, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update As you have seen and heard, today we have announced that a case of COVID-19 has been detected within Pond Inlet. Since the onset of the pandemic, we knew that no combination of preventative measures can absolutely guarantee the prevention of COVID-19. We anticipated that sooner or later the virus would be detected in the territory. Just as we have poured extensive effort into our prevention plan, so too have we developed a comprehensive response plan to minimize, to the greatest possible extent, the impact that COVID-19 has on Nunavut. We have been in contact with hamlet authorities and have initiated our Rapid Response Plan. A Rapid Response Team has already been deployed to Pond Inlet and is scheduled to arrive early this afternoon. That team will immediately initiate containment measures, begin contact tracing, and monitor the health and well-being of persons on home isolation orders. The Pond Inlet Health Centre is well-staffed and prepared, and health centre operations will continue. All passenger travel in and out of Pond Inlet has ceased. This includes any movement in or out of the community by land travel. This travel ban is a necessary containment measure to minimize the risk of COVID-19 spreading to multiple communities at once. Until we have determined the potential spread of the virus within the community, all non-essential offices and services will be closed. There is to be no social gatherings within dwellings, and all residents of Pond Inlet are asked to continue to maintain social distancing and good hygiene. For residents of Pond Inlet, we recognize that this news may be frightening. However, the Government of Nunavut would like to assure everyone that although travel is restricted, you are not cut off from help and support. Critical services will be maintained, and plans are in place to ensure that access to services such as heat, power, water, sewer, and communications will not be interrupted. Our primary focus now is to detect and contain the virus to prevent further transmission within the community and to other communities. Anyone who has reason to believe that they have been exposed to the virus is advised to call the COVID-19 hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. or 6 p.m. or call your community health centre. Please, do not go to the health centre in person unless you are instructed to by a health official. To all Nunavummiut, know that the preventative measures that we have all been taking are more important now than ever. Everyone needs to practise social distancing, stay home whenever possible, and avoid contact with those who are not a member of your household. Together, our efforts can slow the spread of COVID-19. Finally, I remind everyone of the importance of kindness. Now is not the time for blame, or shame. It is the time for compassion, empathy, and support of your fellow Nunavummiut. The Government of Nunavut thanks all Nunavummiut for their efforts to date. We will continue to exhaust all efforts to contain the virus, and minimize its impact on Pond Inlet, and on all the territory. Only together can we all protect our territory from the threat of COVID-19.    Department of Health Services  Residents of Pond Inlet must call their health centre first. All regular appointments at the Pond Inlet Health Centre have been cancelled. Only emergency services are available.  COVID-19 Hotline and self-assessment tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or call their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days. Nunavummiut can also use the self-assessment tool available at www.gov.nu.ca COMMUNITY TRAVEL AND GATHERINGS RESTRICTION ORDER POND INLET All travel to and from Pond Inlet is banned except: People with a letter from the CPHO Medevac patients Flight crews Nunavut Inuit exercising their hunting rights as set out in Article 5 may leave and return to Pond Inlet but not travel to any other community People travelling on a flight which must land in Pond Inlet due to weather or emergency Medevac crews must restrict movements to the airport and the health centre and must wear personal protective equipment. All businesses operating in Pond Inlet must close except for: Grocery stores Fuel and motor vehicle stations Post office Restaurants open for take out service All social gatherings shall be restricted to five persons or fewer. No social gatherings in dwellings. The order can be consulted at:https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/covid-19-novel-coronavirus   Department of Health Services, April 29, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update As many of you may know, some jurisdictions in Canada have started or will soon begin a gradual lifting of the restrictions they have implemented to flatten the COVID curve. Today I’d like to speak in more detail about what needs to happen before we can do the same. There are three conditions that need to be met before we can consider relaxing existing restrictions in the territory. They are as follows: We need to achieve in-territory diagnostic capacity. This means that we need to be able to implement a rapid, accurate, and comprehensive COVID-19 testing program here in Nunavut; There needs to be significant indication that rates of COVID-19 are decreasing in the southern jurisdictions to which Nunavummiut most often travel; and There needs to remain no active cases of COVID-19 within Nunavut. The nature of these conditions means that it is difficult to assign a specific timeline to re-opening, but fulfillment of these conditions is necessary to minimize risk to public health and safety. We need to know that Nunavummiut travelling outside of the territory can do so safely, and we need to be able to respond rapidly to any confirmed cases of COVID-19 within Nunavut. I know that people are eager to go back to work, visit loved ones, and engage in social activities. However, if we lift these restrictions too early, we will increase the risk to Nunavummiut. If we aren’t careful about how we transition back from these restrictions, then we could effectively undo all the hard work and sacrifices that we’ve made over the past seven weeks. It is as important as ever that we stay the course: maintain social distancing, stay home whenever possible, and wash your hands often. These measures continue to be the best defence against COVID-19, and the best way to protect our families, our communities, and our territory.   Department of Health Services Access to health care services will remain available in all communities seven days a week. All non-urgent requests will be triaged daily. Immediate access to urgent and emergent health care services are and will continue to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. All clients are asked to call before presenting at a health facility. In Iqaluit, public health, the emergency room and inpatient unit will remain open. Well baby clinics, prenatal visits and immunizations are continuing across Nunavut. Physicians will continue community visits. If this is not possible, the visits will be conducted by telehealth or by phone.   Volumes  Total (All Isolation Locations)   Traveler Type   Guests in Isolation as of April 28   Medical Travel   206   Public   136   Total   342    Traveller repatriation summary:  Departure Date   # of Travellers from Isolation Sites   April 29   38   April 30   15   May 1   19   May 2   6   May 3   14    Critical Worker Requests As of April 28, there are 786 requests, 597 of which are critical worker requests.

The new order adds clarity around gatherings and social distancing and provides easy to understand scenarios that will help Nunavummiut more easily follow the order. It will also help businesses understand how to adjust their operations to ensure public safety and continued operation. Finally, the changes will also assist law enforcement and peace officers to more easily interpret the intent of the order in the unlikely event there is a need for enforcement. I’d like to outline some of the new definitions and information provided in the new order. Food service establishments and licensed premises remain closed. Restaurants can still provide options for take-out or delivery, as long as they abide by the rules of social distancing while doing so. All businesses deemed as Personal Service Providers must also remain closed. These include hair dressing, barbering, massage therapy, and other similar establishments. Additionally, dentists, veterinarians, and psychologists must remain closed, except for emergencies. Public playgrounds, municipal parks, and day-use areas of territorial parks also remain closed. Though still subject to closures and limitations, the following businesses are permitted to remain open: any business large enough to maintain a two-metre social distance within the workplace, or businesses that limit customers to no more than five at a time. The five-at-a-time rule does not apply to businesses that are large enough to maintain social distancing throughout the entire premise, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and similar facilities. The order provides a definition to gatherings. All organized public gatherings of more than five people remain prohibited. This includes concerts, community events, sporting events, and ceremonies such as marriages, funerals, or memorial services. Finally, all social gatherings, including social gatherings in private dwellings, shall be restricted to five persons or fewer. This includes play groups, club meetings, and meals with individuals who do not reside together. This new order does not mean that restrictions are being loosened, or that the Government of Nunavut has re-assessed the territory’s position or tolerance for risk. Instead, the definitions under this new order have been aligned with definitions being applied in other jurisdictions. This makes restrictive measures clearer and more consistent in their application and enforcement. It is strongly recommended that Nunavummiut limit contact with anyone who is not a member of their immediate household. Any social gathering carries a degree of risk, especially when we are looking at individuals from multiple different households mingling together. Nunavummiut must still exercise caution at all times, practise social distancing to the greatest extent possible, and wash hands and all shared surfaces thoroughly and often. The previous order met the intended purpose of providing necessary tools to help protect public health. However, The Government of Nunavut recognized the need to provide clearer language and definitions. For this reason, the Department of Justice worked with the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) to prepare a new Order to ensure the language is clear and understandable while remaining true to its intent.

This resource is user-friendly, available in all four official languages, and can be accessed through the Government of Nunavut webpage at https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/covid-19-novel-coronavirus. The purpose of this self-assessment tool is to provide Nunavummiut with real-time information and recommendations based on self-reported symptoms or recent travel history. The tool will help Nunavummiut determine whether they should self-isolate, and when they should contact a health care service provider for additional follow-up or testing. This tool is meant to supplement the existing resources that are already available, and it is not a replacement for social distancing and good hygiene, such as washing regularly. Mass gatherings are still banned, and everyone is still required to follow the rules. Nunavummiut who don’t have access to online resources but believe that they are displaying COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, are encouraged to call the COVID Hotline at 1-888-975-8601. You can also ask someone with internet access to complete the self-assessment on your behalf by sharing with them your travel history and any symptoms that you may be experiencing.

This means that many Nunavummiut currently in the south are coming to the end of their mandatory 14-day isolation periods. It is time for many of these residents to return home. The mandatory rules we put in place in our isolation sites are very strict. I think it is important to remind everyone that for 14 days, residents are: Confined in their hotel rooms most of the day. Have no physical contact with other residents undergoing isolation and no physical contact with the general population. Are allowed only monitored outings on hotel grounds. Must have daily health check-ins with on-site nurses. Are held responsible if they break isolation. There are no exceptions. These measures are a first step and they ensure Nunavummiut who want to come home, as well as their families and communities, remain healthy and safe. The second step is bringing residents home. I want to take a moment and outline this process: 48 hours before anticipated departure, travellers are informed on the clearance and travel process. The day before departure, the nurses on-site review each traveller’s daily check-in logs to make sure they complied with the isolation rules. The nurses conduct a final in-person assessment to ensure travellers are healthy and show no symptoms of COVID-19. The assessments and results are sent to my office – and a decision to clear a traveller for the scheduled return home is made and a letter approving travel is issued. Residents need both the letter and a proof of residency to return to the territory. The day of departure, residents approved for travel are transported from the hotel to the airport via a private shuttle, sanitized thoroughly before use. The Government of Nunavut worked with airlines to minimize, to the greatest possible extent, the risk of anyone being exposed to COVID-19 during their travel back to the territory. Airports have enhanced cleaning, sanitation and passenger procedures throughout the check-in and security process that ensure physical distancing. As an additional precaution, residents will also undergo an airline health check prior to boarding. Until they arrive at their final destination in Nunavut, residents remain bound by the isolation agreement they signed the day they accepted to enter the isolation sites. Residents will travel to Nunavut on both chartered and scheduled flights: Residents travelling on chartered flights are shuttled directly to their airplane for boarding and take-off. Once in Nunavut, they will be chartered to their final in-territory destination. Residents travelling on scheduled flights are dropped off at the airport, where they are met and guided by airline employees to check-in, through security, to the boarding area and finally on the plane. They do not come in contact with other travellers during this process and remain bound by their isolation agreement. I want to thank our returning residents for going through these drastic measures to protect their communities and Nunavut. As we welcome back friends, family members, and loved ones, it is more important than ever to follow the rules: All social gatherings are still banned, and all Nunavummiut, including those just returning to their home communities, are expected to do their part to keep Nunavut safe. Practice strict social distancing, stay home when possible, avoid contact with individuals outside of your household, and monitor your health.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Department of Health Services Isolation Sites Those in isolation have access to cable, internet, three meals a day, fresh linens and cleaning supplies.

This equipment will be used to test mine staff for COVID-19. At this time there is no evidence that screening in this fashion is a substitute for 14 days of isolation. This is why Nunavut, and every other Canadian jurisdiction, is using 14 days of isolation after exposure or travel. As a result, I have informed management of Agnico Eagle Mines that these tests do not change the current requirement for mine staff to stay out of the town of Rankin Inlet. The Department of Health is committed to improving and protecting the health of all Nunavummiut. For COVID-19 this means having testing equipment that meets Canadian standards and can be deployed to every community in Nunavut. The equipment used by AEM does not meet these criteria. If the Department of Health were to commit to using devices like this, we would not improve access to COVID testing for all Nunavummiut. The Department of Health continues to work on acquiring diagnostic capability that can be rapidly deployed and will provide quick access to results for all Nunavummiut. The combination of machines we continue to pursue will not only allow testing in all communities but will also improve our ability to rapidly diagnose a number of other infectious diseases that threaten Nunavummiut on a regular basis. Testing for COVID-19 at the wrong time can produce incorrect results and create a false sense of reassurance.     As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Department of Health Services The Public Health Emergency has been extended until April 16.

12,2020-09-21,Canada,Nunavut,,https://gov.nu.ca/health/news/confirmed-covid-19-case-mary-river-mine,Government Website,Confirmed COVID-19 case at Mary River Mine,"   21 September 2020News Release Confirmed COVID-19 case at Mary River Mine IQALUIT, Nunavut (September 21, 2020) – Dr. Michael Patterson, Nunavut’s Chief Public Health Officer, today announced a positive case of COVID-19 at the Mary River Mine 176 km southwest of Pond Inlet. The individual was not exposed to the virus in Nunavut and the case will count as a positive in the individual’s home jurisdiction. “The individual is currently in isolation and has not developed symptoms,” said Dr. Patterson. “The results were confirmed by the Hamilton Regional Laboratory today.” There is no evidence of transmission at Mary River Mine at this time. Nunavut’s Public Health team is ready to provide support and respond if, and when, it becomes necessary. “There are no Nunavut residents currently working at the Mary River Mine, and the risk of COVID-19 spreading in our communities due to this positive case is very low,” said Minister of Health George Hickes. “As always, we ask Nunavummiut to please remain vigilant in regular handwashing, maintaining physical distancing measures and staying home if you feel unwell.” The current public health measures, Nunavut’s Path and the Common Travel Areas with Churchill, Manitoba and the Northwest Territories remain unaffected. Symptoms of COVID-19 include a fever, cough or difficulty breathing. The best protection from spreading or catching the disease is physical distancing, handwashing for at least 20 seconds, coughing and sneezing into an elbow and staying home as much as possible. ### Media Contact: Cate Macleod 	Press Secretary to Premier Savikataaq 	867-975-5059cmacleod@gov.nu.ca Chris Puglia 	Acting Manager Communications 	Department of Health 	867-975-5949cpuglia@gov.nu.caDocument(s):  2020-09_nr35_hea_confirmed_covid-19_case_at_mary_river_mine_-_eng.pdf  "

Department of Community and Government Services - May 28, 2020 Minister of Community and Government Services update Ullaakkut, With the construction season upon us the Government of Nunavut (GN) has undertaken necessary preparations for construction projects to proceed during the summer and fall of 2020 in 19 Nunavut communities. This includes over 50 capital projects valued at approximately $600 million. Given the significant size of our construction program, we rely on a certain level of skilled workers from southern Canada to work on these projects alongside our Inuit and Northern labour. In consultation with Dr. Patterson, arrangements have been made to ensure that all southern workers comply with the strict requirement of the 14-day isolation period before travelling to Nunavut. The GN will control and monitor these measures at the isolation facilities in the south during the 14 days including up until workers board their flights. This follows the procedures for residents and medical travellers already in place. We need to balance the long-term infrastructure needs of communities with the current COVID-19 restrictions and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the municipalities, especially our mayors and councillors, for taking an active role in the decision to proceed with these projects during the 2020 construction season. I also would like to acknowledge the construction companies for their understanding of, and the need to respect, the directives set by Dr. Patterson to ensure that the construction projects move ahead with an understanding of maintaining the health and well-being of the workers and all Nunavummiut. Despite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are looking forward to a safe and productive construction season this summer. Thank you.   Department of Community and Government services - April 30, 2020  Critical services will be maintained in Pond Inlet, and plans are in place to ensure that access to services such as heat, power, water, sewer, and communications will not be interrupted. Community and Government Services (CGS), along with the municipality, has a plan in place for a water intake/pumping solution to ensure the community has ongoing access to water The temporary pumping system will include: A pump set up on the shore of the reservoir, Suction hose put through a drilled hole in the ice, A discharge hose to supply water into the back of the water truck, Manual chlorination into the back of the truck, and, The pump will be set up in a temporary porta-tank to provide containment for fuel refilling. 		  This solution can be managed by municipality staff. CGS is actively working on a permanent solution to be implemented later this summer. Department of Community and Government services - April 20, 2020  The Department of Community and Government services is providing an additional $2 million to municipalities to cover expenses related to COVID-19. This additional funding will ensure that hamlets are able to provide unforeseen services in response to the pandemic.  Eligible expenses include but are not limited to the purchase of cleaning materials, hiring additional staff, expenses for additional road clearing, by-law and enforcement patrols, and to cover lost revenues resulting from facility closures. Municipalities can contact their CGS regional community development office for more information.

14,2020-09-19,Canada,Nunavut,,https://gov.nu.ca/health/news/confirmed-covid-19-cases-hope-bay-mine,Government Website,Confirmed COVID-19 cases at Hope Bay Mine,"   19 September 2020News Release  Confirmed COVID-19 cases at Hope Bay Mine  IQALUIT, Nunavut (September 19, 2020) – Dr. Michael Patterson, Nunavut’s Chief Public Health Officer, today announced two positive cases of COVID-19 at the Hope Bay Mine 125 km southwest of Cambridge Bay. Both individuals were identified as having been exposed in their home jurisdiction. Although the exposure happened prior to travel, this was not identified until after they had arrived at the mine site. “Both miners are asymptomatic and were immediately isolated and swabbed for the virus,” said Dr. Patterson. “The samples tested positive on the GeneXpert device in Rankin Inlet late on September 16 and were confirmed by the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg today.” At this time, there is no evidence of transmission within the Hope Bay Mine site. Nunavut’s Public Health team is ready to provide support and respond if, and when necessary. “Hope Bay Mine is an isolated location, and no Nunavut residents currently work there. The risk of COVID-19 spreading in our communities because of these cases remains very low,” said Minister of Health George Hickes. “We are closely monitoring the situation and we will keep Nunavummiut informed if anything changes.” The current public health measures, Nunavut’s Path and the Common Travel Areas with Churchill, Manitoba and the Northwest Territories, are not affected. Symptoms of COVID-19 include a fever, cough or difficulty breathing. The best protection from spreading or catching the disease is physical distancing, handwashing for at least 20 seconds, coughing and sneezing into an elbow and staying home as much as possible. ### Media Contact:  Cate Macleod 	Press Secretary to Premier Savikataaq 	867-975-5059cmacleod@gov.nu.ca Chris Puglia 	Acting Manager Communications 	Department of Health 	867-975-5949cpuglia@gov.nu.ca 	 Document(s):  2020-09_nr34_hea_confirmed_covid-19_cases_at_hope_bay_mine_-_eng_.pdf  "

Department of Community and Government Services - May 28, 2020 Minister of Community and Government Services update Ullaakkut, With the construction season upon us the Government of Nunavut (GN) has undertaken necessary preparations for construction projects to proceed during the summer and fall of 2020 in 19 Nunavut communities. This includes over 50 capital projects valued at approximately $600 million. Given the significant size of our construction program, we rely on a certain level of skilled workers from southern Canada to work on these projects alongside our Inuit and Northern labour. In consultation with Dr. Patterson, arrangements have been made to ensure that all southern workers comply with the strict requirement of the 14-day isolation period before travelling to Nunavut. The GN will control and monitor these measures at the isolation facilities in the south during the 14 days including up until workers board their flights. This follows the procedures for residents and medical travellers already in place. We need to balance the long-term infrastructure needs of communities with the current COVID-19 restrictions and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the municipalities, especially our mayors and councillors, for taking an active role in the decision to proceed with these projects during the 2020 construction season. I also would like to acknowledge the construction companies for their understanding of, and the need to respect, the directives set by Dr. Patterson to ensure that the construction projects move ahead with an understanding of maintaining the health and well-being of the workers and all Nunavummiut. Despite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are looking forward to a safe and productive construction season this summer. Thank you.   Department of Community and Government services - April 30, 2020  Critical services will be maintained in Pond Inlet, and plans are in place to ensure that access to services such as heat, power, water, sewer, and communications will not be interrupted. Community and Government Services (CGS), along with the municipality, has a plan in place for a water intake/pumping solution to ensure the community has ongoing access to water The temporary pumping system will include: A pump set up on the shore of the reservoir, Suction hose put through a drilled hole in the ice, A discharge hose to supply water into the back of the water truck, Manual chlorination into the back of the truck, and, The pump will be set up in a temporary porta-tank to provide containment for fuel refilling. 		  This solution can be managed by municipality staff. CGS is actively working on a permanent solution to be implemented later this summer. Department of Community and Government services - April 20, 2020  The Department of Community and Government services is providing an additional $2 million to municipalities to cover expenses related to COVID-19. This additional funding will ensure that hamlets are able to provide unforeseen services in response to the pandemic.  Eligible expenses include but are not limited to the purchase of cleaning materials, hiring additional staff, expenses for additional road clearing, by-law and enforcement patrols, and to cover lost revenues resulting from facility closures. Municipalities can contact their CGS regional community development office for more information.

With the two-week period concluded, there is no longer a concern that those individuals contracted the virus. These past weeks we have continued to improve our capacity for in-territory testing. The Biofire device in Iqaluit is now operating alongside the GeneXpert machine. Aside from the need to have increased testing capacity in-territory, we also need to improve the turn around time for test results. This week, the Department of Health is starting a pilot project using charter aircraft to transport COVID-19 samples from Baffin communities to Iqaluit. The goal is to have a system in place that will reduce the test results turn around time to five days or less. Once the system is in place and working, we will begin the same process in Rankin Inlet. Increased in-territory testing capacity combined with shorter turnaround times for tests results, will give us more flexibility with our public health measures and improve our response in case of an outbreak. However, testing is not enough. As most people know, the Public Health strategy for minimizing the risks of COVID-19 entering and spreading in the territory relies on several measures. Testing is just one component. Physical distancing, good hygiene like washing our hands, staying home when sick and in the isolation hubs, work in tandem with testing and should not be underestimated. We should also keep in mind that our public health measures are effective only because Nunavummiut, individually and collectively, follow them. We have been effective so far in reducing the risks because each and everyone of us made the conscious choice to adopt and include these measures in our daily lives. Every time we choose to ignore these measures, the risk increases. While the risk can never be zero, we know that these measures are working. Nunavut remains COVID-free. We have seen decreases in respiratory illnesses this year across the territory. It is therefore vital that, individually and collectively, we continue to make the choice to follow public health measures and remain active participants in protecting our families and communities. Thank you   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  Public Health Emergency The Public Health Emergency was extended on Sept. 3 to and is in effect until Sept. 17.

The Government of Nunavut is managing several hubs, and dealing with a large number of requests from both medical and non-essential travellers. In an attempt to help clear up some of the delays to get into the hubs, Iqaluit is being looked at as one of several options to help relieve the wait time for medical travellers in Winnipeg. This has not been finalized and we are actively looking at the possibility of creating a second hub in Winnipeg, specifically for medical travellers. Our commitment is to ensure our medical travellers are well cared for and we are prioritizing their stays above non-essential travellers. We understand the concerns raised on social media over the weekend. However, nothing has been confirmed about an Iqaluit or additional Winnipeg hub. We recognize the fear and uncertainty that comes with COVID-19. However, we need to balance that fear with facts, the best possible care for Nunavummiut and our commitment to public health and safety. When there is an official course of action on this, we will announce it with all the relevant information. As we work to relieve this backlog, we thank those waiting for a spot in the isolation hubs for their patience and understanding.

On July 20, all licensed establishments in the territory will be allowed to open with regular hours. Nunavut will also be extending its common travel area to include Churchill, Manitoba. This bubble is exclusive to the community of Churchill and does not extend to other regions of Manitoba. The common travel area applies to air, land and water travel and exempts travellers from isolation requirements in either Nunavut or Churchill under certain conditions: Travel must originate from Nunavut to Churchill or from Churchill to Nunavut. Travellers must have not been outside either Churchill or Nunavut for 2 weeks prior to travelling. Travellers must remain in either Nunavut or Churchill for the duration of their stay. Prior to travelling outside of Nunavut, travellers must contact the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer for Nunavut and provide: Contact information, such as an address and phone number, at the person’s regular place of residence; and A written declaration that can be obtained by emailing CPHOtravelrequests@gov.nu.ca or by going to the Department of Health’s website. When travelling by air, travellers are required to obtain a letter from the CPHO authorizing travel or they will not be permitted to board their flight. Those who leave the common travel area outside of Churchill will need to isolate for 14 days at a government isolation facility, prior to returning to Nunavut. I would like to also take this opportunity to thank all Nunavummiut for their patience as we work together to protect our territory and families from COVID-19.

We are still waiting on confirmatory results for the presumptive case detected in the Mary River Mine, with the expectation that they will be ready sometime this week. The Department of Health continues to monitor the situation at the Mary River Mine site closely, and we will provide support as needed. I want to take this opportunity and remind Nunavummiut that: Testing is only one component of the Public Health response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Testing is important, but it is not a replacement for social distancing or hand-washing. Testing is important, but it is absolutely not a replacement for 14 days of isolation. The Government of Nunavut follows testing guidelines and best practices that have been endorsed by the World Health Organization and Health Canada. We rely on diagnostic devices that have undergone rigorous validation and accreditation processes to provide dependable testing to Nunavummiut. Even under ideal conditions, and with validated equipment, testing is not always a reliable method of identifying cases of COVID-19 and halting transmission. There is strong evidence that false negatives can occur throughout the incubation period. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the overarching goal of our public health response is to identify, contain and break transmission. The Government of Nunavut will continue to look at emerging evidence and best practices set out by public health authorities, both nationally and globally, to shape our response to COVID-19, and will alter public health measures as and when appropriate. Thank you. 			   			As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Today marks the third bi-weekly announcement for Nunavut’s Path for moving forward during COVID-19. There are still no cases of COVID-19 detected in the territory, so once again we are in a position to alter public health measures. I’m pleased to announce the following changes under the new Order Respecting Social Distancing and Gatherings, which goes into effect today: The limit for outdoor gatherings has now been increased to 50 people. The limit for indoor gatherings has been increased to 10 people. In private dwellings, this means 10 people in addition to those who reside there. The limit for gatherings at places of worship, conference facilities, community halls, rental meeting spaces, and gatherings organized by the Government of Canada, Government of Nunavut, municipal corporation, or Regional Inuit Organizations has been set at 50 people or 50% of capacity for the facility, whichever is less. In all facilities and gatherings, it is still expected that social distancing is maintained. As we take another step forward on Nunavut’s Path, and we return to some of the activities, programs, or venues that we’ve missed, we need to remain diligent in our collective commitment to practice social distancing and good hand hygiene. If you make the choice to participate in a large gathering, or attend an indoor event, or even meet up with friends for dinner, please also choose to be responsible, and choose to take actions that will keep yourself, your community, and your territory, safe. Wash your hands. Keep six feet away from others. Avoid touching your face. Sanitize high-touch areas often. Consider wearing a mask when social distancing is difficult. If you don’t feel well, stay home.

As of today, Nunavut is resuming regular medical travel to Churchill, Manitoba. As Churchill has not had a confirmed case of COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic, we have determined that the risk of resuming medical travel operations is minimal, and it is greatly outweighed by the benefits of ensuring that Nunavummiut have access to the out-of-territory care they need. Medical travellers and their escorts who travel to Churchill for treatment and do not leave the community for the duration of their stay, will be able to return directly to Nunavut without needing to isolate at a GN designated isolation facility. If the situation changes, we will re-assess and be ready to initiate contact tracing and containment measures immediately. We have also had some inquiries from cab companies regarding their operations. Under the new Order Regarding Social Distancing and Gatherings, cab companies can collect fares from multiple households at once, under specific conditions. Whenever there are multiple passengers in the cab, everyone must wear a mask. Cab drivers must provide masks for riders who do not have them. Most importantly, cab drivers must obtain consent from all passengers before picking up multiple fares. This means that any passenger who is picked up, and all subsequent fares on that ride, must indicate that they are okay with riding in a shared cab with others. All passengers can still request that they do not share their ride with others, and, for now, cab companies must comply with this request. We want to thank all cab companies who have so readily complied with recommendations to limit passenger travel and enhance sanitation procedures in order to keep Nunavummiut safe and healthy. Finally, as restaurants, bars, and other indoor locations are permitted to open, I want to continue to emphasize to Nunavummiut the necessity of social distancing, good hand hygiene, and staying home when we are sick. We need to remember, even as we return to the activities we enjoy, that this pandemic is far from over, and small actions from everyone today add up to major impacts tomorrow. Thank you.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  Calling Ahead at Health Centres Unless you are experiencing a medical emergency, please call your health centre first before going in.

I am pleased to say that after consultation with my counterpart in the GNWT, as of today, residents of the NWT can travel to Nunavut without isolating prior to arrival. The establishment of the common travel area by air or by land between the two territories does however come with strict conditions and expectations: Travel must originate from Nunavut to the NWT or from the NWT to Nunavut. Travellers have not been outside their respective territory for two weeks prior to their travel to the NWT or Nunavut. Travellers remain in either territory for the duration of their stay. Travellers from the NWT who wish to enter Nunavut, must write to: cphotravelrequests@gov.nu.ca and complete and sign the Nunavut and NWT Traveller’s Declaration form. Failure to do so will affect entry in Nunavut. Failure to answer truthfully will be subject to fines. This also applies for Nunavummiut who wish to return home after their stay in the NWT. My office will issue a letter of approval. Travellers will be required to present the approval letter prior to boarding any airplane entering Nunavut. Isolation before entering Nunavut is still required if You are a Nunavut resident who is returning home from travel in southern Canada via Yellowknife. In this case, you will need to complete a 14-day isolation period in the GN isolation hub in Yellowknife. You are an NWT resident who has travelled outside your territory less than two weeks before your scheduled arrival in Nunavut. In this case, you will need to complete the NWT isolation requirements before applying for travel to Nunavut. I want to re-assure Nunavummiut that should the current situation change in either territory, we will re-assess the common travel area and take all necessary measures to protect the health and safety of Nunavummiut. Further Information can be found in Travel and Isolation section of the Department of Health website at https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/travel-and-isolation. Today also marks the second of our bi-weekly announcements regarding the status of current health measures. Beginning June 22: Personal service providers will also be permitted to open for one-on-one sessions. This includes hairdressers and nail salons. Again, these facilities will be responsible for ensuring that PPE is available for both clients and service providers when requested. Bars and restaurants will be allowed to re-open and operate at half capacity. Last call for alcohol service will be at 9 p.m.. Facility operators need to ensure that patrons are respecting social distancing. Liquor Inspectors have the authority to enforce orders regarding social distancing, and they will be monitoring to ensure adherence to these conditions. Theatres and churches are also permitted to re-open on June 22. On June 29: Youth centres and day camps will be able to resume operations. Long-term care facilities will begin accepting visitors in a limited capacity; they can only allow one to two visitors per resident at a time, and these visitors can only be immediate family. Guidelines for re-opening will be available on the health website in the coming days. Though we can reasonably forecast what the next two weeks may bring, we must remain aware of the possible need to change or re-introduce public health measures. While we are in a position to ease restrictions, we remain vulnerable to the impacts of this global pandemic. Every week, new information becomes available. Every week, the situation can change. What doesn’t change is that social distancing, washing your hands and staying home when you are sick are the three main actions each and everyone of us can take to keep our families and our communities safe. Thank you.   	   	  As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  Calling Ahead at Health Centres Unless you are experiencing a medical emergency, please call your health centre first before going in.

Right now, travel into Nunavut represents the single biggest risk for introducing COVID-19. The travel ban, and the 14-day isolation requirements for returning Nunavummiut, are meant to mitigate this risk and keep our territory safe. Knowing that, I’d like to take this opportunity to share information on the new process being implemented for reserving stays in GN southern isolation facilities. Moving forward, all Nunavummiut who must travel outside of the territory should contact the email address NUisolationreservations@nunavutcare.ca and submit an Isolation Reservation Request Form as soon as they know their plans for travel. From there, the travel team will work to identify room availability and reserve your stay in one of the designated isolation facilities. This new streamlined process is meant to help Nunavummiut plan for their 14-day quarantine period farther in advance and ensures that our travel team can anticipate and accommodate travellers in the coming months. More information, including intake days requirements, can also be found on the Department of Health’s website. Remember, non-essential travel outside of the territory is still not recommended. All individuals who are applying for critical worker exemption will continue to use the email address CPHOTravelRequests@gov.nu.ca. Finally, the Department of Health has made temporary amendments to the Medical Travel Policy to help keep our medical travellers and escorts safe from COVID-19. Specific provisions have been added to ensure that medical travellers and escorts abide by rules of social distancing, hand-washing hygiene, and other behaviours that help to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The amendments also more clearly outline the requirements for both medical travellers and escorts to complete 14 days of self-isolation at a designated isolation facility prior to returning to Nunavut. As we continue to look at ways of easing public health measures and returning the activities we enjoy, we must remain diligent and aware that the threat of COVID-19 has not yet passed. Please continue to maintain physical distancing and handwashing practices, and limit any non-essential travel out of the territory.

This annual event highlights the health risks associated with tobacco use, and advocates for effective policies to reduce tobacco consumption. Right now, we are all working hard to commit to our public health measures that protect us from the threat of COVID-19. We are social distancing, staying home as much as possible, and washing our hands as much as we can. These actions are keeping ourselves, our communities, and our territory safe. Quitting tobacco use is one more step we can take to guard ourselves against the impact of this pandemic. We know that COVID-19 is mainly a respiratory virus, and early evidence suggests that smoking can make symptoms worse. Smokers are also likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19, as smoking increases the likelihood of transmission from one’s face and lips. Please remember: do not share cigarettes, joints, or pipes. Do not pick up discarded cigarette or cannabis butts. Wash your hands often, and refrain from touching your face. The best thing that we can do for our health is to quit smoking. By making the decision to quit smoking, we can help to protect ourselves from COVID-19 today, and dramatically improve our health for the coming weeks, months, and years. Support is available for anyone who wants to explore options to help them quit. Message a counsellor on the Tobacco Has No Place Here Facebook page or call 1-866-368-7848 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The service is private and free. Counsellors can help you in Inuktitut, English, Inuinnaqtun and French. Nicotine replacement therapy, or NRT, is also available at no cost through the Non-Insured Health Benefits program at your local health centre or pharmacy. Call ahead, and ask your health care provider for information and options for NRT. Thank you. Chief Public Health Officer update Good morning. Today marks the start of Nunavut’s Path forward. Day cares, territorial parks, and playgrounds are permitted to re-open, and the size limit for outdoor gatherings has been increased to 25. Today will also be the first of our bi-weekly assessments concerning the modification of public health measures. As we look at altering public health measures, I want to take a moment and emphasize to all Nunavummiut the continued importance of social distancing. While we are in a position today to alter measures, we are not in a position to take social distancing for granted. We’ve noticed through the contact tracing of persons under investigation that people’s contact bubbles are becoming noticeably larger. Larger contact bubbles will make it significantly more challenging to identify and prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. COVID-19 continues to pose a risk to Nunavummiut, and we are not immune to this pandemic. We’ve made it this far thanks to our collective efforts, but those efforts absolutely have to continue. With that said, I’m pleased to announce the following modifications to public health measures that will be occurring over the next two weeks. Effective immediately, in-territory travel advisories are lifted. Travel outside of Nunavut is still not recommended. Individuals who are travelling outside of the territory need to be aware not only of the isolation procedures to return, but also of the measures that other jurisdictions may have in place to limit or discourage travel. On June 8, workplaces and retail outlets are permitted to re-open, provided that they have safety measures in place. Galleries, museums, and libraries may also be opened for individual viewing and browsing, though group sessions are still prohibited. There will also be an increased availability of in-person health assessments at health centres across the territory. On June 15, dental clinics, physiotherapy clinics, massage therapy, and chiropractic treatments are permitted to resume. Gyms and pools will also be permitted to re-open for solo workouts and lap swimming only. Please note, that all these measures are subject to alteration should conditions change.

Department of Health Services, May 28, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update Good morning. I’d like to take this opportunity to clarify the conditions required in order for us to consider altering the current border measures in place. I have previously indicated that the border restrictions currently in place will likely be among the final public health measures that are lifted. This is because right now travel into Nunavut from outside of the territory represents the highest risk. If we want to continue Nunavut’s Path, and remove additional public health measures inside the territory, then we need to maintain our strict travel measures. This is our best chance to both return to the activities we enjoy and the programs we depend on, while still protecting the health and safety of Nunavummiut. With that said, fulfillment of any of the following conditions may influence decisions to alter our border measures. Development of a vaccine for COVID-19. We’ve already discussed this, and though it is unlikely that a vaccine will be developed and readily available in the near future, it is still a factor that would greatly influence all of our public health measures; Development or discovery of an effective treatment for COVID-19; Indication that COVID-19 is under control in our neighboring jurisdictions. This means that beyond just decreasing case numbers, we would need to see evidence that community transmission in neighboring jurisdictions is minimal and contained; And finally, achievement of sustainable and on-going diagnostic capacity in every community in Nunavut. Unfortunately, many of these factors are outside of our control, but we will continue to monitor the evolving global situation. As always, our decisions surrounding the border measures will be guided by evidence and will be designed to protect and preserve the health and safety of Nunavummiut throughout this global pandemic. I would like to remind Nunavummiut that as of Monday, June 1, playgrounds, territorial parks, and daycares are permitted to open, and the size of outdoor gatherings may increase to 25. On June 1, we will also begin our bi-weekly announcements on the assessment and potential easing of additional public health measures. The reason we have chosen two weeks as our interval of choice is straightforward. All evidence suggests that 14 days is the maximum incubation time for COVID-19. So, this 14-day window will give us an opportunity to assess the situation around us and make informed decisions based on the latest information available. Please remember that if a threat is detected, we may need to react immediately. We will provide as much warning as possible, but we may need to introduce additional public health measures right away. Finally, the Department is issuing a Public Health Advisory to the community of Sanikiluaq due to the detection of pertussis, also known as whooping cough. Whooping cough is a disease of the throat or lungs that is spread easily from person to person. Anyone can get whooping cough, but the most severe cases are in young children. For that reason, the daycare in Sanikiluaq must remain closed for the time being. Thank you.  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

These past two months have not been easy, and all Nunavummiut have had to make sacrifices. However, thanks to our combined efforts, we are protecting our families, our communities, and our territory from this pandemic, and I hope that all Nunavummiut can feel a sense of pride knowing that their actions are making a deep and measurable impact on keeping Nunavut healthy and safe. It is time for us to move forward. This does not mean that this pandemic is over. This does not mean that the threat has passed. This means that we can cautiously begin our return to the activities we enjoy, knowing that at any time we may need to change our behaviour to protect ourselves from emerging threats. In the coming weeks, we will work with our stakeholders to re-introduce our businesses, our activities, and our programs in a way that is safe, sustainable, and poses the least risk to the health and safety of Nunavummiut. Know that as we begin to loosen restrictions internally, it is imperative that our strict border measures remain to minimize the risk of introducing COVID-19 into the territory. With that being said, I’m pleased to announce that as of June 1: Daycares will be permitted to open up for regular business. The size limit for outdoor gatherings will increase to 25 people. Territorial parks will be allowed to reopen for outdoor activities only, if local circumstances permit. All park buildings will remain closed. Municipal playgrounds will be allowed to re-open, again, if local circumstances permit. These particular conditions have been selected because they are deemed low risk. Moving forward, our plan is to re-assess our condition every two weeks. If the state of COVID in Nunavut is favorable, we will continue to lift public health measures, beginning with lower risk activities and programs. If our condition is stable, we may remain at the status quo until we are confident that lifting additional restrictions would not pose an undue risk to Nunavummiut. Finally, if the threat of COVID-19 increases, or eased public health measures are posing a potential public health threat to the territory, we may need to introduce or re-introduce certain conditions. I share in everyone’s desire to return to normal. We all want to know when we can confidently and safely travel within our own territory, or to our neighbouring jurisdictions. However, trying to forecast specific dates and timelines for when we can lift all of our public health measures would be inaccurate, and frankly, it would be insincere. The COVID-19 pandemic is evolving rapidly, and every single week yields new information that shapes our strategy and our public health measures. Predictions and decisions made on the basis of today’s understanding of the virus may be obsolete in a short time. For this reason, we have opted for an approach that is flexible, cautious, and adaptive to the evolving situation around us. Again, I want to thank all Nunavummiut for their continued patience and understanding. No one is left unaffected by this pandemic, but our collective accountability has kept Nunavut safe so far. This accountability and responsibility needs to continue, and, as we loosen restrictions, we must continue to practice social distancing, stay away from others when we are sick and wash our hands often.

I am pleased to announce several items today. The first is that Rankin Inlet now has the ability to provide testing if a positive case is confirmed in-territory. I’d like to commend the medical and laboratory staff, especially Matt Stacey and Dr. Jasmine Pawa, who have been working tirelessly to become acquainted with the GeneXpert machine, and to ensure that it can be managed safely, efficiently, and accurately. Getting this machine up and running is a significant step forward for Nunavut, as this now fulfills our criteria of obtaining reliable and effective in-territory diagnostic capacity. When coupled with the fact that we still have no confirmed cases of COVID-19 inside the territory, we have now met two of our three conditions. While the situation in southern Canada will continue to play a role in our approach moving forward, we are now in a better position to consider reducing some restrictions in the territory. I have one other piece of news I would like to share. Moving forward, Kitikmeot medical travellers receiving treatment in Yellowknife are no longer required to undergo the 14-day isolation period, and instead will be permitted to return home immediately. This decision has been made through consultation with the Northwest Territories and is contingent on there being no active cases of COVID-19 in the NWT. Please note that this is for medical travellers only, and this is only when their treatment is provided in Yellowknife. Any medical traveller who needs to leave the Northwest Territories to receive treatment in other cities in Canada will still be required to complete their 14-day isolation period. For all medical travellers to whom this new rule applies who are currently in quarantine, we are working to get you home as soon as possible. As always, our main goal is the safety, health and well being of Nunavummiut. I would like to thank you all for your patience, understanding and support as we continue to care for our families and our communities.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, May 8, 2020 Minister of Health update: It was announced at the start of this year by the World Health Organization that all of 2020 was to be recognized as the Year of the Nurse and the Midwife. This was an opportunity to celebrate the vital role of nurses and midwives in the delivery of health care services across the world. Several months later, in the midst of this global pandemic, we are not just talking about their essential role in keeping us healthy, we are experiencing it firsthand. Nurses and midwives continue to deliver vital health care services in our territory, in our country, and throughout the world. May 11 to 17 is recognized as National Nursing Week. As our nurses work tirelessly to ensure that Nunavummiut have access to the care they need, I think it’s important that we all take this opportunity to show them our immense gratitude for their service and their contribution to this territory. Nunavut has more than 300 nurses who are essential to the development and delivery of programs that keep Nunavummiut healthy. In these uncertain times, as the world battles COVID-19, our nurses are on the front line, providing care to those who need it most. This pandemic has demonstrated our nurses’ willingness to put their own health and safety at risk to protect and care for those around them. This National Nursing Week, and indeed this entire Year of The Nurse and Midwife, give us an opportunity to shine a spotlight on these essential health staff. However, our gratitude for your service is not restricted to a single week, or a single year. I would like all Nunavummiut to join me in showing our ongoing appreciation for your continued dedication to this territory. Thank you.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, May 6, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update: Since it was confirmed that the detected COVID case in Nunavut was a false positive, the territory has witnessed great displays of solidarity, support, and pride. The additional restrictions in Pond Inlet have been lifted, and I hope that the community feels a measure of relief knowing that they are still COVID-free. This is good news. As a territory, we have done well so far. However, we cannot allow our celebration to lapse into complacency. It is more important than ever that we maintain these rules that we’ve all become familiar with. The threat of COVID-19 is still very real and we need to stay the course. Practise social distancing. Avoid contact with individuals who are not a member of your household. Limit trips for errands. Purchase only the supplies that your household needs. And, of course, wash your hands. There is no combination of measures that can absolutely guarantee the prevention of COVID-19. Even as we celebrate for Pond Inlet, all Nunavummiut need to remain vigilant and cautious. Follow the rules, and encourage your friends, family, and neighbours to do the same. I want to thank all Nunavummiut for their continued patience, understanding, and cooperation. We can only get through this together.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Travel outside the territory as of May 7, 2020: The Government of Nunavut’s decision to charge $2,100 per individual and $1,050 for each additional family member during the mandatory 14-day isolation stays for residents returning to the territory has been reversed. The Government of Nunavut will continue to cover these costs as long as mandatory isolation for residents returning to the territory is in place. Please keep in mind that travel outside of Nunavut during the COVID-19 pandemic is not advised.    Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

This means that although the first test result showed COVID-19 infection, further investigation and testing have not shown any other evidence of COVID-19 infection in Pond Inlet. As I have previously mentioned, no lab test is perfect. There is always a chance of false positive or false negative results. When interpreting results and deciding on an appropriate course of action, we consider many pieces of information, of which test results are just one piece. We always aim to err on the side of caution. Diagnostic tests are part of an entire system of measures to intervene on COVID-19 infection. In these circumstances the test gave an incorrect result, but the rest of the system (public health nurses, contact tracing, surveillance) have not identified any other cases of COVID-19 infection. The information available so far includes: The individual involved has not been outside of Pond Inlet for some time. We have not identified an exposure to COVID-19. We have not found any other cases of COVID-19 in Pond Inlet. We have not noticed any increase in significant respiratory infections. 		  For all of the reasons above we believe that the individual in Pond Inlet does not, and never did have COVID-19. As a result, our rapid response team will stop operating in Pond Inlet and the members of the team will begin preparing for future deployments. All territorial orders under the Public Health Emergency remain in effect. However, the additional measures specific to Pond Inlet as a result of the positive COVID-19 case are now lifted. Effective immediately, travel between Pond Inlet and other Nunavut communities may resume, and the community-specific restrictions on businesses and services in Pond Inlet are also rescinded.      Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

The Rapid Response Team is in the community, and they are implementing containment and contact tracing. As the team completes additional testing, there is the possibility that more positive cases may be confirmed in the community. This does not necessarily mean that there is community transmission and should not be cause for alarm. What this does mean is that the Rapid Response Team is doing their job, which is finding the virus and stopping it from spreading. Containment is key, and right now it is our top priority. As this process takes place, the Government of Nunavut will continue to support the community of Pond Inlet. I also want to take a moment and thank the municipality of Pond Inlet and its residents for allowing me to answer their questions earlier today on the community radio. Moving forward, I would like to remind all Nunavummiut, using the strongest possible terms, that every single social interaction carries a degree of risk. Despite all of the Government of Nunavut’s preventative measures, and the new containment measures now in place within Pond Inlet, it is impossible to reasonably predict where or when COVID-19 may be detected next. I urge all Nunavummiut to exercise a high degree of caution, and to seriously consider these risks before participating in a gathering of any kind. If you deem it necessary to participate in gatherings, then please keep track of the people with whom you interact, as this information may be necessary in case contact tracing needs to be conducted in your community. Health staff cannot get us through this alone. How well we do, and where we go from here, depends on the actions of every single Nunavummiut. Right now, the best way of slowing the spread of COVID-19 continues to be through social distancing and effective hygiene. If everyone follows these rules together, we can put ourselves in the best position to make it through this uncertain time. It’s more important than ever that we be careful, responsible, kind, and supportive. I’d like to thank Nunavummiut for their continued cooperation and understanding. As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Travel outside the territory as of May 7, 2020 Starting May 7, 2020, Nunavummiut who chose to travel outside Nunavut while the CPHO’s travel ban is still in effect will have to cover the costs of their 14-day isolation period in one of the Government of Nunavut’s isolation sites. The fee for a single individual in a room is $2,100 for the 14-day period, and each additional family member in the room will pay $1,050. Updates will be provided as they become available. 		   Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, April 30, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update As you have seen and heard, today we have announced that a case of COVID-19 has been detected within Pond Inlet. Since the onset of the pandemic, we knew that no combination of preventative measures can absolutely guarantee the prevention of COVID-19. We anticipated that sooner or later the virus would be detected in the territory. Just as we have poured extensive effort into our prevention plan, so too have we developed a comprehensive response plan to minimize, to the greatest possible extent, the impact that COVID-19 has on Nunavut. We have been in contact with hamlet authorities and have initiated our Rapid Response Plan. A Rapid Response Team has already been deployed to Pond Inlet and is scheduled to arrive early this afternoon. That team will immediately initiate containment measures, begin contact tracing, and monitor the health and well-being of persons on home isolation orders. The Pond Inlet Health Centre is well-staffed and prepared, and health centre operations will continue. All passenger travel in and out of Pond Inlet has ceased. This includes any movement in or out of the community by land travel. This travel ban is a necessary containment measure to minimize the risk of COVID-19 spreading to multiple communities at once. Until we have determined the potential spread of the virus within the community, all non-essential offices and services will be closed. There is to be no social gatherings within dwellings, and all residents of Pond Inlet are asked to continue to maintain social distancing and good hygiene. For residents of Pond Inlet, we recognize that this news may be frightening. However, the Government of Nunavut would like to assure everyone that although travel is restricted, you are not cut off from help and support. Critical services will be maintained, and plans are in place to ensure that access to services such as heat, power, water, sewer, and communications will not be interrupted. Our primary focus now is to detect and contain the virus to prevent further transmission within the community and to other communities. Anyone who has reason to believe that they have been exposed to the virus is advised to call the COVID-19 hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. or 6 p.m. or call your community health centre. Please, do not go to the health centre in person unless you are instructed to by a health official. To all Nunavummiut, know that the preventative measures that we have all been taking are more important now than ever. Everyone needs to practise social distancing, stay home whenever possible, and avoid contact with those who are not a member of your household. Together, our efforts can slow the spread of COVID-19. Finally, I remind everyone of the importance of kindness. Now is not the time for blame, or shame. It is the time for compassion, empathy, and support of your fellow Nunavummiut. The Government of Nunavut thanks all Nunavummiut for their efforts to date. We will continue to exhaust all efforts to contain the virus, and minimize its impact on Pond Inlet, and on all the territory. Only together can we all protect our territory from the threat of COVID-19.    Department of Health Services  Residents of Pond Inlet must call their health centre first. All regular appointments at the Pond Inlet Health Centre have been cancelled. Only emergency services are available.  COVID-19 Hotline and self-assessment tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or call their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days. Nunavummiut can also use the self-assessment tool available at www.gov.nu.ca COMMUNITY TRAVEL AND GATHERINGS RESTRICTION ORDER POND INLET All travel to and from Pond Inlet is banned except: People with a letter from the CPHO Medevac patients Flight crews Nunavut Inuit exercising their hunting rights as set out in Article 5 may leave and return to Pond Inlet but not travel to any other community People travelling on a flight which must land in Pond Inlet due to weather or emergency Medevac crews must restrict movements to the airport and the health centre and must wear personal protective equipment. All businesses operating in Pond Inlet must close except for: Grocery stores Fuel and motor vehicle stations Post office Restaurants open for take out service All social gatherings shall be restricted to five persons or fewer. No social gatherings in dwellings. The order can be consulted at:https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/covid-19-novel-coronavirus   Department of Health Services, April 29, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update As many of you may know, some jurisdictions in Canada have started or will soon begin a gradual lifting of the restrictions they have implemented to flatten the COVID curve. Today I’d like to speak in more detail about what needs to happen before we can do the same. There are three conditions that need to be met before we can consider relaxing existing restrictions in the territory. They are as follows: We need to achieve in-territory diagnostic capacity. This means that we need to be able to implement a rapid, accurate, and comprehensive COVID-19 testing program here in Nunavut; There needs to be significant indication that rates of COVID-19 are decreasing in the southern jurisdictions to which Nunavummiut most often travel; and There needs to remain no active cases of COVID-19 within Nunavut. The nature of these conditions means that it is difficult to assign a specific timeline to re-opening, but fulfillment of these conditions is necessary to minimize risk to public health and safety. We need to know that Nunavummiut travelling outside of the territory can do so safely, and we need to be able to respond rapidly to any confirmed cases of COVID-19 within Nunavut. I know that people are eager to go back to work, visit loved ones, and engage in social activities. However, if we lift these restrictions too early, we will increase the risk to Nunavummiut. If we aren’t careful about how we transition back from these restrictions, then we could effectively undo all the hard work and sacrifices that we’ve made over the past seven weeks. It is as important as ever that we stay the course: maintain social distancing, stay home whenever possible, and wash your hands often. These measures continue to be the best defence against COVID-19, and the best way to protect our families, our communities, and our territory.   Department of Health Services Access to health care services will remain available in all communities seven days a week. All non-urgent requests will be triaged daily. Immediate access to urgent and emergent health care services are and will continue to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. All clients are asked to call before presenting at a health facility. In Iqaluit, public health, the emergency room and inpatient unit will remain open. Well baby clinics, prenatal visits and immunizations are continuing across Nunavut. Physicians will continue community visits. If this is not possible, the visits will be conducted by telehealth or by phone.   Volumes  Total (All Isolation Locations)   Traveler Type   Guests in Isolation as of April 28   Medical Travel   206   Public   136   Total   342    Traveller repatriation summary:  Departure Date   # of Travellers from Isolation Sites   April 29   38   April 30   15   May 1   19   May 2   6   May 3   14    Critical Worker Requests As of April 28, there are 786 requests, 597 of which are critical worker requests.

The new order adds clarity around gatherings and social distancing and provides easy to understand scenarios that will help Nunavummiut more easily follow the order. It will also help businesses understand how to adjust their operations to ensure public safety and continued operation. Finally, the changes will also assist law enforcement and peace officers to more easily interpret the intent of the order in the unlikely event there is a need for enforcement. I’d like to outline some of the new definitions and information provided in the new order. Food service establishments and licensed premises remain closed. Restaurants can still provide options for take-out or delivery, as long as they abide by the rules of social distancing while doing so. All businesses deemed as Personal Service Providers must also remain closed. These include hair dressing, barbering, massage therapy, and other similar establishments. Additionally, dentists, veterinarians, and psychologists must remain closed, except for emergencies. Public playgrounds, municipal parks, and day-use areas of territorial parks also remain closed. Though still subject to closures and limitations, the following businesses are permitted to remain open: any business large enough to maintain a two-metre social distance within the workplace, or businesses that limit customers to no more than five at a time. The five-at-a-time rule does not apply to businesses that are large enough to maintain social distancing throughout the entire premise, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and similar facilities. The order provides a definition to gatherings. All organized public gatherings of more than five people remain prohibited. This includes concerts, community events, sporting events, and ceremonies such as marriages, funerals, or memorial services. Finally, all social gatherings, including social gatherings in private dwellings, shall be restricted to five persons or fewer. This includes play groups, club meetings, and meals with individuals who do not reside together. This new order does not mean that restrictions are being loosened, or that the Government of Nunavut has re-assessed the territory’s position or tolerance for risk. Instead, the definitions under this new order have been aligned with definitions being applied in other jurisdictions. This makes restrictive measures clearer and more consistent in their application and enforcement. It is strongly recommended that Nunavummiut limit contact with anyone who is not a member of their immediate household. Any social gathering carries a degree of risk, especially when we are looking at individuals from multiple different households mingling together. Nunavummiut must still exercise caution at all times, practise social distancing to the greatest extent possible, and wash hands and all shared surfaces thoroughly and often. The previous order met the intended purpose of providing necessary tools to help protect public health. However, The Government of Nunavut recognized the need to provide clearer language and definitions. For this reason, the Department of Justice worked with the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) to prepare a new Order to ensure the language is clear and understandable while remaining true to its intent.

This resource is user-friendly, available in all four official languages, and can be accessed through the Government of Nunavut webpage at https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/covid-19-novel-coronavirus. The purpose of this self-assessment tool is to provide Nunavummiut with real-time information and recommendations based on self-reported symptoms or recent travel history. The tool will help Nunavummiut determine whether they should self-isolate, and when they should contact a health care service provider for additional follow-up or testing. This tool is meant to supplement the existing resources that are already available, and it is not a replacement for social distancing and good hygiene, such as washing regularly. Mass gatherings are still banned, and everyone is still required to follow the rules. Nunavummiut who don’t have access to online resources but believe that they are displaying COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, are encouraged to call the COVID Hotline at 1-888-975-8601. You can also ask someone with internet access to complete the self-assessment on your behalf by sharing with them your travel history and any symptoms that you may be experiencing.

This means that many Nunavummiut currently in the south are coming to the end of their mandatory 14-day isolation periods. It is time for many of these residents to return home. The mandatory rules we put in place in our isolation sites are very strict. I think it is important to remind everyone that for 14 days, residents are: Confined in their hotel rooms most of the day. Have no physical contact with other residents undergoing isolation and no physical contact with the general population. Are allowed only monitored outings on hotel grounds. Must have daily health check-ins with on-site nurses. Are held responsible if they break isolation. There are no exceptions. These measures are a first step and they ensure Nunavummiut who want to come home, as well as their families and communities, remain healthy and safe. The second step is bringing residents home. I want to take a moment and outline this process: 48 hours before anticipated departure, travellers are informed on the clearance and travel process. The day before departure, the nurses on-site review each traveller’s daily check-in logs to make sure they complied with the isolation rules. The nurses conduct a final in-person assessment to ensure travellers are healthy and show no symptoms of COVID-19. The assessments and results are sent to my office – and a decision to clear a traveller for the scheduled return home is made and a letter approving travel is issued. Residents need both the letter and a proof of residency to return to the territory. The day of departure, residents approved for travel are transported from the hotel to the airport via a private shuttle, sanitized thoroughly before use. The Government of Nunavut worked with airlines to minimize, to the greatest possible extent, the risk of anyone being exposed to COVID-19 during their travel back to the territory. Airports have enhanced cleaning, sanitation and passenger procedures throughout the check-in and security process that ensure physical distancing. As an additional precaution, residents will also undergo an airline health check prior to boarding. Until they arrive at their final destination in Nunavut, residents remain bound by the isolation agreement they signed the day they accepted to enter the isolation sites. Residents will travel to Nunavut on both chartered and scheduled flights: Residents travelling on chartered flights are shuttled directly to their airplane for boarding and take-off. Once in Nunavut, they will be chartered to their final in-territory destination. Residents travelling on scheduled flights are dropped off at the airport, where they are met and guided by airline employees to check-in, through security, to the boarding area and finally on the plane. They do not come in contact with other travellers during this process and remain bound by their isolation agreement. I want to thank our returning residents for going through these drastic measures to protect their communities and Nunavut. As we welcome back friends, family members, and loved ones, it is more important than ever to follow the rules: All social gatherings are still banned, and all Nunavummiut, including those just returning to their home communities, are expected to do their part to keep Nunavut safe. Practice strict social distancing, stay home when possible, avoid contact with individuals outside of your household, and monitor your health.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Department of Health Services Isolation Sites Those in isolation have access to cable, internet, three meals a day, fresh linens and cleaning supplies.

This equipment will be used to test mine staff for COVID-19. At this time there is no evidence that screening in this fashion is a substitute for 14 days of isolation. This is why Nunavut, and every other Canadian jurisdiction, is using 14 days of isolation after exposure or travel. As a result, I have informed management of Agnico Eagle Mines that these tests do not change the current requirement for mine staff to stay out of the town of Rankin Inlet. The Department of Health is committed to improving and protecting the health of all Nunavummiut. For COVID-19 this means having testing equipment that meets Canadian standards and can be deployed to every community in Nunavut. The equipment used by AEM does not meet these criteria. If the Department of Health were to commit to using devices like this, we would not improve access to COVID testing for all Nunavummiut. The Department of Health continues to work on acquiring diagnostic capability that can be rapidly deployed and will provide quick access to results for all Nunavummiut.

Department of Community and Government Services - May 28, 2020 Minister of Community and Government Services update Ullaakkut, With the construction season upon us the Government of Nunavut (GN) has undertaken necessary preparations for construction projects to proceed during the summer and fall of 2020 in 19 Nunavut communities. This includes over 50 capital projects valued at approximately $600 million. Given the significant size of our construction program, we rely on a certain level of skilled workers from southern Canada to work on these projects alongside our Inuit and Northern labour. In consultation with Dr. Patterson, arrangements have been made to ensure that all southern workers comply with the strict requirement of the 14-day isolation period before travelling to Nunavut. The GN will control and monitor these measures at the isolation facilities in the south during the 14 days including up until workers board their flights. This follows the procedures for residents and medical travellers already in place. We need to balance the long-term infrastructure needs of communities with the current COVID-19 restrictions and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the municipalities, especially our mayors and councillors, for taking an active role in the decision to proceed with these projects during the 2020 construction season. I also would like to acknowledge the construction companies for their understanding of, and the need to respect, the directives set by Dr. Patterson to ensure that the construction projects move ahead with an understanding of maintaining the health and well-being of the workers and all Nunavummiut. Despite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are looking forward to a safe and productive construction season this summer. Thank you.   Department of Community and Government services - April 30, 2020  Critical services will be maintained in Pond Inlet, and plans are in place to ensure that access to services such as heat, power, water, sewer, and communications will not be interrupted. Community and Government Services (CGS), along with the municipality, has a plan in place for a water intake/pumping solution to ensure the community has ongoing access to water The temporary pumping system will include: A pump set up on the shore of the reservoir, Suction hose put through a drilled hole in the ice, A discharge hose to supply water into the back of the water truck, Manual chlorination into the back of the truck, and, The pump will be set up in a temporary porta-tank to provide containment for fuel refilling. 		  This solution can be managed by municipality staff. CGS is actively working on a permanent solution to be implemented later this summer. Department of Community and Government services - April 20, 2020  The Department of Community and Government services is providing an additional $2 million to municipalities to cover expenses related to COVID-19. This additional funding will ensure that hamlets are able to provide unforeseen services in response to the pandemic.  Eligible expenses include but are not limited to the purchase of cleaning materials, hiring additional staff, expenses for additional road clearing, by-law and enforcement patrols, and to cover lost revenues resulting from facility closures. Municipalities can contact their CGS regional community development office for more information.

18,2020-09-08,Canada,Nunavut,,https://gov.nu.ca/health/news/covid-19-department-health-services-update,Government Website,COVID-19 Department of Health Services update,"   08 September 2020       Department of Health Services, September 8, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update Good morning, This past weekend marked the end of the14-day period for the 23 people identified as contacts of a positive case of COVID 19 at the Ottawa Residence Inn. With the two-week period concluded, there is no longer a concern that those individuals contracted the virus. These past weeks we have continued to improve our capacity for in-territory testing. The Biofire device in Iqaluit is now operating alongside the GeneXpert machine. Aside from the need to have increased testing capacity in-territory, we also need to improve the turn around time for test results. This week, the Department of Health is starting a pilot project using charter aircraft to transport COVID-19 samples from Baffin communities to Iqaluit. The goal is to have a system in place that will reduce the test results turn around time to five days or less. Once the system is in place and working, we will begin the same process in Rankin Inlet. Increased in-territory testing capacity combined with shorter turnaround times for tests results, will give us more flexibility with our public health measures and improve our response in case of an outbreak. However, testing is not enough. As most people know, the Public Health strategy for minimizing the risks of COVID-19 entering and spreading in the territory relies on several measures. Testing is just one component. Physical distancing, good hygiene like washing our hands, staying home when sick and in the isolation hubs, work in tandem with testing and should not be underestimated. We should also keep in mind that our public health measures are effective only because Nunavummiut, individually and collectively, follow them. We have been effective so far in reducing the risks because each and everyone of us made the conscious choice to adopt and include these measures in our daily lives. Every time we choose to ignore these measures, the risk increases. While the risk can never be zero, we know that these measures are working. Nunavut remains COVID-free. We have seen decreases in respiratory illnesses this year across the territory. It is therefore vital that, individually and collectively, we continue to make the choice to follow public health measures and remain active participants in protecting our families and communities. Thank you   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  Public Health Emergency The Public Health Emergency was extended on Sept. 3 to and is in effect until Sept. 17.

The Government of Nunavut is managing several hubs, and dealing with a large number of requests from both medical and non-essential travellers. In an attempt to help clear up some of the delays to get into the hubs, Iqaluit is being looked at as one of several options to help relieve the wait time for medical travellers in Winnipeg. This has not been finalized and we are actively looking at the possibility of creating a second hub in Winnipeg, specifically for medical travellers. Our commitment is to ensure our medical travellers are well cared for and we are prioritizing their stays above non-essential travellers. We understand the concerns raised on social media over the weekend. However, nothing has been confirmed about an Iqaluit or additional Winnipeg hub. We recognize the fear and uncertainty that comes with COVID-19. However, we need to balance that fear with facts, the best possible care for Nunavummiut and our commitment to public health and safety. When there is an official course of action on this, we will announce it with all the relevant information. As we work to relieve this backlog, we thank those waiting for a spot in the isolation hubs for their patience and understanding. We are working around the clock to keep our territory and Nunavummiut safe. Thanks to all the staff who have worked so hard to keep everyone well during COVID-19.

On July 20, all licensed establishments in the territory will be allowed to open with regular hours. Nunavut will also be extending its common travel area to include Churchill, Manitoba. This bubble is exclusive to the community of Churchill and does not extend to other regions of Manitoba. The common travel area applies to air, land and water travel and exempts travellers from isolation requirements in either Nunavut or Churchill under certain conditions: Travel must originate from Nunavut to Churchill or from Churchill to Nunavut. Travellers must have not been outside either Churchill or Nunavut for 2 weeks prior to travelling. Travellers must remain in either Nunavut or Churchill for the duration of their stay. Prior to travelling outside of Nunavut, travellers must contact the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer for Nunavut and provide: Contact information, such as an address and phone number, at the person’s regular place of residence; and A written declaration that can be obtained by emailing CPHOtravelrequests@gov.nu.ca or by going to the Department of Health’s website. When travelling by air, travellers are required to obtain a letter from the CPHO authorizing travel or they will not be permitted to board their flight. Those who leave the common travel area outside of Churchill will need to isolate for 14 days at a government isolation facility, prior to returning to Nunavut. I would like to also take this opportunity to thank all Nunavummiut for their patience as we work together to protect our territory and families from COVID-19.

We are still waiting on confirmatory results for the presumptive case detected in the Mary River Mine, with the expectation that they will be ready sometime this week. The Department of Health continues to monitor the situation at the Mary River Mine site closely, and we will provide support as needed. I want to take this opportunity and remind Nunavummiut that: Testing is only one component of the Public Health response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Testing is important, but it is not a replacement for social distancing or hand-washing. Testing is important, but it is absolutely not a replacement for 14 days of isolation. The Government of Nunavut follows testing guidelines and best practices that have been endorsed by the World Health Organization and Health Canada. We rely on diagnostic devices that have undergone rigorous validation and accreditation processes to provide dependable testing to Nunavummiut. Even under ideal conditions, and with validated equipment, testing is not always a reliable method of identifying cases of COVID-19 and halting transmission. There is strong evidence that false negatives can occur throughout the incubation period. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the overarching goal of our public health response is to identify, contain and break transmission. The Government of Nunavut will continue to look at emerging evidence and best practices set out by public health authorities, both nationally and globally, to shape our response to COVID-19, and will alter public health measures as and when appropriate.

I’m pleased to announce the following changes under the new Order Respecting Social Distancing and Gatherings, which goes into effect today: The limit for outdoor gatherings has now been increased to 50 people. The limit for indoor gatherings has been increased to 10 people. In private dwellings, this means 10 people in addition to those who reside there. The limit for gatherings at places of worship, conference facilities, community halls, rental meeting spaces, and gatherings organized by the Government of Canada, Government of Nunavut, municipal corporation, or Regional Inuit Organizations has been set at 50 people or 50% of capacity for the facility, whichever is less. In all facilities and gatherings, it is still expected that social distancing is maintained. As we take another step forward on Nunavut’s Path, and we return to some of the activities, programs, or venues that we’ve missed, we need to remain diligent in our collective commitment to practice social distancing and good hand hygiene. If you make the choice to participate in a large gathering, or attend an indoor event, or even meet up with friends for dinner, please also choose to be responsible, and choose to take actions that will keep yourself, your community, and your territory, safe. Wash your hands. Keep six feet away from others. Avoid touching your face. Sanitize high-touch areas often. Consider wearing a mask when social distancing is difficult. If you don’t feel well, stay home. Thank you. 			   			As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  Calling Ahead at Health Centres Unless you are experiencing a medical emergency, please call your health centre first before going in.

As of today, Nunavut is resuming regular medical travel to Churchill, Manitoba. As Churchill has not had a confirmed case of COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic, we have determined that the risk of resuming medical travel operations is minimal, and it is greatly outweighed by the benefits of ensuring that Nunavummiut have access to the out-of-territory care they need. Medical travellers and their escorts who travel to Churchill for treatment and do not leave the community for the duration of their stay, will be able to return directly to Nunavut without needing to isolate at a GN designated isolation facility. If the situation changes, we will re-assess and be ready to initiate contact tracing and containment measures immediately. We have also had some inquiries from cab companies regarding their operations. Under the new Order Regarding Social Distancing and Gatherings, cab companies can collect fares from multiple households at once, under specific conditions. Whenever there are multiple passengers in the cab, everyone must wear a mask. Cab drivers must provide masks for riders who do not have them. Most importantly, cab drivers must obtain consent from all passengers before picking up multiple fares. This means that any passenger who is picked up, and all subsequent fares on that ride, must indicate that they are okay with riding in a shared cab with others. All passengers can still request that they do not share their ride with others, and, for now, cab companies must comply with this request. We want to thank all cab companies who have so readily complied with recommendations to limit passenger travel and enhance sanitation procedures in order to keep Nunavummiut safe and healthy. Finally, as restaurants, bars, and other indoor locations are permitted to open, I want to continue to emphasize to Nunavummiut the necessity of social distancing, good hand hygiene, and staying home when we are sick. We need to remember, even as we return to the activities we enjoy, that this pandemic is far from over, and small actions from everyone today add up to major impacts tomorrow.

I am pleased to say that after consultation with my counterpart in the GNWT, as of today, residents of the NWT can travel to Nunavut without isolating prior to arrival. The establishment of the common travel area by air or by land between the two territories does however come with strict conditions and expectations: Travel must originate from Nunavut to the NWT or from the NWT to Nunavut. Travellers have not been outside their respective territory for two weeks prior to their travel to the NWT or Nunavut. Travellers remain in either territory for the duration of their stay. Travellers from the NWT who wish to enter Nunavut, must write to: cphotravelrequests@gov.nu.ca and complete and sign the Nunavut and NWT Traveller’s Declaration form. Failure to do so will affect entry in Nunavut. Failure to answer truthfully will be subject to fines. This also applies for Nunavummiut who wish to return home after their stay in the NWT. My office will issue a letter of approval. Travellers will be required to present the approval letter prior to boarding any airplane entering Nunavut. Isolation before entering Nunavut is still required if You are a Nunavut resident who is returning home from travel in southern Canada via Yellowknife. In this case, you will need to complete a 14-day isolation period in the GN isolation hub in Yellowknife. You are an NWT resident who has travelled outside your territory less than two weeks before your scheduled arrival in Nunavut. In this case, you will need to complete the NWT isolation requirements before applying for travel to Nunavut. I want to re-assure Nunavummiut that should the current situation change in either territory, we will re-assess the common travel area and take all necessary measures to protect the health and safety of Nunavummiut. Further Information can be found in Travel and Isolation section of the Department of Health website at https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/travel-and-isolation. Today also marks the second of our bi-weekly announcements regarding the status of current health measures. Beginning June 22: Personal service providers will also be permitted to open for one-on-one sessions. This includes hairdressers and nail salons. Again, these facilities will be responsible for ensuring that PPE is available for both clients and service providers when requested. Bars and restaurants will be allowed to re-open and operate at half capacity. Last call for alcohol service will be at 9 p.m.. Facility operators need to ensure that patrons are respecting social distancing. Liquor Inspectors have the authority to enforce orders regarding social distancing, and they will be monitoring to ensure adherence to these conditions. Theatres and churches are also permitted to re-open on June 22. On June 29: Youth centres and day camps will be able to resume operations. Long-term care facilities will begin accepting visitors in a limited capacity; they can only allow one to two visitors per resident at a time, and these visitors can only be immediate family. Guidelines for re-opening will be available on the health website in the coming days. Though we can reasonably forecast what the next two weeks may bring, we must remain aware of the possible need to change or re-introduce public health measures. While we are in a position to ease restrictions, we remain vulnerable to the impacts of this global pandemic. Every week, new information becomes available. Every week, the situation can change. What doesn’t change is that social distancing, washing your hands and staying home when you are sick are the three main actions each and everyone of us can take to keep our families and our communities safe.

Right now, travel into Nunavut represents the single biggest risk for introducing COVID-19. The travel ban, and the 14-day isolation requirements for returning Nunavummiut, are meant to mitigate this risk and keep our territory safe. Knowing that, I’d like to take this opportunity to share information on the new process being implemented for reserving stays in GN southern isolation facilities. Moving forward, all Nunavummiut who must travel outside of the territory should contact the email address NUisolationreservations@nunavutcare.ca and submit an Isolation Reservation Request Form as soon as they know their plans for travel. From there, the travel team will work to identify room availability and reserve your stay in one of the designated isolation facilities. This new streamlined process is meant to help Nunavummiut plan for their 14-day quarantine period farther in advance and ensures that our travel team can anticipate and accommodate travellers in the coming months. More information, including intake days requirements, can also be found on the Department of Health’s website. Remember, non-essential travel outside of the territory is still not recommended. All individuals who are applying for critical worker exemption will continue to use the email address CPHOTravelRequests@gov.nu.ca. Finally, the Department of Health has made temporary amendments to the Medical Travel Policy to help keep our medical travellers and escorts safe from COVID-19. Specific provisions have been added to ensure that medical travellers and escorts abide by rules of social distancing, hand-washing hygiene, and other behaviours that help to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The amendments also more clearly outline the requirements for both medical travellers and escorts to complete 14 days of self-isolation at a designated isolation facility prior to returning to Nunavut. As we continue to look at ways of easing public health measures and returning the activities we enjoy, we must remain diligent and aware that the threat of COVID-19 has not yet passed. Please continue to maintain physical distancing and handwashing practices, and limit any non-essential travel out of the territory. Thank you.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

This annual event highlights the health risks associated with tobacco use, and advocates for effective policies to reduce tobacco consumption. Right now, we are all working hard to commit to our public health measures that protect us from the threat of COVID-19. We are social distancing, staying home as much as possible, and washing our hands as much as we can. These actions are keeping ourselves, our communities, and our territory safe. Quitting tobacco use is one more step we can take to guard ourselves against the impact of this pandemic. We know that COVID-19 is mainly a respiratory virus, and early evidence suggests that smoking can make symptoms worse. Smokers are also likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19, as smoking increases the likelihood of transmission from one’s face and lips. Please remember: do not share cigarettes, joints, or pipes. Do not pick up discarded cigarette or cannabis butts. Wash your hands often, and refrain from touching your face. The best thing that we can do for our health is to quit smoking. By making the decision to quit smoking, we can help to protect ourselves from COVID-19 today, and dramatically improve our health for the coming weeks, months, and years. Support is available for anyone who wants to explore options to help them quit. Message a counsellor on the Tobacco Has No Place Here Facebook page or call 1-866-368-7848 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The service is private and free. Counsellors can help you in Inuktitut, English, Inuinnaqtun and French. Nicotine replacement therapy, or NRT, is also available at no cost through the Non-Insured Health Benefits program at your local health centre or pharmacy. Call ahead, and ask your health care provider for information and options for NRT. Thank you. Chief Public Health Officer update Good morning. Today marks the start of Nunavut’s Path forward. Day cares, territorial parks, and playgrounds are permitted to re-open, and the size limit for outdoor gatherings has been increased to 25. Today will also be the first of our bi-weekly assessments concerning the modification of public health measures. As we look at altering public health measures, I want to take a moment and emphasize to all Nunavummiut the continued importance of social distancing. While we are in a position today to alter measures, we are not in a position to take social distancing for granted. We’ve noticed through the contact tracing of persons under investigation that people’s contact bubbles are becoming noticeably larger. Larger contact bubbles will make it significantly more challenging to identify and prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. COVID-19 continues to pose a risk to Nunavummiut, and we are not immune to this pandemic. We’ve made it this far thanks to our collective efforts, but those efforts absolutely have to continue. With that said, I’m pleased to announce the following modifications to public health measures that will be occurring over the next two weeks. Effective immediately, in-territory travel advisories are lifted. Travel outside of Nunavut is still not recommended. Individuals who are travelling outside of the territory need to be aware not only of the isolation procedures to return, but also of the measures that other jurisdictions may have in place to limit or discourage travel. On June 8, workplaces and retail outlets are permitted to re-open, provided that they have safety measures in place. Galleries, museums, and libraries may also be opened for individual viewing and browsing, though group sessions are still prohibited. There will also be an increased availability of in-person health assessments at health centres across the territory. On June 15, dental clinics, physiotherapy clinics, massage therapy, and chiropractic treatments are permitted to resume. Gyms and pools will also be permitted to re-open for solo workouts and lap swimming only. Please note, that all these measures are subject to alteration should conditions change. Thank you.     Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, May 28, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update Good morning. I’d like to take this opportunity to clarify the conditions required in order for us to consider altering the current border measures in place. I have previously indicated that the border restrictions currently in place will likely be among the final public health measures that are lifted. This is because right now travel into Nunavut from outside of the territory represents the highest risk. If we want to continue Nunavut’s Path, and remove additional public health measures inside the territory, then we need to maintain our strict travel measures. This is our best chance to both return to the activities we enjoy and the programs we depend on, while still protecting the health and safety of Nunavummiut. With that said, fulfillment of any of the following conditions may influence decisions to alter our border measures. Development of a vaccine for COVID-19. We’ve already discussed this, and though it is unlikely that a vaccine will be developed and readily available in the near future, it is still a factor that would greatly influence all of our public health measures; Development or discovery of an effective treatment for COVID-19; Indication that COVID-19 is under control in our neighboring jurisdictions. This means that beyond just decreasing case numbers, we would need to see evidence that community transmission in neighboring jurisdictions is minimal and contained; And finally, achievement of sustainable and on-going diagnostic capacity in every community in Nunavut. Unfortunately, many of these factors are outside of our control, but we will continue to monitor the evolving global situation. As always, our decisions surrounding the border measures will be guided by evidence and will be designed to protect and preserve the health and safety of Nunavummiut throughout this global pandemic. I would like to remind Nunavummiut that as of Monday, June 1, playgrounds, territorial parks, and daycares are permitted to open, and the size of outdoor gatherings may increase to 25. On June 1, we will also begin our bi-weekly announcements on the assessment and potential easing of additional public health measures. The reason we have chosen two weeks as our interval of choice is straightforward. All evidence suggests that 14 days is the maximum incubation time for COVID-19. So, this 14-day window will give us an opportunity to assess the situation around us and make informed decisions based on the latest information available. Please remember that if a threat is detected, we may need to react immediately. We will provide as much warning as possible, but we may need to introduce additional public health measures right away. Finally, the Department is issuing a Public Health Advisory to the community of Sanikiluaq due to the detection of pertussis, also known as whooping cough. Whooping cough is a disease of the throat or lungs that is spread easily from person to person. Anyone can get whooping cough, but the most severe cases are in young children. For that reason, the daycare in Sanikiluaq must remain closed for the time being. Thank you.  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

These past two months have not been easy, and all Nunavummiut have had to make sacrifices. However, thanks to our combined efforts, we are protecting our families, our communities, and our territory from this pandemic, and I hope that all Nunavummiut can feel a sense of pride knowing that their actions are making a deep and measurable impact on keeping Nunavut healthy and safe. It is time for us to move forward. This does not mean that this pandemic is over. This does not mean that the threat has passed. This means that we can cautiously begin our return to the activities we enjoy, knowing that at any time we may need to change our behaviour to protect ourselves from emerging threats. In the coming weeks, we will work with our stakeholders to re-introduce our businesses, our activities, and our programs in a way that is safe, sustainable, and poses the least risk to the health and safety of Nunavummiut. Know that as we begin to loosen restrictions internally, it is imperative that our strict border measures remain to minimize the risk of introducing COVID-19 into the territory. With that being said, I’m pleased to announce that as of June 1: Daycares will be permitted to open up for regular business. The size limit for outdoor gatherings will increase to 25 people. Territorial parks will be allowed to reopen for outdoor activities only, if local circumstances permit. All park buildings will remain closed. Municipal playgrounds will be allowed to re-open, again, if local circumstances permit. These particular conditions have been selected because they are deemed low risk. Moving forward, our plan is to re-assess our condition every two weeks. If the state of COVID in Nunavut is favorable, we will continue to lift public health measures, beginning with lower risk activities and programs. If our condition is stable, we may remain at the status quo until we are confident that lifting additional restrictions would not pose an undue risk to Nunavummiut. Finally, if the threat of COVID-19 increases, or eased public health measures are posing a potential public health threat to the territory, we may need to introduce or re-introduce certain conditions. I share in everyone’s desire to return to normal. We all want to know when we can confidently and safely travel within our own territory, or to our neighbouring jurisdictions. However, trying to forecast specific dates and timelines for when we can lift all of our public health measures would be inaccurate, and frankly, it would be insincere. The COVID-19 pandemic is evolving rapidly, and every single week yields new information that shapes our strategy and our public health measures. Predictions and decisions made on the basis of today’s understanding of the virus may be obsolete in a short time. For this reason, we have opted for an approach that is flexible, cautious, and adaptive to the evolving situation around us. Again, I want to thank all Nunavummiut for their continued patience and understanding. No one is left unaffected by this pandemic, but our collective accountability has kept Nunavut safe so far. This accountability and responsibility needs to continue, and, as we loosen restrictions, we must continue to practice social distancing, stay away from others when we are sick and wash our hands often. Thank you.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

I am pleased to announce several items today. The first is that Rankin Inlet now has the ability to provide testing if a positive case is confirmed in-territory. I’d like to commend the medical and laboratory staff, especially Matt Stacey and Dr. Jasmine Pawa, who have been working tirelessly to become acquainted with the GeneXpert machine, and to ensure that it can be managed safely, efficiently, and accurately. Getting this machine up and running is a significant step forward for Nunavut, as this now fulfills our criteria of obtaining reliable and effective in-territory diagnostic capacity. When coupled with the fact that we still have no confirmed cases of COVID-19 inside the territory, we have now met two of our three conditions. While the situation in southern Canada will continue to play a role in our approach moving forward, we are now in a better position to consider reducing some restrictions in the territory. I have one other piece of news I would like to share. Moving forward, Kitikmeot medical travellers receiving treatment in Yellowknife are no longer required to undergo the 14-day isolation period, and instead will be permitted to return home immediately. This decision has been made through consultation with the Northwest Territories and is contingent on there being no active cases of COVID-19 in the NWT. Please note that this is for medical travellers only, and this is only when their treatment is provided in Yellowknife. Any medical traveller who needs to leave the Northwest Territories to receive treatment in other cities in Canada will still be required to complete their 14-day isolation period. For all medical travellers to whom this new rule applies who are currently in quarantine, we are working to get you home as soon as possible. As always, our main goal is the safety, health and well being of Nunavummiut. I would like to thank you all for your patience, understanding and support as we continue to care for our families and our communities.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, May 8, 2020 Minister of Health update: It was announced at the start of this year by the World Health Organization that all of 2020 was to be recognized as the Year of the Nurse and the Midwife. This was an opportunity to celebrate the vital role of nurses and midwives in the delivery of health care services across the world. Several months later, in the midst of this global pandemic, we are not just talking about their essential role in keeping us healthy, we are experiencing it firsthand. Nurses and midwives continue to deliver vital health care services in our territory, in our country, and throughout the world. May 11 to 17 is recognized as National Nursing Week. As our nurses work tirelessly to ensure that Nunavummiut have access to the care they need, I think it’s important that we all take this opportunity to show them our immense gratitude for their service and their contribution to this territory. Nunavut has more than 300 nurses who are essential to the development and delivery of programs that keep Nunavummiut healthy. In these uncertain times, as the world battles COVID-19, our nurses are on the front line, providing care to those who need it most. This pandemic has demonstrated our nurses’ willingness to put their own health and safety at risk to protect and care for those around them. This National Nursing Week, and indeed this entire Year of The Nurse and Midwife, give us an opportunity to shine a spotlight on these essential health staff. However, our gratitude for your service is not restricted to a single week, or a single year. I would like all Nunavummiut to join me in showing our ongoing appreciation for your continued dedication to this territory. Thank you.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, May 6, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update: Since it was confirmed that the detected COVID case in Nunavut was a false positive, the territory has witnessed great displays of solidarity, support, and pride. The additional restrictions in Pond Inlet have been lifted, and I hope that the community feels a measure of relief knowing that they are still COVID-free. This is good news. As a territory, we have done well so far. However, we cannot allow our celebration to lapse into complacency. It is more important than ever that we maintain these rules that we’ve all become familiar with. The threat of COVID-19 is still very real and we need to stay the course. Practise social distancing. Avoid contact with individuals who are not a member of your household. Limit trips for errands. Purchase only the supplies that your household needs. And, of course, wash your hands. There is no combination of measures that can absolutely guarantee the prevention of COVID-19. Even as we celebrate for Pond Inlet, all Nunavummiut need to remain vigilant and cautious. Follow the rules, and encourage your friends, family, and neighbours to do the same. I want to thank all Nunavummiut for their continued patience, understanding, and cooperation. We can only get through this together.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Travel outside the territory as of May 7, 2020: The Government of Nunavut’s decision to charge $2,100 per individual and $1,050 for each additional family member during the mandatory 14-day isolation stays for residents returning to the territory has been reversed. The Government of Nunavut will continue to cover these costs as long as mandatory isolation for residents returning to the territory is in place. Please keep in mind that travel outside of Nunavut during the COVID-19 pandemic is not advised.    Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

This means that although the first test result showed COVID-19 infection, further investigation and testing have not shown any other evidence of COVID-19 infection in Pond Inlet. As I have previously mentioned, no lab test is perfect. There is always a chance of false positive or false negative results. When interpreting results and deciding on an appropriate course of action, we consider many pieces of information, of which test results are just one piece. We always aim to err on the side of caution. Diagnostic tests are part of an entire system of measures to intervene on COVID-19 infection. In these circumstances the test gave an incorrect result, but the rest of the system (public health nurses, contact tracing, surveillance) have not identified any other cases of COVID-19 infection. The information available so far includes: The individual involved has not been outside of Pond Inlet for some time. We have not identified an exposure to COVID-19. We have not found any other cases of COVID-19 in Pond Inlet. We have not noticed any increase in significant respiratory infections. 		  For all of the reasons above we believe that the individual in Pond Inlet does not, and never did have COVID-19. As a result, our rapid response team will stop operating in Pond Inlet and the members of the team will begin preparing for future deployments. All territorial orders under the Public Health Emergency remain in effect. However, the additional measures specific to Pond Inlet as a result of the positive COVID-19 case are now lifted. Effective immediately, travel between Pond Inlet and other Nunavut communities may resume, and the community-specific restrictions on businesses and services in Pond Inlet are also rescinded.      Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

The Rapid Response Team is in the community, and they are implementing containment and contact tracing. As the team completes additional testing, there is the possibility that more positive cases may be confirmed in the community. This does not necessarily mean that there is community transmission and should not be cause for alarm. What this does mean is that the Rapid Response Team is doing their job, which is finding the virus and stopping it from spreading. Containment is key, and right now it is our top priority. As this process takes place, the Government of Nunavut will continue to support the community of Pond Inlet. I also want to take a moment and thank the municipality of Pond Inlet and its residents for allowing me to answer their questions earlier today on the community radio. Moving forward, I would like to remind all Nunavummiut, using the strongest possible terms, that every single social interaction carries a degree of risk. Despite all of the Government of Nunavut’s preventative measures, and the new containment measures now in place within Pond Inlet, it is impossible to reasonably predict where or when COVID-19 may be detected next. I urge all Nunavummiut to exercise a high degree of caution, and to seriously consider these risks before participating in a gathering of any kind. If you deem it necessary to participate in gatherings, then please keep track of the people with whom you interact, as this information may be necessary in case contact tracing needs to be conducted in your community. Health staff cannot get us through this alone. How well we do, and where we go from here, depends on the actions of every single Nunavummiut. Right now, the best way of slowing the spread of COVID-19 continues to be through social distancing and effective hygiene. If everyone follows these rules together, we can put ourselves in the best position to make it through this uncertain time. It’s more important than ever that we be careful, responsible, kind, and supportive. I’d like to thank Nunavummiut for their continued cooperation and understanding. As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Travel outside the territory as of May 7, 2020 Starting May 7, 2020, Nunavummiut who chose to travel outside Nunavut while the CPHO’s travel ban is still in effect will have to cover the costs of their 14-day isolation period in one of the Government of Nunavut’s isolation sites. The fee for a single individual in a room is $2,100 for the 14-day period, and each additional family member in the room will pay $1,050. Updates will be provided as they become available. 		   Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, April 30, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update As you have seen and heard, today we have announced that a case of COVID-19 has been detected within Pond Inlet. Since the onset of the pandemic, we knew that no combination of preventative measures can absolutely guarantee the prevention of COVID-19. We anticipated that sooner or later the virus would be detected in the territory. Just as we have poured extensive effort into our prevention plan, so too have we developed a comprehensive response plan to minimize, to the greatest possible extent, the impact that COVID-19 has on Nunavut. We have been in contact with hamlet authorities and have initiated our Rapid Response Plan. A Rapid Response Team has already been deployed to Pond Inlet and is scheduled to arrive early this afternoon. That team will immediately initiate containment measures, begin contact tracing, and monitor the health and well-being of persons on home isolation orders. The Pond Inlet Health Centre is well-staffed and prepared, and health centre operations will continue. All passenger travel in and out of Pond Inlet has ceased. This includes any movement in or out of the community by land travel. This travel ban is a necessary containment measure to minimize the risk of COVID-19 spreading to multiple communities at once. Until we have determined the potential spread of the virus within the community, all non-essential offices and services will be closed. There is to be no social gatherings within dwellings, and all residents of Pond Inlet are asked to continue to maintain social distancing and good hygiene. For residents of Pond Inlet, we recognize that this news may be frightening. However, the Government of Nunavut would like to assure everyone that although travel is restricted, you are not cut off from help and support. Critical services will be maintained, and plans are in place to ensure that access to services such as heat, power, water, sewer, and communications will not be interrupted. Our primary focus now is to detect and contain the virus to prevent further transmission within the community and to other communities. Anyone who has reason to believe that they have been exposed to the virus is advised to call the COVID-19 hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. or 6 p.m. or call your community health centre. Please, do not go to the health centre in person unless you are instructed to by a health official. To all Nunavummiut, know that the preventative measures that we have all been taking are more important now than ever. Everyone needs to practise social distancing, stay home whenever possible, and avoid contact with those who are not a member of your household. Together, our efforts can slow the spread of COVID-19. Finally, I remind everyone of the importance of kindness. Now is not the time for blame, or shame. It is the time for compassion, empathy, and support of your fellow Nunavummiut. The Government of Nunavut thanks all Nunavummiut for their efforts to date. We will continue to exhaust all efforts to contain the virus, and minimize its impact on Pond Inlet, and on all the territory. Only together can we all protect our territory from the threat of COVID-19.    Department of Health Services  Residents of Pond Inlet must call their health centre first. All regular appointments at the Pond Inlet Health Centre have been cancelled. Only emergency services are available.  COVID-19 Hotline and self-assessment tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or call their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days. Nunavummiut can also use the self-assessment tool available at www.gov.nu.ca COMMUNITY TRAVEL AND GATHERINGS RESTRICTION ORDER POND INLET All travel to and from Pond Inlet is banned except: People with a letter from the CPHO Medevac patients Flight crews Nunavut Inuit exercising their hunting rights as set out in Article 5 may leave and return to Pond Inlet but not travel to any other community People travelling on a flight which must land in Pond Inlet due to weather or emergency Medevac crews must restrict movements to the airport and the health centre and must wear personal protective equipment. All businesses operating in Pond Inlet must close except for: Grocery stores Fuel and motor vehicle stations Post office Restaurants open for take out service All social gatherings shall be restricted to five persons or fewer. No social gatherings in dwellings. The order can be consulted at:https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/covid-19-novel-coronavirus   Department of Health Services, April 29, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update As many of you may know, some jurisdictions in Canada have started or will soon begin a gradual lifting of the restrictions they have implemented to flatten the COVID curve. Today I’d like to speak in more detail about what needs to happen before we can do the same. There are three conditions that need to be met before we can consider relaxing existing restrictions in the territory. They are as follows: We need to achieve in-territory diagnostic capacity. This means that we need to be able to implement a rapid, accurate, and comprehensive COVID-19 testing program here in Nunavut; There needs to be significant indication that rates of COVID-19 are decreasing in the southern jurisdictions to which Nunavummiut most often travel; and There needs to remain no active cases of COVID-19 within Nunavut. The nature of these conditions means that it is difficult to assign a specific timeline to re-opening, but fulfillment of these conditions is necessary to minimize risk to public health and safety. We need to know that Nunavummiut travelling outside of the territory can do so safely, and we need to be able to respond rapidly to any confirmed cases of COVID-19 within Nunavut. I know that people are eager to go back to work, visit loved ones, and engage in social activities. However, if we lift these restrictions too early, we will increase the risk to Nunavummiut. If we aren’t careful about how we transition back from these restrictions, then we could effectively undo all the hard work and sacrifices that we’ve made over the past seven weeks. It is as important as ever that we stay the course: maintain social distancing, stay home whenever possible, and wash your hands often. These measures continue to be the best defence against COVID-19, and the best way to protect our families, our communities, and our territory.   Department of Health Services Access to health care services will remain available in all communities seven days a week. All non-urgent requests will be triaged daily. Immediate access to urgent and emergent health care services are and will continue to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. All clients are asked to call before presenting at a health facility. In Iqaluit, public health, the emergency room and inpatient unit will remain open. Well baby clinics, prenatal visits and immunizations are continuing across Nunavut. Physicians will continue community visits. If this is not possible, the visits will be conducted by telehealth or by phone.   Volumes  Total (All Isolation Locations)   Traveler Type   Guests in Isolation as of April 28   Medical Travel   206   Public   136   Total   342    Traveller repatriation summary:  Departure Date   # of Travellers from Isolation Sites   April 29   38   April 30   15   May 1   19   May 2   6   May 3   14    Critical Worker Requests As of April 28, there are 786 requests, 597 of which are critical worker requests.

The new order adds clarity around gatherings and social distancing and provides easy to understand scenarios that will help Nunavummiut more easily follow the order. It will also help businesses understand how to adjust their operations to ensure public safety and continued operation. Finally, the changes will also assist law enforcement and peace officers to more easily interpret the intent of the order in the unlikely event there is a need for enforcement. I’d like to outline some of the new definitions and information provided in the new order. Food service establishments and licensed premises remain closed. Restaurants can still provide options for take-out or delivery, as long as they abide by the rules of social distancing while doing so. All businesses deemed as Personal Service Providers must also remain closed. These include hair dressing, barbering, massage therapy, and other similar establishments. Additionally, dentists, veterinarians, and psychologists must remain closed, except for emergencies. Public playgrounds, municipal parks, and day-use areas of territorial parks also remain closed. Though still subject to closures and limitations, the following businesses are permitted to remain open: any business large enough to maintain a two-metre social distance within the workplace, or businesses that limit customers to no more than five at a time. The five-at-a-time rule does not apply to businesses that are large enough to maintain social distancing throughout the entire premise, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and similar facilities. The order provides a definition to gatherings. All organized public gatherings of more than five people remain prohibited. This includes concerts, community events, sporting events, and ceremonies such as marriages, funerals, or memorial services. Finally, all social gatherings, including social gatherings in private dwellings, shall be restricted to five persons or fewer. This includes play groups, club meetings, and meals with individuals who do not reside together. This new order does not mean that restrictions are being loosened, or that the Government of Nunavut has re-assessed the territory’s position or tolerance for risk. Instead, the definitions under this new order have been aligned with definitions being applied in other jurisdictions. This makes restrictive measures clearer and more consistent in their application and enforcement. It is strongly recommended that Nunavummiut limit contact with anyone who is not a member of their immediate household. Any social gathering carries a degree of risk, especially when we are looking at individuals from multiple different households mingling together. Nunavummiut must still exercise caution at all times, practise social distancing to the greatest extent possible, and wash hands and all shared surfaces thoroughly and often. The previous order met the intended purpose of providing necessary tools to help protect public health. However, The Government of Nunavut recognized the need to provide clearer language and definitions. For this reason, the Department of Justice worked with the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) to prepare a new Order to ensure the language is clear and understandable while remaining true to its intent.

This resource is user-friendly, available in all four official languages, and can be accessed through the Government of Nunavut webpage at https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/covid-19-novel-coronavirus. The purpose of this self-assessment tool is to provide Nunavummiut with real-time information and recommendations based on self-reported symptoms or recent travel history. The tool will help Nunavummiut determine whether they should self-isolate, and when they should contact a health care service provider for additional follow-up or testing. This tool is meant to supplement the existing resources that are already available, and it is not a replacement for social distancing and good hygiene, such as washing regularly. Mass gatherings are still banned, and everyone is still required to follow the rules. Nunavummiut who don’t have access to online resources but believe that they are displaying COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, are encouraged to call the COVID Hotline at 1-888-975-8601. You can also ask someone with internet access to complete the self-assessment on your behalf by sharing with them your travel history and any symptoms that you may be experiencing.

This means that many Nunavummiut currently in the south are coming to the end of their mandatory 14-day isolation periods. It is time for many of these residents to return home. The mandatory rules we put in place in our isolation sites are very strict. I think it is important to remind everyone that for 14 days, residents are: Confined in their hotel rooms most of the day. Have no physical contact with other residents undergoing isolation and no physical contact with the general population. Are allowed only monitored outings on hotel grounds. Must have daily health check-ins with on-site nurses. Are held responsible if they break isolation. There are no exceptions. These measures are a first step and they ensure Nunavummiut who want to come home, as well as their families and communities, remain healthy and safe. The second step is bringing residents home. I want to take a moment and outline this process: 48 hours before anticipated departure, travellers are informed on the clearance and travel process. The day before departure, the nurses on-site review each traveller’s daily check-in logs to make sure they complied with the isolation rules. The nurses conduct a final in-person assessment to ensure travellers are healthy and show no symptoms of COVID-19. The assessments and results are sent to my office – and a decision to clear a traveller for the scheduled return home is made and a letter approving travel is issued. Residents need both the letter and a proof of residency to return to the territory. The day of departure, residents approved for travel are transported from the hotel to the airport via a private shuttle, sanitized thoroughly before use. The Government of Nunavut worked with airlines to minimize, to the greatest possible extent, the risk of anyone being exposed to COVID-19 during their travel back to the territory. Airports have enhanced cleaning, sanitation and passenger procedures throughout the check-in and security process that ensure physical distancing. As an additional precaution, residents will also undergo an airline health check prior to boarding. Until they arrive at their final destination in Nunavut, residents remain bound by the isolation agreement they signed the day they accepted to enter the isolation sites. Residents will travel to Nunavut on both chartered and scheduled flights: Residents travelling on chartered flights are shuttled directly to their airplane for boarding and take-off. Once in Nunavut, they will be chartered to their final in-territory destination. Residents travelling on scheduled flights are dropped off at the airport, where they are met and guided by airline employees to check-in, through security, to the boarding area and finally on the plane. They do not come in contact with other travellers during this process and remain bound by their isolation agreement. I want to thank our returning residents for going through these drastic measures to protect their communities and Nunavut. As we welcome back friends, family members, and loved ones, it is more important than ever to follow the rules: All social gatherings are still banned, and all Nunavummiut, including those just returning to their home communities, are expected to do their part to keep Nunavut safe. Practice strict social distancing, stay home when possible, avoid contact with individuals outside of your household, and monitor your health.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Department of Health Services Isolation Sites Those in isolation have access to cable, internet, three meals a day, fresh linens and cleaning supplies.

This equipment will be used to test mine staff for COVID-19. At this time there is no evidence that screening in this fashion is a substitute for 14 days of isolation. This is why Nunavut, and every other Canadian jurisdiction, is using 14 days of isolation after exposure or travel. As a result, I have informed management of Agnico Eagle Mines that these tests do not change the current requirement for mine staff to stay out of the town of Rankin Inlet. The Department of Health is committed to improving and protecting the health of all Nunavummiut. For COVID-19 this means having testing equipment that meets Canadian standards and can be deployed to every community in Nunavut. The equipment used by AEM does not meet these criteria. If the Department of Health were to commit to using devices like this, we would not improve access to COVID testing for all Nunavummiut. The Department of Health continues to work on acquiring diagnostic capability that can be rapidly deployed and will provide quick access to results for all Nunavummiut. The combination of machines we continue to pursue will not only allow testing in all communities but will also improve our ability to rapidly diagnose a number of other infectious diseases that threaten Nunavummiut on a regular basis. Testing for COVID-19 at the wrong time can produce incorrect results and create a false sense of reassurance.     As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Department of Health Services The Public Health Emergency has been extended until April 16.

The GN’s Department of Health is working to identify any possible exposure between the staff member and clients who were in isolation during that time. Staff at the isolation sites are always required to wear masks while working, which would help limit the risk of transmission. “We are discussing with Ottawa Public Health whether this positive case will require those scheduled to return home in the coming days to remain in isolation until they can be cleared as contacts and confirmed COVID-free,” said George Hickes, Minister of Health. “We will make all decisions based on the best medical advice and take the necessary steps to keep everyone safe.” Any Nunavummiut who were in isolation between August 16 and August 19 at the Residence Inn in Ottawa and have since travelled home to Nunavut are asked to monitor for symptoms of COVID-19.

Department of Community and Government Services - May 28, 2020 Minister of Community and Government Services update Ullaakkut, With the construction season upon us the Government of Nunavut (GN) has undertaken necessary preparations for construction projects to proceed during the summer and fall of 2020 in 19 Nunavut communities. This includes over 50 capital projects valued at approximately $600 million. Given the significant size of our construction program, we rely on a certain level of skilled workers from southern Canada to work on these projects alongside our Inuit and Northern labour. In consultation with Dr. Patterson, arrangements have been made to ensure that all southern workers comply with the strict requirement of the 14-day isolation period before travelling to Nunavut. The GN will control and monitor these measures at the isolation facilities in the south during the 14 days including up until workers board their flights. This follows the procedures for residents and medical travellers already in place. We need to balance the long-term infrastructure needs of communities with the current COVID-19 restrictions and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the municipalities, especially our mayors and councillors, for taking an active role in the decision to proceed with these projects during the 2020 construction season. I also would like to acknowledge the construction companies for their understanding of, and the need to respect, the directives set by Dr. Patterson to ensure that the construction projects move ahead with an understanding of maintaining the health and well-being of the workers and all Nunavummiut. Despite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are looking forward to a safe and productive construction season this summer. Thank you.   Department of Community and Government services - April 30, 2020  Critical services will be maintained in Pond Inlet, and plans are in place to ensure that access to services such as heat, power, water, sewer, and communications will not be interrupted. Community and Government Services (CGS), along with the municipality, has a plan in place for a water intake/pumping solution to ensure the community has ongoing access to water The temporary pumping system will include: A pump set up on the shore of the reservoir, Suction hose put through a drilled hole in the ice, A discharge hose to supply water into the back of the water truck, Manual chlorination into the back of the truck, and, The pump will be set up in a temporary porta-tank to provide containment for fuel refilling. 		  This solution can be managed by municipality staff. CGS is actively working on a permanent solution to be implemented later this summer. Department of Community and Government services - April 20, 2020  The Department of Community and Government services is providing an additional $2 million to municipalities to cover expenses related to COVID-19. This additional funding will ensure that hamlets are able to provide unforeseen services in response to the pandemic.  Eligible expenses include but are not limited to the purchase of cleaning materials, hiring additional staff, expenses for additional road clearing, by-law and enforcement patrols, and to cover lost revenues resulting from facility closures. Municipalities can contact their CGS regional community development office for more information.

The Government of Nunavut is managing several hubs, and dealing with a large number of requests from both medical and non-essential travellers. In an attempt to help clear up some of the delays to get into the hubs, Iqaluit is being looked at as one of several options to help relieve the wait time for medical travellers in Winnipeg. This has not been finalized and we are actively looking at the possibility of creating a second hub in Winnipeg, specifically for medical travellers. Our commitment is to ensure our medical travellers are well cared for and we are prioritizing their stays above non-essential travellers. We understand the concerns raised on social media over the weekend. However, nothing has been confirmed about an Iqaluit or additional Winnipeg hub. We recognize the fear and uncertainty that comes with COVID-19. However, we need to balance that fear with facts, the best possible care for Nunavummiut and our commitment to public health and safety. When there is an official course of action on this, we will announce it with all the relevant information. As we work to relieve this backlog, we thank those waiting for a spot in the isolation hubs for their patience and understanding. We are working around the clock to keep our territory and Nunavummiut safe. Thanks to all the staff who have worked so hard to keep everyone well during COVID-19.

On July 20, all licensed establishments in the territory will be allowed to open with regular hours. Nunavut will also be extending its common travel area to include Churchill, Manitoba. This bubble is exclusive to the community of Churchill and does not extend to other regions of Manitoba. The common travel area applies to air, land and water travel and exempts travellers from isolation requirements in either Nunavut or Churchill under certain conditions: Travel must originate from Nunavut to Churchill or from Churchill to Nunavut. Travellers must have not been outside either Churchill or Nunavut for 2 weeks prior to travelling. Travellers must remain in either Nunavut or Churchill for the duration of their stay. Prior to travelling outside of Nunavut, travellers must contact the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer for Nunavut and provide: Contact information, such as an address and phone number, at the person’s regular place of residence; and A written declaration that can be obtained by emailing CPHOtravelrequests@gov.nu.ca or by going to the Department of Health’s website. When travelling by air, travellers are required to obtain a letter from the CPHO authorizing travel or they will not be permitted to board their flight. Those who leave the common travel area outside of Churchill will need to isolate for 14 days at a government isolation facility, prior to returning to Nunavut. I would like to also take this opportunity to thank all Nunavummiut for their patience as we work together to protect our territory and families from COVID-19.

We are still waiting on confirmatory results for the presumptive case detected in the Mary River Mine, with the expectation that they will be ready sometime this week. The Department of Health continues to monitor the situation at the Mary River Mine site closely, and we will provide support as needed. I want to take this opportunity and remind Nunavummiut that: Testing is only one component of the Public Health response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Testing is important, but it is not a replacement for social distancing or hand-washing. Testing is important, but it is absolutely not a replacement for 14 days of isolation. The Government of Nunavut follows testing guidelines and best practices that have been endorsed by the World Health Organization and Health Canada. We rely on diagnostic devices that have undergone rigorous validation and accreditation processes to provide dependable testing to Nunavummiut. Even under ideal conditions, and with validated equipment, testing is not always a reliable method of identifying cases of COVID-19 and halting transmission. There is strong evidence that false negatives can occur throughout the incubation period. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the overarching goal of our public health response is to identify, contain and break transmission. The Government of Nunavut will continue to look at emerging evidence and best practices set out by public health authorities, both nationally and globally, to shape our response to COVID-19, and will alter public health measures as and when appropriate.

Today marks the third bi-weekly announcement for Nunavut’s Path for moving forward during COVID-19. There are still no cases of COVID-19 detected in the territory, so once again we are in a position to alter public health measures. I’m pleased to announce the following changes under the new Order Respecting Social Distancing and Gatherings, which goes into effect today: The limit for outdoor gatherings has now been increased to 50 people. The limit for indoor gatherings has been increased to 10 people. In private dwellings, this means 10 people in addition to those who reside there. The limit for gatherings at places of worship, conference facilities, community halls, rental meeting spaces, and gatherings organized by the Government of Canada, Government of Nunavut, municipal corporation, or Regional Inuit Organizations has been set at 50 people or 50% of capacity for the facility, whichever is less. In all facilities and gatherings, it is still expected that social distancing is maintained. As we take another step forward on Nunavut’s Path, and we return to some of the activities, programs, or venues that we’ve missed, we need to remain diligent in our collective commitment to practice social distancing and good hand hygiene. If you make the choice to participate in a large gathering, or attend an indoor event, or even meet up with friends for dinner, please also choose to be responsible, and choose to take actions that will keep yourself, your community, and your territory, safe. Wash your hands. Keep six feet away from others. Avoid touching your face. Sanitize high-touch areas often. Consider wearing a mask when social distancing is difficult. If you don’t feel well, stay home. Thank you. 			   			As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  Calling Ahead at Health Centres Unless you are experiencing a medical emergency, please call your health centre first before going in.

As of today, Nunavut is resuming regular medical travel to Churchill, Manitoba. As Churchill has not had a confirmed case of COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic, we have determined that the risk of resuming medical travel operations is minimal, and it is greatly outweighed by the benefits of ensuring that Nunavummiut have access to the out-of-territory care they need. Medical travellers and their escorts who travel to Churchill for treatment and do not leave the community for the duration of their stay, will be able to return directly to Nunavut without needing to isolate at a GN designated isolation facility. If the situation changes, we will re-assess and be ready to initiate contact tracing and containment measures immediately. We have also had some inquiries from cab companies regarding their operations. Under the new Order Regarding Social Distancing and Gatherings, cab companies can collect fares from multiple households at once, under specific conditions. Whenever there are multiple passengers in the cab, everyone must wear a mask. Cab drivers must provide masks for riders who do not have them. Most importantly, cab drivers must obtain consent from all passengers before picking up multiple fares. This means that any passenger who is picked up, and all subsequent fares on that ride, must indicate that they are okay with riding in a shared cab with others. All passengers can still request that they do not share their ride with others, and, for now, cab companies must comply with this request. We want to thank all cab companies who have so readily complied with recommendations to limit passenger travel and enhance sanitation procedures in order to keep Nunavummiut safe and healthy. Finally, as restaurants, bars, and other indoor locations are permitted to open, I want to continue to emphasize to Nunavummiut the necessity of social distancing, good hand hygiene, and staying home when we are sick. We need to remember, even as we return to the activities we enjoy, that this pandemic is far from over, and small actions from everyone today add up to major impacts tomorrow. Thank you.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  Calling Ahead at Health Centres Unless you are experiencing a medical emergency, please call your health centre first before going in.

I am pleased to say that after consultation with my counterpart in the GNWT, as of today, residents of the NWT can travel to Nunavut without isolating prior to arrival. The establishment of the common travel area by air or by land between the two territories does however come with strict conditions and expectations: Travel must originate from Nunavut to the NWT or from the NWT to Nunavut. Travellers have not been outside their respective territory for two weeks prior to their travel to the NWT or Nunavut. Travellers remain in either territory for the duration of their stay. Travellers from the NWT who wish to enter Nunavut, must write to: cphotravelrequests@gov.nu.ca and complete and sign the Nunavut and NWT Traveller’s Declaration form. Failure to do so will affect entry in Nunavut. Failure to answer truthfully will be subject to fines. This also applies for Nunavummiut who wish to return home after their stay in the NWT. My office will issue a letter of approval. Travellers will be required to present the approval letter prior to boarding any airplane entering Nunavut. Isolation before entering Nunavut is still required if You are a Nunavut resident who is returning home from travel in southern Canada via Yellowknife. In this case, you will need to complete a 14-day isolation period in the GN isolation hub in Yellowknife. You are an NWT resident who has travelled outside your territory less than two weeks before your scheduled arrival in Nunavut. In this case, you will need to complete the NWT isolation requirements before applying for travel to Nunavut. I want to re-assure Nunavummiut that should the current situation change in either territory, we will re-assess the common travel area and take all necessary measures to protect the health and safety of Nunavummiut. Further Information can be found in Travel and Isolation section of the Department of Health website at https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/travel-and-isolation. Today also marks the second of our bi-weekly announcements regarding the status of current health measures. Beginning June 22: Personal service providers will also be permitted to open for one-on-one sessions. This includes hairdressers and nail salons. Again, these facilities will be responsible for ensuring that PPE is available for both clients and service providers when requested. Bars and restaurants will be allowed to re-open and operate at half capacity. Last call for alcohol service will be at 9 p.m.. Facility operators need to ensure that patrons are respecting social distancing. Liquor Inspectors have the authority to enforce orders regarding social distancing, and they will be monitoring to ensure adherence to these conditions. Theatres and churches are also permitted to re-open on June 22. On June 29: Youth centres and day camps will be able to resume operations. Long-term care facilities will begin accepting visitors in a limited capacity; they can only allow one to two visitors per resident at a time, and these visitors can only be immediate family. Guidelines for re-opening will be available on the health website in the coming days. Though we can reasonably forecast what the next two weeks may bring, we must remain aware of the possible need to change or re-introduce public health measures. While we are in a position to ease restrictions, we remain vulnerable to the impacts of this global pandemic. Every week, new information becomes available. Every week, the situation can change. What doesn’t change is that social distancing, washing your hands and staying home when you are sick are the three main actions each and everyone of us can take to keep our families and our communities safe.

Right now, travel into Nunavut represents the single biggest risk for introducing COVID-19. The travel ban, and the 14-day isolation requirements for returning Nunavummiut, are meant to mitigate this risk and keep our territory safe. Knowing that, I’d like to take this opportunity to share information on the new process being implemented for reserving stays in GN southern isolation facilities. Moving forward, all Nunavummiut who must travel outside of the territory should contact the email address NUisolationreservations@nunavutcare.ca and submit an Isolation Reservation Request Form as soon as they know their plans for travel. From there, the travel team will work to identify room availability and reserve your stay in one of the designated isolation facilities. This new streamlined process is meant to help Nunavummiut plan for their 14-day quarantine period farther in advance and ensures that our travel team can anticipate and accommodate travellers in the coming months. More information, including intake days requirements, can also be found on the Department of Health’s website. Remember, non-essential travel outside of the territory is still not recommended. All individuals who are applying for critical worker exemption will continue to use the email address CPHOTravelRequests@gov.nu.ca. Finally, the Department of Health has made temporary amendments to the Medical Travel Policy to help keep our medical travellers and escorts safe from COVID-19. Specific provisions have been added to ensure that medical travellers and escorts abide by rules of social distancing, hand-washing hygiene, and other behaviours that help to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The amendments also more clearly outline the requirements for both medical travellers and escorts to complete 14 days of self-isolation at a designated isolation facility prior to returning to Nunavut. As we continue to look at ways of easing public health measures and returning the activities we enjoy, we must remain diligent and aware that the threat of COVID-19 has not yet passed. Please continue to maintain physical distancing and handwashing practices, and limit any non-essential travel out of the territory.

Quitting tobacco use is one more step we can take to guard ourselves against the impact of this pandemic. We know that COVID-19 is mainly a respiratory virus, and early evidence suggests that smoking can make symptoms worse. Smokers are also likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19, as smoking increases the likelihood of transmission from one’s face and lips. Please remember: do not share cigarettes, joints, or pipes. Do not pick up discarded cigarette or cannabis butts. Wash your hands often, and refrain from touching your face. The best thing that we can do for our health is to quit smoking. By making the decision to quit smoking, we can help to protect ourselves from COVID-19 today, and dramatically improve our health for the coming weeks, months, and years. Support is available for anyone who wants to explore options to help them quit. Message a counsellor on the Tobacco Has No Place Here Facebook page or call 1-866-368-7848 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The service is private and free. Counsellors can help you in Inuktitut, English, Inuinnaqtun and French. Nicotine replacement therapy, or NRT, is also available at no cost through the Non-Insured Health Benefits program at your local health centre or pharmacy. Call ahead, and ask your health care provider for information and options for NRT. Thank you. Chief Public Health Officer update Good morning. Today marks the start of Nunavut’s Path forward. Day cares, territorial parks, and playgrounds are permitted to re-open, and the size limit for outdoor gatherings has been increased to 25. Today will also be the first of our bi-weekly assessments concerning the modification of public health measures. As we look at altering public health measures, I want to take a moment and emphasize to all Nunavummiut the continued importance of social distancing. While we are in a position today to alter measures, we are not in a position to take social distancing for granted. We’ve noticed through the contact tracing of persons under investigation that people’s contact bubbles are becoming noticeably larger. Larger contact bubbles will make it significantly more challenging to identify and prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. COVID-19 continues to pose a risk to Nunavummiut, and we are not immune to this pandemic. We’ve made it this far thanks to our collective efforts, but those efforts absolutely have to continue. With that said, I’m pleased to announce the following modifications to public health measures that will be occurring over the next two weeks. Effective immediately, in-territory travel advisories are lifted. Travel outside of Nunavut is still not recommended. Individuals who are travelling outside of the territory need to be aware not only of the isolation procedures to return, but also of the measures that other jurisdictions may have in place to limit or discourage travel. On June 8, workplaces and retail outlets are permitted to re-open, provided that they have safety measures in place. Galleries, museums, and libraries may also be opened for individual viewing and browsing, though group sessions are still prohibited. There will also be an increased availability of in-person health assessments at health centres across the territory. On June 15, dental clinics, physiotherapy clinics, massage therapy, and chiropractic treatments are permitted to resume. Gyms and pools will also be permitted to re-open for solo workouts and lap swimming only. Please note, that all these measures are subject to alteration should conditions change. Thank you.     Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, May 28, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update Good morning. I’d like to take this opportunity to clarify the conditions required in order for us to consider altering the current border measures in place. I have previously indicated that the border restrictions currently in place will likely be among the final public health measures that are lifted. This is because right now travel into Nunavut from outside of the territory represents the highest risk. If we want to continue Nunavut’s Path, and remove additional public health measures inside the territory, then we need to maintain our strict travel measures. This is our best chance to both return to the activities we enjoy and the programs we depend on, while still protecting the health and safety of Nunavummiut. With that said, fulfillment of any of the following conditions may influence decisions to alter our border measures. Development of a vaccine for COVID-19. We’ve already discussed this, and though it is unlikely that a vaccine will be developed and readily available in the near future, it is still a factor that would greatly influence all of our public health measures; Development or discovery of an effective treatment for COVID-19; Indication that COVID-19 is under control in our neighboring jurisdictions. This means that beyond just decreasing case numbers, we would need to see evidence that community transmission in neighboring jurisdictions is minimal and contained; And finally, achievement of sustainable and on-going diagnostic capacity in every community in Nunavut. Unfortunately, many of these factors are outside of our control, but we will continue to monitor the evolving global situation. As always, our decisions surrounding the border measures will be guided by evidence and will be designed to protect and preserve the health and safety of Nunavummiut throughout this global pandemic. I would like to remind Nunavummiut that as of Monday, June 1, playgrounds, territorial parks, and daycares are permitted to open, and the size of outdoor gatherings may increase to 25. On June 1, we will also begin our bi-weekly announcements on the assessment and potential easing of additional public health measures. The reason we have chosen two weeks as our interval of choice is straightforward. All evidence suggests that 14 days is the maximum incubation time for COVID-19. So, this 14-day window will give us an opportunity to assess the situation around us and make informed decisions based on the latest information available. Please remember that if a threat is detected, we may need to react immediately. We will provide as much warning as possible, but we may need to introduce additional public health measures right away. Finally, the Department is issuing a Public Health Advisory to the community of Sanikiluaq due to the detection of pertussis, also known as whooping cough. Whooping cough is a disease of the throat or lungs that is spread easily from person to person. Anyone can get whooping cough, but the most severe cases are in young children. For that reason, the daycare in Sanikiluaq must remain closed for the time being. Thank you.  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

These past two months have not been easy, and all Nunavummiut have had to make sacrifices. However, thanks to our combined efforts, we are protecting our families, our communities, and our territory from this pandemic, and I hope that all Nunavummiut can feel a sense of pride knowing that their actions are making a deep and measurable impact on keeping Nunavut healthy and safe. It is time for us to move forward. This does not mean that this pandemic is over. This does not mean that the threat has passed. This means that we can cautiously begin our return to the activities we enjoy, knowing that at any time we may need to change our behaviour to protect ourselves from emerging threats. In the coming weeks, we will work with our stakeholders to re-introduce our businesses, our activities, and our programs in a way that is safe, sustainable, and poses the least risk to the health and safety of Nunavummiut. Know that as we begin to loosen restrictions internally, it is imperative that our strict border measures remain to minimize the risk of introducing COVID-19 into the territory. With that being said, I’m pleased to announce that as of June 1: Daycares will be permitted to open up for regular business. The size limit for outdoor gatherings will increase to 25 people. Territorial parks will be allowed to reopen for outdoor activities only, if local circumstances permit. All park buildings will remain closed. Municipal playgrounds will be allowed to re-open, again, if local circumstances permit. These particular conditions have been selected because they are deemed low risk. Moving forward, our plan is to re-assess our condition every two weeks. If the state of COVID in Nunavut is favorable, we will continue to lift public health measures, beginning with lower risk activities and programs. If our condition is stable, we may remain at the status quo until we are confident that lifting additional restrictions would not pose an undue risk to Nunavummiut. Finally, if the threat of COVID-19 increases, or eased public health measures are posing a potential public health threat to the territory, we may need to introduce or re-introduce certain conditions. I share in everyone’s desire to return to normal. We all want to know when we can confidently and safely travel within our own territory, or to our neighbouring jurisdictions. However, trying to forecast specific dates and timelines for when we can lift all of our public health measures would be inaccurate, and frankly, it would be insincere. The COVID-19 pandemic is evolving rapidly, and every single week yields new information that shapes our strategy and our public health measures. Predictions and decisions made on the basis of today’s understanding of the virus may be obsolete in a short time. For this reason, we have opted for an approach that is flexible, cautious, and adaptive to the evolving situation around us. Again, I want to thank all Nunavummiut for their continued patience and understanding. No one is left unaffected by this pandemic, but our collective accountability has kept Nunavut safe so far. This accountability and responsibility needs to continue, and, as we loosen restrictions, we must continue to practice social distancing, stay away from others when we are sick and wash our hands often. Thank you.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

I am pleased to announce several items today. The first is that Rankin Inlet now has the ability to provide testing if a positive case is confirmed in-territory. I’d like to commend the medical and laboratory staff, especially Matt Stacey and Dr. Jasmine Pawa, who have been working tirelessly to become acquainted with the GeneXpert machine, and to ensure that it can be managed safely, efficiently, and accurately. Getting this machine up and running is a significant step forward for Nunavut, as this now fulfills our criteria of obtaining reliable and effective in-territory diagnostic capacity. When coupled with the fact that we still have no confirmed cases of COVID-19 inside the territory, we have now met two of our three conditions. While the situation in southern Canada will continue to play a role in our approach moving forward, we are now in a better position to consider reducing some restrictions in the territory. I have one other piece of news I would like to share. Moving forward, Kitikmeot medical travellers receiving treatment in Yellowknife are no longer required to undergo the 14-day isolation period, and instead will be permitted to return home immediately. This decision has been made through consultation with the Northwest Territories and is contingent on there being no active cases of COVID-19 in the NWT. Please note that this is for medical travellers only, and this is only when their treatment is provided in Yellowknife. Any medical traveller who needs to leave the Northwest Territories to receive treatment in other cities in Canada will still be required to complete their 14-day isolation period. For all medical travellers to whom this new rule applies who are currently in quarantine, we are working to get you home as soon as possible. As always, our main goal is the safety, health and well being of Nunavummiut. I would like to thank you all for your patience, understanding and support as we continue to care for our families and our communities.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, May 8, 2020 Minister of Health update: It was announced at the start of this year by the World Health Organization that all of 2020 was to be recognized as the Year of the Nurse and the Midwife. This was an opportunity to celebrate the vital role of nurses and midwives in the delivery of health care services across the world. Several months later, in the midst of this global pandemic, we are not just talking about their essential role in keeping us healthy, we are experiencing it firsthand. Nurses and midwives continue to deliver vital health care services in our territory, in our country, and throughout the world. May 11 to 17 is recognized as National Nursing Week. As our nurses work tirelessly to ensure that Nunavummiut have access to the care they need, I think it’s important that we all take this opportunity to show them our immense gratitude for their service and their contribution to this territory. Nunavut has more than 300 nurses who are essential to the development and delivery of programs that keep Nunavummiut healthy. In these uncertain times, as the world battles COVID-19, our nurses are on the front line, providing care to those who need it most. This pandemic has demonstrated our nurses’ willingness to put their own health and safety at risk to protect and care for those around them. This National Nursing Week, and indeed this entire Year of The Nurse and Midwife, give us an opportunity to shine a spotlight on these essential health staff. However, our gratitude for your service is not restricted to a single week, or a single year. I would like all Nunavummiut to join me in showing our ongoing appreciation for your continued dedication to this territory. Thank you.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, May 6, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update: Since it was confirmed that the detected COVID case in Nunavut was a false positive, the territory has witnessed great displays of solidarity, support, and pride. The additional restrictions in Pond Inlet have been lifted, and I hope that the community feels a measure of relief knowing that they are still COVID-free. This is good news. As a territory, we have done well so far. However, we cannot allow our celebration to lapse into complacency. It is more important than ever that we maintain these rules that we’ve all become familiar with. The threat of COVID-19 is still very real and we need to stay the course. Practise social distancing. Avoid contact with individuals who are not a member of your household. Limit trips for errands. Purchase only the supplies that your household needs. And, of course, wash your hands. There is no combination of measures that can absolutely guarantee the prevention of COVID-19. Even as we celebrate for Pond Inlet, all Nunavummiut need to remain vigilant and cautious. Follow the rules, and encourage your friends, family, and neighbours to do the same. I want to thank all Nunavummiut for their continued patience, understanding, and cooperation. We can only get through this together.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Travel outside the territory as of May 7, 2020: The Government of Nunavut’s decision to charge $2,100 per individual and $1,050 for each additional family member during the mandatory 14-day isolation stays for residents returning to the territory has been reversed. The Government of Nunavut will continue to cover these costs as long as mandatory isolation for residents returning to the territory is in place. Please keep in mind that travel outside of Nunavut during the COVID-19 pandemic is not advised.    Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

This means that although the first test result showed COVID-19 infection, further investigation and testing have not shown any other evidence of COVID-19 infection in Pond Inlet. As I have previously mentioned, no lab test is perfect. There is always a chance of false positive or false negative results. When interpreting results and deciding on an appropriate course of action, we consider many pieces of information, of which test results are just one piece. We always aim to err on the side of caution. Diagnostic tests are part of an entire system of measures to intervene on COVID-19 infection. In these circumstances the test gave an incorrect result, but the rest of the system (public health nurses, contact tracing, surveillance) have not identified any other cases of COVID-19 infection. The information available so far includes: The individual involved has not been outside of Pond Inlet for some time. We have not identified an exposure to COVID-19. We have not found any other cases of COVID-19 in Pond Inlet. We have not noticed any increase in significant respiratory infections. 		  For all of the reasons above we believe that the individual in Pond Inlet does not, and never did have COVID-19. As a result, our rapid response team will stop operating in Pond Inlet and the members of the team will begin preparing for future deployments. All territorial orders under the Public Health Emergency remain in effect. However, the additional measures specific to Pond Inlet as a result of the positive COVID-19 case are now lifted. Effective immediately, travel between Pond Inlet and other Nunavut communities may resume, and the community-specific restrictions on businesses and services in Pond Inlet are also rescinded.      Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

The Rapid Response Team is in the community, and they are implementing containment and contact tracing. As the team completes additional testing, there is the possibility that more positive cases may be confirmed in the community. This does not necessarily mean that there is community transmission and should not be cause for alarm. What this does mean is that the Rapid Response Team is doing their job, which is finding the virus and stopping it from spreading. Containment is key, and right now it is our top priority. As this process takes place, the Government of Nunavut will continue to support the community of Pond Inlet. I also want to take a moment and thank the municipality of Pond Inlet and its residents for allowing me to answer their questions earlier today on the community radio. Moving forward, I would like to remind all Nunavummiut, using the strongest possible terms, that every single social interaction carries a degree of risk. Despite all of the Government of Nunavut’s preventative measures, and the new containment measures now in place within Pond Inlet, it is impossible to reasonably predict where or when COVID-19 may be detected next. I urge all Nunavummiut to exercise a high degree of caution, and to seriously consider these risks before participating in a gathering of any kind. If you deem it necessary to participate in gatherings, then please keep track of the people with whom you interact, as this information may be necessary in case contact tracing needs to be conducted in your community. Health staff cannot get us through this alone. How well we do, and where we go from here, depends on the actions of every single Nunavummiut. Right now, the best way of slowing the spread of COVID-19 continues to be through social distancing and effective hygiene. If everyone follows these rules together, we can put ourselves in the best position to make it through this uncertain time. It’s more important than ever that we be careful, responsible, kind, and supportive. I’d like to thank Nunavummiut for their continued cooperation and understanding. As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Travel outside the territory as of May 7, 2020 Starting May 7, 2020, Nunavummiut who chose to travel outside Nunavut while the CPHO’s travel ban is still in effect will have to cover the costs of their 14-day isolation period in one of the Government of Nunavut’s isolation sites. The fee for a single individual in a room is $2,100 for the 14-day period, and each additional family member in the room will pay $1,050. Updates will be provided as they become available. 		   Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, April 30, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update As you have seen and heard, today we have announced that a case of COVID-19 has been detected within Pond Inlet. Since the onset of the pandemic, we knew that no combination of preventative measures can absolutely guarantee the prevention of COVID-19. We anticipated that sooner or later the virus would be detected in the territory. Just as we have poured extensive effort into our prevention plan, so too have we developed a comprehensive response plan to minimize, to the greatest possible extent, the impact that COVID-19 has on Nunavut. We have been in contact with hamlet authorities and have initiated our Rapid Response Plan. A Rapid Response Team has already been deployed to Pond Inlet and is scheduled to arrive early this afternoon. That team will immediately initiate containment measures, begin contact tracing, and monitor the health and well-being of persons on home isolation orders. The Pond Inlet Health Centre is well-staffed and prepared, and health centre operations will continue. All passenger travel in and out of Pond Inlet has ceased. This includes any movement in or out of the community by land travel. This travel ban is a necessary containment measure to minimize the risk of COVID-19 spreading to multiple communities at once. Until we have determined the potential spread of the virus within the community, all non-essential offices and services will be closed. There is to be no social gatherings within dwellings, and all residents of Pond Inlet are asked to continue to maintain social distancing and good hygiene. For residents of Pond Inlet, we recognize that this news may be frightening. However, the Government of Nunavut would like to assure everyone that although travel is restricted, you are not cut off from help and support. Critical services will be maintained, and plans are in place to ensure that access to services such as heat, power, water, sewer, and communications will not be interrupted. Our primary focus now is to detect and contain the virus to prevent further transmission within the community and to other communities. Anyone who has reason to believe that they have been exposed to the virus is advised to call the COVID-19 hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. or 6 p.m. or call your community health centre. Please, do not go to the health centre in person unless you are instructed to by a health official. To all Nunavummiut, know that the preventative measures that we have all been taking are more important now than ever. Everyone needs to practise social distancing, stay home whenever possible, and avoid contact with those who are not a member of your household. Together, our efforts can slow the spread of COVID-19. Finally, I remind everyone of the importance of kindness. Now is not the time for blame, or shame. It is the time for compassion, empathy, and support of your fellow Nunavummiut. The Government of Nunavut thanks all Nunavummiut for their efforts to date. We will continue to exhaust all efforts to contain the virus, and minimize its impact on Pond Inlet, and on all the territory. Only together can we all protect our territory from the threat of COVID-19.    Department of Health Services  Residents of Pond Inlet must call their health centre first. All regular appointments at the Pond Inlet Health Centre have been cancelled. Only emergency services are available.  COVID-19 Hotline and self-assessment tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or call their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days. Nunavummiut can also use the self-assessment tool available at www.gov.nu.ca COMMUNITY TRAVEL AND GATHERINGS RESTRICTION ORDER POND INLET All travel to and from Pond Inlet is banned except: People with a letter from the CPHO Medevac patients Flight crews Nunavut Inuit exercising their hunting rights as set out in Article 5 may leave and return to Pond Inlet but not travel to any other community People travelling on a flight which must land in Pond Inlet due to weather or emergency Medevac crews must restrict movements to the airport and the health centre and must wear personal protective equipment. All businesses operating in Pond Inlet must close except for: Grocery stores Fuel and motor vehicle stations Post office Restaurants open for take out service All social gatherings shall be restricted to five persons or fewer. No social gatherings in dwellings. The order can be consulted at:https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/covid-19-novel-coronavirus   Department of Health Services, April 29, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update As many of you may know, some jurisdictions in Canada have started or will soon begin a gradual lifting of the restrictions they have implemented to flatten the COVID curve. Today I’d like to speak in more detail about what needs to happen before we can do the same. There are three conditions that need to be met before we can consider relaxing existing restrictions in the territory. They are as follows: We need to achieve in-territory diagnostic capacity. This means that we need to be able to implement a rapid, accurate, and comprehensive COVID-19 testing program here in Nunavut; There needs to be significant indication that rates of COVID-19 are decreasing in the southern jurisdictions to which Nunavummiut most often travel; and There needs to remain no active cases of COVID-19 within Nunavut. The nature of these conditions means that it is difficult to assign a specific timeline to re-opening, but fulfillment of these conditions is necessary to minimize risk to public health and safety. We need to know that Nunavummiut travelling outside of the territory can do so safely, and we need to be able to respond rapidly to any confirmed cases of COVID-19 within Nunavut. I know that people are eager to go back to work, visit loved ones, and engage in social activities. However, if we lift these restrictions too early, we will increase the risk to Nunavummiut. If we aren’t careful about how we transition back from these restrictions, then we could effectively undo all the hard work and sacrifices that we’ve made over the past seven weeks. It is as important as ever that we stay the course: maintain social distancing, stay home whenever possible, and wash your hands often. These measures continue to be the best defence against COVID-19, and the best way to protect our families, our communities, and our territory.   Department of Health Services Access to health care services will remain available in all communities seven days a week. All non-urgent requests will be triaged daily. Immediate access to urgent and emergent health care services are and will continue to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. All clients are asked to call before presenting at a health facility. In Iqaluit, public health, the emergency room and inpatient unit will remain open. Well baby clinics, prenatal visits and immunizations are continuing across Nunavut. Physicians will continue community visits. If this is not possible, the visits will be conducted by telehealth or by phone.   Volumes  Total (All Isolation Locations)   Traveler Type   Guests in Isolation as of April 28   Medical Travel   206   Public   136   Total   342    Traveller repatriation summary:  Departure Date   # of Travellers from Isolation Sites   April 29   38   April 30   15   May 1   19   May 2   6   May 3   14    Critical Worker Requests As of April 28, there are 786 requests, 597 of which are critical worker requests.

The new order adds clarity around gatherings and social distancing and provides easy to understand scenarios that will help Nunavummiut more easily follow the order. It will also help businesses understand how to adjust their operations to ensure public safety and continued operation. Finally, the changes will also assist law enforcement and peace officers to more easily interpret the intent of the order in the unlikely event there is a need for enforcement. I’d like to outline some of the new definitions and information provided in the new order. Food service establishments and licensed premises remain closed. Restaurants can still provide options for take-out or delivery, as long as they abide by the rules of social distancing while doing so. All businesses deemed as Personal Service Providers must also remain closed. These include hair dressing, barbering, massage therapy, and other similar establishments. Additionally, dentists, veterinarians, and psychologists must remain closed, except for emergencies. Public playgrounds, municipal parks, and day-use areas of territorial parks also remain closed. Though still subject to closures and limitations, the following businesses are permitted to remain open: any business large enough to maintain a two-metre social distance within the workplace, or businesses that limit customers to no more than five at a time. The five-at-a-time rule does not apply to businesses that are large enough to maintain social distancing throughout the entire premise, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and similar facilities. The order provides a definition to gatherings. All organized public gatherings of more than five people remain prohibited. This includes concerts, community events, sporting events, and ceremonies such as marriages, funerals, or memorial services. Finally, all social gatherings, including social gatherings in private dwellings, shall be restricted to five persons or fewer. This includes play groups, club meetings, and meals with individuals who do not reside together. This new order does not mean that restrictions are being loosened, or that the Government of Nunavut has re-assessed the territory’s position or tolerance for risk. Instead, the definitions under this new order have been aligned with definitions being applied in other jurisdictions. This makes restrictive measures clearer and more consistent in their application and enforcement. It is strongly recommended that Nunavummiut limit contact with anyone who is not a member of their immediate household. Any social gathering carries a degree of risk, especially when we are looking at individuals from multiple different households mingling together. Nunavummiut must still exercise caution at all times, practise social distancing to the greatest extent possible, and wash hands and all shared surfaces thoroughly and often. The previous order met the intended purpose of providing necessary tools to help protect public health. However, The Government of Nunavut recognized the need to provide clearer language and definitions. For this reason, the Department of Justice worked with the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) to prepare a new Order to ensure the language is clear and understandable while remaining true to its intent.

This resource is user-friendly, available in all four official languages, and can be accessed through the Government of Nunavut webpage at https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/covid-19-novel-coronavirus. The purpose of this self-assessment tool is to provide Nunavummiut with real-time information and recommendations based on self-reported symptoms or recent travel history. The tool will help Nunavummiut determine whether they should self-isolate, and when they should contact a health care service provider for additional follow-up or testing. This tool is meant to supplement the existing resources that are already available, and it is not a replacement for social distancing and good hygiene, such as washing regularly. Mass gatherings are still banned, and everyone is still required to follow the rules. Nunavummiut who don’t have access to online resources but believe that they are displaying COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, are encouraged to call the COVID Hotline at 1-888-975-8601. You can also ask someone with internet access to complete the self-assessment on your behalf by sharing with them your travel history and any symptoms that you may be experiencing.

This means that many Nunavummiut currently in the south are coming to the end of their mandatory 14-day isolation periods. It is time for many of these residents to return home. The mandatory rules we put in place in our isolation sites are very strict. I think it is important to remind everyone that for 14 days, residents are: Confined in their hotel rooms most of the day. Have no physical contact with other residents undergoing isolation and no physical contact with the general population. Are allowed only monitored outings on hotel grounds. Must have daily health check-ins with on-site nurses. Are held responsible if they break isolation. There are no exceptions. These measures are a first step and they ensure Nunavummiut who want to come home, as well as their families and communities, remain healthy and safe. The second step is bringing residents home. I want to take a moment and outline this process: 48 hours before anticipated departure, travellers are informed on the clearance and travel process. The day before departure, the nurses on-site review each traveller’s daily check-in logs to make sure they complied with the isolation rules. The nurses conduct a final in-person assessment to ensure travellers are healthy and show no symptoms of COVID-19. The assessments and results are sent to my office – and a decision to clear a traveller for the scheduled return home is made and a letter approving travel is issued. Residents need both the letter and a proof of residency to return to the territory. The day of departure, residents approved for travel are transported from the hotel to the airport via a private shuttle, sanitized thoroughly before use. The Government of Nunavut worked with airlines to minimize, to the greatest possible extent, the risk of anyone being exposed to COVID-19 during their travel back to the territory. Airports have enhanced cleaning, sanitation and passenger procedures throughout the check-in and security process that ensure physical distancing. As an additional precaution, residents will also undergo an airline health check prior to boarding. Until they arrive at their final destination in Nunavut, residents remain bound by the isolation agreement they signed the day they accepted to enter the isolation sites. Residents will travel to Nunavut on both chartered and scheduled flights: Residents travelling on chartered flights are shuttled directly to their airplane for boarding and take-off. Once in Nunavut, they will be chartered to their final in-territory destination. Residents travelling on scheduled flights are dropped off at the airport, where they are met and guided by airline employees to check-in, through security, to the boarding area and finally on the plane. They do not come in contact with other travellers during this process and remain bound by their isolation agreement. I want to thank our returning residents for going through these drastic measures to protect their communities and Nunavut. As we welcome back friends, family members, and loved ones, it is more important than ever to follow the rules: All social gatherings are still banned, and all Nunavummiut, including those just returning to their home communities, are expected to do their part to keep Nunavut safe. Practice strict social distancing, stay home when possible, avoid contact with individuals outside of your household, and monitor your health.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Department of Health Services Isolation Sites Those in isolation have access to cable, internet, three meals a day, fresh linens and cleaning supplies.

This equipment will be used to test mine staff for COVID-19. At this time there is no evidence that screening in this fashion is a substitute for 14 days of isolation. This is why Nunavut, and every other Canadian jurisdiction, is using 14 days of isolation after exposure or travel. As a result, I have informed management of Agnico Eagle Mines that these tests do not change the current requirement for mine staff to stay out of the town of Rankin Inlet. The Department of Health is committed to improving and protecting the health of all Nunavummiut. For COVID-19 this means having testing equipment that meets Canadian standards and can be deployed to every community in Nunavut. The equipment used by AEM does not meet these criteria. If the Department of Health were to commit to using devices like this, we would not improve access to COVID testing for all Nunavummiut. The Department of Health continues to work on acquiring diagnostic capability that can be rapidly deployed and will provide quick access to results for all Nunavummiut. The combination of machines we continue to pursue will not only allow testing in all communities but will also improve our ability to rapidly diagnose a number of other infectious diseases that threaten Nunavummiut on a regular basis. Testing for COVID-19 at the wrong time can produce incorrect results and create a false sense of reassurance.     As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Department of Health Services The Public Health Emergency has been extended until April 16.

Department of Community and Government Services - May 28, 2020 Minister of Community and Government Services update Ullaakkut, With the construction season upon us the Government of Nunavut (GN) has undertaken necessary preparations for construction projects to proceed during the summer and fall of 2020 in 19 Nunavut communities. This includes over 50 capital projects valued at approximately $600 million. Given the significant size of our construction program, we rely on a certain level of skilled workers from southern Canada to work on these projects alongside our Inuit and Northern labour. In consultation with Dr. Patterson, arrangements have been made to ensure that all southern workers comply with the strict requirement of the 14-day isolation period before travelling to Nunavut. The GN will control and monitor these measures at the isolation facilities in the south during the 14 days including up until workers board their flights. This follows the procedures for residents and medical travellers already in place. We need to balance the long-term infrastructure needs of communities with the current COVID-19 restrictions and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the municipalities, especially our mayors and councillors, for taking an active role in the decision to proceed with these projects during the 2020 construction season. I also would like to acknowledge the construction companies for their understanding of, and the need to respect, the directives set by Dr. Patterson to ensure that the construction projects move ahead with an understanding of maintaining the health and well-being of the workers and all Nunavummiut. Despite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are looking forward to a safe and productive construction season this summer. Thank you.   Department of Community and Government services - April 30, 2020  Critical services will be maintained in Pond Inlet, and plans are in place to ensure that access to services such as heat, power, water, sewer, and communications will not be interrupted. Community and Government Services (CGS), along with the municipality, has a plan in place for a water intake/pumping solution to ensure the community has ongoing access to water The temporary pumping system will include: A pump set up on the shore of the reservoir, Suction hose put through a drilled hole in the ice, A discharge hose to supply water into the back of the water truck, Manual chlorination into the back of the truck, and, The pump will be set up in a temporary porta-tank to provide containment for fuel refilling. 		  This solution can be managed by municipality staff. CGS is actively working on a permanent solution to be implemented later this summer. Department of Community and Government services - April 20, 2020  The Department of Community and Government services is providing an additional $2 million to municipalities to cover expenses related to COVID-19. This additional funding will ensure that hamlets are able to provide unforeseen services in response to the pandemic.  Eligible expenses include but are not limited to the purchase of cleaning materials, hiring additional staff, expenses for additional road clearing, by-law and enforcement patrols, and to cover lost revenues resulting from facility closures. Municipalities can contact their CGS regional community development office for more information.

The Government of Nunavut is managing several hubs, and dealing with a large number of requests from both medical and non-essential travellers. In an attempt to help clear up some of the delays to get into the hubs, Iqaluit is being looked at as one of several options to help relieve the wait time for medical travellers in Winnipeg. This has not been finalized and we are actively looking at the possibility of creating a second hub in Winnipeg, specifically for medical travellers. Our commitment is to ensure our medical travellers are well cared for and we are prioritizing their stays above non-essential travellers. We understand the concerns raised on social media over the weekend. However, nothing has been confirmed about an Iqaluit or additional Winnipeg hub. We recognize the fear and uncertainty that comes with COVID-19. However, we need to balance that fear with facts, the best possible care for Nunavummiut and our commitment to public health and safety. When there is an official course of action on this, we will announce it with all the relevant information. As we work to relieve this backlog, we thank those waiting for a spot in the isolation hubs for their patience and understanding. We are working around the clock to keep our territory and Nunavummiut safe. Thanks to all the staff who have worked so hard to keep everyone well during COVID-19.

On July 20, all licensed establishments in the territory will be allowed to open with regular hours. Nunavut will also be extending its common travel area to include Churchill, Manitoba. This bubble is exclusive to the community of Churchill and does not extend to other regions of Manitoba. The common travel area applies to air, land and water travel and exempts travellers from isolation requirements in either Nunavut or Churchill under certain conditions: Travel must originate from Nunavut to Churchill or from Churchill to Nunavut. Travellers must have not been outside either Churchill or Nunavut for 2 weeks prior to travelling. Travellers must remain in either Nunavut or Churchill for the duration of their stay. Prior to travelling outside of Nunavut, travellers must contact the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer for Nunavut and provide: Contact information, such as an address and phone number, at the person’s regular place of residence; and A written declaration that can be obtained by emailing CPHOtravelrequests@gov.nu.ca or by going to the Department of Health’s website. When travelling by air, travellers are required to obtain a letter from the CPHO authorizing travel or they will not be permitted to board their flight. Those who leave the common travel area outside of Churchill will need to isolate for 14 days at a government isolation facility, prior to returning to Nunavut. I would like to also take this opportunity to thank all Nunavummiut for their patience as we work together to protect our territory and families from COVID-19.

We are still waiting on confirmatory results for the presumptive case detected in the Mary River Mine, with the expectation that they will be ready sometime this week. The Department of Health continues to monitor the situation at the Mary River Mine site closely, and we will provide support as needed. I want to take this opportunity and remind Nunavummiut that: Testing is only one component of the Public Health response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Testing is important, but it is not a replacement for social distancing or hand-washing. Testing is important, but it is absolutely not a replacement for 14 days of isolation. The Government of Nunavut follows testing guidelines and best practices that have been endorsed by the World Health Organization and Health Canada. We rely on diagnostic devices that have undergone rigorous validation and accreditation processes to provide dependable testing to Nunavummiut. Even under ideal conditions, and with validated equipment, testing is not always a reliable method of identifying cases of COVID-19 and halting transmission. There is strong evidence that false negatives can occur throughout the incubation period. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the overarching goal of our public health response is to identify, contain and break transmission. The Government of Nunavut will continue to look at emerging evidence and best practices set out by public health authorities, both nationally and globally, to shape our response to COVID-19, and will alter public health measures as and when appropriate. Thank you. 			   			As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Today marks the third bi-weekly announcement for Nunavut’s Path for moving forward during COVID-19. There are still no cases of COVID-19 detected in the territory, so once again we are in a position to alter public health measures. I’m pleased to announce the following changes under the new Order Respecting Social Distancing and Gatherings, which goes into effect today: The limit for outdoor gatherings has now been increased to 50 people. The limit for indoor gatherings has been increased to 10 people. In private dwellings, this means 10 people in addition to those who reside there. The limit for gatherings at places of worship, conference facilities, community halls, rental meeting spaces, and gatherings organized by the Government of Canada, Government of Nunavut, municipal corporation, or Regional Inuit Organizations has been set at 50 people or 50% of capacity for the facility, whichever is less. In all facilities and gatherings, it is still expected that social distancing is maintained. As we take another step forward on Nunavut’s Path, and we return to some of the activities, programs, or venues that we’ve missed, we need to remain diligent in our collective commitment to practice social distancing and good hand hygiene. If you make the choice to participate in a large gathering, or attend an indoor event, or even meet up with friends for dinner, please also choose to be responsible, and choose to take actions that will keep yourself, your community, and your territory, safe. Wash your hands. Keep six feet away from others. Avoid touching your face. Sanitize high-touch areas often. Consider wearing a mask when social distancing is difficult. If you don’t feel well, stay home. Thank you. 			   			As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  Calling Ahead at Health Centres Unless you are experiencing a medical emergency, please call your health centre first before going in.

As of today, Nunavut is resuming regular medical travel to Churchill, Manitoba. As Churchill has not had a confirmed case of COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic, we have determined that the risk of resuming medical travel operations is minimal, and it is greatly outweighed by the benefits of ensuring that Nunavummiut have access to the out-of-territory care they need. Medical travellers and their escorts who travel to Churchill for treatment and do not leave the community for the duration of their stay, will be able to return directly to Nunavut without needing to isolate at a GN designated isolation facility. If the situation changes, we will re-assess and be ready to initiate contact tracing and containment measures immediately. We have also had some inquiries from cab companies regarding their operations. Under the new Order Regarding Social Distancing and Gatherings, cab companies can collect fares from multiple households at once, under specific conditions. Whenever there are multiple passengers in the cab, everyone must wear a mask. Cab drivers must provide masks for riders who do not have them. Most importantly, cab drivers must obtain consent from all passengers before picking up multiple fares. This means that any passenger who is picked up, and all subsequent fares on that ride, must indicate that they are okay with riding in a shared cab with others. All passengers can still request that they do not share their ride with others, and, for now, cab companies must comply with this request. We want to thank all cab companies who have so readily complied with recommendations to limit passenger travel and enhance sanitation procedures in order to keep Nunavummiut safe and healthy. Finally, as restaurants, bars, and other indoor locations are permitted to open, I want to continue to emphasize to Nunavummiut the necessity of social distancing, good hand hygiene, and staying home when we are sick. We need to remember, even as we return to the activities we enjoy, that this pandemic is far from over, and small actions from everyone today add up to major impacts tomorrow.

I am pleased to say that after consultation with my counterpart in the GNWT, as of today, residents of the NWT can travel to Nunavut without isolating prior to arrival. The establishment of the common travel area by air or by land between the two territories does however come with strict conditions and expectations: Travel must originate from Nunavut to the NWT or from the NWT to Nunavut. Travellers have not been outside their respective territory for two weeks prior to their travel to the NWT or Nunavut. Travellers remain in either territory for the duration of their stay. Travellers from the NWT who wish to enter Nunavut, must write to: cphotravelrequests@gov.nu.ca and complete and sign the Nunavut and NWT Traveller’s Declaration form. Failure to do so will affect entry in Nunavut. Failure to answer truthfully will be subject to fines. This also applies for Nunavummiut who wish to return home after their stay in the NWT. My office will issue a letter of approval. Travellers will be required to present the approval letter prior to boarding any airplane entering Nunavut. Isolation before entering Nunavut is still required if You are a Nunavut resident who is returning home from travel in southern Canada via Yellowknife. In this case, you will need to complete a 14-day isolation period in the GN isolation hub in Yellowknife. You are an NWT resident who has travelled outside your territory less than two weeks before your scheduled arrival in Nunavut. In this case, you will need to complete the NWT isolation requirements before applying for travel to Nunavut. I want to re-assure Nunavummiut that should the current situation change in either territory, we will re-assess the common travel area and take all necessary measures to protect the health and safety of Nunavummiut. Further Information can be found in Travel and Isolation section of the Department of Health website at https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/travel-and-isolation. Today also marks the second of our bi-weekly announcements regarding the status of current health measures. Beginning June 22: Personal service providers will also be permitted to open for one-on-one sessions. This includes hairdressers and nail salons. Again, these facilities will be responsible for ensuring that PPE is available for both clients and service providers when requested. Bars and restaurants will be allowed to re-open and operate at half capacity. Last call for alcohol service will be at 9 p.m.. Facility operators need to ensure that patrons are respecting social distancing. Liquor Inspectors have the authority to enforce orders regarding social distancing, and they will be monitoring to ensure adherence to these conditions. Theatres and churches are also permitted to re-open on June 22. On June 29: Youth centres and day camps will be able to resume operations. Long-term care facilities will begin accepting visitors in a limited capacity; they can only allow one to two visitors per resident at a time, and these visitors can only be immediate family. Guidelines for re-opening will be available on the health website in the coming days. Though we can reasonably forecast what the next two weeks may bring, we must remain aware of the possible need to change or re-introduce public health measures. While we are in a position to ease restrictions, we remain vulnerable to the impacts of this global pandemic. Every week, new information becomes available. Every week, the situation can change. What doesn’t change is that social distancing, washing your hands and staying home when you are sick are the three main actions each and everyone of us can take to keep our families and our communities safe.

Right now, travel into Nunavut represents the single biggest risk for introducing COVID-19. The travel ban, and the 14-day isolation requirements for returning Nunavummiut, are meant to mitigate this risk and keep our territory safe. Knowing that, I’d like to take this opportunity to share information on the new process being implemented for reserving stays in GN southern isolation facilities. Moving forward, all Nunavummiut who must travel outside of the territory should contact the email address NUisolationreservations@nunavutcare.ca and submit an Isolation Reservation Request Form as soon as they know their plans for travel. From there, the travel team will work to identify room availability and reserve your stay in one of the designated isolation facilities. This new streamlined process is meant to help Nunavummiut plan for their 14-day quarantine period farther in advance and ensures that our travel team can anticipate and accommodate travellers in the coming months. More information, including intake days requirements, can also be found on the Department of Health’s website. Remember, non-essential travel outside of the territory is still not recommended. All individuals who are applying for critical worker exemption will continue to use the email address CPHOTravelRequests@gov.nu.ca. Finally, the Department of Health has made temporary amendments to the Medical Travel Policy to help keep our medical travellers and escorts safe from COVID-19. Specific provisions have been added to ensure that medical travellers and escorts abide by rules of social distancing, hand-washing hygiene, and other behaviours that help to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The amendments also more clearly outline the requirements for both medical travellers and escorts to complete 14 days of self-isolation at a designated isolation facility prior to returning to Nunavut. As we continue to look at ways of easing public health measures and returning the activities we enjoy, we must remain diligent and aware that the threat of COVID-19 has not yet passed. Please continue to maintain physical distancing and handwashing practices, and limit any non-essential travel out of the territory. Thank you.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

This annual event highlights the health risks associated with tobacco use, and advocates for effective policies to reduce tobacco consumption. Right now, we are all working hard to commit to our public health measures that protect us from the threat of COVID-19. We are social distancing, staying home as much as possible, and washing our hands as much as we can. These actions are keeping ourselves, our communities, and our territory safe. Quitting tobacco use is one more step we can take to guard ourselves against the impact of this pandemic. We know that COVID-19 is mainly a respiratory virus, and early evidence suggests that smoking can make symptoms worse. Smokers are also likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19, as smoking increases the likelihood of transmission from one’s face and lips. Please remember: do not share cigarettes, joints, or pipes. Do not pick up discarded cigarette or cannabis butts. Wash your hands often, and refrain from touching your face. The best thing that we can do for our health is to quit smoking. By making the decision to quit smoking, we can help to protect ourselves from COVID-19 today, and dramatically improve our health for the coming weeks, months, and years. Support is available for anyone who wants to explore options to help them quit. Message a counsellor on the Tobacco Has No Place Here Facebook page or call 1-866-368-7848 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The service is private and free. Counsellors can help you in Inuktitut, English, Inuinnaqtun and French. Nicotine replacement therapy, or NRT, is also available at no cost through the Non-Insured Health Benefits program at your local health centre or pharmacy. Call ahead, and ask your health care provider for information and options for NRT. Thank you. Chief Public Health Officer update Good morning. Today marks the start of Nunavut’s Path forward. Day cares, territorial parks, and playgrounds are permitted to re-open, and the size limit for outdoor gatherings has been increased to 25. Today will also be the first of our bi-weekly assessments concerning the modification of public health measures. As we look at altering public health measures, I want to take a moment and emphasize to all Nunavummiut the continued importance of social distancing. While we are in a position today to alter measures, we are not in a position to take social distancing for granted. We’ve noticed through the contact tracing of persons under investigation that people’s contact bubbles are becoming noticeably larger. Larger contact bubbles will make it significantly more challenging to identify and prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. COVID-19 continues to pose a risk to Nunavummiut, and we are not immune to this pandemic. We’ve made it this far thanks to our collective efforts, but those efforts absolutely have to continue. With that said, I’m pleased to announce the following modifications to public health measures that will be occurring over the next two weeks. Effective immediately, in-territory travel advisories are lifted. Travel outside of Nunavut is still not recommended. Individuals who are travelling outside of the territory need to be aware not only of the isolation procedures to return, but also of the measures that other jurisdictions may have in place to limit or discourage travel. On June 8, workplaces and retail outlets are permitted to re-open, provided that they have safety measures in place. Galleries, museums, and libraries may also be opened for individual viewing and browsing, though group sessions are still prohibited. There will also be an increased availability of in-person health assessments at health centres across the territory. On June 15, dental clinics, physiotherapy clinics, massage therapy, and chiropractic treatments are permitted to resume. Gyms and pools will also be permitted to re-open for solo workouts and lap swimming only. Please note, that all these measures are subject to alteration should conditions change. Thank you.     Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, May 28, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update Good morning. I’d like to take this opportunity to clarify the conditions required in order for us to consider altering the current border measures in place. I have previously indicated that the border restrictions currently in place will likely be among the final public health measures that are lifted. This is because right now travel into Nunavut from outside of the territory represents the highest risk. If we want to continue Nunavut’s Path, and remove additional public health measures inside the territory, then we need to maintain our strict travel measures. This is our best chance to both return to the activities we enjoy and the programs we depend on, while still protecting the health and safety of Nunavummiut. With that said, fulfillment of any of the following conditions may influence decisions to alter our border measures. Development of a vaccine for COVID-19. We’ve already discussed this, and though it is unlikely that a vaccine will be developed and readily available in the near future, it is still a factor that would greatly influence all of our public health measures; Development or discovery of an effective treatment for COVID-19; Indication that COVID-19 is under control in our neighboring jurisdictions. This means that beyond just decreasing case numbers, we would need to see evidence that community transmission in neighboring jurisdictions is minimal and contained; And finally, achievement of sustainable and on-going diagnostic capacity in every community in Nunavut. Unfortunately, many of these factors are outside of our control, but we will continue to monitor the evolving global situation. As always, our decisions surrounding the border measures will be guided by evidence and will be designed to protect and preserve the health and safety of Nunavummiut throughout this global pandemic. I would like to remind Nunavummiut that as of Monday, June 1, playgrounds, territorial parks, and daycares are permitted to open, and the size of outdoor gatherings may increase to 25. On June 1, we will also begin our bi-weekly announcements on the assessment and potential easing of additional public health measures. The reason we have chosen two weeks as our interval of choice is straightforward. All evidence suggests that 14 days is the maximum incubation time for COVID-19. So, this 14-day window will give us an opportunity to assess the situation around us and make informed decisions based on the latest information available. Please remember that if a threat is detected, we may need to react immediately. We will provide as much warning as possible, but we may need to introduce additional public health measures right away. Finally, the Department is issuing a Public Health Advisory to the community of Sanikiluaq due to the detection of pertussis, also known as whooping cough. Whooping cough is a disease of the throat or lungs that is spread easily from person to person. Anyone can get whooping cough, but the most severe cases are in young children. For that reason, the daycare in Sanikiluaq must remain closed for the time being. Thank you.  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

These past two months have not been easy, and all Nunavummiut have had to make sacrifices. However, thanks to our combined efforts, we are protecting our families, our communities, and our territory from this pandemic, and I hope that all Nunavummiut can feel a sense of pride knowing that their actions are making a deep and measurable impact on keeping Nunavut healthy and safe. It is time for us to move forward. This does not mean that this pandemic is over. This does not mean that the threat has passed. This means that we can cautiously begin our return to the activities we enjoy, knowing that at any time we may need to change our behaviour to protect ourselves from emerging threats. In the coming weeks, we will work with our stakeholders to re-introduce our businesses, our activities, and our programs in a way that is safe, sustainable, and poses the least risk to the health and safety of Nunavummiut. Know that as we begin to loosen restrictions internally, it is imperative that our strict border measures remain to minimize the risk of introducing COVID-19 into the territory. With that being said, I’m pleased to announce that as of June 1: Daycares will be permitted to open up for regular business. The size limit for outdoor gatherings will increase to 25 people. Territorial parks will be allowed to reopen for outdoor activities only, if local circumstances permit. All park buildings will remain closed. Municipal playgrounds will be allowed to re-open, again, if local circumstances permit. These particular conditions have been selected because they are deemed low risk. Moving forward, our plan is to re-assess our condition every two weeks. If the state of COVID in Nunavut is favorable, we will continue to lift public health measures, beginning with lower risk activities and programs. If our condition is stable, we may remain at the status quo until we are confident that lifting additional restrictions would not pose an undue risk to Nunavummiut. Finally, if the threat of COVID-19 increases, or eased public health measures are posing a potential public health threat to the territory, we may need to introduce or re-introduce certain conditions. I share in everyone’s desire to return to normal. We all want to know when we can confidently and safely travel within our own territory, or to our neighbouring jurisdictions. However, trying to forecast specific dates and timelines for when we can lift all of our public health measures would be inaccurate, and frankly, it would be insincere. The COVID-19 pandemic is evolving rapidly, and every single week yields new information that shapes our strategy and our public health measures. Predictions and decisions made on the basis of today’s understanding of the virus may be obsolete in a short time. For this reason, we have opted for an approach that is flexible, cautious, and adaptive to the evolving situation around us. Again, I want to thank all Nunavummiut for their continued patience and understanding. No one is left unaffected by this pandemic, but our collective accountability has kept Nunavut safe so far. This accountability and responsibility needs to continue, and, as we loosen restrictions, we must continue to practice social distancing, stay away from others when we are sick and wash our hands often. Thank you.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

I am pleased to announce several items today. The first is that Rankin Inlet now has the ability to provide testing if a positive case is confirmed in-territory. I’d like to commend the medical and laboratory staff, especially Matt Stacey and Dr. Jasmine Pawa, who have been working tirelessly to become acquainted with the GeneXpert machine, and to ensure that it can be managed safely, efficiently, and accurately. Getting this machine up and running is a significant step forward for Nunavut, as this now fulfills our criteria of obtaining reliable and effective in-territory diagnostic capacity. When coupled with the fact that we still have no confirmed cases of COVID-19 inside the territory, we have now met two of our three conditions. While the situation in southern Canada will continue to play a role in our approach moving forward, we are now in a better position to consider reducing some restrictions in the territory. I have one other piece of news I would like to share. Moving forward, Kitikmeot medical travellers receiving treatment in Yellowknife are no longer required to undergo the 14-day isolation period, and instead will be permitted to return home immediately. This decision has been made through consultation with the Northwest Territories and is contingent on there being no active cases of COVID-19 in the NWT. Please note that this is for medical travellers only, and this is only when their treatment is provided in Yellowknife. Any medical traveller who needs to leave the Northwest Territories to receive treatment in other cities in Canada will still be required to complete their 14-day isolation period. For all medical travellers to whom this new rule applies who are currently in quarantine, we are working to get you home as soon as possible. As always, our main goal is the safety, health and well being of Nunavummiut. I would like to thank you all for your patience, understanding and support as we continue to care for our families and our communities.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, May 8, 2020 Minister of Health update: It was announced at the start of this year by the World Health Organization that all of 2020 was to be recognized as the Year of the Nurse and the Midwife. This was an opportunity to celebrate the vital role of nurses and midwives in the delivery of health care services across the world. Several months later, in the midst of this global pandemic, we are not just talking about their essential role in keeping us healthy, we are experiencing it firsthand. Nurses and midwives continue to deliver vital health care services in our territory, in our country, and throughout the world. May 11 to 17 is recognized as National Nursing Week. As our nurses work tirelessly to ensure that Nunavummiut have access to the care they need, I think it’s important that we all take this opportunity to show them our immense gratitude for their service and their contribution to this territory. Nunavut has more than 300 nurses who are essential to the development and delivery of programs that keep Nunavummiut healthy. In these uncertain times, as the world battles COVID-19, our nurses are on the front line, providing care to those who need it most. This pandemic has demonstrated our nurses’ willingness to put their own health and safety at risk to protect and care for those around them. This National Nursing Week, and indeed this entire Year of The Nurse and Midwife, give us an opportunity to shine a spotlight on these essential health staff. However, our gratitude for your service is not restricted to a single week, or a single year. I would like all Nunavummiut to join me in showing our ongoing appreciation for your continued dedication to this territory.

Department of Health Services, May 6, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update: Since it was confirmed that the detected COVID case in Nunavut was a false positive, the territory has witnessed great displays of solidarity, support, and pride. The additional restrictions in Pond Inlet have been lifted, and I hope that the community feels a measure of relief knowing that they are still COVID-free. This is good news. As a territory, we have done well so far. However, we cannot allow our celebration to lapse into complacency. It is more important than ever that we maintain these rules that we’ve all become familiar with. The threat of COVID-19 is still very real and we need to stay the course. Practise social distancing. Avoid contact with individuals who are not a member of your household. Limit trips for errands. Purchase only the supplies that your household needs. And, of course, wash your hands. There is no combination of measures that can absolutely guarantee the prevention of COVID-19. Even as we celebrate for Pond Inlet, all Nunavummiut need to remain vigilant and cautious. Follow the rules, and encourage your friends, family, and neighbours to do the same. I want to thank all Nunavummiut for their continued patience, understanding, and cooperation. We can only get through this together.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Travel outside the territory as of May 7, 2020: The Government of Nunavut’s decision to charge $2,100 per individual and $1,050 for each additional family member during the mandatory 14-day isolation stays for residents returning to the territory has been reversed. The Government of Nunavut will continue to cover these costs as long as mandatory isolation for residents returning to the territory is in place. Please keep in mind that travel outside of Nunavut during the COVID-19 pandemic is not advised.    Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

This means that although the first test result showed COVID-19 infection, further investigation and testing have not shown any other evidence of COVID-19 infection in Pond Inlet. As I have previously mentioned, no lab test is perfect. There is always a chance of false positive or false negative results. When interpreting results and deciding on an appropriate course of action, we consider many pieces of information, of which test results are just one piece. We always aim to err on the side of caution. Diagnostic tests are part of an entire system of measures to intervene on COVID-19 infection. In these circumstances the test gave an incorrect result, but the rest of the system (public health nurses, contact tracing, surveillance) have not identified any other cases of COVID-19 infection. The information available so far includes: The individual involved has not been outside of Pond Inlet for some time. We have not identified an exposure to COVID-19. We have not found any other cases of COVID-19 in Pond Inlet. We have not noticed any increase in significant respiratory infections. 		  For all of the reasons above we believe that the individual in Pond Inlet does not, and never did have COVID-19. As a result, our rapid response team will stop operating in Pond Inlet and the members of the team will begin preparing for future deployments. All territorial orders under the Public Health Emergency remain in effect. However, the additional measures specific to Pond Inlet as a result of the positive COVID-19 case are now lifted. Effective immediately, travel between Pond Inlet and other Nunavut communities may resume, and the community-specific restrictions on businesses and services in Pond Inlet are also rescinded.      Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

The Rapid Response Team is in the community, and they are implementing containment and contact tracing. As the team completes additional testing, there is the possibility that more positive cases may be confirmed in the community. This does not necessarily mean that there is community transmission and should not be cause for alarm. What this does mean is that the Rapid Response Team is doing their job, which is finding the virus and stopping it from spreading. Containment is key, and right now it is our top priority. As this process takes place, the Government of Nunavut will continue to support the community of Pond Inlet. I also want to take a moment and thank the municipality of Pond Inlet and its residents for allowing me to answer their questions earlier today on the community radio. Moving forward, I would like to remind all Nunavummiut, using the strongest possible terms, that every single social interaction carries a degree of risk. Despite all of the Government of Nunavut’s preventative measures, and the new containment measures now in place within Pond Inlet, it is impossible to reasonably predict where or when COVID-19 may be detected next. I urge all Nunavummiut to exercise a high degree of caution, and to seriously consider these risks before participating in a gathering of any kind. If you deem it necessary to participate in gatherings, then please keep track of the people with whom you interact, as this information may be necessary in case contact tracing needs to be conducted in your community. Health staff cannot get us through this alone. How well we do, and where we go from here, depends on the actions of every single Nunavummiut. Right now, the best way of slowing the spread of COVID-19 continues to be through social distancing and effective hygiene. If everyone follows these rules together, we can put ourselves in the best position to make it through this uncertain time. It’s more important than ever that we be careful, responsible, kind, and supportive. I’d like to thank Nunavummiut for their continued cooperation and understanding. As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Travel outside the territory as of May 7, 2020 Starting May 7, 2020, Nunavummiut who chose to travel outside Nunavut while the CPHO’s travel ban is still in effect will have to cover the costs of their 14-day isolation period in one of the Government of Nunavut’s isolation sites. The fee for a single individual in a room is $2,100 for the 14-day period, and each additional family member in the room will pay $1,050. Updates will be provided as they become available. 		   Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, April 30, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update As you have seen and heard, today we have announced that a case of COVID-19 has been detected within Pond Inlet. Since the onset of the pandemic, we knew that no combination of preventative measures can absolutely guarantee the prevention of COVID-19. We anticipated that sooner or later the virus would be detected in the territory. Just as we have poured extensive effort into our prevention plan, so too have we developed a comprehensive response plan to minimize, to the greatest possible extent, the impact that COVID-19 has on Nunavut. We have been in contact with hamlet authorities and have initiated our Rapid Response Plan. A Rapid Response Team has already been deployed to Pond Inlet and is scheduled to arrive early this afternoon. That team will immediately initiate containment measures, begin contact tracing, and monitor the health and well-being of persons on home isolation orders. The Pond Inlet Health Centre is well-staffed and prepared, and health centre operations will continue. All passenger travel in and out of Pond Inlet has ceased. This includes any movement in or out of the community by land travel. This travel ban is a necessary containment measure to minimize the risk of COVID-19 spreading to multiple communities at once. Until we have determined the potential spread of the virus within the community, all non-essential offices and services will be closed. There is to be no social gatherings within dwellings, and all residents of Pond Inlet are asked to continue to maintain social distancing and good hygiene. For residents of Pond Inlet, we recognize that this news may be frightening. However, the Government of Nunavut would like to assure everyone that although travel is restricted, you are not cut off from help and support. Critical services will be maintained, and plans are in place to ensure that access to services such as heat, power, water, sewer, and communications will not be interrupted. Our primary focus now is to detect and contain the virus to prevent further transmission within the community and to other communities. Anyone who has reason to believe that they have been exposed to the virus is advised to call the COVID-19 hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. or 6 p.m. or call your community health centre. Please, do not go to the health centre in person unless you are instructed to by a health official. To all Nunavummiut, know that the preventative measures that we have all been taking are more important now than ever. Everyone needs to practise social distancing, stay home whenever possible, and avoid contact with those who are not a member of your household. Together, our efforts can slow the spread of COVID-19. Finally, I remind everyone of the importance of kindness. Now is not the time for blame, or shame. It is the time for compassion, empathy, and support of your fellow Nunavummiut. The Government of Nunavut thanks all Nunavummiut for their efforts to date. We will continue to exhaust all efforts to contain the virus, and minimize its impact on Pond Inlet, and on all the territory. Only together can we all protect our territory from the threat of COVID-19.    Department of Health Services  Residents of Pond Inlet must call their health centre first. All regular appointments at the Pond Inlet Health Centre have been cancelled. Only emergency services are available.  COVID-19 Hotline and self-assessment tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or call their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days. Nunavummiut can also use the self-assessment tool available at www.gov.nu.ca COMMUNITY TRAVEL AND GATHERINGS RESTRICTION ORDER POND INLET All travel to and from Pond Inlet is banned except: People with a letter from the CPHO Medevac patients Flight crews Nunavut Inuit exercising their hunting rights as set out in Article 5 may leave and return to Pond Inlet but not travel to any other community People travelling on a flight which must land in Pond Inlet due to weather or emergency Medevac crews must restrict movements to the airport and the health centre and must wear personal protective equipment. All businesses operating in Pond Inlet must close except for: Grocery stores Fuel and motor vehicle stations Post office Restaurants open for take out service All social gatherings shall be restricted to five persons or fewer. No social gatherings in dwellings. The order can be consulted at:https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/covid-19-novel-coronavirus   Department of Health Services, April 29, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update As many of you may know, some jurisdictions in Canada have started or will soon begin a gradual lifting of the restrictions they have implemented to flatten the COVID curve. Today I’d like to speak in more detail about what needs to happen before we can do the same. There are three conditions that need to be met before we can consider relaxing existing restrictions in the territory. They are as follows: We need to achieve in-territory diagnostic capacity. This means that we need to be able to implement a rapid, accurate, and comprehensive COVID-19 testing program here in Nunavut; There needs to be significant indication that rates of COVID-19 are decreasing in the southern jurisdictions to which Nunavummiut most often travel; and There needs to remain no active cases of COVID-19 within Nunavut. The nature of these conditions means that it is difficult to assign a specific timeline to re-opening, but fulfillment of these conditions is necessary to minimize risk to public health and safety. We need to know that Nunavummiut travelling outside of the territory can do so safely, and we need to be able to respond rapidly to any confirmed cases of COVID-19 within Nunavut. I know that people are eager to go back to work, visit loved ones, and engage in social activities. However, if we lift these restrictions too early, we will increase the risk to Nunavummiut. If we aren’t careful about how we transition back from these restrictions, then we could effectively undo all the hard work and sacrifices that we’ve made over the past seven weeks. It is as important as ever that we stay the course: maintain social distancing, stay home whenever possible, and wash your hands often. These measures continue to be the best defence against COVID-19, and the best way to protect our families, our communities, and our territory.   Department of Health Services Access to health care services will remain available in all communities seven days a week. All non-urgent requests will be triaged daily. Immediate access to urgent and emergent health care services are and will continue to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. All clients are asked to call before presenting at a health facility. In Iqaluit, public health, the emergency room and inpatient unit will remain open. Well baby clinics, prenatal visits and immunizations are continuing across Nunavut. Physicians will continue community visits. If this is not possible, the visits will be conducted by telehealth or by phone.   Volumes  Total (All Isolation Locations)   Traveler Type   Guests in Isolation as of April 28   Medical Travel   206   Public   136   Total   342    Traveller repatriation summary:  Departure Date   # of Travellers from Isolation Sites   April 29   38   April 30   15   May 1   19   May 2   6   May 3   14    Critical Worker Requests As of April 28, there are 786 requests, 597 of which are critical worker requests.

The new order adds clarity around gatherings and social distancing and provides easy to understand scenarios that will help Nunavummiut more easily follow the order. It will also help businesses understand how to adjust their operations to ensure public safety and continued operation. Finally, the changes will also assist law enforcement and peace officers to more easily interpret the intent of the order in the unlikely event there is a need for enforcement. I’d like to outline some of the new definitions and information provided in the new order. Food service establishments and licensed premises remain closed. Restaurants can still provide options for take-out or delivery, as long as they abide by the rules of social distancing while doing so. All businesses deemed as Personal Service Providers must also remain closed. These include hair dressing, barbering, massage therapy, and other similar establishments. Additionally, dentists, veterinarians, and psychologists must remain closed, except for emergencies. Public playgrounds, municipal parks, and day-use areas of territorial parks also remain closed. Though still subject to closures and limitations, the following businesses are permitted to remain open: any business large enough to maintain a two-metre social distance within the workplace, or businesses that limit customers to no more than five at a time. The five-at-a-time rule does not apply to businesses that are large enough to maintain social distancing throughout the entire premise, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and similar facilities. The order provides a definition to gatherings. All organized public gatherings of more than five people remain prohibited. This includes concerts, community events, sporting events, and ceremonies such as marriages, funerals, or memorial services. Finally, all social gatherings, including social gatherings in private dwellings, shall be restricted to five persons or fewer. This includes play groups, club meetings, and meals with individuals who do not reside together. This new order does not mean that restrictions are being loosened, or that the Government of Nunavut has re-assessed the territory’s position or tolerance for risk. Instead, the definitions under this new order have been aligned with definitions being applied in other jurisdictions. This makes restrictive measures clearer and more consistent in their application and enforcement. It is strongly recommended that Nunavummiut limit contact with anyone who is not a member of their immediate household. Any social gathering carries a degree of risk, especially when we are looking at individuals from multiple different households mingling together. Nunavummiut must still exercise caution at all times, practise social distancing to the greatest extent possible, and wash hands and all shared surfaces thoroughly and often. The previous order met the intended purpose of providing necessary tools to help protect public health. However, The Government of Nunavut recognized the need to provide clearer language and definitions. For this reason, the Department of Justice worked with the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) to prepare a new Order to ensure the language is clear and understandable while remaining true to its intent.

This resource is user-friendly, available in all four official languages, and can be accessed through the Government of Nunavut webpage at https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/covid-19-novel-coronavirus. The purpose of this self-assessment tool is to provide Nunavummiut with real-time information and recommendations based on self-reported symptoms or recent travel history. The tool will help Nunavummiut determine whether they should self-isolate, and when they should contact a health care service provider for additional follow-up or testing. This tool is meant to supplement the existing resources that are already available, and it is not a replacement for social distancing and good hygiene, such as washing regularly. Mass gatherings are still banned, and everyone is still required to follow the rules. Nunavummiut who don’t have access to online resources but believe that they are displaying COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, are encouraged to call the COVID Hotline at 1-888-975-8601. You can also ask someone with internet access to complete the self-assessment on your behalf by sharing with them your travel history and any symptoms that you may be experiencing.

This means that many Nunavummiut currently in the south are coming to the end of their mandatory 14-day isolation periods. It is time for many of these residents to return home. The mandatory rules we put in place in our isolation sites are very strict. I think it is important to remind everyone that for 14 days, residents are: Confined in their hotel rooms most of the day. Have no physical contact with other residents undergoing isolation and no physical contact with the general population. Are allowed only monitored outings on hotel grounds. Must have daily health check-ins with on-site nurses. Are held responsible if they break isolation. There are no exceptions. These measures are a first step and they ensure Nunavummiut who want to come home, as well as their families and communities, remain healthy and safe. The second step is bringing residents home. I want to take a moment and outline this process: 48 hours before anticipated departure, travellers are informed on the clearance and travel process. The day before departure, the nurses on-site review each traveller’s daily check-in logs to make sure they complied with the isolation rules. The nurses conduct a final in-person assessment to ensure travellers are healthy and show no symptoms of COVID-19. The assessments and results are sent to my office – and a decision to clear a traveller for the scheduled return home is made and a letter approving travel is issued. Residents need both the letter and a proof of residency to return to the territory. The day of departure, residents approved for travel are transported from the hotel to the airport via a private shuttle, sanitized thoroughly before use. The Government of Nunavut worked with airlines to minimize, to the greatest possible extent, the risk of anyone being exposed to COVID-19 during their travel back to the territory. Airports have enhanced cleaning, sanitation and passenger procedures throughout the check-in and security process that ensure physical distancing. As an additional precaution, residents will also undergo an airline health check prior to boarding. Until they arrive at their final destination in Nunavut, residents remain bound by the isolation agreement they signed the day they accepted to enter the isolation sites. Residents will travel to Nunavut on both chartered and scheduled flights: Residents travelling on chartered flights are shuttled directly to their airplane for boarding and take-off. Once in Nunavut, they will be chartered to their final in-territory destination. Residents travelling on scheduled flights are dropped off at the airport, where they are met and guided by airline employees to check-in, through security, to the boarding area and finally on the plane. They do not come in contact with other travellers during this process and remain bound by their isolation agreement. I want to thank our returning residents for going through these drastic measures to protect their communities and Nunavut. As we welcome back friends, family members, and loved ones, it is more important than ever to follow the rules: All social gatherings are still banned, and all Nunavummiut, including those just returning to their home communities, are expected to do their part to keep Nunavut safe. Practice strict social distancing, stay home when possible, avoid contact with individuals outside of your household, and monitor your health.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Department of Health Services Isolation Sites Those in isolation have access to cable, internet, three meals a day, fresh linens and cleaning supplies.

This equipment will be used to test mine staff for COVID-19. At this time there is no evidence that screening in this fashion is a substitute for 14 days of isolation. This is why Nunavut, and every other Canadian jurisdiction, is using 14 days of isolation after exposure or travel. As a result, I have informed management of Agnico Eagle Mines that these tests do not change the current requirement for mine staff to stay out of the town of Rankin Inlet. The Department of Health is committed to improving and protecting the health of all Nunavummiut. For COVID-19 this means having testing equipment that meets Canadian standards and can be deployed to every community in Nunavut. The equipment used by AEM does not meet these criteria. If the Department of Health were to commit to using devices like this, we would not improve access to COVID testing for all Nunavummiut. The Department of Health continues to work on acquiring diagnostic capability that can be rapidly deployed and will provide quick access to results for all Nunavummiut. The combination of machines we continue to pursue will not only allow testing in all communities but will also improve our ability to rapidly diagnose a number of other infectious diseases that threaten Nunavummiut on a regular basis. Testing for COVID-19 at the wrong time can produce incorrect results and create a false sense of reassurance.     As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Department of Health Services The Public Health Emergency has been extended until April 16.

Department of Community and Government Services - May 28, 2020 Minister of Community and Government Services update Ullaakkut, With the construction season upon us the Government of Nunavut (GN) has undertaken necessary preparations for construction projects to proceed during the summer and fall of 2020 in 19 Nunavut communities. This includes over 50 capital projects valued at approximately $600 million. Given the significant size of our construction program, we rely on a certain level of skilled workers from southern Canada to work on these projects alongside our Inuit and Northern labour. In consultation with Dr. Patterson, arrangements have been made to ensure that all southern workers comply with the strict requirement of the 14-day isolation period before travelling to Nunavut. The GN will control and monitor these measures at the isolation facilities in the south during the 14 days including up until workers board their flights. This follows the procedures for residents and medical travellers already in place. We need to balance the long-term infrastructure needs of communities with the current COVID-19 restrictions and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the municipalities, especially our mayors and councillors, for taking an active role in the decision to proceed with these projects during the 2020 construction season. I also would like to acknowledge the construction companies for their understanding of, and the need to respect, the directives set by Dr. Patterson to ensure that the construction projects move ahead with an understanding of maintaining the health and well-being of the workers and all Nunavummiut. Despite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are looking forward to a safe and productive construction season this summer. Thank you.   Department of Community and Government services - April 30, 2020  Critical services will be maintained in Pond Inlet, and plans are in place to ensure that access to services such as heat, power, water, sewer, and communications will not be interrupted. Community and Government Services (CGS), along with the municipality, has a plan in place for a water intake/pumping solution to ensure the community has ongoing access to water The temporary pumping system will include: A pump set up on the shore of the reservoir, Suction hose put through a drilled hole in the ice, A discharge hose to supply water into the back of the water truck, Manual chlorination into the back of the truck, and, The pump will be set up in a temporary porta-tank to provide containment for fuel refilling. 		  This solution can be managed by municipality staff. CGS is actively working on a permanent solution to be implemented later this summer. Department of Community and Government services - April 20, 2020  The Department of Community and Government services is providing an additional $2 million to municipalities to cover expenses related to COVID-19. This additional funding will ensure that hamlets are able to provide unforeseen services in response to the pandemic.  Eligible expenses include but are not limited to the purchase of cleaning materials, hiring additional staff, expenses for additional road clearing, by-law and enforcement patrols, and to cover lost revenues resulting from facility closures. Municipalities can contact their CGS regional community development office for more information.

The Government of Nunavut is managing several hubs, and dealing with a large number of requests from both medical and non-essential travellers. In an attempt to help clear up some of the delays to get into the hubs, Iqaluit is being looked at as one of several options to help relieve the wait time for medical travellers in Winnipeg. This has not been finalized and we are actively looking at the possibility of creating a second hub in Winnipeg, specifically for medical travellers. Our commitment is to ensure our medical travellers are well cared for and we are prioritizing their stays above non-essential travellers. We understand the concerns raised on social media over the weekend. However, nothing has been confirmed about an Iqaluit or additional Winnipeg hub. We recognize the fear and uncertainty that comes with COVID-19. However, we need to balance that fear with facts, the best possible care for Nunavummiut and our commitment to public health and safety. When there is an official course of action on this, we will announce it with all the relevant information. As we work to relieve this backlog, we thank those waiting for a spot in the isolation hubs for their patience and understanding. We are working around the clock to keep our territory and Nunavummiut safe. Thanks to all the staff who have worked so hard to keep everyone well during COVID-19.

On July 20, all licensed establishments in the territory will be allowed to open with regular hours. Nunavut will also be extending its common travel area to include Churchill, Manitoba. This bubble is exclusive to the community of Churchill and does not extend to other regions of Manitoba. The common travel area applies to air, land and water travel and exempts travellers from isolation requirements in either Nunavut or Churchill under certain conditions: Travel must originate from Nunavut to Churchill or from Churchill to Nunavut. Travellers must have not been outside either Churchill or Nunavut for 2 weeks prior to travelling. Travellers must remain in either Nunavut or Churchill for the duration of their stay. Prior to travelling outside of Nunavut, travellers must contact the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer for Nunavut and provide: Contact information, such as an address and phone number, at the person’s regular place of residence; and A written declaration that can be obtained by emailing CPHOtravelrequests@gov.nu.ca or by going to the Department of Health’s website. When travelling by air, travellers are required to obtain a letter from the CPHO authorizing travel or they will not be permitted to board their flight. Those who leave the common travel area outside of Churchill will need to isolate for 14 days at a government isolation facility, prior to returning to Nunavut. I would like to also take this opportunity to thank all Nunavummiut for their patience as we work together to protect our territory and families from COVID-19. Thank you 			   			  As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

We are still waiting on confirmatory results for the presumptive case detected in the Mary River Mine, with the expectation that they will be ready sometime this week. The Department of Health continues to monitor the situation at the Mary River Mine site closely, and we will provide support as needed. I want to take this opportunity and remind Nunavummiut that: Testing is only one component of the Public Health response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Testing is important, but it is not a replacement for social distancing or hand-washing. Testing is important, but it is absolutely not a replacement for 14 days of isolation. The Government of Nunavut follows testing guidelines and best practices that have been endorsed by the World Health Organization and Health Canada. We rely on diagnostic devices that have undergone rigorous validation and accreditation processes to provide dependable testing to Nunavummiut. Even under ideal conditions, and with validated equipment, testing is not always a reliable method of identifying cases of COVID-19 and halting transmission. There is strong evidence that false negatives can occur throughout the incubation period.

Today marks the third bi-weekly announcement for Nunavut’s Path for moving forward during COVID-19. There are still no cases of COVID-19 detected in the territory, so once again we are in a position to alter public health measures. I’m pleased to announce the following changes under the new Order Respecting Social Distancing and Gatherings, which goes into effect today: The limit for outdoor gatherings has now been increased to 50 people. The limit for indoor gatherings has been increased to 10 people. In private dwellings, this means 10 people in addition to those who reside there. The limit for gatherings at places of worship, conference facilities, community halls, rental meeting spaces, and gatherings organized by the Government of Canada, Government of Nunavut, municipal corporation, or Regional Inuit Organizations has been set at 50 people or 50% of capacity for the facility, whichever is less. In all facilities and gatherings, it is still expected that social distancing is maintained. As we take another step forward on Nunavut’s Path, and we return to some of the activities, programs, or venues that we’ve missed, we need to remain diligent in our collective commitment to practice social distancing and good hand hygiene. If you make the choice to participate in a large gathering, or attend an indoor event, or even meet up with friends for dinner, please also choose to be responsible, and choose to take actions that will keep yourself, your community, and your territory, safe. Wash your hands. Keep six feet away from others. Avoid touching your face. Sanitize high-touch areas often. Consider wearing a mask when social distancing is difficult. If you don’t feel well, stay home. Thank you. 			   			As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  Calling Ahead at Health Centres Unless you are experiencing a medical emergency, please call your health centre first before going in.

As of today, Nunavut is resuming regular medical travel to Churchill, Manitoba. As Churchill has not had a confirmed case of COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic, we have determined that the risk of resuming medical travel operations is minimal, and it is greatly outweighed by the benefits of ensuring that Nunavummiut have access to the out-of-territory care they need. Medical travellers and their escorts who travel to Churchill for treatment and do not leave the community for the duration of their stay, will be able to return directly to Nunavut without needing to isolate at a GN designated isolation facility. If the situation changes, we will re-assess and be ready to initiate contact tracing and containment measures immediately. We have also had some inquiries from cab companies regarding their operations. Under the new Order Regarding Social Distancing and Gatherings, cab companies can collect fares from multiple households at once, under specific conditions. Whenever there are multiple passengers in the cab, everyone must wear a mask. Cab drivers must provide masks for riders who do not have them. Most importantly, cab drivers must obtain consent from all passengers before picking up multiple fares. This means that any passenger who is picked up, and all subsequent fares on that ride, must indicate that they are okay with riding in a shared cab with others. All passengers can still request that they do not share their ride with others, and, for now, cab companies must comply with this request. We want to thank all cab companies who have so readily complied with recommendations to limit passenger travel and enhance sanitation procedures in order to keep Nunavummiut safe and healthy. Finally, as restaurants, bars, and other indoor locations are permitted to open, I want to continue to emphasize to Nunavummiut the necessity of social distancing, good hand hygiene, and staying home when we are sick. We need to remember, even as we return to the activities we enjoy, that this pandemic is far from over, and small actions from everyone today add up to major impacts tomorrow.

I am pleased to say that after consultation with my counterpart in the GNWT, as of today, residents of the NWT can travel to Nunavut without isolating prior to arrival. The establishment of the common travel area by air or by land between the two territories does however come with strict conditions and expectations: Travel must originate from Nunavut to the NWT or from the NWT to Nunavut. Travellers have not been outside their respective territory for two weeks prior to their travel to the NWT or Nunavut. Travellers remain in either territory for the duration of their stay. Travellers from the NWT who wish to enter Nunavut, must write to: cphotravelrequests@gov.nu.ca and complete and sign the Nunavut and NWT Traveller’s Declaration form. Failure to do so will affect entry in Nunavut. Failure to answer truthfully will be subject to fines. This also applies for Nunavummiut who wish to return home after their stay in the NWT. My office will issue a letter of approval. Travellers will be required to present the approval letter prior to boarding any airplane entering Nunavut. Isolation before entering Nunavut is still required if You are a Nunavut resident who is returning home from travel in southern Canada via Yellowknife. In this case, you will need to complete a 14-day isolation period in the GN isolation hub in Yellowknife. You are an NWT resident who has travelled outside your territory less than two weeks before your scheduled arrival in Nunavut. In this case, you will need to complete the NWT isolation requirements before applying for travel to Nunavut. I want to re-assure Nunavummiut that should the current situation change in either territory, we will re-assess the common travel area and take all necessary measures to protect the health and safety of Nunavummiut. Further Information can be found in Travel and Isolation section of the Department of Health website at https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/travel-and-isolation. Today also marks the second of our bi-weekly announcements regarding the status of current health measures. Beginning June 22: Personal service providers will also be permitted to open for one-on-one sessions. This includes hairdressers and nail salons. Again, these facilities will be responsible for ensuring that PPE is available for both clients and service providers when requested. Bars and restaurants will be allowed to re-open and operate at half capacity. Last call for alcohol service will be at 9 p.m.. Facility operators need to ensure that patrons are respecting social distancing. Liquor Inspectors have the authority to enforce orders regarding social distancing, and they will be monitoring to ensure adherence to these conditions. Theatres and churches are also permitted to re-open on June 22. On June 29: Youth centres and day camps will be able to resume operations. Long-term care facilities will begin accepting visitors in a limited capacity; they can only allow one to two visitors per resident at a time, and these visitors can only be immediate family. Guidelines for re-opening will be available on the health website in the coming days. Though we can reasonably forecast what the next two weeks may bring, we must remain aware of the possible need to change or re-introduce public health measures. While we are in a position to ease restrictions, we remain vulnerable to the impacts of this global pandemic. Every week, new information becomes available. Every week, the situation can change. What doesn’t change is that social distancing, washing your hands and staying home when you are sick are the three main actions each and everyone of us can take to keep our families and our communities safe.

Right now, travel into Nunavut represents the single biggest risk for introducing COVID-19. The travel ban, and the 14-day isolation requirements for returning Nunavummiut, are meant to mitigate this risk and keep our territory safe. Knowing that, I’d like to take this opportunity to share information on the new process being implemented for reserving stays in GN southern isolation facilities. Moving forward, all Nunavummiut who must travel outside of the territory should contact the email address NUisolationreservations@nunavutcare.ca and submit an Isolation Reservation Request Form as soon as they know their plans for travel. From there, the travel team will work to identify room availability and reserve your stay in one of the designated isolation facilities. This new streamlined process is meant to help Nunavummiut plan for their 14-day quarantine period farther in advance and ensures that our travel team can anticipate and accommodate travellers in the coming months. More information, including intake days requirements, can also be found on the Department of Health’s website. Remember, non-essential travel outside of the territory is still not recommended. All individuals who are applying for critical worker exemption will continue to use the email address CPHOTravelRequests@gov.nu.ca. Finally, the Department of Health has made temporary amendments to the Medical Travel Policy to help keep our medical travellers and escorts safe from COVID-19. Specific provisions have been added to ensure that medical travellers and escorts abide by rules of social distancing, hand-washing hygiene, and other behaviours that help to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The amendments also more clearly outline the requirements for both medical travellers and escorts to complete 14 days of self-isolation at a designated isolation facility prior to returning to Nunavut. As we continue to look at ways of easing public health measures and returning the activities we enjoy, we must remain diligent and aware that the threat of COVID-19 has not yet passed. Please continue to maintain physical distancing and handwashing practices, and limit any non-essential travel out of the territory. Thank you.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

This annual event highlights the health risks associated with tobacco use, and advocates for effective policies to reduce tobacco consumption. Right now, we are all working hard to commit to our public health measures that protect us from the threat of COVID-19. We are social distancing, staying home as much as possible, and washing our hands as much as we can. These actions are keeping ourselves, our communities, and our territory safe. Quitting tobacco use is one more step we can take to guard ourselves against the impact of this pandemic. We know that COVID-19 is mainly a respiratory virus, and early evidence suggests that smoking can make symptoms worse. Smokers are also likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19, as smoking increases the likelihood of transmission from one’s face and lips. Please remember: do not share cigarettes, joints, or pipes. Do not pick up discarded cigarette or cannabis butts. Wash your hands often, and refrain from touching your face. The best thing that we can do for our health is to quit smoking. By making the decision to quit smoking, we can help to protect ourselves from COVID-19 today, and dramatically improve our health for the coming weeks, months, and years. Support is available for anyone who wants to explore options to help them quit. Message a counsellor on the Tobacco Has No Place Here Facebook page or call 1-866-368-7848 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The service is private and free. Counsellors can help you in Inuktitut, English, Inuinnaqtun and French. Nicotine replacement therapy, or NRT, is also available at no cost through the Non-Insured Health Benefits program at your local health centre or pharmacy. Call ahead, and ask your health care provider for information and options for NRT. Thank you. Chief Public Health Officer update Good morning. Today marks the start of Nunavut’s Path forward. Day cares, territorial parks, and playgrounds are permitted to re-open, and the size limit for outdoor gatherings has been increased to 25. Today will also be the first of our bi-weekly assessments concerning the modification of public health measures. As we look at altering public health measures, I want to take a moment and emphasize to all Nunavummiut the continued importance of social distancing. While we are in a position today to alter measures, we are not in a position to take social distancing for granted. We’ve noticed through the contact tracing of persons under investigation that people’s contact bubbles are becoming noticeably larger. Larger contact bubbles will make it significantly more challenging to identify and prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. COVID-19 continues to pose a risk to Nunavummiut, and we are not immune to this pandemic. We’ve made it this far thanks to our collective efforts, but those efforts absolutely have to continue. With that said, I’m pleased to announce the following modifications to public health measures that will be occurring over the next two weeks. Effective immediately, in-territory travel advisories are lifted. Travel outside of Nunavut is still not recommended. Individuals who are travelling outside of the territory need to be aware not only of the isolation procedures to return, but also of the measures that other jurisdictions may have in place to limit or discourage travel. On June 8, workplaces and retail outlets are permitted to re-open, provided that they have safety measures in place. Galleries, museums, and libraries may also be opened for individual viewing and browsing, though group sessions are still prohibited. There will also be an increased availability of in-person health assessments at health centres across the territory. On June 15, dental clinics, physiotherapy clinics, massage therapy, and chiropractic treatments are permitted to resume. Gyms and pools will also be permitted to re-open for solo workouts and lap swimming only. Please note, that all these measures are subject to alteration should conditions change.

Department of Health Services, May 28, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update Good morning. I’d like to take this opportunity to clarify the conditions required in order for us to consider altering the current border measures in place. I have previously indicated that the border restrictions currently in place will likely be among the final public health measures that are lifted. This is because right now travel into Nunavut from outside of the territory represents the highest risk. If we want to continue Nunavut’s Path, and remove additional public health measures inside the territory, then we need to maintain our strict travel measures. This is our best chance to both return to the activities we enjoy and the programs we depend on, while still protecting the health and safety of Nunavummiut. With that said, fulfillment of any of the following conditions may influence decisions to alter our border measures. Development of a vaccine for COVID-19. We’ve already discussed this, and though it is unlikely that a vaccine will be developed and readily available in the near future, it is still a factor that would greatly influence all of our public health measures; Development or discovery of an effective treatment for COVID-19; Indication that COVID-19 is under control in our neighboring jurisdictions. This means that beyond just decreasing case numbers, we would need to see evidence that community transmission in neighboring jurisdictions is minimal and contained; And finally, achievement of sustainable and on-going diagnostic capacity in every community in Nunavut. Unfortunately, many of these factors are outside of our control, but we will continue to monitor the evolving global situation. As always, our decisions surrounding the border measures will be guided by evidence and will be designed to protect and preserve the health and safety of Nunavummiut throughout this global pandemic. I would like to remind Nunavummiut that as of Monday, June 1, playgrounds, territorial parks, and daycares are permitted to open, and the size of outdoor gatherings may increase to 25. On June 1, we will also begin our bi-weekly announcements on the assessment and potential easing of additional public health measures. The reason we have chosen two weeks as our interval of choice is straightforward. All evidence suggests that 14 days is the maximum incubation time for COVID-19. So, this 14-day window will give us an opportunity to assess the situation around us and make informed decisions based on the latest information available. Please remember that if a threat is detected, we may need to react immediately. We will provide as much warning as possible, but we may need to introduce additional public health measures right away. Finally, the Department is issuing a Public Health Advisory to the community of Sanikiluaq due to the detection of pertussis, also known as whooping cough. Whooping cough is a disease of the throat or lungs that is spread easily from person to person. Anyone can get whooping cough, but the most severe cases are in young children. For that reason, the daycare in Sanikiluaq must remain closed for the time being. Thank you.  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

These past two months have not been easy, and all Nunavummiut have had to make sacrifices. However, thanks to our combined efforts, we are protecting our families, our communities, and our territory from this pandemic, and I hope that all Nunavummiut can feel a sense of pride knowing that their actions are making a deep and measurable impact on keeping Nunavut healthy and safe. It is time for us to move forward. This does not mean that this pandemic is over. This does not mean that the threat has passed. This means that we can cautiously begin our return to the activities we enjoy, knowing that at any time we may need to change our behaviour to protect ourselves from emerging threats. In the coming weeks, we will work with our stakeholders to re-introduce our businesses, our activities, and our programs in a way that is safe, sustainable, and poses the least risk to the health and safety of Nunavummiut. Know that as we begin to loosen restrictions internally, it is imperative that our strict border measures remain to minimize the risk of introducing COVID-19 into the territory. With that being said, I’m pleased to announce that as of June 1: Daycares will be permitted to open up for regular business. The size limit for outdoor gatherings will increase to 25 people. Territorial parks will be allowed to reopen for outdoor activities only, if local circumstances permit. All park buildings will remain closed. Municipal playgrounds will be allowed to re-open, again, if local circumstances permit. These particular conditions have been selected because they are deemed low risk. Moving forward, our plan is to re-assess our condition every two weeks. If the state of COVID in Nunavut is favorable, we will continue to lift public health measures, beginning with lower risk activities and programs. If our condition is stable, we may remain at the status quo until we are confident that lifting additional restrictions would not pose an undue risk to Nunavummiut. Finally, if the threat of COVID-19 increases, or eased public health measures are posing a potential public health threat to the territory, we may need to introduce or re-introduce certain conditions. I share in everyone’s desire to return to normal. We all want to know when we can confidently and safely travel within our own territory, or to our neighbouring jurisdictions. However, trying to forecast specific dates and timelines for when we can lift all of our public health measures would be inaccurate, and frankly, it would be insincere. The COVID-19 pandemic is evolving rapidly, and every single week yields new information that shapes our strategy and our public health measures. Predictions and decisions made on the basis of today’s understanding of the virus may be obsolete in a short time. For this reason, we have opted for an approach that is flexible, cautious, and adaptive to the evolving situation around us. Again, I want to thank all Nunavummiut for their continued patience and understanding. No one is left unaffected by this pandemic, but our collective accountability has kept Nunavut safe so far. This accountability and responsibility needs to continue, and, as we loosen restrictions, we must continue to practice social distancing, stay away from others when we are sick and wash our hands often. Thank you.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

I am pleased to announce several items today. The first is that Rankin Inlet now has the ability to provide testing if a positive case is confirmed in-territory. I’d like to commend the medical and laboratory staff, especially Matt Stacey and Dr. Jasmine Pawa, who have been working tirelessly to become acquainted with the GeneXpert machine, and to ensure that it can be managed safely, efficiently, and accurately. Getting this machine up and running is a significant step forward for Nunavut, as this now fulfills our criteria of obtaining reliable and effective in-territory diagnostic capacity. When coupled with the fact that we still have no confirmed cases of COVID-19 inside the territory, we have now met two of our three conditions. While the situation in southern Canada will continue to play a role in our approach moving forward, we are now in a better position to consider reducing some restrictions in the territory. I have one other piece of news I would like to share. Moving forward, Kitikmeot medical travellers receiving treatment in Yellowknife are no longer required to undergo the 14-day isolation period, and instead will be permitted to return home immediately. This decision has been made through consultation with the Northwest Territories and is contingent on there being no active cases of COVID-19 in the NWT. Please note that this is for medical travellers only, and this is only when their treatment is provided in Yellowknife. Any medical traveller who needs to leave the Northwest Territories to receive treatment in other cities in Canada will still be required to complete their 14-day isolation period. For all medical travellers to whom this new rule applies who are currently in quarantine, we are working to get you home as soon as possible. As always, our main goal is the safety, health and well being of Nunavummiut. I would like to thank you all for your patience, understanding and support as we continue to care for our families and our communities.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, May 8, 2020 Minister of Health update: It was announced at the start of this year by the World Health Organization that all of 2020 was to be recognized as the Year of the Nurse and the Midwife. This was an opportunity to celebrate the vital role of nurses and midwives in the delivery of health care services across the world. Several months later, in the midst of this global pandemic, we are not just talking about their essential role in keeping us healthy, we are experiencing it firsthand. Nurses and midwives continue to deliver vital health care services in our territory, in our country, and throughout the world. May 11 to 17 is recognized as National Nursing Week. As our nurses work tirelessly to ensure that Nunavummiut have access to the care they need, I think it’s important that we all take this opportunity to show them our immense gratitude for their service and their contribution to this territory. Nunavut has more than 300 nurses who are essential to the development and delivery of programs that keep Nunavummiut healthy. In these uncertain times, as the world battles COVID-19, our nurses are on the front line, providing care to those who need it most. This pandemic has demonstrated our nurses’ willingness to put their own health and safety at risk to protect and care for those around them. This National Nursing Week, and indeed this entire Year of The Nurse and Midwife, give us an opportunity to shine a spotlight on these essential health staff. However, our gratitude for your service is not restricted to a single week, or a single year. I would like all Nunavummiut to join me in showing our ongoing appreciation for your continued dedication to this territory. Thank you.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, May 6, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update: Since it was confirmed that the detected COVID case in Nunavut was a false positive, the territory has witnessed great displays of solidarity, support, and pride. The additional restrictions in Pond Inlet have been lifted, and I hope that the community feels a measure of relief knowing that they are still COVID-free. This is good news. As a territory, we have done well so far. However, we cannot allow our celebration to lapse into complacency. It is more important than ever that we maintain these rules that we’ve all become familiar with. The threat of COVID-19 is still very real and we need to stay the course. Practise social distancing. Avoid contact with individuals who are not a member of your household. Limit trips for errands. Purchase only the supplies that your household needs. And, of course, wash your hands. There is no combination of measures that can absolutely guarantee the prevention of COVID-19. Even as we celebrate for Pond Inlet, all Nunavummiut need to remain vigilant and cautious. Follow the rules, and encourage your friends, family, and neighbours to do the same. I want to thank all Nunavummiut for their continued patience, understanding, and cooperation. We can only get through this together.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Travel outside the territory as of May 7, 2020: The Government of Nunavut’s decision to charge $2,100 per individual and $1,050 for each additional family member during the mandatory 14-day isolation stays for residents returning to the territory has been reversed. The Government of Nunavut will continue to cover these costs as long as mandatory isolation for residents returning to the territory is in place. Please keep in mind that travel outside of Nunavut during the COVID-19 pandemic is not advised.    Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

This means that although the first test result showed COVID-19 infection, further investigation and testing have not shown any other evidence of COVID-19 infection in Pond Inlet. As I have previously mentioned, no lab test is perfect. There is always a chance of false positive or false negative results. When interpreting results and deciding on an appropriate course of action, we consider many pieces of information, of which test results are just one piece. We always aim to err on the side of caution. Diagnostic tests are part of an entire system of measures to intervene on COVID-19 infection. In these circumstances the test gave an incorrect result, but the rest of the system (public health nurses, contact tracing, surveillance) have not identified any other cases of COVID-19 infection. The information available so far includes: The individual involved has not been outside of Pond Inlet for some time. We have not identified an exposure to COVID-19. We have not found any other cases of COVID-19 in Pond Inlet. We have not noticed any increase in significant respiratory infections. 		  For all of the reasons above we believe that the individual in Pond Inlet does not, and never did have COVID-19. As a result, our rapid response team will stop operating in Pond Inlet and the members of the team will begin preparing for future deployments. All territorial orders under the Public Health Emergency remain in effect. However, the additional measures specific to Pond Inlet as a result of the positive COVID-19 case are now lifted. Effective immediately, travel between Pond Inlet and other Nunavut communities may resume, and the community-specific restrictions on businesses and services in Pond Inlet are also rescinded.      Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

The Rapid Response Team is in the community, and they are implementing containment and contact tracing. As the team completes additional testing, there is the possibility that more positive cases may be confirmed in the community. This does not necessarily mean that there is community transmission and should not be cause for alarm. What this does mean is that the Rapid Response Team is doing their job, which is finding the virus and stopping it from spreading. Containment is key, and right now it is our top priority. As this process takes place, the Government of Nunavut will continue to support the community of Pond Inlet. I also want to take a moment and thank the municipality of Pond Inlet and its residents for allowing me to answer their questions earlier today on the community radio. Moving forward, I would like to remind all Nunavummiut, using the strongest possible terms, that every single social interaction carries a degree of risk. Despite all of the Government of Nunavut’s preventative measures, and the new containment measures now in place within Pond Inlet, it is impossible to reasonably predict where or when COVID-19 may be detected next. I urge all Nunavummiut to exercise a high degree of caution, and to seriously consider these risks before participating in a gathering of any kind. If you deem it necessary to participate in gatherings, then please keep track of the people with whom you interact, as this information may be necessary in case contact tracing needs to be conducted in your community. Health staff cannot get us through this alone. How well we do, and where we go from here, depends on the actions of every single Nunavummiut. Right now, the best way of slowing the spread of COVID-19 continues to be through social distancing and effective hygiene. If everyone follows these rules together, we can put ourselves in the best position to make it through this uncertain time. It’s more important than ever that we be careful, responsible, kind, and supportive. I’d like to thank Nunavummiut for their continued cooperation and understanding. As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Travel outside the territory as of May 7, 2020 Starting May 7, 2020, Nunavummiut who chose to travel outside Nunavut while the CPHO’s travel ban is still in effect will have to cover the costs of their 14-day isolation period in one of the Government of Nunavut’s isolation sites. The fee for a single individual in a room is $2,100 for the 14-day period, and each additional family member in the room will pay $1,050. Updates will be provided as they become available. 		   Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, April 30, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update As you have seen and heard, today we have announced that a case of COVID-19 has been detected within Pond Inlet. Since the onset of the pandemic, we knew that no combination of preventative measures can absolutely guarantee the prevention of COVID-19. We anticipated that sooner or later the virus would be detected in the territory. Just as we have poured extensive effort into our prevention plan, so too have we developed a comprehensive response plan to minimize, to the greatest possible extent, the impact that COVID-19 has on Nunavut. We have been in contact with hamlet authorities and have initiated our Rapid Response Plan. A Rapid Response Team has already been deployed to Pond Inlet and is scheduled to arrive early this afternoon. That team will immediately initiate containment measures, begin contact tracing, and monitor the health and well-being of persons on home isolation orders. The Pond Inlet Health Centre is well-staffed and prepared, and health centre operations will continue. All passenger travel in and out of Pond Inlet has ceased. This includes any movement in or out of the community by land travel. This travel ban is a necessary containment measure to minimize the risk of COVID-19 spreading to multiple communities at once. Until we have determined the potential spread of the virus within the community, all non-essential offices and services will be closed. There is to be no social gatherings within dwellings, and all residents of Pond Inlet are asked to continue to maintain social distancing and good hygiene. For residents of Pond Inlet, we recognize that this news may be frightening. However, the Government of Nunavut would like to assure everyone that although travel is restricted, you are not cut off from help and support. Critical services will be maintained, and plans are in place to ensure that access to services such as heat, power, water, sewer, and communications will not be interrupted. Our primary focus now is to detect and contain the virus to prevent further transmission within the community and to other communities. Anyone who has reason to believe that they have been exposed to the virus is advised to call the COVID-19 hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. or 6 p.m. or call your community health centre. Please, do not go to the health centre in person unless you are instructed to by a health official. To all Nunavummiut, know that the preventative measures that we have all been taking are more important now than ever. Everyone needs to practise social distancing, stay home whenever possible, and avoid contact with those who are not a member of your household. Together, our efforts can slow the spread of COVID-19. Finally, I remind everyone of the importance of kindness. Now is not the time for blame, or shame. It is the time for compassion, empathy, and support of your fellow Nunavummiut. The Government of Nunavut thanks all Nunavummiut for their efforts to date. We will continue to exhaust all efforts to contain the virus, and minimize its impact on Pond Inlet, and on all the territory. Only together can we all protect our territory from the threat of COVID-19.    Department of Health Services  Residents of Pond Inlet must call their health centre first. All regular appointments at the Pond Inlet Health Centre have been cancelled. Only emergency services are available.  COVID-19 Hotline and self-assessment tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or call their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days. Nunavummiut can also use the self-assessment tool available at www.gov.nu.ca COMMUNITY TRAVEL AND GATHERINGS RESTRICTION ORDER POND INLET All travel to and from Pond Inlet is banned except: People with a letter from the CPHO Medevac patients Flight crews Nunavut Inuit exercising their hunting rights as set out in Article 5 may leave and return to Pond Inlet but not travel to any other community People travelling on a flight which must land in Pond Inlet due to weather or emergency Medevac crews must restrict movements to the airport and the health centre and must wear personal protective equipment. All businesses operating in Pond Inlet must close except for: Grocery stores Fuel and motor vehicle stations Post office Restaurants open for take out service All social gatherings shall be restricted to five persons or fewer. No social gatherings in dwellings. The order can be consulted at:https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/covid-19-novel-coronavirus   Department of Health Services, April 29, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update As many of you may know, some jurisdictions in Canada have started or will soon begin a gradual lifting of the restrictions they have implemented to flatten the COVID curve. Today I’d like to speak in more detail about what needs to happen before we can do the same. There are three conditions that need to be met before we can consider relaxing existing restrictions in the territory. They are as follows: We need to achieve in-territory diagnostic capacity. This means that we need to be able to implement a rapid, accurate, and comprehensive COVID-19 testing program here in Nunavut; There needs to be significant indication that rates of COVID-19 are decreasing in the southern jurisdictions to which Nunavummiut most often travel; and There needs to remain no active cases of COVID-19 within Nunavut. The nature of these conditions means that it is difficult to assign a specific timeline to re-opening, but fulfillment of these conditions is necessary to minimize risk to public health and safety. We need to know that Nunavummiut travelling outside of the territory can do so safely, and we need to be able to respond rapidly to any confirmed cases of COVID-19 within Nunavut. I know that people are eager to go back to work, visit loved ones, and engage in social activities. However, if we lift these restrictions too early, we will increase the risk to Nunavummiut. If we aren’t careful about how we transition back from these restrictions, then we could effectively undo all the hard work and sacrifices that we’ve made over the past seven weeks. It is as important as ever that we stay the course: maintain social distancing, stay home whenever possible, and wash your hands often. These measures continue to be the best defence against COVID-19, and the best way to protect our families, our communities, and our territory.   Department of Health Services Access to health care services will remain available in all communities seven days a week. All non-urgent requests will be triaged daily. Immediate access to urgent and emergent health care services are and will continue to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. All clients are asked to call before presenting at a health facility. In Iqaluit, public health, the emergency room and inpatient unit will remain open. Well baby clinics, prenatal visits and immunizations are continuing across Nunavut. Physicians will continue community visits. If this is not possible, the visits will be conducted by telehealth or by phone.   Volumes  Total (All Isolation Locations)   Traveler Type   Guests in Isolation as of April 28   Medical Travel   206   Public   136   Total   342    Traveller repatriation summary:  Departure Date   # of Travellers from Isolation Sites   April 29   38   April 30   15   May 1   19   May 2   6   May 3   14    Critical Worker Requests As of April 28, there are 786 requests, 597 of which are critical worker requests.

The new order adds clarity around gatherings and social distancing and provides easy to understand scenarios that will help Nunavummiut more easily follow the order. It will also help businesses understand how to adjust their operations to ensure public safety and continued operation. Finally, the changes will also assist law enforcement and peace officers to more easily interpret the intent of the order in the unlikely event there is a need for enforcement. I’d like to outline some of the new definitions and information provided in the new order. Food service establishments and licensed premises remain closed. Restaurants can still provide options for take-out or delivery, as long as they abide by the rules of social distancing while doing so. All businesses deemed as Personal Service Providers must also remain closed. These include hair dressing, barbering, massage therapy, and other similar establishments. Additionally, dentists, veterinarians, and psychologists must remain closed, except for emergencies. Public playgrounds, municipal parks, and day-use areas of territorial parks also remain closed. Though still subject to closures and limitations, the following businesses are permitted to remain open: any business large enough to maintain a two-metre social distance within the workplace, or businesses that limit customers to no more than five at a time. The five-at-a-time rule does not apply to businesses that are large enough to maintain social distancing throughout the entire premise, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and similar facilities. The order provides a definition to gatherings. All organized public gatherings of more than five people remain prohibited. This includes concerts, community events, sporting events, and ceremonies such as marriages, funerals, or memorial services. Finally, all social gatherings, including social gatherings in private dwellings, shall be restricted to five persons or fewer. This includes play groups, club meetings, and meals with individuals who do not reside together. This new order does not mean that restrictions are being loosened, or that the Government of Nunavut has re-assessed the territory’s position or tolerance for risk. Instead, the definitions under this new order have been aligned with definitions being applied in other jurisdictions. This makes restrictive measures clearer and more consistent in their application and enforcement. It is strongly recommended that Nunavummiut limit contact with anyone who is not a member of their immediate household. Any social gathering carries a degree of risk, especially when we are looking at individuals from multiple different households mingling together. Nunavummiut must still exercise caution at all times, practise social distancing to the greatest extent possible, and wash hands and all shared surfaces thoroughly and often. The previous order met the intended purpose of providing necessary tools to help protect public health. However, The Government of Nunavut recognized the need to provide clearer language and definitions. For this reason, the Department of Justice worked with the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) to prepare a new Order to ensure the language is clear and understandable while remaining true to its intent.

This resource is user-friendly, available in all four official languages, and can be accessed through the Government of Nunavut webpage at https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/covid-19-novel-coronavirus. The purpose of this self-assessment tool is to provide Nunavummiut with real-time information and recommendations based on self-reported symptoms or recent travel history. The tool will help Nunavummiut determine whether they should self-isolate, and when they should contact a health care service provider for additional follow-up or testing.

This means that many Nunavummiut currently in the south are coming to the end of their mandatory 14-day isolation periods. It is time for many of these residents to return home. The mandatory rules we put in place in our isolation sites are very strict. I think it is important to remind everyone that for 14 days, residents are: Confined in their hotel rooms most of the day. Have no physical contact with other residents undergoing isolation and no physical contact with the general population. Are allowed only monitored outings on hotel grounds. Must have daily health check-ins with on-site nurses. Are held responsible if they break isolation. There are no exceptions. These measures are a first step and they ensure Nunavummiut who want to come home, as well as their families and communities, remain healthy and safe. The second step is bringing residents home. I want to take a moment and outline this process: 48 hours before anticipated departure, travellers are informed on the clearance and travel process. The day before departure, the nurses on-site review each traveller’s daily check-in logs to make sure they complied with the isolation rules. The nurses conduct a final in-person assessment to ensure travellers are healthy and show no symptoms of COVID-19. The assessments and results are sent to my office – and a decision to clear a traveller for the scheduled return home is made and a letter approving travel is issued. Residents need both the letter and a proof of residency to return to the territory. The day of departure, residents approved for travel are transported from the hotel to the airport via a private shuttle, sanitized thoroughly before use. The Government of Nunavut worked with airlines to minimize, to the greatest possible extent, the risk of anyone being exposed to COVID-19 during their travel back to the territory. Airports have enhanced cleaning, sanitation and passenger procedures throughout the check-in and security process that ensure physical distancing. As an additional precaution, residents will also undergo an airline health check prior to boarding. Until they arrive at their final destination in Nunavut, residents remain bound by the isolation agreement they signed the day they accepted to enter the isolation sites. Residents will travel to Nunavut on both chartered and scheduled flights: Residents travelling on chartered flights are shuttled directly to their airplane for boarding and take-off. Once in Nunavut, they will be chartered to their final in-territory destination. Residents travelling on scheduled flights are dropped off at the airport, where they are met and guided by airline employees to check-in, through security, to the boarding area and finally on the plane. They do not come in contact with other travellers during this process and remain bound by their isolation agreement. I want to thank our returning residents for going through these drastic measures to protect their communities and Nunavut. As we welcome back friends, family members, and loved ones, it is more important than ever to follow the rules: All social gatherings are still banned, and all Nunavummiut, including those just returning to their home communities, are expected to do their part to keep Nunavut safe. Practice strict social distancing, stay home when possible, avoid contact with individuals outside of your household, and monitor your health.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Department of Health Services Isolation Sites Those in isolation have access to cable, internet, three meals a day, fresh linens and cleaning supplies.

This equipment will be used to test mine staff for COVID-19. At this time there is no evidence that screening in this fashion is a substitute for 14 days of isolation. This is why Nunavut, and every other Canadian jurisdiction, is using 14 days of isolation after exposure or travel. As a result, I have informed management of Agnico Eagle Mines that these tests do not change the current requirement for mine staff to stay out of the town of Rankin Inlet. The Department of Health is committed to improving and protecting the health of all Nunavummiut. For COVID-19 this means having testing equipment that meets Canadian standards and can be deployed to every community in Nunavut. The equipment used by AEM does not meet these criteria. If the Department of Health were to commit to using devices like this, we would not improve access to COVID testing for all Nunavummiut. The Department of Health continues to work on acquiring diagnostic capability that can be rapidly deployed and will provide quick access to results for all Nunavummiut. The combination of machines we continue to pursue will not only allow testing in all communities but will also improve our ability to rapidly diagnose a number of other infectious diseases that threaten Nunavummiut on a regular basis. Testing for COVID-19 at the wrong time can produce incorrect results and create a false sense of reassurance.     As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Department of Health Services The Public Health Emergency has been extended until April 16.

31,2020-07-27,Canada,Nunavut,,https://gov.nu.ca/education/news/covid-19-department-education-services-update,Government Website,COVID-19 Department of Education Services update,"   27 July 2020        Department of Education Services, July 27, 2020 On Friday, July 24, the Department of Education release the 2020-21 Opening Plan for Nunavut Schools: Health and Safety.  Because there are no confirmed or probable cases of COVID-19 in Nunavut, all schools will open, as scheduled, for the new school year, unless otherwise directed by Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO). To see when your school opens and the Department of Education’s 2020-21 Opening Plan for Nunavut Schools, visit: https://gov.nu.ca/education/information/2020-21-opening-plan-nunavut-schools Planning for 2020-21 School Year All schools will open, as scheduled, for the new school year, unless otherwise directed by CPHO. 4 stages have been developed to direct school operations depending on the impacts of COVID-19 in each community. The CPHO will determine when a community moves from stage to stage. For updates, check the Department of Education website and listen to GN press conferences. Educators/School Staff Educator recruitment is on track for the 2020-21 school year. 									There are currently 30 open educator positions across the territory.  Teachers and school staff are not defined as critical workers and are required to follow the same isolation process as other Nunavummiut returning to the territory. The department worked with the Department of Health to secure reservations in the hubs and return travel dates and ensure out of territory school staff could return for the start of the school year. Health and Safety Restrictions Health and safety restrictions are different in schools than everywhere else for several reasons: 									It is critical to balance the risk of direct infection and transmission of COVID-19 in children with the harms of school closure on their physical and mental health.  Current evidence suggests that children may be less susceptible to COVID-19 infection and may be less likely to transmit the virus to others. Schools are controlled environments, and any potential spread of the virus can be managed and tracked more easily.  The Department of Education, the CPHO, and DEAs/CSFN were involved in the development of the health and safety plans. Cleaning will be enhanced in all schools, and custodians will receive guidelines and training. Learning and Instruction The focus in the first several months of school will be on learning recovery, assessment, and instruction. School staff will receive guidelines and a toolkit for learning, instruction, and assessment, including information on remote instruction, and expectations for communicating with students. Physical distancing and masks Physical distancing requirements depend on the stage a community is in. Adjusting the percentage of students in school will help support limited contact between students, as needed. The department will work with schools and DEAs in Stages 2 and 3 regarding physical distancing requirements, including organizing students by cohort. In general, the use of masks is not recommended for children. 									At the discretion of the CPHO, there may be some instances where students should wear masks. Some school staff may wear masks, if they are unable to physically distance when required by the CPHO.  School assemblies will be avoided so as not to mix classroom cohorts.   Department of Education Services, July 20, 2020 The Department of Education will be releasing the 2020-21 Opening Plan for Nunavut Schools at the end of July.  Keeping our staff and students safe is the Department of Education’s highest priority. By working closely with the Chief Public Health Officer, and providing clear guidelines around health and safety, the Department of Education can ensure that our students are learning in a safe, supportive environment.   Department of Education Services, July 13, 2020  Since March 17, when schools were closed to students, the Department of Education has been working diligently in preparation for the upcoming 2020-21 school year, specifically addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. Information on plans and guidelines for opening schools will be made available to the public as they are finalized. These will include detailed guidelines on health and safety, as well as recovery learning and assessment, and student and staff wellbeing. The Department of Education will be releasing the first document of its school opening plan later this month, after it has been reviewed by the Chief Public Health Officer and the department has heard from education stakeholders. Keeping our staff and students safe is the Department of Education’s highest priority. By working closely with the Chief Public Health Officer, and providing clear guidelines around health and safety, the Department of Education can ensure that our students are learning in a safe, supportive environment. On Wednesday, July 15, David Joanasie, Minister of Education, and Dr. Michael Patterson, Chief Public Health Officer, will be teleconferencing with District Education Authorities, the Commission scolaire francophone du Nunavut, and the Coalition of Nunavut District Education Authorities to discuss health and safety considerations related to the Department of Education’s school opening plan.   Department of Education Services, July 6, 2020  Since March 17, when schools were closed to students, the Department of Education has been working diligently in preparation for the upcoming 2020-21 school year, specifically addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Department of Education will be connecting with all licensed child-care facilities in the coming days.     Department of Education Services, May 8, 2020  Child Care Facilities From March 17 to April 21, 2020, the Government of Nunavut provided licenced child care facilities $885,000 to cover parental fees. This funding enabled facilities to continue paying staff while transitioning to financial assistance programs offered by the Government of Canada, such as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the Canadian Wage Subsidy Program. The Canadian Wage Subsidy Program covers 75% of staff’s wages and has now been extended beyond June. The Department of Education provides licenced child care facilities with 				$4.2 million annually in operation and maintenance funding. This funding will continue while facilities are closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Department of Education continues to provide licencing for child care facilities, training for staff, and create and distribute educational resources. The Government of Nunavut continues to work with the Government of Canada, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., the regional Inuit organizations, and other stakeholders to support child care facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Department of Education Services, April 30, 2020  Schools in Pond Inlet are closed to the community, including school staff, until further notice. The physical distribution of student learning packages in Pond Inlet has been suspended until further notice. All Department of Education staff, including school staff, are to work from home if possible. These measures are to ensure the health and safety of Pond Inlet students, families, and staff. The Department of Education will provide support to other Government of Nunavut departments as needed. Department of Education Services, April 29, 2020 Student Learning Packages Many students have already received an initial learning package from their teachers. 		Most packages include learn-at-home work and activities for one or two weeks at a time. Learning packages are focused on strengthening skills in literacy, numeracy, and health and wellbeing. There is a mix of paper and electronic-based work, depending on the student and their circumstance.  Students and families should expect to receive learning packages for the rest of the school year. Learning packages are designed to reinforce the skills students have already learned and will not be expected to be assessed by teachers toward final grades. The department has provided continuity of learning guidelines for all school staff, which outline a number of ways that school staff can communicate with students and families. The department would like to thank all school staff for supporting their students and their families during these unprecedented times. Early Learning and Child Care Support Following direction from the Chief Public Health Officer, all child care facilities must remain closed to children until further notice. During this closure, the Department of Education has and will continue to pay all regular O&M funding to licensed child care facilities. 		This should account for a significant portion of the monthly operating costs of a facility. Because the day care closures were sudden and unexpected, the department paid parental fees temporarily to ensure facilities could continue to pay their staff, and to allow time for facilities to apply for federal subsidies, such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy. The total cost of this funding provided was $885,000.  Department of Education staff are ready to support child-care facilities in their applications to these federal programs, and we have been communicating with all facilities around this. The department continues to explore further options to support child care facilities, including possible use of federal funds.   Department of Education Services, April 17, 2020 Minister of Education update: Ullukkut, The well-being and success of Nunavut’s children and youth is the top priority of the Department of Education. In these uncertain times, we want to make sure students have the opportunity to thrive, and to pursue any future path they desire. With students’ well-being in mind, I am announcing that as of today, all schools in Nunavut will be closed to students for the rest of the 2019-20 school year. This closure is supported by the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO). Because students have already missed over a month of class time, it is even more important that all school staff report to work on April 21, 2020. As in other provinces and territories, Nunavut’s school staff are vital to ensuring our students do not fall behind in their education. The Department of Education has developed guidelines to help school staff prepare learning packages to meet the specific needs of their students. Staff will work with students and their families to determine how best to support learning. This means that for our students in Kindergarten to Grade 9, teachers will prioritize literacy and numeracy, while strengthening the skills and knowledge that have been taught so far this school year. For high school students, teachers and administrators will evaluate their individual situations. Some students may already have completed the credits they need to graduate. Others may need to complete specific courses to be eligible to graduate. Teachers may provide opportunities for students to upgrade their marks or earn the credits they need by completing suggested assignments and projects. Teachers will review their students’ outcomes to date, align them with skills that need to be strengthened, and take into consideration what is possible for them to accomplish at home. There will be a strong focus on supporting health and wellness, literacy, and numeracy for all students. This includes household projects and activities that allow families to learn together, such as reading together, journal writing, and projects that draw on the creativity of students. The Department is also aware that many families are currently on the land and may not be able to receive student learning packages. On-the-land activities like hunting and fishing complement student learning, and the department encourages these activities. Realizing Nunavut’s technology limitations, especially in some of our smaller communities, students’ continued learning will not be entirely online. This means that students’ learning packages will take many forms -- some will be paper-based, some will be activity-based, and some will be electronic. However, all of them will give students an opportunity to further their learning. Wherever possible, teachers will be asked to check in with families weekly, to see how they are progressing and if they need any extra support or resources. The best way to communicate -- either by phone, text, GN email, or through other online portals -- will be determined with students and families. Beyond creating student learning packages, staff also will be supporting students by assessing their work prior to the school closure to determine final grades, and preparing year-end report cards. To Nunavut’s high school students and their families, a reminder that all departmental exams are cancelled for the school year. For those Grade 12 students on track to graduate, I want to assure you that principals and teachers will work with you to ensure you complete any necessary requirements. We are here to help you succeed and realize your goals. Finally, school staff will also plan and prepare for the 2020-21 school year, particularly with the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic in mind. For school staff who have voluntarily returned to work and have already been preparing learning packages, many students and families recognize your hard work and expressed their appreciation. As a parent, and as Minister of Education, I want to express my sincere gratitude to you for your dedication and enthusiasm. Thank you for your efforts and commitment to Nunavut’s students. We all want the best for our children and youth. The Department of Education appreciates the support and patience Nunavummiut and our education partners have shown during these unprecedented times. The uncertainty has not been easy, but we will make it through, together. Stay safe everyone. Qujannamiik, quana, thank you, merci. Department of Education Services Students in Nunavut will not have class for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year. School staff will continue to work to support learning at home until the end of the school year. Students will be receiving learning packages from their schools to support learning at home. School staff will connect with families over the coming weeks. All high school diploma exams for this year are cancelled, and high school marks will be based on course work only. All students will receive a year-end report card. Department of Education Services, April 15, 2020 To ensure staff at licenced child care facilities continue to be paid, the Department of Education will fund parental fees for all licensed child care facilities up to April 21, 2020. The Government of Nunavut has taken strict measures to minimize the spread of COVID-19, this is why child care facilities must remain closed until further notice. Department of Education Services, April 8, 2020 Minister of Education update Yesterday, the Department of Education sent a letter to all school staff about returning to work in their home communities on April 21, 2020. This is specific to STAFF ONLY, so that they can prepare and develop continuity of learning plans in the case the school closure is extended. I want to clarify the numbers I provided yesterday – there are 1,185 staff who work in schools across the territory. Ninety-three (93) of these staff are currently out of the territory, making their way back to their home communities. This represents eight per cent (8%) of all school staff. Teachers across the country are working hard to support learning at home for students so that they are not disadvantaged by the school closure. Our students deserve the same supports, and this is why we are asking teachers to work during this time. Teachers returning to work will focus on supporting students in their education and their wellbeing by developing learning packages. This is particularly important for those students that do not have access to online resources and those who are on specialized learning plans. School staff who may have travelled out of territory must undergo a mandatory 14-day isolation period in a GN-designated isolation hub in the south before returning to Nunavut. This is the same process that all Nunavut residents, FANS students, and medical travel patients returning to Nunavut have been following. This process was established under the orders of the Chief Public Health Officer. Nunavut residents, including school staff, are responsible for their travel costs to return home to Nunavut. The GN is covering the cost of the isolation hubs for all Nunavut residents, including school staff. All GN staff, including teachers, are expected to work from within the territory. We will address any requests from staff who currently are out-of-territory to work remotely on a case-by-case basis. The Department of Education has been in continuous contact with the Nunavut Teachers’ Association (NTA) and the Coalition of Nunavut DEAs. They both support the decision to bring teachers back to work to ensure that students can continue to learn and are supported during school closures. Schools will only be reopened to students once the Chief Public Health Officer determines it is safe to do so. However, we need our staff back at work by April 21 to prepare for our students’ success and progress, whatever the next step may be. Department of Education Services, April 7, 2020 As of April 7, teachers currently in-territory can go back to school on a voluntary basis, in order to start developing learning packages for students. Guidelines on the delivery of those packages to students are being finalised by the Department of Education. All school staff are expected to return to work in their home communities on April 21, 2020. Teachers that are currently out of territory must undergo a 14-day isolation period in a designated isolation hub before returning to Nunavut. If teachers cannot begin their 14-day isolation period in time for their return on April 21, they must contact their principal and provide information on travel plans and correspondence with the isolation hubs to support any expected delays. On April 21, a decision will be made according to the recommendation of the Chief Public Health Officer. If school closures persist: School staff will be required to resume operations and will be asked to develop continuity of learning plans for all students. Teachers will be provided with clear guidance on how assessments, final report cards, and grade progression will be achieved. If schools re-open: School operations will resume as normal. In both cases, departmental exams for high school students have been cancelled until the end of June. Department of Education Services, April 3, 2020 On Tuesday, April 7, school staff will be able to access schools on a voluntary basis should they wish to prepare learning packages for students. The department has a working group developing guidelines for teachers identifying grade-specific areas of focus for learning packages. Packages may look different for each student. School access is for operational purposes only and not for recreation or other non-education-related activities. The department has also provided all schools with health and safety protocols related to COVID-19, including respiratory etiquette, hand washing, and physical distancing. Department of Education Services, March 31, 2020 Minister of Education update: Since March 17, Nunavut schools have been closed to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. As a result, parents and caregivers have been asking for educational resources to help their children continue to learn. Today I am announcing that the Department of Education has developed a learn-at-home website, Angirrami Ilinniarniq (angirrami.com). This website offers free access to some of the same educational resources used in our schools. These include downloadable books and e-books for pre-school ages and up; educational audiobooks and animated videos; tips and activities for learning; and resources for managing stress and mental health. There will also be links to download the department’s Inuktut language learning apps: Uqausiit Pinnguarutiit has fun activities that support Inuit language shape and sound recognition, and vocabulary development. Titirariuqsauti introduces Inuit language symbol sounds and printing paths.  Qimirrunaut is the department’s new Inuktut e-book library app. These apps are available for Android and iOS devices and can be downloaded from the Google Play or Apple App stores. Angirrami Ilinniarniq provides links to other online educational resources on subjects such as science, math, history, and social studies.  I want to also note that although the website launches today, new resources will be regularly added. The priority is to get our Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun resources online as quickly as possible. English and French resources will follow soon after. All the resources found on this site were created by the Department of Education and its partners, including the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and the Representative for Children and Youth’s Office, as well as the Departments of Family Services, Health, Environment, and Economic Development and Transportation. I want to thank all the students, parents, and caregivers for their patience. I know for many of you it has not been easy with schools and child care facilities closed. However, we must all do our part to prevent the spread of COVID-19. I assure you that my department has been working hard to get this website ready as quickly as possible. I encourage Nunavummiut to explore all the resources this website has to offer. Make learning a part of your daily routine! Qujannamiik, quana, thank you, merci. Department of Education Services, March 31, 2020 Today, the Department of Education Is launching a learn-at-home website, Angirrami Ilinniarniq (angirrami.com).

Upon recommendation from the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO), schools and daycare facility closures for students and children will be extended until end of day April 20. At that point and time, the CPHO will reassess and provide direction.

Department of Community and Government Services - May 28, 2020 Minister of Community and Government Services update Ullaakkut, With the construction season upon us the Government of Nunavut (GN) has undertaken necessary preparations for construction projects to proceed during the summer and fall of 2020 in 19 Nunavut communities. This includes over 50 capital projects valued at approximately $600 million. Given the significant size of our construction program, we rely on a certain level of skilled workers from southern Canada to work on these projects alongside our Inuit and Northern labour. In consultation with Dr. Patterson, arrangements have been made to ensure that all southern workers comply with the strict requirement of the 14-day isolation period before travelling to Nunavut. The GN will control and monitor these measures at the isolation facilities in the south during the 14 days including up until workers board their flights. This follows the procedures for residents and medical travellers already in place. We need to balance the long-term infrastructure needs of communities with the current COVID-19 restrictions and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the municipalities, especially our mayors and councillors, for taking an active role in the decision to proceed with these projects during the 2020 construction season. I also would like to acknowledge the construction companies for their understanding of, and the need to respect, the directives set by Dr. Patterson to ensure that the construction projects move ahead with an understanding of maintaining the health and well-being of the workers and all Nunavummiut. Despite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are looking forward to a safe and productive construction season this summer. Thank you.   Department of Community and Government services - April 30, 2020  Critical services will be maintained in Pond Inlet, and plans are in place to ensure that access to services such as heat, power, water, sewer, and communications will not be interrupted. Community and Government Services (CGS), along with the municipality, has a plan in place for a water intake/pumping solution to ensure the community has ongoing access to water The temporary pumping system will include: A pump set up on the shore of the reservoir, Suction hose put through a drilled hole in the ice, A discharge hose to supply water into the back of the water truck, Manual chlorination into the back of the truck, and, The pump will be set up in a temporary porta-tank to provide containment for fuel refilling. 		  This solution can be managed by municipality staff. CGS is actively working on a permanent solution to be implemented later this summer. Department of Community and Government services - April 20, 2020  The Department of Community and Government services is providing an additional $2 million to municipalities to cover expenses related to COVID-19. This additional funding will ensure that hamlets are able to provide unforeseen services in response to the pandemic.  Eligible expenses include but are not limited to the purchase of cleaning materials, hiring additional staff, expenses for additional road clearing, by-law and enforcement patrols, and to cover lost revenues resulting from facility closures. Municipalities can contact their CGS regional community development office for more information.

The Government of Nunavut is managing several hubs, and dealing with a large number of requests from both medical and non-essential travellers. In an attempt to help clear up some of the delays to get into the hubs, Iqaluit is being looked at as one of several options to help relieve the wait time for medical travellers in Winnipeg. This has not been finalized and we are actively looking at the possibility of creating a second hub in Winnipeg, specifically for medical travellers. Our commitment is to ensure our medical travellers are well cared for and we are prioritizing their stays above non-essential travellers. We understand the concerns raised on social media over the weekend. However, nothing has been confirmed about an Iqaluit or additional Winnipeg hub. We recognize the fear and uncertainty that comes with COVID-19. However, we need to balance that fear with facts, the best possible care for Nunavummiut and our commitment to public health and safety. When there is an official course of action on this, we will announce it with all the relevant information. As we work to relieve this backlog, we thank those waiting for a spot in the isolation hubs for their patience and understanding. We are working around the clock to keep our territory and Nunavummiut safe. Thanks to all the staff who have worked so hard to keep everyone well during COVID-19.

On July 20, all licensed establishments in the territory will be allowed to open with regular hours. Nunavut will also be extending its common travel area to include Churchill, Manitoba. This bubble is exclusive to the community of Churchill and does not extend to other regions of Manitoba. The common travel area applies to air, land and water travel and exempts travellers from isolation requirements in either Nunavut or Churchill under certain conditions: Travel must originate from Nunavut to Churchill or from Churchill to Nunavut. Travellers must have not been outside either Churchill or Nunavut for 2 weeks prior to travelling. Travellers must remain in either Nunavut or Churchill for the duration of their stay. Prior to travelling outside of Nunavut, travellers must contact the Office of the Chief Public Health Officer for Nunavut and provide: Contact information, such as an address and phone number, at the person’s regular place of residence; and A written declaration that can be obtained by emailing CPHOtravelrequests@gov.nu.ca or by going to the Department of Health’s website. When travelling by air, travellers are required to obtain a letter from the CPHO authorizing travel or they will not be permitted to board their flight. Those who leave the common travel area outside of Churchill will need to isolate for 14 days at a government isolation facility, prior to returning to Nunavut. I would like to also take this opportunity to thank all Nunavummiut for their patience as we work together to protect our territory and families from COVID-19.

We are still waiting on confirmatory results for the presumptive case detected in the Mary River Mine, with the expectation that they will be ready sometime this week. The Department of Health continues to monitor the situation at the Mary River Mine site closely, and we will provide support as needed. I want to take this opportunity and remind Nunavummiut that: Testing is only one component of the Public Health response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Testing is important, but it is not a replacement for social distancing or hand-washing. Testing is important, but it is absolutely not a replacement for 14 days of isolation. The Government of Nunavut follows testing guidelines and best practices that have been endorsed by the World Health Organization and Health Canada. We rely on diagnostic devices that have undergone rigorous validation and accreditation processes to provide dependable testing to Nunavummiut. Even under ideal conditions, and with validated equipment, testing is not always a reliable method of identifying cases of COVID-19 and halting transmission. There is strong evidence that false negatives can occur throughout the incubation period. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the overarching goal of our public health response is to identify, contain and break transmission. The Government of Nunavut will continue to look at emerging evidence and best practices set out by public health authorities, both nationally and globally, to shape our response to COVID-19, and will alter public health measures as and when appropriate.

Today marks the third bi-weekly announcement for Nunavut’s Path for moving forward during COVID-19. There are still no cases of COVID-19 detected in the territory, so once again we are in a position to alter public health measures. I’m pleased to announce the following changes under the new Order Respecting Social Distancing and Gatherings, which goes into effect today: The limit for outdoor gatherings has now been increased to 50 people. The limit for indoor gatherings has been increased to 10 people. In private dwellings, this means 10 people in addition to those who reside there. The limit for gatherings at places of worship, conference facilities, community halls, rental meeting spaces, and gatherings organized by the Government of Canada, Government of Nunavut, municipal corporation, or Regional Inuit Organizations has been set at 50 people or 50% of capacity for the facility, whichever is less. In all facilities and gatherings, it is still expected that social distancing is maintained. As we take another step forward on Nunavut’s Path, and we return to some of the activities, programs, or venues that we’ve missed, we need to remain diligent in our collective commitment to practice social distancing and good hand hygiene. If you make the choice to participate in a large gathering, or attend an indoor event, or even meet up with friends for dinner, please also choose to be responsible, and choose to take actions that will keep yourself, your community, and your territory, safe. Wash your hands. Keep six feet away from others. Avoid touching your face. Sanitize high-touch areas often. Consider wearing a mask when social distancing is difficult. If you don’t feel well, stay home.

As of today, Nunavut is resuming regular medical travel to Churchill, Manitoba. As Churchill has not had a confirmed case of COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic, we have determined that the risk of resuming medical travel operations is minimal, and it is greatly outweighed by the benefits of ensuring that Nunavummiut have access to the out-of-territory care they need. Medical travellers and their escorts who travel to Churchill for treatment and do not leave the community for the duration of their stay, will be able to return directly to Nunavut without needing to isolate at a GN designated isolation facility. If the situation changes, we will re-assess and be ready to initiate contact tracing and containment measures immediately. We have also had some inquiries from cab companies regarding their operations. Under the new Order Regarding Social Distancing and Gatherings, cab companies can collect fares from multiple households at once, under specific conditions. Whenever there are multiple passengers in the cab, everyone must wear a mask. Cab drivers must provide masks for riders who do not have them. Most importantly, cab drivers must obtain consent from all passengers before picking up multiple fares. This means that any passenger who is picked up, and all subsequent fares on that ride, must indicate that they are okay with riding in a shared cab with others. All passengers can still request that they do not share their ride with others, and, for now, cab companies must comply with this request. We want to thank all cab companies who have so readily complied with recommendations to limit passenger travel and enhance sanitation procedures in order to keep Nunavummiut safe and healthy. Finally, as restaurants, bars, and other indoor locations are permitted to open, I want to continue to emphasize to Nunavummiut the necessity of social distancing, good hand hygiene, and staying home when we are sick. We need to remember, even as we return to the activities we enjoy, that this pandemic is far from over, and small actions from everyone today add up to major impacts tomorrow.

I am pleased to say that after consultation with my counterpart in the GNWT, as of today, residents of the NWT can travel to Nunavut without isolating prior to arrival. The establishment of the common travel area by air or by land between the two territories does however come with strict conditions and expectations: Travel must originate from Nunavut to the NWT or from the NWT to Nunavut. Travellers have not been outside their respective territory for two weeks prior to their travel to the NWT or Nunavut. Travellers remain in either territory for the duration of their stay. Travellers from the NWT who wish to enter Nunavut, must write to: cphotravelrequests@gov.nu.ca and complete and sign the Nunavut and NWT Traveller’s Declaration form. Failure to do so will affect entry in Nunavut. Failure to answer truthfully will be subject to fines. This also applies for Nunavummiut who wish to return home after their stay in the NWT. My office will issue a letter of approval. Travellers will be required to present the approval letter prior to boarding any airplane entering Nunavut. Isolation before entering Nunavut is still required if You are a Nunavut resident who is returning home from travel in southern Canada via Yellowknife. In this case, you will need to complete a 14-day isolation period in the GN isolation hub in Yellowknife. You are an NWT resident who has travelled outside your territory less than two weeks before your scheduled arrival in Nunavut. In this case, you will need to complete the NWT isolation requirements before applying for travel to Nunavut. I want to re-assure Nunavummiut that should the current situation change in either territory, we will re-assess the common travel area and take all necessary measures to protect the health and safety of Nunavummiut. Further Information can be found in Travel and Isolation section of the Department of Health website at https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/travel-and-isolation. Today also marks the second of our bi-weekly announcements regarding the status of current health measures. Beginning June 22: Personal service providers will also be permitted to open for one-on-one sessions. This includes hairdressers and nail salons. Again, these facilities will be responsible for ensuring that PPE is available for both clients and service providers when requested. Bars and restaurants will be allowed to re-open and operate at half capacity. Last call for alcohol service will be at 9 p.m.. Facility operators need to ensure that patrons are respecting social distancing. Liquor Inspectors have the authority to enforce orders regarding social distancing, and they will be monitoring to ensure adherence to these conditions. Theatres and churches are also permitted to re-open on June 22. On June 29: Youth centres and day camps will be able to resume operations. Long-term care facilities will begin accepting visitors in a limited capacity; they can only allow one to two visitors per resident at a time, and these visitors can only be immediate family. Guidelines for re-opening will be available on the health website in the coming days. Though we can reasonably forecast what the next two weeks may bring, we must remain aware of the possible need to change or re-introduce public health measures. While we are in a position to ease restrictions, we remain vulnerable to the impacts of this global pandemic. Every week, new information becomes available. Every week, the situation can change. What doesn’t change is that social distancing, washing your hands and staying home when you are sick are the three main actions each and everyone of us can take to keep our families and our communities safe.

Right now, travel into Nunavut represents the single biggest risk for introducing COVID-19. The travel ban, and the 14-day isolation requirements for returning Nunavummiut, are meant to mitigate this risk and keep our territory safe. Knowing that, I’d like to take this opportunity to share information on the new process being implemented for reserving stays in GN southern isolation facilities. Moving forward, all Nunavummiut who must travel outside of the territory should contact the email address NUisolationreservations@nunavutcare.ca and submit an Isolation Reservation Request Form as soon as they know their plans for travel. From there, the travel team will work to identify room availability and reserve your stay in one of the designated isolation facilities. This new streamlined process is meant to help Nunavummiut plan for their 14-day quarantine period farther in advance and ensures that our travel team can anticipate and accommodate travellers in the coming months. More information, including intake days requirements, can also be found on the Department of Health’s website. Remember, non-essential travel outside of the territory is still not recommended. All individuals who are applying for critical worker exemption will continue to use the email address CPHOTravelRequests@gov.nu.ca. Finally, the Department of Health has made temporary amendments to the Medical Travel Policy to help keep our medical travellers and escorts safe from COVID-19. Specific provisions have been added to ensure that medical travellers and escorts abide by rules of social distancing, hand-washing hygiene, and other behaviours that help to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The amendments also more clearly outline the requirements for both medical travellers and escorts to complete 14 days of self-isolation at a designated isolation facility prior to returning to Nunavut. As we continue to look at ways of easing public health measures and returning the activities we enjoy, we must remain diligent and aware that the threat of COVID-19 has not yet passed. Please continue to maintain physical distancing and handwashing practices, and limit any non-essential travel out of the territory.

This annual event highlights the health risks associated with tobacco use, and advocates for effective policies to reduce tobacco consumption. Right now, we are all working hard to commit to our public health measures that protect us from the threat of COVID-19. We are social distancing, staying home as much as possible, and washing our hands as much as we can. These actions are keeping ourselves, our communities, and our territory safe. Quitting tobacco use is one more step we can take to guard ourselves against the impact of this pandemic. We know that COVID-19 is mainly a respiratory virus, and early evidence suggests that smoking can make symptoms worse. Smokers are also likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19, as smoking increases the likelihood of transmission from one’s face and lips. Please remember: do not share cigarettes, joints, or pipes. Do not pick up discarded cigarette or cannabis butts. Wash your hands often, and refrain from touching your face. The best thing that we can do for our health is to quit smoking. By making the decision to quit smoking, we can help to protect ourselves from COVID-19 today, and dramatically improve our health for the coming weeks, months, and years. Support is available for anyone who wants to explore options to help them quit. Message a counsellor on the Tobacco Has No Place Here Facebook page or call 1-866-368-7848 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The service is private and free. Counsellors can help you in Inuktitut, English, Inuinnaqtun and French.

Call ahead, and ask your health care provider for information and options for NRT. Thank you. Chief Public Health Officer update Good morning. Today marks the start of Nunavut’s Path forward. Day cares, territorial parks, and playgrounds are permitted to re-open, and the size limit for outdoor gatherings has been increased to 25. Today will also be the first of our bi-weekly assessments concerning the modification of public health measures. As we look at altering public health measures, I want to take a moment and emphasize to all Nunavummiut the continued importance of social distancing. While we are in a position today to alter measures, we are not in a position to take social distancing for granted. We’ve noticed through the contact tracing of persons under investigation that people’s contact bubbles are becoming noticeably larger. Larger contact bubbles will make it significantly more challenging to identify and prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. COVID-19 continues to pose a risk to Nunavummiut, and we are not immune to this pandemic. We’ve made it this far thanks to our collective efforts, but those efforts absolutely have to continue. With that said, I’m pleased to announce the following modifications to public health measures that will be occurring over the next two weeks. Effective immediately, in-territory travel advisories are lifted. Travel outside of Nunavut is still not recommended. Individuals who are travelling outside of the territory need to be aware not only of the isolation procedures to return, but also of the measures that other jurisdictions may have in place to limit or discourage travel. On June 8, workplaces and retail outlets are permitted to re-open, provided that they have safety measures in place. Galleries, museums, and libraries may also be opened for individual viewing and browsing, though group sessions are still prohibited. There will also be an increased availability of in-person health assessments at health centres across the territory. On June 15, dental clinics, physiotherapy clinics, massage therapy, and chiropractic treatments are permitted to resume. Gyms and pools will also be permitted to re-open for solo workouts and lap swimming only. Please note, that all these measures are subject to alteration should conditions change.

Department of Health Services, May 28, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update Good morning. I’d like to take this opportunity to clarify the conditions required in order for us to consider altering the current border measures in place. I have previously indicated that the border restrictions currently in place will likely be among the final public health measures that are lifted. This is because right now travel into Nunavut from outside of the territory represents the highest risk. If we want to continue Nunavut’s Path, and remove additional public health measures inside the territory, then we need to maintain our strict travel measures. This is our best chance to both return to the activities we enjoy and the programs we depend on, while still protecting the health and safety of Nunavummiut. With that said, fulfillment of any of the following conditions may influence decisions to alter our border measures. Development of a vaccine for COVID-19. We’ve already discussed this, and though it is unlikely that a vaccine will be developed and readily available in the near future, it is still a factor that would greatly influence all of our public health measures; Development or discovery of an effective treatment for COVID-19; Indication that COVID-19 is under control in our neighboring jurisdictions. This means that beyond just decreasing case numbers, we would need to see evidence that community transmission in neighboring jurisdictions is minimal and contained; And finally, achievement of sustainable and on-going diagnostic capacity in every community in Nunavut. Unfortunately, many of these factors are outside of our control, but we will continue to monitor the evolving global situation. As always, our decisions surrounding the border measures will be guided by evidence and will be designed to protect and preserve the health and safety of Nunavummiut throughout this global pandemic. I would like to remind Nunavummiut that as of Monday, June 1, playgrounds, territorial parks, and daycares are permitted to open, and the size of outdoor gatherings may increase to 25. On June 1, we will also begin our bi-weekly announcements on the assessment and potential easing of additional public health measures. The reason we have chosen two weeks as our interval of choice is straightforward. All evidence suggests that 14 days is the maximum incubation time for COVID-19. So, this 14-day window will give us an opportunity to assess the situation around us and make informed decisions based on the latest information available. Please remember that if a threat is detected, we may need to react immediately. We will provide as much warning as possible, but we may need to introduce additional public health measures right away. Finally, the Department is issuing a Public Health Advisory to the community of Sanikiluaq due to the detection of pertussis, also known as whooping cough. Whooping cough is a disease of the throat or lungs that is spread easily from person to person. Anyone can get whooping cough, but the most severe cases are in young children. For that reason, the daycare in Sanikiluaq must remain closed for the time being. Thank you.

These past two months have not been easy, and all Nunavummiut have had to make sacrifices. However, thanks to our combined efforts, we are protecting our families, our communities, and our territory from this pandemic, and I hope that all Nunavummiut can feel a sense of pride knowing that their actions are making a deep and measurable impact on keeping Nunavut healthy and safe. It is time for us to move forward. This does not mean that this pandemic is over. This does not mean that the threat has passed. This means that we can cautiously begin our return to the activities we enjoy, knowing that at any time we may need to change our behaviour to protect ourselves from emerging threats. In the coming weeks, we will work with our stakeholders to re-introduce our businesses, our activities, and our programs in a way that is safe, sustainable, and poses the least risk to the health and safety of Nunavummiut. Know that as we begin to loosen restrictions internally, it is imperative that our strict border measures remain to minimize the risk of introducing COVID-19 into the territory. With that being said, I’m pleased to announce that as of June 1: Daycares will be permitted to open up for regular business. The size limit for outdoor gatherings will increase to 25 people. Territorial parks will be allowed to reopen for outdoor activities only, if local circumstances permit. All park buildings will remain closed. Municipal playgrounds will be allowed to re-open, again, if local circumstances permit. These particular conditions have been selected because they are deemed low risk. Moving forward, our plan is to re-assess our condition every two weeks. If the state of COVID in Nunavut is favorable, we will continue to lift public health measures, beginning with lower risk activities and programs. If our condition is stable, we may remain at the status quo until we are confident that lifting additional restrictions would not pose an undue risk to Nunavummiut. Finally, if the threat of COVID-19 increases, or eased public health measures are posing a potential public health threat to the territory, we may need to introduce or re-introduce certain conditions. I share in everyone’s desire to return to normal. We all want to know when we can confidently and safely travel within our own territory, or to our neighbouring jurisdictions. However, trying to forecast specific dates and timelines for when we can lift all of our public health measures would be inaccurate, and frankly, it would be insincere. The COVID-19 pandemic is evolving rapidly, and every single week yields new information that shapes our strategy and our public health measures. Predictions and decisions made on the basis of today’s understanding of the virus may be obsolete in a short time. For this reason, we have opted for an approach that is flexible, cautious, and adaptive to the evolving situation around us. Again, I want to thank all Nunavummiut for their continued patience and understanding. No one is left unaffected by this pandemic, but our collective accountability has kept Nunavut safe so far. This accountability and responsibility needs to continue, and, as we loosen restrictions, we must continue to practice social distancing, stay away from others when we are sick and wash our hands often. Thank you.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

I am pleased to announce several items today. The first is that Rankin Inlet now has the ability to provide testing if a positive case is confirmed in-territory. I’d like to commend the medical and laboratory staff, especially Matt Stacey and Dr. Jasmine Pawa, who have been working tirelessly to become acquainted with the GeneXpert machine, and to ensure that it can be managed safely, efficiently, and accurately. Getting this machine up and running is a significant step forward for Nunavut, as this now fulfills our criteria of obtaining reliable and effective in-territory diagnostic capacity. When coupled with the fact that we still have no confirmed cases of COVID-19 inside the territory, we have now met two of our three conditions. While the situation in southern Canada will continue to play a role in our approach moving forward, we are now in a better position to consider reducing some restrictions in the territory. I have one other piece of news I would like to share. Moving forward, Kitikmeot medical travellers receiving treatment in Yellowknife are no longer required to undergo the 14-day isolation period, and instead will be permitted to return home immediately. This decision has been made through consultation with the Northwest Territories and is contingent on there being no active cases of COVID-19 in the NWT. Please note that this is for medical travellers only, and this is only when their treatment is provided in Yellowknife. Any medical traveller who needs to leave the Northwest Territories to receive treatment in other cities in Canada will still be required to complete their 14-day isolation period. For all medical travellers to whom this new rule applies who are currently in quarantine, we are working to get you home as soon as possible. As always, our main goal is the safety, health and well being of Nunavummiut. I would like to thank you all for your patience, understanding and support as we continue to care for our families and our communities.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, May 8, 2020 Minister of Health update: It was announced at the start of this year by the World Health Organization that all of 2020 was to be recognized as the Year of the Nurse and the Midwife. This was an opportunity to celebrate the vital role of nurses and midwives in the delivery of health care services across the world. Several months later, in the midst of this global pandemic, we are not just talking about their essential role in keeping us healthy, we are experiencing it firsthand. Nurses and midwives continue to deliver vital health care services in our territory, in our country, and throughout the world. May 11 to 17 is recognized as National Nursing Week. As our nurses work tirelessly to ensure that Nunavummiut have access to the care they need, I think it’s important that we all take this opportunity to show them our immense gratitude for their service and their contribution to this territory. Nunavut has more than 300 nurses who are essential to the development and delivery of programs that keep Nunavummiut healthy. In these uncertain times, as the world battles COVID-19, our nurses are on the front line, providing care to those who need it most. This pandemic has demonstrated our nurses’ willingness to put their own health and safety at risk to protect and care for those around them. This National Nursing Week, and indeed this entire Year of The Nurse and Midwife, give us an opportunity to shine a spotlight on these essential health staff. However, our gratitude for your service is not restricted to a single week, or a single year. I would like all Nunavummiut to join me in showing our ongoing appreciation for your continued dedication to this territory. Thank you.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, May 6, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update: Since it was confirmed that the detected COVID case in Nunavut was a false positive, the territory has witnessed great displays of solidarity, support, and pride. The additional restrictions in Pond Inlet have been lifted, and I hope that the community feels a measure of relief knowing that they are still COVID-free. This is good news. As a territory, we have done well so far. However, we cannot allow our celebration to lapse into complacency. It is more important than ever that we maintain these rules that we’ve all become familiar with. The threat of COVID-19 is still very real and we need to stay the course. Practise social distancing. Avoid contact with individuals who are not a member of your household. Limit trips for errands. Purchase only the supplies that your household needs. And, of course, wash your hands. There is no combination of measures that can absolutely guarantee the prevention of COVID-19. Even as we celebrate for Pond Inlet, all Nunavummiut need to remain vigilant and cautious. Follow the rules, and encourage your friends, family, and neighbours to do the same. I want to thank all Nunavummiut for their continued patience, understanding, and cooperation. We can only get through this together.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Travel outside the territory as of May 7, 2020: The Government of Nunavut’s decision to charge $2,100 per individual and $1,050 for each additional family member during the mandatory 14-day isolation stays for residents returning to the territory has been reversed. The Government of Nunavut will continue to cover these costs as long as mandatory isolation for residents returning to the territory is in place. Please keep in mind that travel outside of Nunavut during the COVID-19 pandemic is not advised.    Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

This means that although the first test result showed COVID-19 infection, further investigation and testing have not shown any other evidence of COVID-19 infection in Pond Inlet. As I have previously mentioned, no lab test is perfect. There is always a chance of false positive or false negative results. When interpreting results and deciding on an appropriate course of action, we consider many pieces of information, of which test results are just one piece. We always aim to err on the side of caution. Diagnostic tests are part of an entire system of measures to intervene on COVID-19 infection. In these circumstances the test gave an incorrect result, but the rest of the system (public health nurses, contact tracing, surveillance) have not identified any other cases of COVID-19 infection. The information available so far includes: The individual involved has not been outside of Pond Inlet for some time. We have not identified an exposure to COVID-19. We have not found any other cases of COVID-19 in Pond Inlet. We have not noticed any increase in significant respiratory infections. 		  For all of the reasons above we believe that the individual in Pond Inlet does not, and never did have COVID-19. As a result, our rapid response team will stop operating in Pond Inlet and the members of the team will begin preparing for future deployments. All territorial orders under the Public Health Emergency remain in effect. However, the additional measures specific to Pond Inlet as a result of the positive COVID-19 case are now lifted. Effective immediately, travel between Pond Inlet and other Nunavut communities may resume, and the community-specific restrictions on businesses and services in Pond Inlet are also rescinded.      Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

The Rapid Response Team is in the community, and they are implementing containment and contact tracing. As the team completes additional testing, there is the possibility that more positive cases may be confirmed in the community. This does not necessarily mean that there is community transmission and should not be cause for alarm. What this does mean is that the Rapid Response Team is doing their job, which is finding the virus and stopping it from spreading. Containment is key, and right now it is our top priority. As this process takes place, the Government of Nunavut will continue to support the community of Pond Inlet. I also want to take a moment and thank the municipality of Pond Inlet and its residents for allowing me to answer their questions earlier today on the community radio. Moving forward, I would like to remind all Nunavummiut, using the strongest possible terms, that every single social interaction carries a degree of risk. Despite all of the Government of Nunavut’s preventative measures, and the new containment measures now in place within Pond Inlet, it is impossible to reasonably predict where or when COVID-19 may be detected next. I urge all Nunavummiut to exercise a high degree of caution, and to seriously consider these risks before participating in a gathering of any kind. If you deem it necessary to participate in gatherings, then please keep track of the people with whom you interact, as this information may be necessary in case contact tracing needs to be conducted in your community. Health staff cannot get us through this alone. How well we do, and where we go from here, depends on the actions of every single Nunavummiut. Right now, the best way of slowing the spread of COVID-19 continues to be through social distancing and effective hygiene. If everyone follows these rules together, we can put ourselves in the best position to make it through this uncertain time. It’s more important than ever that we be careful, responsible, kind, and supportive. I’d like to thank Nunavummiut for their continued cooperation and understanding. As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Travel outside the territory as of May 7, 2020 Starting May 7, 2020, Nunavummiut who chose to travel outside Nunavut while the CPHO’s travel ban is still in effect will have to cover the costs of their 14-day isolation period in one of the Government of Nunavut’s isolation sites.

Department of Health Services, April 30, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update As you have seen and heard, today we have announced that a case of COVID-19 has been detected within Pond Inlet. Since the onset of the pandemic, we knew that no combination of preventative measures can absolutely guarantee the prevention of COVID-19. We anticipated that sooner or later the virus would be detected in the territory. Just as we have poured extensive effort into our prevention plan, so too have we developed a comprehensive response plan to minimize, to the greatest possible extent, the impact that COVID-19 has on Nunavut. We have been in contact with hamlet authorities and have initiated our Rapid Response Plan. A Rapid Response Team has already been deployed to Pond Inlet and is scheduled to arrive early this afternoon. That team will immediately initiate containment measures, begin contact tracing, and monitor the health and well-being of persons on home isolation orders. The Pond Inlet Health Centre is well-staffed and prepared, and health centre operations will continue. All passenger travel in and out of Pond Inlet has ceased. This includes any movement in or out of the community by land travel. This travel ban is a necessary containment measure to minimize the risk of COVID-19 spreading to multiple communities at once. Until we have determined the potential spread of the virus within the community, all non-essential offices and services will be closed. There is to be no social gatherings within dwellings, and all residents of Pond Inlet are asked to continue to maintain social distancing and good hygiene. For residents of Pond Inlet, we recognize that this news may be frightening. However, the Government of Nunavut would like to assure everyone that although travel is restricted, you are not cut off from help and support. Critical services will be maintained, and plans are in place to ensure that access to services such as heat, power, water, sewer, and communications will not be interrupted. Our primary focus now is to detect and contain the virus to prevent further transmission within the community and to other communities. Anyone who has reason to believe that they have been exposed to the virus is advised to call the COVID-19 hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. or 6 p.m. or call your community health centre. Please, do not go to the health centre in person unless you are instructed to by a health official. To all Nunavummiut, know that the preventative measures that we have all been taking are more important now than ever. Everyone needs to practise social distancing, stay home whenever possible, and avoid contact with those who are not a member of your household. Together, our efforts can slow the spread of COVID-19. Finally, I remind everyone of the importance of kindness. Now is not the time for blame, or shame. It is the time for compassion, empathy, and support of your fellow Nunavummiut. The Government of Nunavut thanks all Nunavummiut for their efforts to date. We will continue to exhaust all efforts to contain the virus, and minimize its impact on Pond Inlet, and on all the territory. Only together can we all protect our territory from the threat of COVID-19.    Department of Health Services  Residents of Pond Inlet must call their health centre first. All regular appointments at the Pond Inlet Health Centre have been cancelled. Only emergency services are available.  COVID-19 Hotline and self-assessment tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or call their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days. Nunavummiut can also use the self-assessment tool available at www.gov.nu.ca COMMUNITY TRAVEL AND GATHERINGS RESTRICTION ORDER POND INLET All travel to and from Pond Inlet is banned except: People with a letter from the CPHO Medevac patients Flight crews Nunavut Inuit exercising their hunting rights as set out in Article 5 may leave and return to Pond Inlet but not travel to any other community People travelling on a flight which must land in Pond Inlet due to weather or emergency Medevac crews must restrict movements to the airport and the health centre and must wear personal protective equipment. All businesses operating in Pond Inlet must close except for: Grocery stores Fuel and motor vehicle stations Post office Restaurants open for take out service All social gatherings shall be restricted to five persons or fewer. No social gatherings in dwellings. The order can be consulted at:https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/covid-19-novel-coronavirus   Department of Health Services, April 29, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update As many of you may know, some jurisdictions in Canada have started or will soon begin a gradual lifting of the restrictions they have implemented to flatten the COVID curve. Today I’d like to speak in more detail about what needs to happen before we can do the same. There are three conditions that need to be met before we can consider relaxing existing restrictions in the territory. They are as follows: We need to achieve in-territory diagnostic capacity. This means that we need to be able to implement a rapid, accurate, and comprehensive COVID-19 testing program here in Nunavut; There needs to be significant indication that rates of COVID-19 are decreasing in the southern jurisdictions to which Nunavummiut most often travel; and There needs to remain no active cases of COVID-19 within Nunavut. The nature of these conditions means that it is difficult to assign a specific timeline to re-opening, but fulfillment of these conditions is necessary to minimize risk to public health and safety. We need to know that Nunavummiut travelling outside of the territory can do so safely, and we need to be able to respond rapidly to any confirmed cases of COVID-19 within Nunavut. I know that people are eager to go back to work, visit loved ones, and engage in social activities. However, if we lift these restrictions too early, we will increase the risk to Nunavummiut. If we aren’t careful about how we transition back from these restrictions, then we could effectively undo all the hard work and sacrifices that we’ve made over the past seven weeks. It is as important as ever that we stay the course: maintain social distancing, stay home whenever possible, and wash your hands often. These measures continue to be the best defence against COVID-19, and the best way to protect our families, our communities, and our territory.   Department of Health Services Access to health care services will remain available in all communities seven days a week. All non-urgent requests will be triaged daily. Immediate access to urgent and emergent health care services are and will continue to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. All clients are asked to call before presenting at a health facility. In Iqaluit, public health, the emergency room and inpatient unit will remain open.

The new order adds clarity around gatherings and social distancing and provides easy to understand scenarios that will help Nunavummiut more easily follow the order. It will also help businesses understand how to adjust their operations to ensure public safety and continued operation. Finally, the changes will also assist law enforcement and peace officers to more easily interpret the intent of the order in the unlikely event there is a need for enforcement. I’d like to outline some of the new definitions and information provided in the new order. Food service establishments and licensed premises remain closed. Restaurants can still provide options for take-out or delivery, as long as they abide by the rules of social distancing while doing so. All businesses deemed as Personal Service Providers must also remain closed. These include hair dressing, barbering, massage therapy, and other similar establishments. Additionally, dentists, veterinarians, and psychologists must remain closed, except for emergencies. Public playgrounds, municipal parks, and day-use areas of territorial parks also remain closed. Though still subject to closures and limitations, the following businesses are permitted to remain open: any business large enough to maintain a two-metre social distance within the workplace, or businesses that limit customers to no more than five at a time. The five-at-a-time rule does not apply to businesses that are large enough to maintain social distancing throughout the entire premise, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and similar facilities. The order provides a definition to gatherings. All organized public gatherings of more than five people remain prohibited. This includes concerts, community events, sporting events, and ceremonies such as marriages, funerals, or memorial services. Finally, all social gatherings, including social gatherings in private dwellings, shall be restricted to five persons or fewer. This includes play groups, club meetings, and meals with individuals who do not reside together. This new order does not mean that restrictions are being loosened, or that the Government of Nunavut has re-assessed the territory’s position or tolerance for risk. Instead, the definitions under this new order have been aligned with definitions being applied in other jurisdictions. This makes restrictive measures clearer and more consistent in their application and enforcement. It is strongly recommended that Nunavummiut limit contact with anyone who is not a member of their immediate household. Any social gathering carries a degree of risk, especially when we are looking at individuals from multiple different households mingling together. Nunavummiut must still exercise caution at all times, practise social distancing to the greatest extent possible, and wash hands and all shared surfaces thoroughly and often. The previous order met the intended purpose of providing necessary tools to help protect public health. However, The Government of Nunavut recognized the need to provide clearer language and definitions. For this reason, the Department of Justice worked with the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) to prepare a new Order to ensure the language is clear and understandable while remaining true to its intent.

This resource is user-friendly, available in all four official languages, and can be accessed through the Government of Nunavut webpage at https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/covid-19-novel-coronavirus. The purpose of this self-assessment tool is to provide Nunavummiut with real-time information and recommendations based on self-reported symptoms or recent travel history. The tool will help Nunavummiut determine whether they should self-isolate, and when they should contact a health care service provider for additional follow-up or testing. This tool is meant to supplement the existing resources that are already available, and it is not a replacement for social distancing and good hygiene, such as washing regularly. Mass gatherings are still banned, and everyone is still required to follow the rules. Nunavummiut who don’t have access to online resources but believe that they are displaying COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, are encouraged to call the COVID Hotline at 1-888-975-8601. You can also ask someone with internet access to complete the self-assessment on your behalf by sharing with them your travel history and any symptoms that you may be experiencing.

This means that many Nunavummiut currently in the south are coming to the end of their mandatory 14-day isolation periods. It is time for many of these residents to return home. The mandatory rules we put in place in our isolation sites are very strict. I think it is important to remind everyone that for 14 days, residents are: Confined in their hotel rooms most of the day. Have no physical contact with other residents undergoing isolation and no physical contact with the general population. Are allowed only monitored outings on hotel grounds. Must have daily health check-ins with on-site nurses. Are held responsible if they break isolation. There are no exceptions. These measures are a first step and they ensure Nunavummiut who want to come home, as well as their families and communities, remain healthy and safe. The second step is bringing residents home. I want to take a moment and outline this process: 48 hours before anticipated departure, travellers are informed on the clearance and travel process. The day before departure, the nurses on-site review each traveller’s daily check-in logs to make sure they complied with the isolation rules. The nurses conduct a final in-person assessment to ensure travellers are healthy and show no symptoms of COVID-19. The assessments and results are sent to my office – and a decision to clear a traveller for the scheduled return home is made and a letter approving travel is issued. Residents need both the letter and a proof of residency to return to the territory. The day of departure, residents approved for travel are transported from the hotel to the airport via a private shuttle, sanitized thoroughly before use. The Government of Nunavut worked with airlines to minimize, to the greatest possible extent, the risk of anyone being exposed to COVID-19 during their travel back to the territory. Airports have enhanced cleaning, sanitation and passenger procedures throughout the check-in and security process that ensure physical distancing. As an additional precaution, residents will also undergo an airline health check prior to boarding. Until they arrive at their final destination in Nunavut, residents remain bound by the isolation agreement they signed the day they accepted to enter the isolation sites. Residents will travel to Nunavut on both chartered and scheduled flights: Residents travelling on chartered flights are shuttled directly to their airplane for boarding and take-off. Once in Nunavut, they will be chartered to their final in-territory destination. Residents travelling on scheduled flights are dropped off at the airport, where they are met and guided by airline employees to check-in, through security, to the boarding area and finally on the plane. They do not come in contact with other travellers during this process and remain bound by their isolation agreement. I want to thank our returning residents for going through these drastic measures to protect their communities and Nunavut. As we welcome back friends, family members, and loved ones, it is more important than ever to follow the rules: All social gatherings are still banned, and all Nunavummiut, including those just returning to their home communities, are expected to do their part to keep Nunavut safe. Practice strict social distancing, stay home when possible, avoid contact with individuals outside of your household, and monitor your health.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Department of Health Services Isolation Sites Those in isolation have access to cable, internet, three meals a day, fresh linens and cleaning supplies.

This equipment will be used to test mine staff for COVID-19. At this time there is no evidence that screening in this fashion is a substitute for 14 days of isolation. This is why Nunavut, and every other Canadian jurisdiction, is using 14 days of isolation after exposure or travel. As a result, I have informed management of Agnico Eagle Mines that these tests do not change the current requirement for mine staff to stay out of the town of Rankin Inlet. The Department of Health is committed to improving and protecting the health of all Nunavummiut. For COVID-19 this means having testing equipment that meets Canadian standards and can be deployed to every community in Nunavut. The equipment used by AEM does not meet these criteria. If the Department of Health were to commit to using devices like this, we would not improve access to COVID testing for all Nunavummiut. The Department of Health continues to work on acquiring diagnostic capability that can be rapidly deployed and will provide quick access to results for all Nunavummiut. The combination of machines we continue to pursue will not only allow testing in all communities but will also improve our ability to rapidly diagnose a number of other infectious diseases that threaten Nunavummiut on a regular basis. Testing for COVID-19 at the wrong time can produce incorrect results and create a false sense of reassurance.     As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Department of Health Services The Public Health Emergency has been extended until April 16.

There will be some restrictions in place to ensure continued safety of our inmates and staff. Due to the ongoing public health emergency this is subject to change without notice. Department of Justice Services Update - May 6, 2020  The Government of Nunavut has various programs and services that are available to support victims and survivors of violence. We want to remind Nunavummiut that we are still here, and we can help during this very difficult time. We are aware that life is very difficult for many families and individuals and it can put added stress on a home. You should not feel isolated or alone, we are here to help. Individuals are asked to contact the on-call Family Abuse Intervention Act (FAIA) line if they have any questions or need support using the following number 1-844-534-1038. The call will be assessed to determine the support needed and directed to a Community Justice Specialist who can help with applications and resource referrals. The Victim Services Office is closed to the public at this time. However, Nunavummiut who need to contact the office can do so by calling the Toll-Free line at 1-866-456-5216 or emailing victimservices@gov.nu.ca. Services will be provided on a case-by-case basis.  Department of Justice Services Update - May 1, 2020   Community Justice Our service delivery with clients remains consistent with the previously amended service delivery process. In-person meetings are restricted to emergency situations where the client has no access to a phone or safe location to contact our service providers over the phone. Individuals are asked to contact the on-call Family Abuse Intervention Act (FAIA) line if they have any questions or need support using the following number 1-844-534-1038. The call will be assessed to determine the support needed and directed to a Community Justice Specialist who can help with applications and resource referrals. Community Corrections All local community corrections offices continue to be closed to the public until further notice. All community corrections clients are to report by phone to their Regional Managers. The list of contacts can be found at: https://www.gov.nu.ca/justice Department of Justice Services Update - April 24, 2020 The Department of Justice worked with the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) to prepare a new Order Respecting Social Distancing and Mass Gatherings to ensure the language is clear and understandable while remaining true to the order. This new order will come into effect on Friday, April 24, 2020 at 11:59 p.m.   In addition, it is the Department of Justice’s hope the questions and answers below will provide additional clarity and will help Nunavummiut better understand the purpose of this order. When can an enforcement officer enter into my home or public facility? In the Orders being issues by the CPHO, there is a clear distinction between a building where you live, a “dwelling”, and a public facility, such as a grocery store. Under these Orders, the CPHO has provided enforcement Officers with the authority to enter into public facilities without a warrant for enforcement purposes. When it comes to your home, however, the government firmly recognizes your rights and the obligation of enforcement officers to take all reasonable measures to respect those rights. If an enforcement officer believes there is reason to enter into your home, they will need to get your permission, or get a warrant from the Court. Who can enforce these Orders?  In addition to RCMP officers, and to ensure we have the capacity to enforce the emergency orders, the CPHO has authorized all peace officers who are appointed under territorial law, the ability to enforce the orders. This includes municipal enforcement officers, the sheriffs from the Nunavut Court of Justice, the environmental inspectors, and the wildlife officers. Normally these officers can only enforce their own legislation. However, the emergency order grants them additional powers. To ensure those charged with protecting the health of Nunavummiut are prepared to take on this task, they will be provided with clear guidelines on their responsibility. The CPHO authorized these peace officers for a number of reasons: The RCMP may experience staff shortages during the pandemic and may need not be able to address this added responsibility; The authorized peace officers are already familiar with and have had training in enforcement procedures under territorial legislation; The orders affect entry into territorial parks and other on-the-land activities, where wildlife officers are often the first point of contact; and Municipal enforcement officers are experienced with issuing tickets under municipal by-laws and are recognized as an enforcement body within Nunavut communities. The CPHO is working with officials from the RCMP, the Government of Nunavut and municipalities to ensure consistent messaging and enforcement across the territory. What do I do if I am concerned the Orders are not being followed?  Your local RCMP detachment can help and should be used as your first point of contact. If you are concerned, please contact your local RCMP detachment. As we move forward, we will continue to monitor, review and amend these orders as necessary. Our measures will be balanced against the need to fight Covid-19. When we are no longer living under threat of this virus, we will no longer be in need of such measures.   Department of Justice Services Update - April 1, 2020 Adjusted services: Victims Services The Victim Services Office is closed to the public at this time. However, Nunavummiut who need to contact the office can do so by using the following contact information: Victim Services Toll Free 1-866-456-5216; victimservices@gov.nu.ca. Services will be provided on a case by case basis. Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee As of today, April 1, 2020, the Office of the Public Guardian will be joining the Office of the Public Trustee within the Department of Justice. This new office will be the Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee. All contact information remains the same. 	Once the Office reopens after the public health emergency, it will be located on the first floor of the Brown Building in Iqaluit.

We apologize for this inconvenience. Department of Justice Services Update - March 31, 2020 The Corrections division has been working diligently at all levels to ensure we have plans in place to support our staff, our inmates and the community throughout this public health emergency. There is currently a great deal of information in the media from other jurisdictions about what is happening within correctional facilities in other jurisdictions. To ensure Nunavummiut are up to date and aware of the current steps being taken in Nunavut, we are providing the following update. Ultimately, our goal is to ensure the virus does not enter the correctional facilities. Measures already in place include suspending all outside visitation and non-essential traffic. We appreciate the patience and support we have received from inmates and their families in taking this step as we are aware this is not easy. Given the heightened security risks associated with corrections, we cannot provide specific details regarding our individual institutional plans. However, we can provide the following information regarding steps begin taken: All intakes are being isolated for a period of 14 days upon intake. Institutions have added additional hand sanitizing stations in high traffic areas. Response/containment kits are being outfitted with gloves, masks, face shields, gowns and instructions for use. Nurses are diligently screening inmates upon intake for symptoms of COVID-19. Facilities are increasing food and supply orders to ensure facilities are well stocked in the event of an outbreak. Increased cleaning protocols to ensure communal surfaces are cleaned on an increased schedule throughout the day. In addition to these health and safety steps being taken, the department has reviewed all inmates eligible for early release to reduce the inmate population as much as possible. We will continue to take action that will support the health and safety of our inmates, staff and all Nunavummiut.

They do not replace social distancing and other protective measures.  WHAT IS AN APPROPRIATE NON-MEDICAL MASK OR FACE COVERING? Non-medical face masks or face coverings should: be made of at least two layers of tightly woven material fabric (such as cotton or linen) be large enough to completely and comfortably cover the nose and mouth without gaping fit securely to the head with ties or ear loops allow for easy breathing be comfortable and not require frequent adjustment be changed as soon as possible if damp or dirty maintain their shape after washing and drying Some masks also include a pocket to accommodate a paper towel or disposable coffee filter, for increased benefit. If possible, use different fabrics for each side of the mask, so you know which side faces your mouth and which side is out. Non-medical masks or face coverings: should not be placed on children under the age of two years should not be placed on anyone unable to remove them without assistance or anyone who has trouble breathing should not be made of plastic or other non-breathable materials should not be made exclusively of materials that easily fall apart, such as tissues should not be secured with tape or other inappropriate materials should not be shared with others should not impair vision or interfere with tasks   HOW TO PUT ON A NON-MEDICAL MASK OR FACE COVERING Ensure the face covering is clean and dry. Wash your hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds before touching the mask. If none is available, use hand sanitizer with a minimum 60% alcohol base. Ensure your hair is away from your face. Place the face covering over your nose and mouth and secure to your head or ears with its ties or elastics. Adjust if needed to ensure nose and mouth are fully covered. The mask should fit snugly to the cheeks and there should not be any gaps. Repeat Step 2.   While wearing a non-medical mask or face covering, it is important to avoid touching your face. If you do touch your mask or face, you should immediately wash your hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds. You can also use hand sanitizer with a minimum 60% alcohol base.   HOW TO REMOVE A NON-MEDICAL MASK OR FACE COVERING Wash your hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds.

We are still waiting on confirmatory results for the presumptive case detected in the Mary River Mine, with the expectation that they will be ready sometime this week. The Department of Health continues to monitor the situation at the Mary River Mine site closely, and we will provide support as needed. I want to take this opportunity and remind Nunavummiut that: Testing is only one component of the Public Health response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Testing is important, but it is not a replacement for social distancing or hand-washing. Testing is important, but it is absolutely not a replacement for 14 days of isolation. The Government of Nunavut follows testing guidelines and best practices that have been endorsed by the World Health Organization and Health Canada. We rely on diagnostic devices that have undergone rigorous validation and accreditation processes to provide dependable testing to Nunavummiut. Even under ideal conditions, and with validated equipment, testing is not always a reliable method of identifying cases of COVID-19 and halting transmission. There is strong evidence that false negatives can occur throughout the incubation period. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the overarching goal of our public health response is to identify, contain and break transmission. The Government of Nunavut will continue to look at emerging evidence and best practices set out by public health authorities, both nationally and globally, to shape our response to COVID-19, and will alter public health measures as and when appropriate. Thank you. 			   			As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Today marks the third bi-weekly announcement for Nunavut’s Path for moving forward during COVID-19. There are still no cases of COVID-19 detected in the territory, so once again we are in a position to alter public health measures. I’m pleased to announce the following changes under the new Order Respecting Social Distancing and Gatherings, which goes into effect today: The limit for outdoor gatherings has now been increased to 50 people. The limit for indoor gatherings has been increased to 10 people. In private dwellings, this means 10 people in addition to those who reside there. The limit for gatherings at places of worship, conference facilities, community halls, rental meeting spaces, and gatherings organized by the Government of Canada, Government of Nunavut, municipal corporation, or Regional Inuit Organizations has been set at 50 people or 50% of capacity for the facility, whichever is less. In all facilities and gatherings, it is still expected that social distancing is maintained. As we take another step forward on Nunavut’s Path, and we return to some of the activities, programs, or venues that we’ve missed, we need to remain diligent in our collective commitment to practice social distancing and good hand hygiene. If you make the choice to participate in a large gathering, or attend an indoor event, or even meet up with friends for dinner, please also choose to be responsible, and choose to take actions that will keep yourself, your community, and your territory, safe. Wash your hands. Keep six feet away from others. Avoid touching your face. Sanitize high-touch areas often. Consider wearing a mask when social distancing is difficult. If you don’t feel well, stay home. Thank you. 			   			As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  Calling Ahead at Health Centres Unless you are experiencing a medical emergency, please call your health centre first before going in.

As of today, Nunavut is resuming regular medical travel to Churchill, Manitoba. As Churchill has not had a confirmed case of COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic, we have determined that the risk of resuming medical travel operations is minimal, and it is greatly outweighed by the benefits of ensuring that Nunavummiut have access to the out-of-territory care they need. Medical travellers and their escorts who travel to Churchill for treatment and do not leave the community for the duration of their stay, will be able to return directly to Nunavut without needing to isolate at a GN designated isolation facility. If the situation changes, we will re-assess and be ready to initiate contact tracing and containment measures immediately. We have also had some inquiries from cab companies regarding their operations. Under the new Order Regarding Social Distancing and Gatherings, cab companies can collect fares from multiple households at once, under specific conditions. Whenever there are multiple passengers in the cab, everyone must wear a mask. Cab drivers must provide masks for riders who do not have them. Most importantly, cab drivers must obtain consent from all passengers before picking up multiple fares. This means that any passenger who is picked up, and all subsequent fares on that ride, must indicate that they are okay with riding in a shared cab with others. All passengers can still request that they do not share their ride with others, and, for now, cab companies must comply with this request. We want to thank all cab companies who have so readily complied with recommendations to limit passenger travel and enhance sanitation procedures in order to keep Nunavummiut safe and healthy. Finally, as restaurants, bars, and other indoor locations are permitted to open, I want to continue to emphasize to Nunavummiut the necessity of social distancing, good hand hygiene, and staying home when we are sick. We need to remember, even as we return to the activities we enjoy, that this pandemic is far from over, and small actions from everyone today add up to major impacts tomorrow.

I am pleased to say that after consultation with my counterpart in the GNWT, as of today, residents of the NWT can travel to Nunavut without isolating prior to arrival. The establishment of the common travel area by air or by land between the two territories does however come with strict conditions and expectations: Travel must originate from Nunavut to the NWT or from the NWT to Nunavut. Travellers have not been outside their respective territory for two weeks prior to their travel to the NWT or Nunavut. Travellers remain in either territory for the duration of their stay. Travellers from the NWT who wish to enter Nunavut, must write to: cphotravelrequests@gov.nu.ca and complete and sign the Nunavut and NWT Traveller’s Declaration form. Failure to do so will affect entry in Nunavut. Failure to answer truthfully will be subject to fines. This also applies for Nunavummiut who wish to return home after their stay in the NWT. My office will issue a letter of approval. Travellers will be required to present the approval letter prior to boarding any airplane entering Nunavut. Isolation before entering Nunavut is still required if You are a Nunavut resident who is returning home from travel in southern Canada via Yellowknife. In this case, you will need to complete a 14-day isolation period in the GN isolation hub in Yellowknife. You are an NWT resident who has travelled outside your territory less than two weeks before your scheduled arrival in Nunavut. In this case, you will need to complete the NWT isolation requirements before applying for travel to Nunavut. I want to re-assure Nunavummiut that should the current situation change in either territory, we will re-assess the common travel area and take all necessary measures to protect the health and safety of Nunavummiut. Further Information can be found in Travel and Isolation section of the Department of Health website at https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/travel-and-isolation. Today also marks the second of our bi-weekly announcements regarding the status of current health measures. Beginning June 22: Personal service providers will also be permitted to open for one-on-one sessions. This includes hairdressers and nail salons. Again, these facilities will be responsible for ensuring that PPE is available for both clients and service providers when requested. Bars and restaurants will be allowed to re-open and operate at half capacity. Last call for alcohol service will be at 9 p.m.. Facility operators need to ensure that patrons are respecting social distancing. Liquor Inspectors have the authority to enforce orders regarding social distancing, and they will be monitoring to ensure adherence to these conditions. Theatres and churches are also permitted to re-open on June 22. On June 29: Youth centres and day camps will be able to resume operations. Long-term care facilities will begin accepting visitors in a limited capacity; they can only allow one to two visitors per resident at a time, and these visitors can only be immediate family. Guidelines for re-opening will be available on the health website in the coming days. Though we can reasonably forecast what the next two weeks may bring, we must remain aware of the possible need to change or re-introduce public health measures. While we are in a position to ease restrictions, we remain vulnerable to the impacts of this global pandemic. Every week, new information becomes available. Every week, the situation can change. What doesn’t change is that social distancing, washing your hands and staying home when you are sick are the three main actions each and everyone of us can take to keep our families and our communities safe.

Right now, travel into Nunavut represents the single biggest risk for introducing COVID-19. The travel ban, and the 14-day isolation requirements for returning Nunavummiut, are meant to mitigate this risk and keep our territory safe. Knowing that, I’d like to take this opportunity to share information on the new process being implemented for reserving stays in GN southern isolation facilities. Moving forward, all Nunavummiut who must travel outside of the territory should contact the email address NUisolationreservations@nunavutcare.ca and submit an Isolation Reservation Request Form as soon as they know their plans for travel. From there, the travel team will work to identify room availability and reserve your stay in one of the designated isolation facilities. This new streamlined process is meant to help Nunavummiut plan for their 14-day quarantine period farther in advance and ensures that our travel team can anticipate and accommodate travellers in the coming months. More information, including intake days requirements, can also be found on the Department of Health’s website. Remember, non-essential travel outside of the territory is still not recommended. All individuals who are applying for critical worker exemption will continue to use the email address CPHOTravelRequests@gov.nu.ca. Finally, the Department of Health has made temporary amendments to the Medical Travel Policy to help keep our medical travellers and escorts safe from COVID-19. Specific provisions have been added to ensure that medical travellers and escorts abide by rules of social distancing, hand-washing hygiene, and other behaviours that help to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The amendments also more clearly outline the requirements for both medical travellers and escorts to complete 14 days of self-isolation at a designated isolation facility prior to returning to Nunavut. As we continue to look at ways of easing public health measures and returning the activities we enjoy, we must remain diligent and aware that the threat of COVID-19 has not yet passed. Please continue to maintain physical distancing and handwashing practices, and limit any non-essential travel out of the territory.

This annual event highlights the health risks associated with tobacco use, and advocates for effective policies to reduce tobacco consumption. Right now, we are all working hard to commit to our public health measures that protect us from the threat of COVID-19. We are social distancing, staying home as much as possible, and washing our hands as much as we can. These actions are keeping ourselves, our communities, and our territory safe. Quitting tobacco use is one more step we can take to guard ourselves against the impact of this pandemic. We know that COVID-19 is mainly a respiratory virus, and early evidence suggests that smoking can make symptoms worse. Smokers are also likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19, as smoking increases the likelihood of transmission from one’s face and lips. Please remember: do not share cigarettes, joints, or pipes. Do not pick up discarded cigarette or cannabis butts. Wash your hands often, and refrain from touching your face. The best thing that we can do for our health is to quit smoking. By making the decision to quit smoking, we can help to protect ourselves from COVID-19 today, and dramatically improve our health for the coming weeks, months, and years. Support is available for anyone who wants to explore options to help them quit. Message a counsellor on the Tobacco Has No Place Here Facebook page or call 1-866-368-7848 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The service is private and free. Counsellors can help you in Inuktitut, English, Inuinnaqtun and French. Nicotine replacement therapy, or NRT, is also available at no cost through the Non-Insured Health Benefits program at your local health centre or pharmacy. Call ahead, and ask your health care provider for information and options for NRT. Thank you. Chief Public Health Officer update Good morning. Today marks the start of Nunavut’s Path forward. Day cares, territorial parks, and playgrounds are permitted to re-open, and the size limit for outdoor gatherings has been increased to 25. Today will also be the first of our bi-weekly assessments concerning the modification of public health measures. As we look at altering public health measures, I want to take a moment and emphasize to all Nunavummiut the continued importance of social distancing. While we are in a position today to alter measures, we are not in a position to take social distancing for granted. We’ve noticed through the contact tracing of persons under investigation that people’s contact bubbles are becoming noticeably larger. Larger contact bubbles will make it significantly more challenging to identify and prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. COVID-19 continues to pose a risk to Nunavummiut, and we are not immune to this pandemic. We’ve made it this far thanks to our collective efforts, but those efforts absolutely have to continue. With that said, I’m pleased to announce the following modifications to public health measures that will be occurring over the next two weeks. Effective immediately, in-territory travel advisories are lifted. Travel outside of Nunavut is still not recommended. Individuals who are travelling outside of the territory need to be aware not only of the isolation procedures to return, but also of the measures that other jurisdictions may have in place to limit or discourage travel. On June 8, workplaces and retail outlets are permitted to re-open, provided that they have safety measures in place. Galleries, museums, and libraries may also be opened for individual viewing and browsing, though group sessions are still prohibited. There will also be an increased availability of in-person health assessments at health centres across the territory. On June 15, dental clinics, physiotherapy clinics, massage therapy, and chiropractic treatments are permitted to resume. Gyms and pools will also be permitted to re-open for solo workouts and lap swimming only. Please note, that all these measures are subject to alteration should conditions change.

Department of Health Services, May 28, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update Good morning. I’d like to take this opportunity to clarify the conditions required in order for us to consider altering the current border measures in place. I have previously indicated that the border restrictions currently in place will likely be among the final public health measures that are lifted. This is because right now travel into Nunavut from outside of the territory represents the highest risk. If we want to continue Nunavut’s Path, and remove additional public health measures inside the territory, then we need to maintain our strict travel measures. This is our best chance to both return to the activities we enjoy and the programs we depend on, while still protecting the health and safety of Nunavummiut. With that said, fulfillment of any of the following conditions may influence decisions to alter our border measures. Development of a vaccine for COVID-19. We’ve already discussed this, and though it is unlikely that a vaccine will be developed and readily available in the near future, it is still a factor that would greatly influence all of our public health measures; Development or discovery of an effective treatment for COVID-19; Indication that COVID-19 is under control in our neighboring jurisdictions. This means that beyond just decreasing case numbers, we would need to see evidence that community transmission in neighboring jurisdictions is minimal and contained; And finally, achievement of sustainable and on-going diagnostic capacity in every community in Nunavut. Unfortunately, many of these factors are outside of our control, but we will continue to monitor the evolving global situation. As always, our decisions surrounding the border measures will be guided by evidence and will be designed to protect and preserve the health and safety of Nunavummiut throughout this global pandemic. I would like to remind Nunavummiut that as of Monday, June 1, playgrounds, territorial parks, and daycares are permitted to open, and the size of outdoor gatherings may increase to 25. On June 1, we will also begin our bi-weekly announcements on the assessment and potential easing of additional public health measures. The reason we have chosen two weeks as our interval of choice is straightforward. All evidence suggests that 14 days is the maximum incubation time for COVID-19. So, this 14-day window will give us an opportunity to assess the situation around us and make informed decisions based on the latest information available. Please remember that if a threat is detected, we may need to react immediately. We will provide as much warning as possible, but we may need to introduce additional public health measures right away. Finally, the Department is issuing a Public Health Advisory to the community of Sanikiluaq due to the detection of pertussis, also known as whooping cough. Whooping cough is a disease of the throat or lungs that is spread easily from person to person. Anyone can get whooping cough, but the most severe cases are in young children. For that reason, the daycare in Sanikiluaq must remain closed for the time being. Thank you.  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

These past two months have not been easy, and all Nunavummiut have had to make sacrifices. However, thanks to our combined efforts, we are protecting our families, our communities, and our territory from this pandemic, and I hope that all Nunavummiut can feel a sense of pride knowing that their actions are making a deep and measurable impact on keeping Nunavut healthy and safe. It is time for us to move forward. This does not mean that this pandemic is over. This does not mean that the threat has passed. This means that we can cautiously begin our return to the activities we enjoy, knowing that at any time we may need to change our behaviour to protect ourselves from emerging threats. In the coming weeks, we will work with our stakeholders to re-introduce our businesses, our activities, and our programs in a way that is safe, sustainable, and poses the least risk to the health and safety of Nunavummiut. Know that as we begin to loosen restrictions internally, it is imperative that our strict border measures remain to minimize the risk of introducing COVID-19 into the territory. With that being said, I’m pleased to announce that as of June 1: Daycares will be permitted to open up for regular business. The size limit for outdoor gatherings will increase to 25 people. Territorial parks will be allowed to reopen for outdoor activities only, if local circumstances permit. All park buildings will remain closed. Municipal playgrounds will be allowed to re-open, again, if local circumstances permit. These particular conditions have been selected because they are deemed low risk. Moving forward, our plan is to re-assess our condition every two weeks. If the state of COVID in Nunavut is favorable, we will continue to lift public health measures, beginning with lower risk activities and programs. If our condition is stable, we may remain at the status quo until we are confident that lifting additional restrictions would not pose an undue risk to Nunavummiut. Finally, if the threat of COVID-19 increases, or eased public health measures are posing a potential public health threat to the territory, we may need to introduce or re-introduce certain conditions. I share in everyone’s desire to return to normal. We all want to know when we can confidently and safely travel within our own territory, or to our neighbouring jurisdictions. However, trying to forecast specific dates and timelines for when we can lift all of our public health measures would be inaccurate, and frankly, it would be insincere. The COVID-19 pandemic is evolving rapidly, and every single week yields new information that shapes our strategy and our public health measures. Predictions and decisions made on the basis of today’s understanding of the virus may be obsolete in a short time. For this reason, we have opted for an approach that is flexible, cautious, and adaptive to the evolving situation around us. Again, I want to thank all Nunavummiut for their continued patience and understanding. No one is left unaffected by this pandemic, but our collective accountability has kept Nunavut safe so far. This accountability and responsibility needs to continue, and, as we loosen restrictions, we must continue to practice social distancing, stay away from others when we are sick and wash our hands often.

I am pleased to announce several items today. The first is that Rankin Inlet now has the ability to provide testing if a positive case is confirmed in-territory. I’d like to commend the medical and laboratory staff, especially Matt Stacey and Dr. Jasmine Pawa, who have been working tirelessly to become acquainted with the GeneXpert machine, and to ensure that it can be managed safely, efficiently, and accurately. Getting this machine up and running is a significant step forward for Nunavut, as this now fulfills our criteria of obtaining reliable and effective in-territory diagnostic capacity. When coupled with the fact that we still have no confirmed cases of COVID-19 inside the territory, we have now met two of our three conditions. While the situation in southern Canada will continue to play a role in our approach moving forward, we are now in a better position to consider reducing some restrictions in the territory. I have one other piece of news I would like to share. Moving forward, Kitikmeot medical travellers receiving treatment in Yellowknife are no longer required to undergo the 14-day isolation period, and instead will be permitted to return home immediately. This decision has been made through consultation with the Northwest Territories and is contingent on there being no active cases of COVID-19 in the NWT. Please note that this is for medical travellers only, and this is only when their treatment is provided in Yellowknife. Any medical traveller who needs to leave the Northwest Territories to receive treatment in other cities in Canada will still be required to complete their 14-day isolation period. For all medical travellers to whom this new rule applies who are currently in quarantine, we are working to get you home as soon as possible. As always, our main goal is the safety, health and well being of Nunavummiut. I would like to thank you all for your patience, understanding and support as we continue to care for our families and our communities.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, May 8, 2020 Minister of Health update: It was announced at the start of this year by the World Health Organization that all of 2020 was to be recognized as the Year of the Nurse and the Midwife. This was an opportunity to celebrate the vital role of nurses and midwives in the delivery of health care services across the world. Several months later, in the midst of this global pandemic, we are not just talking about their essential role in keeping us healthy, we are experiencing it firsthand. Nurses and midwives continue to deliver vital health care services in our territory, in our country, and throughout the world. May 11 to 17 is recognized as National Nursing Week. As our nurses work tirelessly to ensure that Nunavummiut have access to the care they need, I think it’s important that we all take this opportunity to show them our immense gratitude for their service and their contribution to this territory. Nunavut has more than 300 nurses who are essential to the development and delivery of programs that keep Nunavummiut healthy. In these uncertain times, as the world battles COVID-19, our nurses are on the front line, providing care to those who need it most. This pandemic has demonstrated our nurses’ willingness to put their own health and safety at risk to protect and care for those around them. This National Nursing Week, and indeed this entire Year of The Nurse and Midwife, give us an opportunity to shine a spotlight on these essential health staff. However, our gratitude for your service is not restricted to a single week, or a single year. I would like all Nunavummiut to join me in showing our ongoing appreciation for your continued dedication to this territory. Thank you.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, May 6, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update: Since it was confirmed that the detected COVID case in Nunavut was a false positive, the territory has witnessed great displays of solidarity, support, and pride. The additional restrictions in Pond Inlet have been lifted, and I hope that the community feels a measure of relief knowing that they are still COVID-free. This is good news. As a territory, we have done well so far. However, we cannot allow our celebration to lapse into complacency. It is more important than ever that we maintain these rules that we’ve all become familiar with. The threat of COVID-19 is still very real and we need to stay the course. Practise social distancing. Avoid contact with individuals who are not a member of your household. Limit trips for errands. Purchase only the supplies that your household needs. And, of course, wash your hands. There is no combination of measures that can absolutely guarantee the prevention of COVID-19. Even as we celebrate for Pond Inlet, all Nunavummiut need to remain vigilant and cautious. Follow the rules, and encourage your friends, family, and neighbours to do the same. I want to thank all Nunavummiut for their continued patience, understanding, and cooperation. We can only get through this together.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Travel outside the territory as of May 7, 2020: The Government of Nunavut’s decision to charge $2,100 per individual and $1,050 for each additional family member during the mandatory 14-day isolation stays for residents returning to the territory has been reversed. The Government of Nunavut will continue to cover these costs as long as mandatory isolation for residents returning to the territory is in place. Please keep in mind that travel outside of Nunavut during the COVID-19 pandemic is not advised.    Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

This means that although the first test result showed COVID-19 infection, further investigation and testing have not shown any other evidence of COVID-19 infection in Pond Inlet. As I have previously mentioned, no lab test is perfect. There is always a chance of false positive or false negative results. When interpreting results and deciding on an appropriate course of action, we consider many pieces of information, of which test results are just one piece. We always aim to err on the side of caution. Diagnostic tests are part of an entire system of measures to intervene on COVID-19 infection. In these circumstances the test gave an incorrect result, but the rest of the system (public health nurses, contact tracing, surveillance) have not identified any other cases of COVID-19 infection. The information available so far includes: The individual involved has not been outside of Pond Inlet for some time. We have not identified an exposure to COVID-19. We have not found any other cases of COVID-19 in Pond Inlet. We have not noticed any increase in significant respiratory infections. 		  For all of the reasons above we believe that the individual in Pond Inlet does not, and never did have COVID-19. As a result, our rapid response team will stop operating in Pond Inlet and the members of the team will begin preparing for future deployments. All territorial orders under the Public Health Emergency remain in effect. However, the additional measures specific to Pond Inlet as a result of the positive COVID-19 case are now lifted. Effective immediately, travel between Pond Inlet and other Nunavut communities may resume, and the community-specific restrictions on businesses and services in Pond Inlet are also rescinded.      Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

The Rapid Response Team is in the community, and they are implementing containment and contact tracing. As the team completes additional testing, there is the possibility that more positive cases may be confirmed in the community. This does not necessarily mean that there is community transmission and should not be cause for alarm. What this does mean is that the Rapid Response Team is doing their job, which is finding the virus and stopping it from spreading. Containment is key, and right now it is our top priority. As this process takes place, the Government of Nunavut will continue to support the community of Pond Inlet. I also want to take a moment and thank the municipality of Pond Inlet and its residents for allowing me to answer their questions earlier today on the community radio. Moving forward, I would like to remind all Nunavummiut, using the strongest possible terms, that every single social interaction carries a degree of risk. Despite all of the Government of Nunavut’s preventative measures, and the new containment measures now in place within Pond Inlet, it is impossible to reasonably predict where or when COVID-19 may be detected next. I urge all Nunavummiut to exercise a high degree of caution, and to seriously consider these risks before participating in a gathering of any kind. If you deem it necessary to participate in gatherings, then please keep track of the people with whom you interact, as this information may be necessary in case contact tracing needs to be conducted in your community. Health staff cannot get us through this alone. How well we do, and where we go from here, depends on the actions of every single Nunavummiut. Right now, the best way of slowing the spread of COVID-19 continues to be through social distancing and effective hygiene. If everyone follows these rules together, we can put ourselves in the best position to make it through this uncertain time. It’s more important than ever that we be careful, responsible, kind, and supportive. I’d like to thank Nunavummiut for their continued cooperation and understanding. As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Travel outside the territory as of May 7, 2020 Starting May 7, 2020, Nunavummiut who chose to travel outside Nunavut while the CPHO’s travel ban is still in effect will have to cover the costs of their 14-day isolation period in one of the Government of Nunavut’s isolation sites. The fee for a single individual in a room is $2,100 for the 14-day period, and each additional family member in the room will pay $1,050. Updates will be provided as they become available. 		   Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, April 30, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update As you have seen and heard, today we have announced that a case of COVID-19 has been detected within Pond Inlet. Since the onset of the pandemic, we knew that no combination of preventative measures can absolutely guarantee the prevention of COVID-19. We anticipated that sooner or later the virus would be detected in the territory. Just as we have poured extensive effort into our prevention plan, so too have we developed a comprehensive response plan to minimize, to the greatest possible extent, the impact that COVID-19 has on Nunavut. We have been in contact with hamlet authorities and have initiated our Rapid Response Plan. A Rapid Response Team has already been deployed to Pond Inlet and is scheduled to arrive early this afternoon. That team will immediately initiate containment measures, begin contact tracing, and monitor the health and well-being of persons on home isolation orders. The Pond Inlet Health Centre is well-staffed and prepared, and health centre operations will continue. All passenger travel in and out of Pond Inlet has ceased. This includes any movement in or out of the community by land travel. This travel ban is a necessary containment measure to minimize the risk of COVID-19 spreading to multiple communities at once. Until we have determined the potential spread of the virus within the community, all non-essential offices and services will be closed. There is to be no social gatherings within dwellings, and all residents of Pond Inlet are asked to continue to maintain social distancing and good hygiene. For residents of Pond Inlet, we recognize that this news may be frightening. However, the Government of Nunavut would like to assure everyone that although travel is restricted, you are not cut off from help and support. Critical services will be maintained, and plans are in place to ensure that access to services such as heat, power, water, sewer, and communications will not be interrupted. Our primary focus now is to detect and contain the virus to prevent further transmission within the community and to other communities. Anyone who has reason to believe that they have been exposed to the virus is advised to call the COVID-19 hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. or 6 p.m. or call your community health centre. Please, do not go to the health centre in person unless you are instructed to by a health official. To all Nunavummiut, know that the preventative measures that we have all been taking are more important now than ever. Everyone needs to practise social distancing, stay home whenever possible, and avoid contact with those who are not a member of your household. Together, our efforts can slow the spread of COVID-19. Finally, I remind everyone of the importance of kindness. Now is not the time for blame, or shame. It is the time for compassion, empathy, and support of your fellow Nunavummiut. The Government of Nunavut thanks all Nunavummiut for their efforts to date. We will continue to exhaust all efforts to contain the virus, and minimize its impact on Pond Inlet, and on all the territory. Only together can we all protect our territory from the threat of COVID-19.    Department of Health Services  Residents of Pond Inlet must call their health centre first. All regular appointments at the Pond Inlet Health Centre have been cancelled. Only emergency services are available.  COVID-19 Hotline and self-assessment tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or call their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days. Nunavummiut can also use the self-assessment tool available at www.gov.nu.ca COMMUNITY TRAVEL AND GATHERINGS RESTRICTION ORDER POND INLET All travel to and from Pond Inlet is banned except: People with a letter from the CPHO Medevac patients Flight crews Nunavut Inuit exercising their hunting rights as set out in Article 5 may leave and return to Pond Inlet but not travel to any other community People travelling on a flight which must land in Pond Inlet due to weather or emergency Medevac crews must restrict movements to the airport and the health centre and must wear personal protective equipment. All businesses operating in Pond Inlet must close except for: Grocery stores Fuel and motor vehicle stations Post office Restaurants open for take out service All social gatherings shall be restricted to five persons or fewer. No social gatherings in dwellings. The order can be consulted at:https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/covid-19-novel-coronavirus   Department of Health Services, April 29, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update As many of you may know, some jurisdictions in Canada have started or will soon begin a gradual lifting of the restrictions they have implemented to flatten the COVID curve. Today I’d like to speak in more detail about what needs to happen before we can do the same. There are three conditions that need to be met before we can consider relaxing existing restrictions in the territory. They are as follows: We need to achieve in-territory diagnostic capacity. This means that we need to be able to implement a rapid, accurate, and comprehensive COVID-19 testing program here in Nunavut; There needs to be significant indication that rates of COVID-19 are decreasing in the southern jurisdictions to which Nunavummiut most often travel; and There needs to remain no active cases of COVID-19 within Nunavut. The nature of these conditions means that it is difficult to assign a specific timeline to re-opening, but fulfillment of these conditions is necessary to minimize risk to public health and safety. We need to know that Nunavummiut travelling outside of the territory can do so safely, and we need to be able to respond rapidly to any confirmed cases of COVID-19 within Nunavut. I know that people are eager to go back to work, visit loved ones, and engage in social activities. However, if we lift these restrictions too early, we will increase the risk to Nunavummiut. If we aren’t careful about how we transition back from these restrictions, then we could effectively undo all the hard work and sacrifices that we’ve made over the past seven weeks. It is as important as ever that we stay the course: maintain social distancing, stay home whenever possible, and wash your hands often. These measures continue to be the best defence against COVID-19, and the best way to protect our families, our communities, and our territory.   Department of Health Services Access to health care services will remain available in all communities seven days a week. All non-urgent requests will be triaged daily. Immediate access to urgent and emergent health care services are and will continue to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. All clients are asked to call before presenting at a health facility. In Iqaluit, public health, the emergency room and inpatient unit will remain open. Well baby clinics, prenatal visits and immunizations are continuing across Nunavut. Physicians will continue community visits. If this is not possible, the visits will be conducted by telehealth or by phone.   Volumes  Total (All Isolation Locations)   Traveler Type   Guests in Isolation as of April 28   Medical Travel   206   Public   136   Total   342    Traveller repatriation summary:  Departure Date   # of Travellers from Isolation Sites   April 29   38   April 30   15   May 1   19   May 2   6   May 3   14    Critical Worker Requests As of April 28, there are 786 requests, 597 of which are critical worker requests.

The new order adds clarity around gatherings and social distancing and provides easy to understand scenarios that will help Nunavummiut more easily follow the order. It will also help businesses understand how to adjust their operations to ensure public safety and continued operation. Finally, the changes will also assist law enforcement and peace officers to more easily interpret the intent of the order in the unlikely event there is a need for enforcement. I’d like to outline some of the new definitions and information provided in the new order. Food service establishments and licensed premises remain closed. Restaurants can still provide options for take-out or delivery, as long as they abide by the rules of social distancing while doing so. All businesses deemed as Personal Service Providers must also remain closed. These include hair dressing, barbering, massage therapy, and other similar establishments. Additionally, dentists, veterinarians, and psychologists must remain closed, except for emergencies. Public playgrounds, municipal parks, and day-use areas of territorial parks also remain closed. Though still subject to closures and limitations, the following businesses are permitted to remain open: any business large enough to maintain a two-metre social distance within the workplace, or businesses that limit customers to no more than five at a time. The five-at-a-time rule does not apply to businesses that are large enough to maintain social distancing throughout the entire premise, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and similar facilities. The order provides a definition to gatherings. All organized public gatherings of more than five people remain prohibited. This includes concerts, community events, sporting events, and ceremonies such as marriages, funerals, or memorial services. Finally, all social gatherings, including social gatherings in private dwellings, shall be restricted to five persons or fewer. This includes play groups, club meetings, and meals with individuals who do not reside together. This new order does not mean that restrictions are being loosened, or that the Government of Nunavut has re-assessed the territory’s position or tolerance for risk. Instead, the definitions under this new order have been aligned with definitions being applied in other jurisdictions. This makes restrictive measures clearer and more consistent in their application and enforcement. It is strongly recommended that Nunavummiut limit contact with anyone who is not a member of their immediate household. Any social gathering carries a degree of risk, especially when we are looking at individuals from multiple different households mingling together. Nunavummiut must still exercise caution at all times, practise social distancing to the greatest extent possible, and wash hands and all shared surfaces thoroughly and often. The previous order met the intended purpose of providing necessary tools to help protect public health. However, The Government of Nunavut recognized the need to provide clearer language and definitions. For this reason, the Department of Justice worked with the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) to prepare a new Order to ensure the language is clear and understandable while remaining true to its intent.

This resource is user-friendly, available in all four official languages, and can be accessed through the Government of Nunavut webpage at https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/covid-19-novel-coronavirus. The purpose of this self-assessment tool is to provide Nunavummiut with real-time information and recommendations based on self-reported symptoms or recent travel history. The tool will help Nunavummiut determine whether they should self-isolate, and when they should contact a health care service provider for additional follow-up or testing. This tool is meant to supplement the existing resources that are already available, and it is not a replacement for social distancing and good hygiene, such as washing regularly. Mass gatherings are still banned, and everyone is still required to follow the rules. Nunavummiut who don’t have access to online resources but believe that they are displaying COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, are encouraged to call the COVID Hotline at 1-888-975-8601. You can also ask someone with internet access to complete the self-assessment on your behalf by sharing with them your travel history and any symptoms that you may be experiencing.

This means that many Nunavummiut currently in the south are coming to the end of their mandatory 14-day isolation periods. It is time for many of these residents to return home. The mandatory rules we put in place in our isolation sites are very strict. I think it is important to remind everyone that for 14 days, residents are: Confined in their hotel rooms most of the day. Have no physical contact with other residents undergoing isolation and no physical contact with the general population. Are allowed only monitored outings on hotel grounds. Must have daily health check-ins with on-site nurses. Are held responsible if they break isolation. There are no exceptions. These measures are a first step and they ensure Nunavummiut who want to come home, as well as their families and communities, remain healthy and safe. The second step is bringing residents home. I want to take a moment and outline this process: 48 hours before anticipated departure, travellers are informed on the clearance and travel process. The day before departure, the nurses on-site review each traveller’s daily check-in logs to make sure they complied with the isolation rules. The nurses conduct a final in-person assessment to ensure travellers are healthy and show no symptoms of COVID-19. The assessments and results are sent to my office – and a decision to clear a traveller for the scheduled return home is made and a letter approving travel is issued. Residents need both the letter and a proof of residency to return to the territory. The day of departure, residents approved for travel are transported from the hotel to the airport via a private shuttle, sanitized thoroughly before use. The Government of Nunavut worked with airlines to minimize, to the greatest possible extent, the risk of anyone being exposed to COVID-19 during their travel back to the territory. Airports have enhanced cleaning, sanitation and passenger procedures throughout the check-in and security process that ensure physical distancing. As an additional precaution, residents will also undergo an airline health check prior to boarding. Until they arrive at their final destination in Nunavut, residents remain bound by the isolation agreement they signed the day they accepted to enter the isolation sites. Residents will travel to Nunavut on both chartered and scheduled flights: Residents travelling on chartered flights are shuttled directly to their airplane for boarding and take-off. Once in Nunavut, they will be chartered to their final in-territory destination. Residents travelling on scheduled flights are dropped off at the airport, where they are met and guided by airline employees to check-in, through security, to the boarding area and finally on the plane. They do not come in contact with other travellers during this process and remain bound by their isolation agreement. I want to thank our returning residents for going through these drastic measures to protect their communities and Nunavut. As we welcome back friends, family members, and loved ones, it is more important than ever to follow the rules: All social gatherings are still banned, and all Nunavummiut, including those just returning to their home communities, are expected to do their part to keep Nunavut safe. Practice strict social distancing, stay home when possible, avoid contact with individuals outside of your household, and monitor your health.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Department of Health Services Isolation Sites Those in isolation have access to cable, internet, three meals a day, fresh linens and cleaning supplies.

This equipment will be used to test mine staff for COVID-19. At this time there is no evidence that screening in this fashion is a substitute for 14 days of isolation. This is why Nunavut, and every other Canadian jurisdiction, is using 14 days of isolation after exposure or travel. As a result, I have informed management of Agnico Eagle Mines that these tests do not change the current requirement for mine staff to stay out of the town of Rankin Inlet. The Department of Health is committed to improving and protecting the health of all Nunavummiut. For COVID-19 this means having testing equipment that meets Canadian standards and can be deployed to every community in Nunavut. The equipment used by AEM does not meet these criteria. If the Department of Health were to commit to using devices like this, we would not improve access to COVID testing for all Nunavummiut. The Department of Health continues to work on acquiring diagnostic capability that can be rapidly deployed and will provide quick access to results for all Nunavummiut. The combination of machines we continue to pursue will not only allow testing in all communities but will also improve our ability to rapidly diagnose a number of other infectious diseases that threaten Nunavummiut on a regular basis. Testing for COVID-19 at the wrong time can produce incorrect results and create a false sense of reassurance.     As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Department of Health Services The Public Health Emergency has been extended until April 16.

40,2020-07-13,Canada,Nunavut,,https://gov.nu.ca/education/news/covid-19-department-education-services-update,Government Website,COVID-19 Department of Education Services update,"   13 July 2020      Department of Education Services, July 13, 2020  Since March 17, when schools were closed to students, the Department of Education has been working diligently in preparation for the upcoming 2020-21 school year, specifically addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. Information on plans and guidelines for opening schools will be made available to the public as they are finalized. These will include detailed guidelines on health and safety, as well as recovery learning and assessment, and student and staff wellbeing. The Department of Education will be releasing the first document of its school opening plan later this month, after it has been reviewed by the Chief Public Health Officer and the department has heard from education stakeholders. Keeping our staff and students safe is the Department of Education’s highest priority. By working closely with the Chief Public Health Officer, and providing clear guidelines around health and safety, the Department of Education can ensure that our students are learning in a safe, supportive environment. On Wednesday, July 15, David Joanasie, Minister of Education, and Dr. Michael Patterson, Chief Public Health Officer, will be teleconferencing with District Education Authorities, the Commission scolaire francophone du Nunavut, and the Coalition of Nunavut District Education Authorities to discuss health and safety considerations related to the Department of Education’s school opening plan.   Department of Education Services, July 6, 2020  Since March 17, when schools were closed to students, the Department of Education has been working diligently in preparation for the upcoming 2020-21 school year, specifically addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.

For more information go to:  English - https://gov.nu.ca/education/information/child-care-facility-guidelines-re-opening-june-1-2020 Inuktitut - https://gov.nu.ca/iu/education/information/pairivvinnut-atuagait-matuikanniqpata-juuni-1-2020mit Inuinnaqtun - https://gov.nu.ca/in/ilinniaqtuliqiyikkut/information/nutaqqiqiviit-igluqpaini-maligahat-angmaffaaqata-imaruqtirviani-1 French - https://gov.nu.ca/fr/education/information/directives-pour-la-reouverture-des-etablissements-de-garde-denfants-le-1er   Department of Education Services, May 25, 2020  The Department of Education has developed guidelines for child-care facility reopening, including information on enhanced cleaning and hygiene, and physical distancing during drop-off and pick-up. The Department of Education will be connecting with all licensed child-care facilities in the coming days.     Department of Education Services, May 8, 2020  Child Care Facilities From March 17 to April 21, 2020, the Government of Nunavut provided licenced child care facilities $885,000 to cover parental fees. This funding enabled facilities to continue paying staff while transitioning to financial assistance programs offered by the Government of Canada, such as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the Canadian Wage Subsidy Program. The Canadian Wage Subsidy Program covers 75% of staff’s wages and has now been extended beyond June. The Department of Education provides licenced child care facilities with 				$4.2 million annually in operation and maintenance funding. This funding will continue while facilities are closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Department of Education continues to provide licencing for child care facilities, training for staff, and create and distribute educational resources. The Government of Nunavut continues to work with the Government of Canada, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., the regional Inuit organizations, and other stakeholders to support child care facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Department of Education Services, April 30, 2020  Schools in Pond Inlet are closed to the community, including school staff, until further notice. The physical distribution of student learning packages in Pond Inlet has been suspended until further notice. All Department of Education staff, including school staff, are to work from home if possible. These measures are to ensure the health and safety of Pond Inlet students, families, and staff. The Department of Education will provide support to other Government of Nunavut departments as needed. Department of Education Services, April 29, 2020 Student Learning Packages Many students have already received an initial learning package from their teachers. 		Most packages include learn-at-home work and activities for one or two weeks at a time. Learning packages are focused on strengthening skills in literacy, numeracy, and health and wellbeing. There is a mix of paper and electronic-based work, depending on the student and their circumstance.  Students and families should expect to receive learning packages for the rest of the school year. Learning packages are designed to reinforce the skills students have already learned and will not be expected to be assessed by teachers toward final grades. The department has provided continuity of learning guidelines for all school staff, which outline a number of ways that school staff can communicate with students and families. The department would like to thank all school staff for supporting their students and their families during these unprecedented times. Early Learning and Child Care Support Following direction from the Chief Public Health Officer, all child care facilities must remain closed to children until further notice. During this closure, the Department of Education has and will continue to pay all regular O&M funding to licensed child care facilities. 		This should account for a significant portion of the monthly operating costs of a facility. Because the day care closures were sudden and unexpected, the department paid parental fees temporarily to ensure facilities could continue to pay their staff, and to allow time for facilities to apply for federal subsidies, such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy. The total cost of this funding provided was $885,000.  Department of Education staff are ready to support child-care facilities in their applications to these federal programs, and we have been communicating with all facilities around this. The department continues to explore further options to support child care facilities, including possible use of federal funds.   Department of Education Services, April 17, 2020 Minister of Education update: Ullukkut, The well-being and success of Nunavut’s children and youth is the top priority of the Department of Education. In these uncertain times, we want to make sure students have the opportunity to thrive, and to pursue any future path they desire. With students’ well-being in mind, I am announcing that as of today, all schools in Nunavut will be closed to students for the rest of the 2019-20 school year. This closure is supported by the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO). Because students have already missed over a month of class time, it is even more important that all school staff report to work on April 21, 2020. As in other provinces and territories, Nunavut’s school staff are vital to ensuring our students do not fall behind in their education. The Department of Education has developed guidelines to help school staff prepare learning packages to meet the specific needs of their students. Staff will work with students and their families to determine how best to support learning. This means that for our students in Kindergarten to Grade 9, teachers will prioritize literacy and numeracy, while strengthening the skills and knowledge that have been taught so far this school year. For high school students, teachers and administrators will evaluate their individual situations. Some students may already have completed the credits they need to graduate. Others may need to complete specific courses to be eligible to graduate. Teachers may provide opportunities for students to upgrade their marks or earn the credits they need by completing suggested assignments and projects. Teachers will review their students’ outcomes to date, align them with skills that need to be strengthened, and take into consideration what is possible for them to accomplish at home. There will be a strong focus on supporting health and wellness, literacy, and numeracy for all students. This includes household projects and activities that allow families to learn together, such as reading together, journal writing, and projects that draw on the creativity of students. The Department is also aware that many families are currently on the land and may not be able to receive student learning packages. On-the-land activities like hunting and fishing complement student learning, and the department encourages these activities. Realizing Nunavut’s technology limitations, especially in some of our smaller communities, students’ continued learning will not be entirely online. This means that students’ learning packages will take many forms -- some will be paper-based, some will be activity-based, and some will be electronic. However, all of them will give students an opportunity to further their learning. Wherever possible, teachers will be asked to check in with families weekly, to see how they are progressing and if they need any extra support or resources. The best way to communicate -- either by phone, text, GN email, or through other online portals -- will be determined with students and families. Beyond creating student learning packages, staff also will be supporting students by assessing their work prior to the school closure to determine final grades, and preparing year-end report cards. To Nunavut’s high school students and their families, a reminder that all departmental exams are cancelled for the school year. For those Grade 12 students on track to graduate, I want to assure you that principals and teachers will work with you to ensure you complete any necessary requirements. We are here to help you succeed and realize your goals. Finally, school staff will also plan and prepare for the 2020-21 school year, particularly with the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic in mind. For school staff who have voluntarily returned to work and have already been preparing learning packages, many students and families recognize your hard work and expressed their appreciation. As a parent, and as Minister of Education, I want to express my sincere gratitude to you for your dedication and enthusiasm. Thank you for your efforts and commitment to Nunavut’s students. We all want the best for our children and youth. The Department of Education appreciates the support and patience Nunavummiut and our education partners have shown during these unprecedented times. The uncertainty has not been easy, but we will make it through, together. Stay safe everyone. Qujannamiik, quana, thank you, merci. Department of Education Services Students in Nunavut will not have class for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year. School staff will continue to work to support learning at home until the end of the school year. Students will be receiving learning packages from their schools to support learning at home. School staff will connect with families over the coming weeks. All high school diploma exams for this year are cancelled, and high school marks will be based on course work only. All students will receive a year-end report card. Department of Education Services, April 15, 2020 To ensure staff at licenced child care facilities continue to be paid, the Department of Education will fund parental fees for all licensed child care facilities up to April 21, 2020. The Government of Nunavut has taken strict measures to minimize the spread of COVID-19, this is why child care facilities must remain closed until further notice. Department of Education Services, April 8, 2020 Minister of Education update Yesterday, the Department of Education sent a letter to all school staff about returning to work in their home communities on April 21, 2020. This is specific to STAFF ONLY, so that they can prepare and develop continuity of learning plans in the case the school closure is extended. I want to clarify the numbers I provided yesterday – there are 1,185 staff who work in schools across the territory. Ninety-three (93) of these staff are currently out of the territory, making their way back to their home communities. This represents eight per cent (8%) of all school staff. Teachers across the country are working hard to support learning at home for students so that they are not disadvantaged by the school closure. Our students deserve the same supports, and this is why we are asking teachers to work during this time. Teachers returning to work will focus on supporting students in their education and their wellbeing by developing learning packages. This is particularly important for those students that do not have access to online resources and those who are on specialized learning plans. School staff who may have travelled out of territory must undergo a mandatory 14-day isolation period in a GN-designated isolation hub in the south before returning to Nunavut. This is the same process that all Nunavut residents, FANS students, and medical travel patients returning to Nunavut have been following. This process was established under the orders of the Chief Public Health Officer. Nunavut residents, including school staff, are responsible for their travel costs to return home to Nunavut. The GN is covering the cost of the isolation hubs for all Nunavut residents, including school staff. All GN staff, including teachers, are expected to work from within the territory. We will address any requests from staff who currently are out-of-territory to work remotely on a case-by-case basis. The Department of Education has been in continuous contact with the Nunavut Teachers’ Association (NTA) and the Coalition of Nunavut DEAs. They both support the decision to bring teachers back to work to ensure that students can continue to learn and are supported during school closures. Schools will only be reopened to students once the Chief Public Health Officer determines it is safe to do so. However, we need our staff back at work by April 21 to prepare for our students’ success and progress, whatever the next step may be. Department of Education Services, April 7, 2020 As of April 7, teachers currently in-territory can go back to school on a voluntary basis, in order to start developing learning packages for students. Guidelines on the delivery of those packages to students are being finalised by the Department of Education. All school staff are expected to return to work in their home communities on April 21, 2020. Teachers that are currently out of territory must undergo a 14-day isolation period in a designated isolation hub before returning to Nunavut. If teachers cannot begin their 14-day isolation period in time for their return on April 21, they must contact their principal and provide information on travel plans and correspondence with the isolation hubs to support any expected delays. On April 21, a decision will be made according to the recommendation of the Chief Public Health Officer. If school closures persist: School staff will be required to resume operations and will be asked to develop continuity of learning plans for all students. Teachers will be provided with clear guidance on how assessments, final report cards, and grade progression will be achieved. If schools re-open: School operations will resume as normal. In both cases, departmental exams for high school students have been cancelled until the end of June. Department of Education Services, April 3, 2020 On Tuesday, April 7, school staff will be able to access schools on a voluntary basis should they wish to prepare learning packages for students. The department has a working group developing guidelines for teachers identifying grade-specific areas of focus for learning packages. Packages may look different for each student. School access is for operational purposes only and not for recreation or other non-education-related activities. The department has also provided all schools with health and safety protocols related to COVID-19, including respiratory etiquette, hand washing, and physical distancing. Department of Education Services, March 31, 2020 Minister of Education update: Since March 17, Nunavut schools have been closed to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. As a result, parents and caregivers have been asking for educational resources to help their children continue to learn. Today I am announcing that the Department of Education has developed a learn-at-home website, Angirrami Ilinniarniq (angirrami.com). This website offers free access to some of the same educational resources used in our schools. These include downloadable books and e-books for pre-school ages and up; educational audiobooks and animated videos; tips and activities for learning; and resources for managing stress and mental health. There will also be links to download the department’s Inuktut language learning apps: Uqausiit Pinnguarutiit has fun activities that support Inuit language shape and sound recognition, and vocabulary development. Titirariuqsauti introduces Inuit language symbol sounds and printing paths.  Qimirrunaut is the department’s new Inuktut e-book library app. These apps are available for Android and iOS devices and can be downloaded from the Google Play or Apple App stores. Angirrami Ilinniarniq provides links to other online educational resources on subjects such as science, math, history, and social studies.  I want to also note that although the website launches today, new resources will be regularly added. The priority is to get our Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun resources online as quickly as possible. English and French resources will follow soon after. All the resources found on this site were created by the Department of Education and its partners, including the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and the Representative for Children and Youth’s Office, as well as the Departments of Family Services, Health, Environment, and Economic Development and Transportation. I want to thank all the students, parents, and caregivers for their patience. I know for many of you it has not been easy with schools and child care facilities closed. However, we must all do our part to prevent the spread of COVID-19. I assure you that my department has been working hard to get this website ready as quickly as possible. I encourage Nunavummiut to explore all the resources this website has to offer. Make learning a part of your daily routine! Qujannamiik, quana, thank you, merci. Department of Education Services, March 31, 2020 Today, the Department of Education Is launching a learn-at-home website, Angirrami Ilinniarniq (angirrami.com). This learn-at-home website developed by the Department of Education provides free access to help children and youth continue learning in their language during the school closure. Upon recommendation from the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO), schools and daycare facility closures for students and children will be extended until end of day April 20. At that point and time, the CPHO will reassess and provide direction. Department of Education Services, March 25, 2020 Ongoing services: Bus service contracts will continue to be paid during the three-week school closure. Department of Education Services, March 24, 2020 The Department of Education is supporting the Department of Family Services in coordinating the return of out of territory FANS students and their families to Nunavut. The Department of Education is providing funds to licensed child care facilities to cover parental fees from March 17-April 7, 2020. All licensed child care facilities in Nunavut that charge parental fees will qualify for the grant. Funding will be processed and sent to licensed child care facilities by Friday, March 27, 2020. During this time, parents will not be required to pay parental fees.

Closed /Cancelled/Suspended services: All schools and child care facilities in Nunavut are closed for a three-week period, starting Tuesday, March 17, 2020. 		  Department of Education Services update - March 19, 2020 Education and several GN departments are working closely together to reduce the impact school closures have on food programs. The Department of Education will be providing funds to all licensed child care facilities. This funding will be equal to the parental fees licenced child care facilities would be normally receiving during this three-week closure. This will allow licenced child care facilities to not charge parental fees for this period but still pay their staff as normal. Closed /Cancelled/Suspended services: All schools and child care facilities in Nunavut are closed for a three-week period, starting Tuesday, March 17, 2020.     "

Department of Community and Government Services - May 28, 2020 Minister of Community and Government Services update Ullaakkut, With the construction season upon us the Government of Nunavut (GN) has undertaken necessary preparations for construction projects to proceed during the summer and fall of 2020 in 19 Nunavut communities. This includes over 50 capital projects valued at approximately $600 million. Given the significant size of our construction program, we rely on a certain level of skilled workers from southern Canada to work on these projects alongside our Inuit and Northern labour. In consultation with Dr. Patterson, arrangements have been made to ensure that all southern workers comply with the strict requirement of the 14-day isolation period before travelling to Nunavut. The GN will control and monitor these measures at the isolation facilities in the south during the 14 days including up until workers board their flights. This follows the procedures for residents and medical travellers already in place. We need to balance the long-term infrastructure needs of communities with the current COVID-19 restrictions and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the municipalities, especially our mayors and councillors, for taking an active role in the decision to proceed with these projects during the 2020 construction season. I also would like to acknowledge the construction companies for their understanding of, and the need to respect, the directives set by Dr. Patterson to ensure that the construction projects move ahead with an understanding of maintaining the health and well-being of the workers and all Nunavummiut. Despite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are looking forward to a safe and productive construction season this summer. Thank you.   Department of Community and Government services - April 30, 2020  Critical services will be maintained in Pond Inlet, and plans are in place to ensure that access to services such as heat, power, water, sewer, and communications will not be interrupted. Community and Government Services (CGS), along with the municipality, has a plan in place for a water intake/pumping solution to ensure the community has ongoing access to water The temporary pumping system will include: A pump set up on the shore of the reservoir, Suction hose put through a drilled hole in the ice, A discharge hose to supply water into the back of the water truck, Manual chlorination into the back of the truck, and, The pump will be set up in a temporary porta-tank to provide containment for fuel refilling. 		  This solution can be managed by municipality staff. CGS is actively working on a permanent solution to be implemented later this summer. Department of Community and Government services - April 20, 2020  The Department of Community and Government services is providing an additional $2 million to municipalities to cover expenses related to COVID-19. This additional funding will ensure that hamlets are able to provide unforeseen services in response to the pandemic.  Eligible expenses include but are not limited to the purchase of cleaning materials, hiring additional staff, expenses for additional road clearing, by-law and enforcement patrols, and to cover lost revenues resulting from facility closures. Municipalities can contact their CGS regional community development office for more information.

Department of Community and Government Services - May 28, 2020 Minister of Community and Government Services update Ullaakkut, With the construction season upon us the Government of Nunavut (GN) has undertaken necessary preparations for construction projects to proceed during the summer and fall of 2020 in 19 Nunavut communities. This includes over 50 capital projects valued at approximately $600 million. Given the significant size of our construction program, we rely on a certain level of skilled workers from southern Canada to work on these projects alongside our Inuit and Northern labour. In consultation with Dr. Patterson, arrangements have been made to ensure that all southern workers comply with the strict requirement of the 14-day isolation period before travelling to Nunavut. The GN will control and monitor these measures at the isolation facilities in the south during the 14 days including up until workers board their flights. This follows the procedures for residents and medical travellers already in place. We need to balance the long-term infrastructure needs of communities with the current COVID-19 restrictions and I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the municipalities, especially our mayors and councillors, for taking an active role in the decision to proceed with these projects during the 2020 construction season. I also would like to acknowledge the construction companies for their understanding of, and the need to respect, the directives set by Dr. Patterson to ensure that the construction projects move ahead with an understanding of maintaining the health and well-being of the workers and all Nunavummiut. Despite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are looking forward to a safe and productive construction season this summer. Thank you.   Department of Community and Government services - April 30, 2020  Critical services will be maintained in Pond Inlet, and plans are in place to ensure that access to services such as heat, power, water, sewer, and communications will not be interrupted. Community and Government Services (CGS), along with the municipality, has a plan in place for a water intake/pumping solution to ensure the community has ongoing access to water The temporary pumping system will include: A pump set up on the shore of the reservoir, Suction hose put through a drilled hole in the ice, A discharge hose to supply water into the back of the water truck, Manual chlorination into the back of the truck, and, The pump will be set up in a temporary porta-tank to provide containment for fuel refilling. 		  This solution can be managed by municipality staff. CGS is actively working on a permanent solution to be implemented later this summer. Department of Community and Government services - April 20, 2020  The Department of Community and Government services is providing an additional $2 million to municipalities to cover expenses related to COVID-19. This additional funding will ensure that hamlets are able to provide unforeseen services in response to the pandemic.  Eligible expenses include but are not limited to the purchase of cleaning materials, hiring additional staff, expenses for additional road clearing, by-law and enforcement patrols, and to cover lost revenues resulting from facility closures. Municipalities can contact their CGS regional community development office for more information.

We are still waiting on confirmatory results for the presumptive case detected in the Mary River Mine, with the expectation that they will be ready sometime this week. The Department of Health continues to monitor the situation at the Mary River Mine site closely, and we will provide support as needed. I want to take this opportunity and remind Nunavummiut that: Testing is only one component of the Public Health response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Testing is important, but it is not a replacement for social distancing or hand-washing. Testing is important, but it is absolutely not a replacement for 14 days of isolation. The Government of Nunavut follows testing guidelines and best practices that have been endorsed by the World Health Organization and Health Canada. We rely on diagnostic devices that have undergone rigorous validation and accreditation processes to provide dependable testing to Nunavummiut. Even under ideal conditions, and with validated equipment, testing is not always a reliable method of identifying cases of COVID-19 and halting transmission. There is strong evidence that false negatives can occur throughout the incubation period. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the overarching goal of our public health response is to identify, contain and break transmission. The Government of Nunavut will continue to look at emerging evidence and best practices set out by public health authorities, both nationally and globally, to shape our response to COVID-19, and will alter public health measures as and when appropriate. Thank you. 			   			As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Today marks the third bi-weekly announcement for Nunavut’s Path for moving forward during COVID-19. There are still no cases of COVID-19 detected in the territory, so once again we are in a position to alter public health measures. I’m pleased to announce the following changes under the new Order Respecting Social Distancing and Gatherings, which goes into effect today: The limit for outdoor gatherings has now been increased to 50 people. The limit for indoor gatherings has been increased to 10 people. In private dwellings, this means 10 people in addition to those who reside there. The limit for gatherings at places of worship, conference facilities, community halls, rental meeting spaces, and gatherings organized by the Government of Canada, Government of Nunavut, municipal corporation, or Regional Inuit Organizations has been set at 50 people or 50% of capacity for the facility, whichever is less. In all facilities and gatherings, it is still expected that social distancing is maintained. As we take another step forward on Nunavut’s Path, and we return to some of the activities, programs, or venues that we’ve missed, we need to remain diligent in our collective commitment to practice social distancing and good hand hygiene. If you make the choice to participate in a large gathering, or attend an indoor event, or even meet up with friends for dinner, please also choose to be responsible, and choose to take actions that will keep yourself, your community, and your territory, safe. Wash your hands. Keep six feet away from others. Avoid touching your face. Sanitize high-touch areas often. Consider wearing a mask when social distancing is difficult. If you don’t feel well, stay home. Thank you. 			   			As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  Calling Ahead at Health Centres Unless you are experiencing a medical emergency, please call your health centre first before going in.

As of today, Nunavut is resuming regular medical travel to Churchill, Manitoba. As Churchill has not had a confirmed case of COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic, we have determined that the risk of resuming medical travel operations is minimal, and it is greatly outweighed by the benefits of ensuring that Nunavummiut have access to the out-of-territory care they need. Medical travellers and their escorts who travel to Churchill for treatment and do not leave the community for the duration of their stay, will be able to return directly to Nunavut without needing to isolate at a GN designated isolation facility. If the situation changes, we will re-assess and be ready to initiate contact tracing and containment measures immediately. We have also had some inquiries from cab companies regarding their operations. Under the new Order Regarding Social Distancing and Gatherings, cab companies can collect fares from multiple households at once, under specific conditions. Whenever there are multiple passengers in the cab, everyone must wear a mask. Cab drivers must provide masks for riders who do not have them. Most importantly, cab drivers must obtain consent from all passengers before picking up multiple fares. This means that any passenger who is picked up, and all subsequent fares on that ride, must indicate that they are okay with riding in a shared cab with others. All passengers can still request that they do not share their ride with others, and, for now, cab companies must comply with this request. We want to thank all cab companies who have so readily complied with recommendations to limit passenger travel and enhance sanitation procedures in order to keep Nunavummiut safe and healthy. Finally, as restaurants, bars, and other indoor locations are permitted to open, I want to continue to emphasize to Nunavummiut the necessity of social distancing, good hand hygiene, and staying home when we are sick. We need to remember, even as we return to the activities we enjoy, that this pandemic is far from over, and small actions from everyone today add up to major impacts tomorrow. Thank you.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  Calling Ahead at Health Centres Unless you are experiencing a medical emergency, please call your health centre first before going in.

I am pleased to say that after consultation with my counterpart in the GNWT, as of today, residents of the NWT can travel to Nunavut without isolating prior to arrival. The establishment of the common travel area by air or by land between the two territories does however come with strict conditions and expectations: Travel must originate from Nunavut to the NWT or from the NWT to Nunavut. Travellers have not been outside their respective territory for two weeks prior to their travel to the NWT or Nunavut. Travellers remain in either territory for the duration of their stay. Travellers from the NWT who wish to enter Nunavut, must write to: cphotravelrequests@gov.nu.ca and complete and sign the Nunavut and NWT Traveller’s Declaration form. Failure to do so will affect entry in Nunavut. Failure to answer truthfully will be subject to fines. This also applies for Nunavummiut who wish to return home after their stay in the NWT. My office will issue a letter of approval. Travellers will be required to present the approval letter prior to boarding any airplane entering Nunavut. Isolation before entering Nunavut is still required if You are a Nunavut resident who is returning home from travel in southern Canada via Yellowknife. In this case, you will need to complete a 14-day isolation period in the GN isolation hub in Yellowknife. You are an NWT resident who has travelled outside your territory less than two weeks before your scheduled arrival in Nunavut. In this case, you will need to complete the NWT isolation requirements before applying for travel to Nunavut. I want to re-assure Nunavummiut that should the current situation change in either territory, we will re-assess the common travel area and take all necessary measures to protect the health and safety of Nunavummiut. Further Information can be found in Travel and Isolation section of the Department of Health website at https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/travel-and-isolation. Today also marks the second of our bi-weekly announcements regarding the status of current health measures. Beginning June 22: Personal service providers will also be permitted to open for one-on-one sessions. This includes hairdressers and nail salons. Again, these facilities will be responsible for ensuring that PPE is available for both clients and service providers when requested. Bars and restaurants will be allowed to re-open and operate at half capacity. Last call for alcohol service will be at 9 p.m.. Facility operators need to ensure that patrons are respecting social distancing. Liquor Inspectors have the authority to enforce orders regarding social distancing, and they will be monitoring to ensure adherence to these conditions. Theatres and churches are also permitted to re-open on June 22. On June 29: Youth centres and day camps will be able to resume operations. Long-term care facilities will begin accepting visitors in a limited capacity; they can only allow one to two visitors per resident at a time, and these visitors can only be immediate family. Guidelines for re-opening will be available on the health website in the coming days. Though we can reasonably forecast what the next two weeks may bring, we must remain aware of the possible need to change or re-introduce public health measures. While we are in a position to ease restrictions, we remain vulnerable to the impacts of this global pandemic. Every week, new information becomes available. Every week, the situation can change. What doesn’t change is that social distancing, washing your hands and staying home when you are sick are the three main actions each and everyone of us can take to keep our families and our communities safe.

Right now, travel into Nunavut represents the single biggest risk for introducing COVID-19. The travel ban, and the 14-day isolation requirements for returning Nunavummiut, are meant to mitigate this risk and keep our territory safe. Knowing that, I’d like to take this opportunity to share information on the new process being implemented for reserving stays in GN southern isolation facilities. Moving forward, all Nunavummiut who must travel outside of the territory should contact the email address NUisolationreservations@nunavutcare.ca and submit an Isolation Reservation Request Form as soon as they know their plans for travel. From there, the travel team will work to identify room availability and reserve your stay in one of the designated isolation facilities. This new streamlined process is meant to help Nunavummiut plan for their 14-day quarantine period farther in advance and ensures that our travel team can anticipate and accommodate travellers in the coming months. More information, including intake days requirements, can also be found on the Department of Health’s website. Remember, non-essential travel outside of the territory is still not recommended. All individuals who are applying for critical worker exemption will continue to use the email address CPHOTravelRequests@gov.nu.ca. Finally, the Department of Health has made temporary amendments to the Medical Travel Policy to help keep our medical travellers and escorts safe from COVID-19. Specific provisions have been added to ensure that medical travellers and escorts abide by rules of social distancing, hand-washing hygiene, and other behaviours that help to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The amendments also more clearly outline the requirements for both medical travellers and escorts to complete 14 days of self-isolation at a designated isolation facility prior to returning to Nunavut. As we continue to look at ways of easing public health measures and returning the activities we enjoy, we must remain diligent and aware that the threat of COVID-19 has not yet passed. Please continue to maintain physical distancing and handwashing practices, and limit any non-essential travel out of the territory.

This annual event highlights the health risks associated with tobacco use, and advocates for effective policies to reduce tobacco consumption. Right now, we are all working hard to commit to our public health measures that protect us from the threat of COVID-19. We are social distancing, staying home as much as possible, and washing our hands as much as we can. These actions are keeping ourselves, our communities, and our territory safe. Quitting tobacco use is one more step we can take to guard ourselves against the impact of this pandemic. We know that COVID-19 is mainly a respiratory virus, and early evidence suggests that smoking can make symptoms worse. Smokers are also likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19, as smoking increases the likelihood of transmission from one’s face and lips. Please remember: do not share cigarettes, joints, or pipes. Do not pick up discarded cigarette or cannabis butts. Wash your hands often, and refrain from touching your face. The best thing that we can do for our health is to quit smoking. By making the decision to quit smoking, we can help to protect ourselves from COVID-19 today, and dramatically improve our health for the coming weeks, months, and years. Support is available for anyone who wants to explore options to help them quit. Message a counsellor on the Tobacco Has No Place Here Facebook page or call 1-866-368-7848 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The service is private and free. Counsellors can help you in Inuktitut, English, Inuinnaqtun and French. Nicotine replacement therapy, or NRT, is also available at no cost through the Non-Insured Health Benefits program at your local health centre or pharmacy. Call ahead, and ask your health care provider for information and options for NRT. Thank you. Chief Public Health Officer update Good morning. Today marks the start of Nunavut’s Path forward. Day cares, territorial parks, and playgrounds are permitted to re-open, and the size limit for outdoor gatherings has been increased to 25. Today will also be the first of our bi-weekly assessments concerning the modification of public health measures. As we look at altering public health measures, I want to take a moment and emphasize to all Nunavummiut the continued importance of social distancing. While we are in a position today to alter measures, we are not in a position to take social distancing for granted. We’ve noticed through the contact tracing of persons under investigation that people’s contact bubbles are becoming noticeably larger. Larger contact bubbles will make it significantly more challenging to identify and prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. COVID-19 continues to pose a risk to Nunavummiut, and we are not immune to this pandemic. We’ve made it this far thanks to our collective efforts, but those efforts absolutely have to continue. With that said, I’m pleased to announce the following modifications to public health measures that will be occurring over the next two weeks. Effective immediately, in-territory travel advisories are lifted. Travel outside of Nunavut is still not recommended. Individuals who are travelling outside of the territory need to be aware not only of the isolation procedures to return, but also of the measures that other jurisdictions may have in place to limit or discourage travel. On June 8, workplaces and retail outlets are permitted to re-open, provided that they have safety measures in place. Galleries, museums, and libraries may also be opened for individual viewing and browsing, though group sessions are still prohibited. There will also be an increased availability of in-person health assessments at health centres across the territory. On June 15, dental clinics, physiotherapy clinics, massage therapy, and chiropractic treatments are permitted to resume. Gyms and pools will also be permitted to re-open for solo workouts and lap swimming only. Please note, that all these measures are subject to alteration should conditions change.

Department of Health Services, May 28, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update Good morning. I’d like to take this opportunity to clarify the conditions required in order for us to consider altering the current border measures in place. I have previously indicated that the border restrictions currently in place will likely be among the final public health measures that are lifted. This is because right now travel into Nunavut from outside of the territory represents the highest risk. If we want to continue Nunavut’s Path, and remove additional public health measures inside the territory, then we need to maintain our strict travel measures. This is our best chance to both return to the activities we enjoy and the programs we depend on, while still protecting the health and safety of Nunavummiut. With that said, fulfillment of any of the following conditions may influence decisions to alter our border measures. Development of a vaccine for COVID-19. We’ve already discussed this, and though it is unlikely that a vaccine will be developed and readily available in the near future, it is still a factor that would greatly influence all of our public health measures; Development or discovery of an effective treatment for COVID-19; Indication that COVID-19 is under control in our neighboring jurisdictions. This means that beyond just decreasing case numbers, we would need to see evidence that community transmission in neighboring jurisdictions is minimal and contained; And finally, achievement of sustainable and on-going diagnostic capacity in every community in Nunavut. Unfortunately, many of these factors are outside of our control, but we will continue to monitor the evolving global situation. As always, our decisions surrounding the border measures will be guided by evidence and will be designed to protect and preserve the health and safety of Nunavummiut throughout this global pandemic. I would like to remind Nunavummiut that as of Monday, June 1, playgrounds, territorial parks, and daycares are permitted to open, and the size of outdoor gatherings may increase to 25. On June 1, we will also begin our bi-weekly announcements on the assessment and potential easing of additional public health measures. The reason we have chosen two weeks as our interval of choice is straightforward. All evidence suggests that 14 days is the maximum incubation time for COVID-19. So, this 14-day window will give us an opportunity to assess the situation around us and make informed decisions based on the latest information available. Please remember that if a threat is detected, we may need to react immediately. We will provide as much warning as possible, but we may need to introduce additional public health measures right away. Finally, the Department is issuing a Public Health Advisory to the community of Sanikiluaq due to the detection of pertussis, also known as whooping cough. Whooping cough is a disease of the throat or lungs that is spread easily from person to person. Anyone can get whooping cough, but the most severe cases are in young children. For that reason, the daycare in Sanikiluaq must remain closed for the time being. Thank you.

These past two months have not been easy, and all Nunavummiut have had to make sacrifices. However, thanks to our combined efforts, we are protecting our families, our communities, and our territory from this pandemic, and I hope that all Nunavummiut can feel a sense of pride knowing that their actions are making a deep and measurable impact on keeping Nunavut healthy and safe. It is time for us to move forward. This does not mean that this pandemic is over. This does not mean that the threat has passed. This means that we can cautiously begin our return to the activities we enjoy, knowing that at any time we may need to change our behaviour to protect ourselves from emerging threats. In the coming weeks, we will work with our stakeholders to re-introduce our businesses, our activities, and our programs in a way that is safe, sustainable, and poses the least risk to the health and safety of Nunavummiut. Know that as we begin to loosen restrictions internally, it is imperative that our strict border measures remain to minimize the risk of introducing COVID-19 into the territory. With that being said, I’m pleased to announce that as of June 1: Daycares will be permitted to open up for regular business. The size limit for outdoor gatherings will increase to 25 people. Territorial parks will be allowed to reopen for outdoor activities only, if local circumstances permit. All park buildings will remain closed. Municipal playgrounds will be allowed to re-open, again, if local circumstances permit. These particular conditions have been selected because they are deemed low risk. Moving forward, our plan is to re-assess our condition every two weeks. If the state of COVID in Nunavut is favorable, we will continue to lift public health measures, beginning with lower risk activities and programs. If our condition is stable, we may remain at the status quo until we are confident that lifting additional restrictions would not pose an undue risk to Nunavummiut. Finally, if the threat of COVID-19 increases, or eased public health measures are posing a potential public health threat to the territory, we may need to introduce or re-introduce certain conditions. I share in everyone’s desire to return to normal. We all want to know when we can confidently and safely travel within our own territory, or to our neighbouring jurisdictions. However, trying to forecast specific dates and timelines for when we can lift all of our public health measures would be inaccurate, and frankly, it would be insincere. The COVID-19 pandemic is evolving rapidly, and every single week yields new information that shapes our strategy and our public health measures. Predictions and decisions made on the basis of today’s understanding of the virus may be obsolete in a short time. For this reason, we have opted for an approach that is flexible, cautious, and adaptive to the evolving situation around us. Again, I want to thank all Nunavummiut for their continued patience and understanding. No one is left unaffected by this pandemic, but our collective accountability has kept Nunavut safe so far. This accountability and responsibility needs to continue, and, as we loosen restrictions, we must continue to practice social distancing, stay away from others when we are sick and wash our hands often.

I am pleased to announce several items today. The first is that Rankin Inlet now has the ability to provide testing if a positive case is confirmed in-territory. I’d like to commend the medical and laboratory staff, especially Matt Stacey and Dr. Jasmine Pawa, who have been working tirelessly to become acquainted with the GeneXpert machine, and to ensure that it can be managed safely, efficiently, and accurately. Getting this machine up and running is a significant step forward for Nunavut, as this now fulfills our criteria of obtaining reliable and effective in-territory diagnostic capacity. When coupled with the fact that we still have no confirmed cases of COVID-19 inside the territory, we have now met two of our three conditions. While the situation in southern Canada will continue to play a role in our approach moving forward, we are now in a better position to consider reducing some restrictions in the territory. I have one other piece of news I would like to share. Moving forward, Kitikmeot medical travellers receiving treatment in Yellowknife are no longer required to undergo the 14-day isolation period, and instead will be permitted to return home immediately. This decision has been made through consultation with the Northwest Territories and is contingent on there being no active cases of COVID-19 in the NWT. Please note that this is for medical travellers only, and this is only when their treatment is provided in Yellowknife. Any medical traveller who needs to leave the Northwest Territories to receive treatment in other cities in Canada will still be required to complete their 14-day isolation period. For all medical travellers to whom this new rule applies who are currently in quarantine, we are working to get you home as soon as possible. As always, our main goal is the safety, health and well being of Nunavummiut. I would like to thank you all for your patience, understanding and support as we continue to care for our families and our communities.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, May 8, 2020 Minister of Health update: It was announced at the start of this year by the World Health Organization that all of 2020 was to be recognized as the Year of the Nurse and the Midwife. This was an opportunity to celebrate the vital role of nurses and midwives in the delivery of health care services across the world. Several months later, in the midst of this global pandemic, we are not just talking about their essential role in keeping us healthy, we are experiencing it firsthand. Nurses and midwives continue to deliver vital health care services in our territory, in our country, and throughout the world. May 11 to 17 is recognized as National Nursing Week. As our nurses work tirelessly to ensure that Nunavummiut have access to the care they need, I think it’s important that we all take this opportunity to show them our immense gratitude for their service and their contribution to this territory. Nunavut has more than 300 nurses who are essential to the development and delivery of programs that keep Nunavummiut healthy. In these uncertain times, as the world battles COVID-19, our nurses are on the front line, providing care to those who need it most. This pandemic has demonstrated our nurses’ willingness to put their own health and safety at risk to protect and care for those around them. This National Nursing Week, and indeed this entire Year of The Nurse and Midwife, give us an opportunity to shine a spotlight on these essential health staff. However, our gratitude for your service is not restricted to a single week, or a single year. I would like all Nunavummiut to join me in showing our ongoing appreciation for your continued dedication to this territory. Thank you.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following:  Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, May 6, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update: Since it was confirmed that the detected COVID case in Nunavut was a false positive, the territory has witnessed great displays of solidarity, support, and pride. The additional restrictions in Pond Inlet have been lifted, and I hope that the community feels a measure of relief knowing that they are still COVID-free. This is good news. As a territory, we have done well so far. However, we cannot allow our celebration to lapse into complacency. It is more important than ever that we maintain these rules that we’ve all become familiar with. The threat of COVID-19 is still very real and we need to stay the course. Practise social distancing. Avoid contact with individuals who are not a member of your household. Limit trips for errands. Purchase only the supplies that your household needs. And, of course, wash your hands. There is no combination of measures that can absolutely guarantee the prevention of COVID-19. Even as we celebrate for Pond Inlet, all Nunavummiut need to remain vigilant and cautious. Follow the rules, and encourage your friends, family, and neighbours to do the same. I want to thank all Nunavummiut for their continued patience, understanding, and cooperation. We can only get through this together.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Travel outside the territory as of May 7, 2020: The Government of Nunavut’s decision to charge $2,100 per individual and $1,050 for each additional family member during the mandatory 14-day isolation stays for residents returning to the territory has been reversed. The Government of Nunavut will continue to cover these costs as long as mandatory isolation for residents returning to the territory is in place. Please keep in mind that travel outside of Nunavut during the COVID-19 pandemic is not advised.    Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

This means that although the first test result showed COVID-19 infection, further investigation and testing have not shown any other evidence of COVID-19 infection in Pond Inlet. As I have previously mentioned, no lab test is perfect. There is always a chance of false positive or false negative results. When interpreting results and deciding on an appropriate course of action, we consider many pieces of information, of which test results are just one piece. We always aim to err on the side of caution. Diagnostic tests are part of an entire system of measures to intervene on COVID-19 infection. In these circumstances the test gave an incorrect result, but the rest of the system (public health nurses, contact tracing, surveillance) have not identified any other cases of COVID-19 infection. The information available so far includes: The individual involved has not been outside of Pond Inlet for some time. We have not identified an exposure to COVID-19. We have not found any other cases of COVID-19 in Pond Inlet. We have not noticed any increase in significant respiratory infections. 		  For all of the reasons above we believe that the individual in Pond Inlet does not, and never did have COVID-19. As a result, our rapid response team will stop operating in Pond Inlet and the members of the team will begin preparing for future deployments. All territorial orders under the Public Health Emergency remain in effect. However, the additional measures specific to Pond Inlet as a result of the positive COVID-19 case are now lifted.

The Rapid Response Team is in the community, and they are implementing containment and contact tracing. As the team completes additional testing, there is the possibility that more positive cases may be confirmed in the community. This does not necessarily mean that there is community transmission and should not be cause for alarm. What this does mean is that the Rapid Response Team is doing their job, which is finding the virus and stopping it from spreading. Containment is key, and right now it is our top priority. As this process takes place, the Government of Nunavut will continue to support the community of Pond Inlet. I also want to take a moment and thank the municipality of Pond Inlet and its residents for allowing me to answer their questions earlier today on the community radio. Moving forward, I would like to remind all Nunavummiut, using the strongest possible terms, that every single social interaction carries a degree of risk. Despite all of the Government of Nunavut’s preventative measures, and the new containment measures now in place within Pond Inlet, it is impossible to reasonably predict where or when COVID-19 may be detected next. I urge all Nunavummiut to exercise a high degree of caution, and to seriously consider these risks before participating in a gathering of any kind. If you deem it necessary to participate in gatherings, then please keep track of the people with whom you interact, as this information may be necessary in case contact tracing needs to be conducted in your community. Health staff cannot get us through this alone. How well we do, and where we go from here, depends on the actions of every single Nunavummiut. Right now, the best way of slowing the spread of COVID-19 continues to be through social distancing and effective hygiene. If everyone follows these rules together, we can put ourselves in the best position to make it through this uncertain time. It’s more important than ever that we be careful, responsible, kind, and supportive. I’d like to thank Nunavummiut for their continued cooperation and understanding. As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Travel outside the territory as of May 7, 2020 Starting May 7, 2020, Nunavummiut who chose to travel outside Nunavut while the CPHO’s travel ban is still in effect will have to cover the costs of their 14-day isolation period in one of the Government of Nunavut’s isolation sites. The fee for a single individual in a room is $2,100 for the 14-day period, and each additional family member in the room will pay $1,050. Updates will be provided as they become available. 		   Department of Health Services  COVID Hotline and Self-Assessment Tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days.

Department of Health Services, April 30, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update As you have seen and heard, today we have announced that a case of COVID-19 has been detected within Pond Inlet. Since the onset of the pandemic, we knew that no combination of preventative measures can absolutely guarantee the prevention of COVID-19. We anticipated that sooner or later the virus would be detected in the territory. Just as we have poured extensive effort into our prevention plan, so too have we developed a comprehensive response plan to minimize, to the greatest possible extent, the impact that COVID-19 has on Nunavut. We have been in contact with hamlet authorities and have initiated our Rapid Response Plan. A Rapid Response Team has already been deployed to Pond Inlet and is scheduled to arrive early this afternoon. That team will immediately initiate containment measures, begin contact tracing, and monitor the health and well-being of persons on home isolation orders. The Pond Inlet Health Centre is well-staffed and prepared, and health centre operations will continue. All passenger travel in and out of Pond Inlet has ceased. This includes any movement in or out of the community by land travel. This travel ban is a necessary containment measure to minimize the risk of COVID-19 spreading to multiple communities at once. Until we have determined the potential spread of the virus within the community, all non-essential offices and services will be closed. There is to be no social gatherings within dwellings, and all residents of Pond Inlet are asked to continue to maintain social distancing and good hygiene. For residents of Pond Inlet, we recognize that this news may be frightening. However, the Government of Nunavut would like to assure everyone that although travel is restricted, you are not cut off from help and support. Critical services will be maintained, and plans are in place to ensure that access to services such as heat, power, water, sewer, and communications will not be interrupted. Our primary focus now is to detect and contain the virus to prevent further transmission within the community and to other communities. Anyone who has reason to believe that they have been exposed to the virus is advised to call the COVID-19 hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. or 6 p.m. or call your community health centre. Please, do not go to the health centre in person unless you are instructed to by a health official. To all Nunavummiut, know that the preventative measures that we have all been taking are more important now than ever. Everyone needs to practise social distancing, stay home whenever possible, and avoid contact with those who are not a member of your household. Together, our efforts can slow the spread of COVID-19. Finally, I remind everyone of the importance of kindness. Now is not the time for blame, or shame. It is the time for compassion, empathy, and support of your fellow Nunavummiut. The Government of Nunavut thanks all Nunavummiut for their efforts to date. We will continue to exhaust all efforts to contain the virus, and minimize its impact on Pond Inlet, and on all the territory. Only together can we all protect our territory from the threat of COVID-19.    Department of Health Services  Residents of Pond Inlet must call their health centre first. All regular appointments at the Pond Inlet Health Centre have been cancelled. Only emergency services are available.  COVID-19 Hotline and self-assessment tool Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or call their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days. Nunavummiut can also use the self-assessment tool available at www.gov.nu.ca COMMUNITY TRAVEL AND GATHERINGS RESTRICTION ORDER POND INLET All travel to and from Pond Inlet is banned except: People with a letter from the CPHO Medevac patients Flight crews Nunavut Inuit exercising their hunting rights as set out in Article 5 may leave and return to Pond Inlet but not travel to any other community People travelling on a flight which must land in Pond Inlet due to weather or emergency Medevac crews must restrict movements to the airport and the health centre and must wear personal protective equipment. All businesses operating in Pond Inlet must close except for: Grocery stores Fuel and motor vehicle stations Post office Restaurants open for take out service All social gatherings shall be restricted to five persons or fewer. No social gatherings in dwellings. The order can be consulted at:https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/covid-19-novel-coronavirus   Department of Health Services, April 29, 2020 Chief Public Health Officer update As many of you may know, some jurisdictions in Canada have started or will soon begin a gradual lifting of the restrictions they have implemented to flatten the COVID curve. Today I’d like to speak in more detail about what needs to happen before we can do the same. There are three conditions that need to be met before we can consider relaxing existing restrictions in the territory. They are as follows: We need to achieve in-territory diagnostic capacity. This means that we need to be able to implement a rapid, accurate, and comprehensive COVID-19 testing program here in Nunavut; There needs to be significant indication that rates of COVID-19 are decreasing in the southern jurisdictions to which Nunavummiut most often travel; and There needs to remain no active cases of COVID-19 within Nunavut. The nature of these conditions means that it is difficult to assign a specific timeline to re-opening, but fulfillment of these conditions is necessary to minimize risk to public health and safety. We need to know that Nunavummiut travelling outside of the territory can do so safely, and we need to be able to respond rapidly to any confirmed cases of COVID-19 within Nunavut. I know that people are eager to go back to work, visit loved ones, and engage in social activities. However, if we lift these restrictions too early, we will increase the risk to Nunavummiut. If we aren’t careful about how we transition back from these restrictions, then we could effectively undo all the hard work and sacrifices that we’ve made over the past seven weeks. It is as important as ever that we stay the course: maintain social distancing, stay home whenever possible, and wash your hands often. These measures continue to be the best defence against COVID-19, and the best way to protect our families, our communities, and our territory.   Department of Health Services Access to health care services will remain available in all communities seven days a week. All non-urgent requests will be triaged daily. Immediate access to urgent and emergent health care services are and will continue to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. All clients are asked to call before presenting at a health facility. In Iqaluit, public health, the emergency room and inpatient unit will remain open. Well baby clinics, prenatal visits and immunizations are continuing across Nunavut. Physicians will continue community visits. If this is not possible, the visits will be conducted by telehealth or by phone.   Volumes  Total (All Isolation Locations)   Traveler Type   Guests in Isolation as of April 28   Medical Travel   206   Public   136   Total   342    Traveller repatriation summary:  Departure Date   # of Travellers from Isolation Sites   April 29   38   April 30   15   May 1   19   May 2   6   May 3   14    Critical Worker Requests As of April 28, there are 786 requests, 597 of which are critical worker requests.

The new order adds clarity around gatherings and social distancing and provides easy to understand scenarios that will help Nunavummiut more easily follow the order. It will also help businesses understand how to adjust their operations to ensure public safety and continued operation. Finally, the changes will also assist law enforcement and peace officers to more easily interpret the intent of the order in the unlikely event there is a need for enforcement. I’d like to outline some of the new definitions and information provided in the new order. Food service establishments and licensed premises remain closed. Restaurants can still provide options for take-out or delivery, as long as they abide by the rules of social distancing while doing so. All businesses deemed as Personal Service Providers must also remain closed. These include hair dressing, barbering, massage therapy, and other similar establishments. Additionally, dentists, veterinarians, and psychologists must remain closed, except for emergencies. Public playgrounds, municipal parks, and day-use areas of territorial parks also remain closed. Though still subject to closures and limitations, the following businesses are permitted to remain open: any business large enough to maintain a two-metre social distance within the workplace, or businesses that limit customers to no more than five at a time. The five-at-a-time rule does not apply to businesses that are large enough to maintain social distancing throughout the entire premise, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, and similar facilities. The order provides a definition to gatherings. All organized public gatherings of more than five people remain prohibited. This includes concerts, community events, sporting events, and ceremonies such as marriages, funerals, or memorial services. Finally, all social gatherings, including social gatherings in private dwellings, shall be restricted to five persons or fewer. This includes play groups, club meetings, and meals with individuals who do not reside together. This new order does not mean that restrictions are being loosened, or that the Government of Nunavut has re-assessed the territory’s position or tolerance for risk. Instead, the definitions under this new order have been aligned with definitions being applied in other jurisdictions. This makes restrictive measures clearer and more consistent in their application and enforcement. It is strongly recommended that Nunavummiut limit contact with anyone who is not a member of their immediate household. Any social gathering carries a degree of risk, especially when we are looking at individuals from multiple different households mingling together. Nunavummiut must still exercise caution at all times, practise social distancing to the greatest extent possible, and wash hands and all shared surfaces thoroughly and often. The previous order met the intended purpose of providing necessary tools to help protect public health. However, The Government of Nunavut recognized the need to provide clearer language and definitions. For this reason, the Department of Justice worked with the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) to prepare a new Order to ensure the language is clear and understandable while remaining true to its intent.

This resource is user-friendly, available in all four official languages, and can be accessed through the Government of Nunavut webpage at https://gov.nu.ca/health/information/covid-19-novel-coronavirus. The purpose of this self-assessment tool is to provide Nunavummiut with real-time information and recommendations based on self-reported symptoms or recent travel history. The tool will help Nunavummiut determine whether they should self-isolate, and when they should contact a health care service provider for additional follow-up or testing. This tool is meant to supplement the existing resources that are already available, and it is not a replacement for social distancing and good hygiene, such as washing regularly. Mass gatherings are still banned, and everyone is still required to follow the rules. Nunavummiut who don’t have access to online resources but believe that they are displaying COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, are encouraged to call the COVID Hotline at 1-888-975-8601. You can also ask someone with internet access to complete the self-assessment on your behalf by sharing with them your travel history and any symptoms that you may be experiencing.

This means that many Nunavummiut currently in the south are coming to the end of their mandatory 14-day isolation periods. It is time for many of these residents to return home. The mandatory rules we put in place in our isolation sites are very strict. I think it is important to remind everyone that for 14 days, residents are: Confined in their hotel rooms most of the day. Have no physical contact with other residents undergoing isolation and no physical contact with the general population. Are allowed only monitored outings on hotel grounds. Must have daily health check-ins with on-site nurses. Are held responsible if they break isolation. There are no exceptions. These measures are a first step and they ensure Nunavummiut who want to come home, as well as their families and communities, remain healthy and safe. The second step is bringing residents home. I want to take a moment and outline this process: 48 hours before anticipated departure, travellers are informed on the clearance and travel process. The day before departure, the nurses on-site review each traveller’s daily check-in logs to make sure they complied with the isolation rules. The nurses conduct a final in-person assessment to ensure travellers are healthy and show no symptoms of COVID-19. The assessments and results are sent to my office – and a decision to clear a traveller for the scheduled return home is made and a letter approving travel is issued. Residents need both the letter and a proof of residency to return to the territory. The day of departure, residents approved for travel are transported from the hotel to the airport via a private shuttle, sanitized thoroughly before use. The Government of Nunavut worked with airlines to minimize, to the greatest possible extent, the risk of anyone being exposed to COVID-19 during their travel back to the territory. Airports have enhanced cleaning, sanitation and passenger procedures throughout the check-in and security process that ensure physical distancing. As an additional precaution, residents will also undergo an airline health check prior to boarding. Until they arrive at their final destination in Nunavut, residents remain bound by the isolation agreement they signed the day they accepted to enter the isolation sites. Residents will travel to Nunavut on both chartered and scheduled flights: Residents travelling on chartered flights are shuttled directly to their airplane for boarding and take-off. Once in Nunavut, they will be chartered to their final in-territory destination. Residents travelling on scheduled flights are dropped off at the airport, where they are met and guided by airline employees to check-in, through security, to the boarding area and finally on the plane. They do not come in contact with other travellers during this process and remain bound by their isolation agreement. I want to thank our returning residents for going through these drastic measures to protect their communities and Nunavut. As we welcome back friends, family members, and loved ones, it is more important than ever to follow the rules: All social gatherings are still banned, and all Nunavummiut, including those just returning to their home communities, are expected to do their part to keep Nunavut safe. Practice strict social distancing, stay home when possible, avoid contact with individuals outside of your household, and monitor your health.   As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Department of Health Services Isolation Sites Those in isolation have access to cable, internet, three meals a day, fresh linens and cleaning supplies.

This equipment will be used to test mine staff for COVID-19. At this time there is no evidence that screening in this fashion is a substitute for 14 days of isolation. This is why Nunavut, and every other Canadian jurisdiction, is using 14 days of isolation after exposure or travel. As a result, I have informed management of Agnico Eagle Mines that these tests do not change the current requirement for mine staff to stay out of the town of Rankin Inlet. The Department of Health is committed to improving and protecting the health of all Nunavummiut. For COVID-19 this means having testing equipment that meets Canadian standards and can be deployed to every community in Nunavut. The equipment used by AEM does not meet these criteria. If the Department of Health were to commit to using devices like this, we would not improve access to COVID testing for all Nunavummiut. The Department of Health continues to work on acquiring diagnostic capability that can be rapidly deployed and will provide quick access to results for all Nunavummiut. The combination of machines we continue to pursue will not only allow testing in all communities but will also improve our ability to rapidly diagnose a number of other infectious diseases that threaten Nunavummiut on a regular basis. Testing for COVID-19 at the wrong time can produce incorrect results and create a false sense of reassurance.     As part of the Government of Nunavut’s (GN) effort to protect Nunavummiut against the risk of COVID-19, GN Departments are implementing the following: Department of Health Services The Public Health Emergency has been extended until April 16.

47,2020-07-06,Canada,Nunavut,,https://gov.nu.ca/education/news/covid-19-department-education-services-update,Government Website,COVID-19 Department of Education Services update,"   06 July 2020     Department of Education Services, July 6, 2020  Since March 17, when schools were closed to students, the Department of Education has been working diligently in preparation for the upcoming 2020-21 school year, specifically addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. Information on plans and guidelines for opening schools will be made available to the public as they are finalized. These will include detailed guidelines on health and safety, as well as recovery learning and assessment, and student and staff wellbeing. The Department of Education will be releasing the first document of its school opening plan later this month, after it has been reviewed by the Chief Public Health Officer and the department has heard from education stakeholders. Keeping our staff and students safe is the Department of Education’s highest priority. By working closely with the Chief Public Health Officer, and providing clear guidelines around health and safety, the Department of Education can ensure that our students are learning in a safe, supportive environment.   Department of Education Services, May 28, 2020 The Department of Education has developed guidelines for child-care facility reopening, including information on enhanced cleaning and hygiene, and physical distancing during drop-off and pick-up. For more information go to:  English - https://gov.nu.ca/education/information/child-care-facility-guidelines-re-opening-june-1-2020 Inuktitut - https://gov.nu.ca/iu/education/information/pairivvinnut-atuagait-matuikanniqpata-juuni-1-2020mit Inuinnaqtun - https://gov.nu.ca/in/ilinniaqtuliqiyikkut/information/nutaqqiqiviit-igluqpaini-maligahat-angmaffaaqata-imaruqtirviani-1 French - https://gov.nu.ca/fr/education/information/directives-pour-la-reouverture-des-etablissements-de-garde-denfants-le-1er   Department of Education Services, May 25, 2020  The Department of Education has developed guidelines for child-care facility reopening, including information on enhanced cleaning and hygiene, and physical distancing during drop-off and pick-up. The Department of Education will be connecting with all licensed child-care facilities in the coming days.     Department of Education Services, May 8, 2020  Child Care Facilities From March 17 to April 21, 2020, the Government of Nunavut provided licenced child care facilities $885,000 to cover parental fees. This funding enabled facilities to continue paying staff while transitioning to financial assistance programs offered by the Government of Canada, such as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) and the Canadian Wage Subsidy Program. The Canadian Wage Subsidy Program covers 75% of staff’s wages and has now been extended beyond June. The Department of Education provides licenced child care facilities with 				$4.2 million annually in operation and maintenance funding. This funding will continue while facilities are closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Department of Education continues to provide licencing for child care facilities, training for staff, and create and distribute educational resources. The Government of Nunavut continues to work with the Government of Canada, Nunavut Tunngavik Inc., the regional Inuit organizations, and other stakeholders to support child care facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Department of Education Services, April 30, 2020  Schools in Pond Inlet are closed to the community, including school staff, until further notice. The physical distribution of student learning packages in Pond Inlet has been suspended until further notice. All Department of Education staff, including school staff, are to work from home if possible. These measures are to ensure the health and safety of Pond Inlet students, families, and staff. The Department of Education will provide support to other Government of Nunavut departments as needed. Department of Education Services, April 29, 2020 Student Learning Packages Many students have already received an initial learning package from their teachers. 		Most packages include learn-at-home work and activities for one or two weeks at a time. Learning packages are focused on strengthening skills in literacy, numeracy, and health and wellbeing. There is a mix of paper and electronic-based work, depending on the student and their circumstance.  Students and families should expect to receive learning packages for the rest of the school year. Learning packages are designed to reinforce the skills students have already learned and will not be expected to be assessed by teachers toward final grades. The department has provided continuity of learning guidelines for all school staff, which outline a number of ways that school staff can communicate with students and families. The department would like to thank all school staff for supporting their students and their families during these unprecedented times. Early Learning and Child Care Support Following direction from the Chief Public Health Officer, all child care facilities must remain closed to children until further notice. During this closure, the Department of Education has and will continue to pay all regular O&M funding to licensed child care facilities. 		This should account for a significant portion of the monthly operating costs of a facility. Because the day care closures were sudden and unexpected, the department paid parental fees temporarily to ensure facilities could continue to pay their staff, and to allow time for facilities to apply for federal subsidies, such as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy. The total cost of this funding provided was $885,000.  Department of Education staff are ready to support child-care facilities in their applications to these federal programs, and we have been communicating with all facilities around this. The department continues to explore further options to support child care facilities, including possible use of federal funds.   Department of Education Services, April 17, 2020 Minister of Education update: Ullukkut, The well-being and success of Nunavut’s children and youth is the top priority of the Department of Education. In these uncertain times, we want to make sure students have the opportunity to thrive, and to pursue any future path they desire. With students’ well-being in mind, I am announcing that as of today, all schools in Nunavut will be closed to students for the rest of the 2019-20 school year. This closure is supported by the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO). Because students have already missed over a month of class time, it is even more important that all school staff report to work on April 21, 2020. As in other provinces and territories, Nunavut’s school staff are vital to ensuring our students do not fall behind in their education. The Department of Education has developed guidelines to help school staff prepare learning packages to meet the specific needs of their students. Staff will work with students and their families to determine how best to support learning. This means that for our students in Kindergarten to Grade 9, teachers will prioritize literacy and numeracy, while strengthening the skills and knowledge that have been taught so far this school year. For high school students, teachers and administrators will evaluate their individual situations. Some students may already have completed the credits they need to graduate. Others may need to complete specific courses to be eligible to graduate. Teachers may provide opportunities for students to upgrade their marks or earn the credits they need by completing suggested assignments and projects. Teachers will review their students’ outcomes to date, align them with skills that need to be strengthened, and take into consideration what is possible for them to accomplish at home. There will be a strong focus on supporting health and wellness, literacy, and numeracy for all students. This includes household projects and activities that allow families to learn together, such as reading together, journal writing, and projects that draw on the creativity of students. The Department is also aware that many families are currently on the land and may not be able to receive student learning packages. On-the-land activities like hunting and fishing complement student learning, and the department encourages these activities. Realizing Nunavut’s technology limitations, especially in some of our smaller communities, students’ continued learning will not be entirely online. This means that students’ learning packages will take many forms -- some will be paper-based, some will be activity-based, and some will be electronic. However, all of them will give students an opportunity to further their learning. Wherever possible, teachers will be asked to check in with families weekly, to see how they are progressing and if they need any extra support or resources. The best way to communicate -- either by phone, text, GN email, or through other online portals -- will be determined with students and families. Beyond creating student learning packages, staff also will be supporting students by assessing their work prior to the school closure to determine final grades, and preparing year-end report cards. To Nunavut’s high school students and their families, a reminder that all departmental exams are cancelled for the school year. For those Grade 12 students on track to graduate, I want to assure you that principals and teachers will work with you to ensure you complete any necessary requirements. We are here to help you succeed and realize your goals. Finally, school staff will also plan and prepare for the 2020-21 school year, particularly with the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic in mind. For school staff who have voluntarily returned to work and have already been preparing learning packages, many students and families recognize your hard work and expressed their appreciation. As a parent, and as Minister of Education, I want to express my sincere gratitude to you for your dedication and enthusiasm. Thank you for your efforts and commitment to Nunavut’s students. We all want the best for our children and youth. The Department of Education appreciates the support and patience Nunavummiut and our education partners have shown during these unprecedented times. The uncertainty has not been easy, but we will make it through, together. Stay safe everyone. Qujannamiik, quana, thank you, merci. Department of Education Services Students in Nunavut will not have class for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year. School staff will continue to work to support learning at home until the end of the school year. Students will be receiving learning packages from their schools to support learning at home. School staff will connect with families over the coming weeks. All high school diploma exams for this year are cancelled, and high school marks will be based on course work only. All students will receive a year-end report card. Department of Education Services, April 15, 2020 To ensure staff at licenced child care facilities continue to be paid, the Department of Education will fund parental fees for all licensed child care facilities up to April 21, 2020. The Government of Nunavut has taken strict measures to minimize the spread of COVID-19, this is why child care facilities must remain closed until further notice. Department of Education Services, April 8, 2020 Minister of Education update Yesterday, the Department of Education sent a letter to all school staff about returning to work in their home communities on April 21, 2020. This is specific to STAFF ONLY, so that they can prepare and develop continuity of learning plans in the case the school closure is extended. I want to clarify the numbers I provided yesterday – there are 1,185 staff who work in schools across the territory. Ninety-three (93) of these staff are currently out of the territory, making their way back to their home communities. This represents eight per cent (8%) of all school staff. Teachers across the country are working hard to support learning at home for students so that they are not disadvantaged by the school closure. Our students deserve the same supports, and this is why we are asking teachers to work during this time. Teachers returning to work will focus on supporting students in their education and their wellbeing by developing learning packages. This is particularly important for those students that do not have access to online resources and those who are on specialized learning plans. School staff who may have travelled out of territory must undergo a mandatory 14-day isolation period in a GN-designated isolation hub in the south before returning to Nunavut. This is the same process that all Nunavut residents, FANS students, and medical travel patients returning to Nunavut have been following. This process was established under the orders of the Chief Public Health Officer. Nunavut residents, including school staff, are responsible for their travel costs to return home to Nunavut. The GN is covering the cost of the isolation hubs for all Nunavut residents, including school staff. All GN staff, including teachers, are expected to work from within the territory. We will address any requests from staff who currently are out-of-territory to work remotely on a case-by-case basis. The Department of Education has been in continuous contact with the Nunavut Teachers’ Association (NTA) and the Coalition of Nunavut DEAs. They both support the decision to bring teachers back to work to ensure that students can continue to learn and are supported during school closures. Schools will only be reopened to students once the Chief Public Health Officer determines it is safe to do so. However, we need our staff back at work by April 21 to prepare for our students’ success and progress, whatever the next step may be. Department of Education Services, April 7, 2020 As of April 7, teachers currently in-territory can go back to school on a voluntary basis, in order to start developing learning packages for students. Guidelines on the delivery of those packages to students are being finalised by the Department of Education. All school staff are expected to return to work in their home communities on April 21, 2020. Teachers that are currently out of territory must undergo a 14-day isolation period in a designated isolation hub before returning to Nunavut. If teachers cannot begin their 14-day isolation period in time for their return on April 21, they must contact their principal and provide information on travel plans and correspondence with the isolation hubs to support any expected delays. On April 21, a decision will be made according to the recommendation of the Chief Public Health Officer. If school closures persist: School staff will be required to resume operations and will be asked to develop continuity of learning plans for all students. Teachers will be provided with clear guidance on how assessments, final report cards, and grade progression will be achieved. If schools re-open: School operations will resume as normal. In both cases, departmental exams for high school students have been cancelled until the end of June. Department of Education Services, April 3, 2020 On Tuesday, April 7, school staff will be able to access schools on a voluntary basis should they wish to prepare learning packages for students. The department has a working group developing guidelines for teachers identifying grade-specific areas of focus for learning packages. Packages may look different for each student. School access is for operational purposes only and not for recreation or other non-education-related activities. The department has also provided all schools with health and safety protocols related to COVID-19, including respiratory etiquette, hand washing, and physical distancing. Department of Education Services, March 31, 2020 Minister of Education update: Since March 17, Nunavut schools have been closed to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. As a result, parents and caregivers have been asking for educational resources to help their children continue to learn. Today I am announcing that the Department of Education has developed a learn-at-home website, Angirrami Ilinniarniq (angirrami.com). This website offers free access to some of the same educational resources used in our schools. These include downloadable books and e-books for pre-school ages and up; educational audiobooks and animated videos; tips and activities for learning; and resources for managing stress and mental health. There will also be links to download the department’s Inuktut language learning apps: Uqausiit Pinnguarutiit has fun activities that support Inuit language shape and sound recognition, and vocabulary development. Titirariuqsauti introduces Inuit language symbol sounds and printing paths.  Qimirrunaut is the department’s new Inuktut e-book library app. These apps are available for Android and iOS devices and can be downloaded from the Google Play or Apple App stores. Angirrami Ilinniarniq provides links to other online educational resources on subjects such as science, math, history, and social studies.  I want to also note that although the website launches today, new resources will be regularly added. The priority is to get our Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun resources online as quickly as possible. English and French resources will follow soon after. All the resources found on this site were created by the Department of Education and its partners, including the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and the Representative for Children and Youth’s Office, as well as the Departments of Family Services, Health, Environment, and Economic Development and Transportation. I want to thank all the students, parents, and caregivers for their patience. I know for many of you it has not been easy with schools and child care facilities closed. However, we must all do our part to prevent the spread of COVID-19. I assure you that my department has been working hard to get this website ready as quickly as possible. I encourage Nunavummiut to explore all the resources this website has to offer. Make learning a part of your daily routine! Qujannamiik, quana, thank you, merci. Department of Education Services, March 31, 2020 Today, the Department of Education Is launching a learn-at-home website, Angirrami Ilinniarniq (angirrami.com). This learn-at-home website developed by the Department of Education provides free access to help children and youth continue learning in their language during the school closure. Upon recommendation from the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO), schools and daycare facility closures for students and children will be extended until end of day April 20. At that point and time, the CPHO will reassess and provide direction. Department of Education Services, March 25, 2020 Ongoing services: Bus service contracts will continue to be paid during the three-week school closure. Department of Education Services, March 24, 2020 The Department of Education is supporting the Department of Family Services in coordinating the return of out of territory FANS students and their families to Nunavut. The Department of Education is providing funds to licensed child care facilities to cover parental fees from March 17-April 7, 2020. All licensed child care facilities in Nunavut that charge parental fees will qualify for the grant. Funding will be processed and sent to licensed child care facilities by Friday, March 27, 2020. During this time, parents will not be required to pay parental fees.

The Department of Education will be providing funds to all licensed child care facilities. This funding will be equal to the parental fees licenced child care facilities would be normally receiving during this three-week closure. This will allow licenced child care facilities to not charge parental fees for this period but still pay their staff as normal.

48,2020-07-02,Canada,Nunavut,,https://gov.nu.ca/health/news/presumptive-case-covid-19-nunavut,Government Website,Presumptive case of COVID-19 in Nunavut,"   02 July 2020News Release Presumptive case of COVID-19 in Nunavut IQALUIT, Nunavut (July 2, 2020) – Dr. Michael Patterson, Nunavut’s Chief Public Health Officer, has announced a presumptive case of COVID-19 at the Mary River Mine, 176 kilometres southwest of Pond Inlet. “The individual is in isolation away from co-workers and doing well. The situation is contained, and I want to assure Nunavummiut that this individual recently entered the territory for work, and there has been no contact between Mary River workers and any of the surrounding communities,” said Dr. Patterson. No Nunavut residents have worked at the Mary River Mine since March. The Department of Health is monitoring the situation closely and is ready to provide support and respond if and when necessary. Baffinland has activated its COVID-19 protocols and has initiated contact tracing. All known contacts have been placed under isolation. Since this is an isolated case, operations at the Mary River mine will continue at this time. “There is no need for Nunavummiut to worry about the spread of COVID-19 in relation to this case,” said Minister of Health George Hickes. “All necessary precautions are in place, and workers at the mine have not had any contact with any community members. We wish this individual a quick recovery. Please remember that we all have a role to play in limiting the spread of COVID-19, and now is the time to stay vigilant with our public health measures.” This current situation does not affect the current public health measures, Nunavut’s Path or the Common Travel Area between Nunavut and the Northwest Territories. Anyone who has reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 is advised to call the COVID-hotline at 1-888-975-8601 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m., or notify their community health centre right away, and immediately isolate at home for 14 days. Please do not go to the health centre in person. 	Symptoms of COVID-19 include a fever, cough or difficulty breathing. The best protection from spreading or catching the disease is physical distancing, handwashing for at least 20 seconds, coughing and sneezing into an elbow and staying home as much as possible. An update will be provided at a press conference at 2 p.m. today. ### Media Contact: Cate Macleod 	Press Secretary to Premier Savikataaq 	867-975-5059cmacleod@gov.nu.ca Scott Hitchcox 	Communications Specialist 	Department of Health 	867-975-5712shitchcox@gov.nu.ca 	 Document(s):  2020-07_nr22_hea_presumptive_covid-19_case_in_nunavut_-_eng.pdf  "

I am pleased to announce the Government of Nunavut is expanding our Nunavut Essential Workers Wage Premium. Through this program the GN funds employers in eligible sectors so they can pay their employees more for the work they do. Employees who earn less than $25 per hour may be eligible to receive an extra top-up of up to $5 per hour. When we launched on June 1, we targeted essential workers in health and social services, as well as licensed day cares. As of today, we are expanding the program to include more sectors, including essential infrastructure, transportation, food, accommodation, retail and professional services. The full list of eligible sectors, along with the application forms and other details, will be available on the Department of Finance’s website. I strongly encourage employers to apply for the Nunavut Essential Workers Wage Premium. Thank you.  Department of Finance Services  The Nunavut Essential Workers Wage Premium (NEWWP) was initially limited to employers that provide services of a health or social nature to vulnerable Nunavummiut, such as food banks, shelters, group homes, care facilities, and licensed daycares. The program is now expanded to include the essential infrastructure, transportation, food, accommodation, retail, and professional services sectors. The Nunavut Essential Workers Wage Premium (NEWWP) applies to full-time, part-time, and casual Nunavut workers earning less than $25 per hour and working in eligible sectors. Workers earning less than or equal to $20 per hour will be eligible for the full $5 wage premium. Workers earning between $20 and $25 per hour will receive a lower premium that will bring wages up to $25 per hour. Workers earning more than $25 per hour are not eligible to receive a premium. Employers (not individuals) must apply to the program and will need to provide basic information about their workforce. The GN’s Department of Finance is administering the Nunavut Essential Workers Wage Premium as a contribution. The contribution policy supporting the program is available on the department’s website: https://gov.nu.ca/finance/information/newwp. Employees of the federal and territorial governments, as well as their associated agencies, are not eligible for the premium. The Government of Canada is fully funding the program.   Department of Finance Services, May 28, 2020 Minister of Finance and Minister responsible for the WSCC update Good morning everyone. I am pleased to announce that the Government of Nunavut (GN) is launching a new program, the Nunavut Essential Workers Wage Premium. Through it, the GN will fund eligible employers to pay their lower-wage workers more for the hours they work. Employees who earn $20 or less per hour will be able to receive an extra $5 per hour. Employees who earn between $20 and $25 per hour will receive enough to bring their wages up to $25 per hour. Funding will be available for employers to support this higher pay for up to 16 weeks. To start, our government is targeting employers who provide health and social services to vulnerable Nunavummiut. These include our shelters, group homes, food banks, boarding homes, and similar organizations. We are also opening this program to licensed daycare facilities. The GN will consider expanding eligibility to employers in other sectors over time, depending on program take-up and funding availability. The GN’s Department of Finance will administer the program with funding from the Government of Canada. We will begin accepting applications from employers on Monday, June 1. Application forms and more information about this program will be available on the Department of Finance’s website starting Monday. I strongly encourage employers in the sectors I mentioned to apply for the Nunavut Essential Workers Wage Premium. As COVID-19 restrictions begin to loosen, and workplaces begin to reopen, I encourage employers to be proactive in their efforts to ensure their workplaces are safe and healthy for employees and the public and are following the public health advice for COVID-19. I invite any employer or employee to visit the WSCC website at www.wscc.nu.ca to check out their COVID-19 resources for more information on how to plan to safely reopen their business or return to work. This toolkit of practical resources, support and information for Nunavut employers and employees is based on current public health information related to COVID-19, and provides guidance on how to do risk assessments at your workplace to ensure you are complying with workplace safety standards and laws.

Ministers agreed that actions taken to address Northern Canada’s disproportionate housing needs and the need for safe shelter from domestic violence must consider the regional climate realities, remoteness, high cost of program delivery, and complexity of the different Indigenous governance structures. Ministers also agreed that once COVID-19 restrictions are lifted, they will meet face-to-face in Iqaluit, Nunavut, to continue discussions that further establish a coordinated approach and plan for long-term success that meets the housing needs of Northern residents across the three territories. Quotes:  “The federal government is committed to providing communities across Canada with support to develop local housing solutions. Today with my colleague, Dan Vandal, Minister of Northern Affairs, we listened to the concerns and unique housing challenges faced by partners in the North, and together we recognize that continued open dialogue is the key to success. Access to safe and affordable housing has the power to lift communities and build prosperity, and we are resolved to make meaningful progress in the years ahead.” -Hon. Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister Responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) “It was my pleasure to host and facilitate our discussions today. Finding long-lasting solutions to housing needs in the North can only happen through open dialogue and cooperation.

There will be some restrictions in place to ensure continued safety of our inmates and staff. Due to the ongoing public health emergency this is subject to change without notice. Department of Justice Services Update - May 6, 2020  The Government of Nunavut has various programs and services that are available to support victims and survivors of violence. We want to remind Nunavummiut that we are still here, and we can help during this very difficult time. We are aware that life is very difficult for many families and individuals and it can put added stress on a home. You should not feel isolated or alone, we are here to help. Individuals are asked to contact the on-call Family Abuse Intervention Act (FAIA) line if they have any questions or need support using the following number 1-844-534-1038. The call will be assessed to determine the support needed and directed to a Community Justice Specialist who can help with applications and resource referrals. The Victim Services Office is closed to the public at this time. However, Nunavummiut who need to contact the office can do so by calling the Toll-Free line at 1-866-456-5216 or emailing victimservices@gov.nu.ca. Services will be provided on a case-by-case basis.  Department of Justice Services Update - May 1, 2020   Community Justice Our service delivery with clients remains consistent with the previously amended service delivery process. In-person meetings are restricted to emergency situations where the client has no access to a phone or safe location to contact our service providers over the phone. Individuals are asked to contact the on-call Family Abuse Intervention Act (FAIA) line if they have any questions or need support using the following number 1-844-534-1038. The call will be assessed to determine the support needed and directed to a Community Justice Specialist who can help with applications and resource referrals. Community Corrections All local community corrections offices continue to be closed to the public until further notice. All community corrections clients are to report by phone to their Regional Managers. The list of contacts can be found at: https://www.gov.nu.ca/justice Department of Justice Services Update - April 24, 2020 The Department of Justice worked with the Chief Public Health Officer (CPHO) to prepare a new Order Respecting Social Distancing and Mass Gatherings to ensure the language is clear and understandable while remaining true to the order. This new order will come into effect on Friday, April 24, 2020 at 11:59 p.m.   In addition, it is the Department of Justice’s hope the questions and answers below will provide additional clarity and will help Nunavummiut better understand the purpose of this order. When can an enforcement officer enter into my home or public facility? In the Orders being issues by the CPHO, there is a clear distinction between a building where you live, a “dwelling”, and a public facility, such as a grocery store. Under these Orders, the CPHO has provided enforcement Officers with the authority to enter into public facilities without a warrant for enforcement purposes. When it comes to your home, however, the government firmly recognizes your rights and the obligation of enforcement officers to take all reasonable measures to respect those rights. If an enforcement officer believes there is reason to enter into your home, they will need to get your permission, or get a warrant from the Court. Who can enforce these Orders?  In addition to RCMP officers, and to ensure we have the capacity to enforce the emergency orders, the CPHO has authorized all peace officers who are appointed under territorial law, the ability to enforce the orders. This includes municipal enforcement officers, the sheriffs from the Nunavut Court of Justice, the environmental inspectors, and the wildlife officers. Normally these officers can only enforce their own legislation. However, the emergency order grants them additional powers. To ensure those charged with protecting the health of Nunavummiut are prepared to take on this task, they will be provided with clear guidelines on their responsibility. The CPHO authorized these peace officers for a number of reasons: The RCMP may experience staff shortages during the pandemic and may need not be able to address this added responsibility; The authorized peace officers are already familiar with and have had training in enforcement procedures under territorial legislation; The orders affect entry into territorial parks and other on-the-land activities, where wildlife officers are often the first point of contact; and Municipal enforcement officers are experienced with issuing tickets under municipal by-laws and are recognized as an enforcement body within Nunavut communities. The CPHO is working with officials from the RCMP, the Government of Nunavut and municipalities to ensure consistent messaging and enforcement across the territory. What do I do if I am concerned the Orders are not being followed?  Your local RCMP detachment can help and should be used as your first point of contact. If you are concerned, please contact your local RCMP detachment. As we move forward, we will continue to monitor, review and amend these orders as necessary. Our measures will be balanced against the need to fight Covid-19. When we are no longer living under threat of this virus, we will no longer be in need of such measures.   Department of Justice Services Update - April 1, 2020 Adjusted services: Victims Services The Victim Services Office is closed to the public at this time. However, Nunavummiut who need to contact the office can do so by using the following contact information: Victim Services Toll Free 1-866-456-5216; victimservices@gov.nu.ca. Services will be provided on a case by case basis. Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee As of today, April 1, 2020, the Office of the Public Guardian will be joining the Office of the Public Trustee within the Department of Justice. This new office will be the Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee. All contact information remains the same. 	Once the Office reopens after the public health emergency, it will be located on the first floor of the Brown Building in Iqaluit. Legal Registries has moved to the 4th floor of 1106 Inuksugait building in Iqaluit. 	Due to the office relocation, clients may experience slight delays in phone and email responses. We apologize for this inconvenience. Department of Justice Services Update - March 31, 2020 The Corrections division has been working diligently at all levels to ensure we have plans in place to support our staff, our inmates and the community throughout this public health emergency. There is currently a great deal of information in the media from other jurisdictions about what is happening within correctional facilities in other jurisdictions. To ensure Nunavummiut are up to date and aware of the current steps being taken in Nunavut, we are providing the following update. Ultimately, our goal is to ensure the virus does not enter the correctional facilities. Measures already in place include suspending all outside visitation and non-essential traffic. We appreciate the patience and support we have received from inmates and their families in taking this step as we are aware this is not easy. Given the heightened security risks associated with corrections, we cannot provide specific details regarding our individual institutional plans. However, we can provide the following information regarding steps begin taken: All intakes are being isolated for a period of 14 days upon intake. Institutions have added additional hand sanitizing stations in high traffic areas. Response/containment kits are being outfitted with gloves, masks, face shields, gowns and instructions for use. Nurses are diligently screening inmates upon intake for symptoms of COVID-19. Facilities are increasing food and supply orders to ensure facilities are well stocked in the event of an outbreak. Increased cleaning protocols to ensure communal surfaces are cleaned on an increased schedule throughout the day. In addition to these health and safety steps being taken, the department has reviewed all inmates eligible for early release to reduce the inmate population as much as possible. We will continue to take action that will support the health and safety of our inmates, staff and all Nunavummiut.

Department of Human Resources services update - June 1, 2020 Minister of Human Resources update: Ullaakkut. Under the guidance of Dr. Patterson, the Government of Nunavut has begun re-assessing the measures that were put in place in response to COVID-19. “Nunavut’s Path: moving forward during COVID-19” which was released last week and lays out the government’s approach to easing restrictions, based on reducing risks related to the virus while minimizing the impacts on Nunavummiut. Based on the current evidence on risk and impacts of measures, re-opening workplaces is considered a low-risk measure. Today, I am announcing the end of the Government of Nunavut’s work from home program for Government of Nunavut employees. Starting Monday, June 8, 2020, GN employees who are currently “working from home” will be returning to their regular workplaces. This decision was made in consultation with the Public Health Team and the Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission (WSCC). We recognize that a healthy workplace is essential to the health and well-being of all our employees, enabling them to bring their essential talents, skills and energy as they deliver services to all Nunavummiut. In support of a safe and healthy workplace, the GN is following WSCC guidelines on risk assessment and worksite precautions and will continue to follow all orders and restrictions set in place by the Chief Public Health Officer in response to COVID-19. GN employees will also continue to receive health and safety information and guidelines on an ongoing basis. The GN’s Employee and Family Assistance Program is also available to support the overall well-being of GN employees and their families. Representatives from each department are working this week to ensure that workplaces are prepared for the return of GN employees and that social distancing continues to be maintained. Some flexibility may be required as employees transition from homes back to offices. We realize that with school closures and the uncertainty of summer day camps programs at this time that parents will need time to work out childcare options and therefore we encourage them to contact their immediate supervisors to discuss their options. At this time, there will also be limited public access to GN offices in order to support social distancing and for the health and safety of all Nunavummiut. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all GN employees for your hard work and continuing commitment during these times. Your well-being is our top priority. I would also like to thank Nunavummiut for your ongoing patience and understanding as we continue to provide necessary programs and services. Thank you.  Department of Human Resources Services  All GN employees will return to GN workplaces beginning June 8, 2020. This decision was made by the GN in consultation with the Chief Public Health Officer and the Workers’ Safety and Compensation Commission (WSCC). The GN is following WSCC guidelines on risk assessment and worksite precautions to ensure safe workplaces and will continue to follow all orders and restrictions set in place by the Chief Public Health Officer in response to COVID-19. Social distancing will continue to be maintained in GN offices, and GN employees will continue to receive health and safety information and reminders on an ongoing basis. The GN’s Employee and Family Assistance Program is also available to support the overall well-being of GN employees and their families. At this time, there will be limited public access to GN offices in order to support social distancing and for the health and safety of all Nunavummiut. Members of the public can contact GN employees as needed by phone and email.

Department of Human Resources services update - April 30, 2020  Under the Government of Nunavut's (GN) work-from-home model implemented on March 20, GN employees in Pond Inlet continue to be supported to work from home whenever possible. The GN Employee and Family Assistance Program (EFAP) by Homewood Health offers a wide range of confidential services to employees and their families.

Department of Family Services Update - March 30, 2020 Out-of-territory students wishing to return to their home communities in Nunavut have started their 14-day isolation period in Ottawa (31 students) and Winnipeg (15 students). Ongoing services: Student funding: all student funding will be extended to the end of April. Adjusted services: Charter to Kitikmeot communities left Iqaluit on Saturday for all in-territory students. The charter landed in every community intended. Any students who have not previously identified the need to return home and require to, will now have to go through regularly scheduled flights with all existing restrictions or processes, e.g. 14 days isolation through Yellowknife if there is no immediately connecting flight. Department of Family Services Update - March 24, 2020 Nunavut students who want to return to Nunavut during the travel ban must undergo a 14-day isolation period at one of two locations in southern Canada. Please contact fans@gov.nu.ca for direction. Department of Family Services Update - March 23, 2020 Deputy Minister of Family Services update regarding student travel back to Nunavut, March 23, 2020 Family Services, Health, Education, and Community & Government Services have been working together to ensure the safe return of students from southern-based educational institutions to their home communities across Nunavut. Those students who wish to return home now, will require immediate isolation in central points for a 14-day period prior to an arranged charter plane to return to Nunavut. The two host facilities for students will be located in Ottawa and Winnipeg. Kivalliq and Kitikmeot Region students will muster in Winnipeg to commence a 14-day period once the last student arrives in to the facility. Baffin/Qikiqtani Region students will muster in an Ottawa facility, and likewise – once the last student arrives into the facility a 14-day period will commence. A charter from each of those cities will then return the students to Nunavut. During the period of quarantine in Ottawa and Winnipeg, the students will have access to tools to complete their studies, will have access to health professionals who will check in to ensure their health needs are met. (There will also be an oversight group tasked with monitoring and addressing issues coming out of this operation) Message to Students: If you wish to get home as soon as possible, please be packed and ready to get to one of the two mustering points. There will be maximum baggage amounts for both the commercial airlines and for the final chartered flight. For those with special needs or requirements, they should be identified with the travel team member that contacts you. And for those that are remaining to complete their terms in place, but wish to return home afterward, FANS will cover until the first available arrangements can be made home. It is my understanding that for the other populations returning to Nunavut, there are avenues to take. For the travel coverage, usual FANS process would continue. Emails will be sent out to students today asking them to provide FANS the necessary level of details and giving them the information, they need.

Simple how-to instructions are being developed so people can sew their own masks at home. Non-medical masks provide additional protection. They do not replace social distancing and other protective measures.  WHAT IS AN APPROPRIATE NON-MEDICAL MASK OR FACE COVERING? Non-medical face masks or face coverings should: be made of at least two layers of tightly woven material fabric (such as cotton or linen) be large enough to completely and comfortably cover the nose and mouth without gaping fit securely to the head with ties or ear loops allow for easy breathing be comfortable and not require frequent adjustment be changed as soon as possible if damp or dirty maintain their shape after washing and drying Some masks also include a pocket to accommodate a paper towel or disposable coffee filter, for increased benefit. If possible, use different fabrics for each side of the mask, so you know which side faces your mouth and which side is out. Non-medical masks or face coverings: should not be placed on children under the age of two years should not be placed on anyone unable to remove them without assistance or anyone who has trouble breathing should not be made of plastic or other non-breathable materials should not be made exclusively of materials that easily fall apart, such as tissues should not be secured with tape or other inappropriate materials should not be shared with others should not impair vision or interfere with tasks   HOW TO PUT ON A NON-MEDICAL MASK OR FACE COVERING Ensure the face covering is clean and dry. Wash your hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds before touching the mask. If none is available, use hand sanitizer with a minimum 60% alcohol base. Ensure your hair is away from your face. Place the face covering over your nose and mouth and secure to your head or ears with its ties or elastics. Adjust if needed to ensure nose and mouth are fully covered. The mask should fit snugly to the cheeks and there should not be any gaps. Repeat Step 2.   While wearing a non-medical mask or face covering, it is important to avoid touching your face. If you do touch your mask or face, you should immediately wash your hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds. You can also use hand sanitizer with a minimum 60% alcohol base.   HOW TO REMOVE A NON-MEDICAL MASK OR FACE COVERING Wash your hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds. 		If none is available, use hand sanitizer with a minimum 60% alcohol base.  Remove the face covering by un-tying it or removing the loops from your ears. 		Avoid touching the front of the mask when removing it. It can be placed in a plastic bag temporarily if you are not at home. 				Make sure you close, or zip seal the bag while storing it.   If you plan to reuse the mask, wash it before wearing it again. 		It can be washed with hot, soapy water, or it can be washed with your other laundry. If throwing it out, place it into a garbage bin or plastic bag.

Those who attended the conference have been requested to exercise self-monitoring, a recommendation for individuals who are at low risk of exposure, are well and not exhibiting symptoms. These individuals can go about most activities of daily life, but should avoid large gatherings, or going into public settings that they cannot leave. For these people, the following activities would be acceptable: Working at a desk with more than 1m separation (or behind a closed door). Getting groceries and other errands. To be avoided: Face-to-face meetings. Air travel. Dinner out at a restaurant or friends’ homes. Other festivities (e.g weddings). In the case that a person does develop symptoms while self-monitoring, they should contact their health centre and be tested. At that time, they will be swabbed and asked to begin self-isolation until the swab results come back. The best defence against viruses such as COVID-19 continues to be maintaining proper hygiene and illness etiquette. Stay home if you are sick. Encourage those you know are sick to stay home. Change how you greet people to avoid physical contact such as handshakes, hugging or kissing. Wash your hands regularly. Cough and sneeze into your sleeve. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as toys, phones, toilets, electronics, bedside tables, television remotes and door handles. ### Media Contact Chris Puglia 	Communications Specialist 	Department of Health 	867-975-5762cpuglia@gov.nu.caDocument(s):  2020-03_psa_hea_pdac_covid-19_-_eng.pdf  "

This year’s theme is “more than food”, reminding us that eating healthy is about more than just the foods we eat. It is also about where, when, why and how we eat. Food sharing is an important part of eating healthy and Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit: it helps strengthen relationships, creates chances for elders to share knowledge about traditional ways of eating, strengthens feelings of belonging, and gives everyone in the family a chance to be involved. There are many ways Nunavummiut can support healthy eating: Harvesting and preparing food together is a great way to spend time with family and to teach food skills. Introducing a variety of country food to children at a young age. Eating together with family or friends, which is good for mental health. Breastfeeding, which is an important part of building a secure, loving relationship between parents and their baby. From birth to six months of age, babies only need breast milk and vitamin D supplements. When buying food at the store, use food labels to compare items and try to limit foods that are high in sodium, sugars, and saturated fat.

All plans are in place until 2023. “These IEPs will help the GN meet our obligations under Article 23 of the Nunavut Agreement and facilitate the creation of a skilled, truly representative public service workforce, in a welcoming and respectful workplace,” said Minister of Human Resources Lorne Kusugak. The territorial public service more than doubled in size over the past 20 years. The number of Inuit employed in the public service has also more than doubled during this period of growth from 918 in March 2000 to 1843 in December 2019. IEPs were developed using data from the Nunavut Inuit Labour Force Analysis and an analysis of the GN’s workforce. IEPs outline opportunities and challenges in Inuit employment and include goals and action plans to 2023. Training, education and career development initiatives to help Inuit employees and casual workers develop their skills and follow a desired career path in the public service are also included. The GN has maintained multi-year, government-wide IEPs since Nunavut was created in 1999. These detailed, multi-year IEPs build on that work, to create more comprehensive, specific plans. Annual goals and priorities for action continue to be included in the annual IEPs in the GN’s business plans. This is the first time departments and territorial corporations have also prepared multi-year IEPs. IEPs are available online at http://bit.ly/IEPs-ENG. Departmental IEPs are also available on GN department’s web pages and on territorial corporation’s websites. 	## Media Contacts: Master Inuit Employment Plan 	Janis Qaunirq 	Communications Specialist 	867-975-6239hrcommunications@gov.nu.ca GN Departments’ and Territorial Corporations’ Inuit Employment Plans 	Communications contact lists for Departments and Corporations: http://bit.ly/GNComms-ENG   Backgrounder Inuit Employment Plans to 2023 The GN drafted a new multi-year Master Inuit Employment Plan in 2017-2018 after new federal funding for Inuit employment initiatives became available until 2023. These IEPs were updated and finalized in 2019. Status of Inuit Employment in the GN  Public Service Employees Need Knowledge and Skills  GN job descriptions and advertisements are reviewed to ensure that education, experience and other qualifications are not inflated to become a barrier to Inuit applicants. 	Almost half of GN positions involving university-level education are in regulated professions, including teachers, nurses, lawyers and accountants. Each of the regulated professions requires a degree in a specific field of study. Graduates must be licensed by an external authority to work in the profession. Inuit representation is well above the GN average of 50 per cent in positions involving college or trades training, high school completion, or no formal education. Since 2013, Inuit representation has been less than 33 per cent in positions involving education at the university level. Nunavut’s Labour Market Creates Challenges in Inuit Employment Nunavut’s labour market does not yet support a fully representative public service in all occupational groups and at all levels. The Government of Canada’s 2018 Nunavut Inuit Labour Force Analysis shows the supply of qualified, available and interested Inuit does not yet match the need of government and other employers in the territory: Nunavut has a young and rapidly growing population. Inuit participation in Nunavut’s labour market remains relatively low. There is a limited supply of educated Inuit to meet government needs. Nunavummiut have increasing choice in employers and types of employment. The IEPs create new opportunities in Inuit Employment Through their IEPs, departments, territorial corporations and agencies are implementing actions in six areas of focus:Document(s):  2020-03_nr06_hr_gn_releases_inuit_employment_plans_to_2023_-_eng.pdf 2020-03_backgrounder_hr_gn_releases_ieps_to_2023_-_eng.pdf  "

Finance Minister George Hickes released the GN’s proposed budget for 2020-21 on February 19, 2020. “Receiving an AA rating reflects our government’s strong fiscal footing and economic growth potential,” said Minister Hickes. “Investments in the mining industry and strong population growth translate into a positive economic outlook for our territory.” DBRS also points to the GN’s challenges – a small economy that is heavily influenced by a large public sector, a geographically remote and dispersed population, and socio-economic challenges including the territory’s high cost of living and housing shortages. An issuer credit rating is an independent opinion about an organization’s ability and willingness to meet its financial obligations. This is the second rating DBRS has issued for the GN.

From front-line and emergency care, to public health and policy, they demonstrate a level of care, compassion and commitment that is unparalleled, and I sincerely thank them for their dedication,” said Minister of Health George Hickes. At the Qikiqtani General Hospital and 24 community health centres, more than 300 nurses and 10 midwives work tirelessly to ensure Nunavummiut receive the best possible care. In 2020, the Department of Health will showcase the contributions, diversity and history of nursing and midwifery in Nunavut, and honour people like Qapik Attagutsiak of Arctic Bay, a traditional Inuit midwife and Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal recipient. Attagutsiak delivered hundreds of babies in Nunavut and assisted in the creation of the Akausivik Inuit Family Health Team and Medical Centre in Ottawa. By telling these stories and highlighting the valuable role nurses and midwives play in our communities, the GN hopes to encourage more Nunavummiut to pursue a career in nursing or midwifery. ### Media Contact: 	Chris Puglia 	Communications Specialist 	Department of Health 	867-975-5762cpuglia@gov.nu.caDocument(s):  2020-02_nr_04_hea_year_of_the_nurse_-_eng.pdf  "

This meeting was a continuation of discussions held in April 2019 in Kugluktuk, Nunavut. Also attending from the NWT were representatives from the Tłı̨chǫ Government, Yellowknives Dene First Nation, Łutsel K'e Dene First Nation and North Slave Métis Alliance. They were joined by Nunavut co-management partners from Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated, the Kitikmeot Regional Wildlife Organization and the Kugluktuk Hunters and Trappers Organization.  Leaders talked about how to enhance communication and coordination between wildlife co-management partners as they continue to work together to help support the conservation and recovery of shared transboundary caribou herds, in particular the Bathurst and Bluenose-East herds. Discussions included: A review of current Nunavut and NWT co-management board proposals and recommendations on caribou management An update on Bathurst caribou co-management actions, including the Bathurst Caribou Advisory Committee and Bathurst Caribou Range Plan Harvest management in the NWT and Nunavut Wolf management incentive programs and the recent joint proposal for wolf management on the winter range of Bathurst and Bluenose-East caribou The operational-level Memorandum of Understanding on barren-ground caribou between the Government of the Northwest Territories (GNWT) and Government of Nunavut (GN) Both Environment Ministers recognize that protecting barren-ground caribou is a shared responsibility that requires the commitment and action of multiple partners, across multiple jurisdictions. Regular communication and meetings like this are necessary to support the recovery and long-term sustainability of our caribou herds.   Quotes “Our barren-ground caribou herds are struggling, and it is up to all of us to do our part to protect them. By coming together as wildlife management partners, we are building on our shared expertise to strengthen the ways we work together to ensure caribou remain an important source of food, culture and livelihood for our future generations.” Shane Thompson, NWT Minister of Environment and Natural Resources “Caribou have incredible cultural and hunting significance in both Nunavut and the Northwest Territories – for many Inuit, caribou allowed us to survive. Both our territories have strong, collaborative wildlife management systems based with Inuit and our co-management partners. We will continue to work together to conserve and oversee our shared caribou herds in the spirit of Avatittinnik Kamatsiarniq.” Joe Savikataaq, Nunavut Premier and Minister of Environment   Quick facts The Bathurst herd was estimated at 8,200 caribou in 2018, a 98 per cent decline since 1986. The Bluenose-East herd has also undergone a significant decline, decreasing 50 per cent in just three years. Many factors may be contributing to caribou population declines, including weather and climate change, nutrition, disease, harvest, predators and development.  Many of these factors are beyond our control as governments or as individuals. Management actions are focused on factors we can control, including human influences (harvest, development and fire management) and predators. The GNWT-GN Memorandum of Understanding on barren-ground caribou supports a coordinated and collaborative approach to monitoring, management and recovery of our shared caribou herds. Several management plans and actions have been developed in collaboration with management partners to support recovery of barren-ground caribou, including: 		Bathurst Caribou Range Plan Taking Care of Caribou management plan for Cape Bathurst, Bluenose-West and Bluenose-East barren-ground caribou herds Mobile conservation zone to prevent harvest of Bathurst caribou Increased incentives for wolf harvesters Proposal for further actions to support wolf monitoring and management  The next population survey for Bathurst and Bluenose-East caribou is planned for June 2020. ### Media Contacts: Josh Long 	Manager, Communications, Education and Outreach 	Department of Environment 	Government of NunavutJLong1@gov.nu.ca Joslyn Oosenbrug 	Manager, Public Affairs and Communication 	Environment and Natural Resources 	Government of the Northwest TerritoriesENR_Communications@gov.nt.caDocument(s):  2020-02_nr_gn_nwt_barren-ground_caribou_meeting_-_eng.pdf  "

This is not uncommon at this time of year. The illness can be spread easily from person to person and may move throughout the community quickly. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, fever and diarrhea. Some of the best ways to prevent this illness are to: wash your hands often, especially before preparing meals or after changing a baby’s diaper. rest and drink plenty of fluids (do not drink pop, energy drinks, or other sugary fluids). clean surfaces such as countertops, doorknobs and bathrooms often with hot soapy water. try to avoid unnecessary contract with people who are sick. Help young children wash their hands, and make sure you clean their toys when you are cleaning other surfaces. Anyone with symptoms should stay home, rest, and drinks plenty of fluids. Anyone with vomiting and diarrhea should not make meals for the family to decrease the risk of spreading the virus to family members. Dirty laundry should be washed in hot water and dried at a high temperature setting. Remember, kissing and touching babies can spread germs. Keep them healthy by staying away when you are sick. People with symptoms can be cared for at home unless the symptoms become severe and involve weakness and dehydration.

Vaping is linked to a serious lung disease that has killed over 50 people in the United States, and over 2,500 cases of this disease have been reported. There are 15 confirmed cases in Canada. Symptoms can include coughing, shortness of breath, chest pain, vomiting, stomach pain, and fever. Although there have been no confirmed cases of this disease in Nunavut, the Department of Health would like to strongly urge Nunavummiut not to vape. Vaping is especially harmful for pregnant women, children, and youth. Please talk to your health care provider if you vape or have vaped in the past, especially if you develop these symptoms.

The high concentration of nicotine and the small particles you breathe in while vaping are linked to addiction, heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, and lung damage. Vaping is not a safe way to quit smoking. Nicotine patches and gums, and quit medications like Champix are safe, and can double your chances of quitting.

A large component of reducing the harm caused by tobacco is by minimizing the impact of second-hand smoke. Second-hand smoke is exhaled by the tobacco user and comes from the burning end of a cigarette. Poisons from tobacco stick to walls, furniture, carpets and clothing for long periods of time. Smoke and chemical residue are particularly harmful for children, pregnant women, Elders and those with chronic heart and lung conditions. Protect your children and other community members by making homes, vehicles and amautiit smoke free. Make sure you are nine metres from the entrance to any public building or workplace before lighting up. The grounds of hospitals, health centres, day cares, schools and sporting venues are now smoke free. It’s not just the right thing to do. It’s the law. As part of Tobacco Reduction Month, National Non-Smoking Week (NNSW) takes place from January 19 to 25, 2020. NNSW has been celebrated annually in Canada since 1977 to encourage quitting tobacco use. Quitting smoking is the best thing that you can do to improve your health. Counselling support and quit medications double the chances of successfully quitting tobacco. Speak with a local health care provider or call the Nunavut QuitLine anytime at 1-866-368-7848. Medications that help with cravings and withdrawal, like the nicotine patch, gum and inhaler, are available at no cost at your local health centre or pharmacy. Check out the Tobacco Has No Place Here Facebook page this month for Tobacco Reduction events and activities led by your local Community Health Representatives.

Consumers in all Nunavut communities will see the retail prices for all diesel products and gasoline fall by 4 cents per litre, before tax. In Iqaluit, the cost to retailers will be reduced by an additional 5 cents per litre, before tax, on automotive diesel fuel and[LC1]  gasoline, for a potential total cost reduction of 9 cents per litre. The additional price reductions in Iqaluit are intended to reduce the gap between what consumers pay in Iqaluit compared to other communities, where prices are lower. “The GN is committed to providing Nunavummiut with high quality fuel products that are suited for our Arctic environment, at the best possible price,” said Minister of Community and Government Services Lorne Kusugak. “Thanks to the diligence of our Petroleum Products Division (PPD) in implementing their early purchase policies, we are able to provide these cost reductions to Nunavummiut.” The reductions in fuel prices reflect an overall decline in crude market prices in 2019. PPD was able to capitalize on advantageous crude prices in international markets and secure its 2019 diesel and gasoline requirements at costs 11 to 15 per cent lower than in 2018.

It also outlines requirements in food and water safety, sanitation, and reporting and responding to communicable diseases to strengthen health protection. The Act establishes the requirements, duties, and powers of the Minister, the Chief Public Health Officer (formerly the Chief Medical Officer of Health) and other officers tasked with protecting the health of Nunavummiut. ### Media Contact: Alison Griffin 	Manager of Communications 	Department of Health 	867-975-5949agriffin@gov.nu.caDocument(s):  2020-01_nr_hea_public_health_act_becomes_law_-_eng.pdf  "
