Don Bureaux, president, NSCC

","
Construction on Nova Scotia Community College’s (NSCC) new, contemporary home in downtown Sydney will begin this month.
NSCC issued a tender on June 26 to start the construction phase of the project. This tender is expected to be awarded within two weeks. Other construction tenders will be issued over the next 18 months.
“The new campus will create a dynamic learning environment with state-of-the-art technology that will attract students from across the province,” said Derek Mombourquette, Minister of Energy and Mines on behalf of Labi Kousoulis, Minister of Labour and Advanced Education. “This project will contribute to our skilled workforce and have long-term economic benefits for the region.” 
Working with Cape Breton Regional Municipality (CBRM), the playground adjacent to the boardwalk near the fire station will be removed and a section of the boardwalk south of Falmouth Street will be closed to the public starting at the end of July for the duration of the project. A pedestrian walkway will be maintained on Falmouth Street with appropriate signs to redirect pedestrians to the sidewalk on Esplanade. 
Nova Scotia’s post-secondary sector plays an important role in the province’s economic growth. The relocation of NSCC’s Marconi campus to the Sydney waterfront will help revitalize the downtown and create a destination campus in Cape Breton’s busiest centre.

Quotes:
In less than a year since the location was announced, the groundwork for our new Sydney campus has moved forward quickly. I’m so pleased to now see this tremendous investment from the province which will fuel the construction phase for our new campus – an invaluable investment in the college’s work and mission and in the community itself.
Don Bureaux, president, NSCC

It is exciting and rewarding to see construction begin. In the midst of a global pandemic, it is important to have good jobs for our citizens and the resulting spinoffs for local businesses are vital for the CBRM’s economy. I applaud the Province’s commitment to NSCC and the next generation of learners.
Mayor Cecil Clarke, Cape Breton Regional Municipality

","
The Nova Scotia Securities Commission is alerting Nova Scotians that they are seeing an increase in Forex-related scams targeting investors.
Forex investing includes speculating on the change in value of one currency against another and is legal and regulated in the province if done through licensed dealers in Nova Scotia.
However, its complexity and volatility can be used by fraudsters to mislead unsuspecting investors into believing a scheme is a legitimate and lucrative investment.
Some of the warning signs that a Forex investment may be fraudulent include: 

a guarantee of little or no risk, and high investment returns
dealers or brokers who are not registered with a provincial or territorial securities commission, and based outside of Canada where it can be difficult or impossible to retrieve funds 
an unwillingness to discuss the past performance or track record of the specialist traders who will handle their money
an unwillingness to identify specialist traders or traders located in offshore jurisdictions who will handle their money; and/ or 
high-pressure sales techniques to buy a Forex investment, to purchase software or take courses related to Forex trading


Quotes:
The commission and other provincial and territorial securities regulators in Canada have seen a rapid increase in Forex-related scams online in the past few months. The Commission issued our latest alert about a Forex-related scam just last week. The scams are being offered on social media, online forums and sites like Reddit and Kijiji, targeting investors with promises of high returns. If you do invest in Forex, you need to know that it is a complex, volatile and extremely risky investment. Do not invest more than you can afford to lose.

The cause of the incident has yet to be determined. The Department of Labour and Advanced Education has been notified.

","
Travellers entering Nova Scotia from outside the Atlantic Canadian bubble must fill out a tracking and self-declaration form, available at: https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/alerts-notices/Self-declaration-Form-Tracking-Travellers-to-Nova-Scotia.pdf
Non-bubble visitors must provide an address where they will be staying and self-isolating for 14 days and a phone number where they can be reached 24/7. Provincial staff will contact those visitors every day to make sure they are observing the 14-day self-isolation requirement.
“We’ve sacrificed too much in Nova Scotia to allow people who won’t follow the rules to put everyone else at risk,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “We’re working hard to reopen our economy safely, to let people explore our province this summer, and to reunite them with their loved ones. Most people are being safe and following the rules and we expect everyone who enters Nova Scotia to do the same.”
If visitors who are supposed to be self-isolating do not answer their phone after three attempts in one day, police will be called and in-person checks will be conducted. The fine for violating the Health Protection Order is $1,000 for a first offence.

HEALTH/WELLNESS—New Pilot Program Supports People to be Certified as Continuing Care Assistants

Government wants to encourage more people to become certified to work in the continuing care field in Nova Scotia. 
That is why a new pilot program will provide funding for people to have their skills and experience assessed and to complete the Recognizing Prior Learning process to become certified to work as continuing care assistants. 
This process will help those who may be currently working as long-term care assistants, or care workers who have come to Nova Scotia who want their credentials and experience recognized. 
“Continuing care assistants look after our loved ones in long-term care as well as at home,” said Health and Wellness Minister Randy Delorey. “By helping more people have their skills and experience recognized and become certified continuing care assistants, we are supporting the workforce to provide more care for those who need it.”
The Recognizing Prior Learning process has two phases. The first is an assessment, where the participant shows what they know. The second phase is education, where the participant completes any outstanding training, education modules, or skills demonstration, and writes the certification exam. 
The pilot program will support up to 200 participants by waiving the assessment phase fees ($800), and/or reducing the education phase fees by $800. 
To qualify, participants must:

be accepted as a participant in the Phase One or Two of the Recognizing Prior Learning program between March 1, 2020 and March 1, 2021
provide a letter from a Nova Scotia continuing care employer indicating the participant is currently employed or has been offered employment
sign a letter of intent to work in Nova Scotia for one year after certification

The pilot program will also provide for 10 new assessors and more support for employers to screen participants. 
Funding for this initiative comes from the Canada-Nova Scotia Home and Community Care and Mental Health and Addiction Services Funding Agreement.
To apply, visit http://www.novascotiacca.ca/.

Quotes:
The Recognizing Prior Learning process acknowledges the knowledge, skills and attitudes gained through on-the-job training, formal education, and life experiences. It allows people to demonstrate their abilities and become certified continuing care assistants more quickly.
Pam Shipley, Continuing Care Assistant Program Manager



Quick Facts:

the pilot program will run until March 1, 2021 and will be managed by the Health Association of Nova Scotia
costs for the education phase vary, depending on the additional training needed, and typically range between $800 and $1,800
293 people have been certified through the Recognizing Prior Learning process in the last five years
this is one of several initiatives underway to recruit and retain more continuing care assistants. Others include launching a bursary program in 2019 and making it easier for retired and internationally-trained nurses to work in the field

Campers from all four Atlantic provinces can reserve and enjoy their spots at any of Nova Scotia’s 20 provincial campgrounds starting today, July 3.
With further easing of public health restrictions, the province will also open more than 300 additional campsites at provincial parks for bookings on Monday, July 6. Reservations will open at set times throughout the day. A schedule of which campgrounds open their reservations and at what time is posted on the Nova Scotia Provincial Parks website.
“Opening the Atlantic bubble allows more people to travel and vacation in Nova Scotia,” said Lands and Forestry Minister Iain Rankin. “Camping season is the perfect time to get outside and spend time in nature. We can increase capacity at our campgrounds and still ensure a safe distance between campsites is maintained so everyone can enjoy camping in our province.”
Only registered campers can enter provincial campgrounds. Campers must have a confirmed reservation before arriving.
Other safety measures in place include frequent cleaning of common areas, signs to promote physical distancing and other healthy practices and changes to the on-site check-in process to minimize physical contact with park employees. A full list of visitor restrictions is found on the Nova Scotia Provincial Parks website.

Quick Facts:

interprovincial travel within the Atlantic provinces, without the requirement to self-isolate for Atlantic Canadian residents, is permitted beginning today 
comfort stations will increase daily operating hours and playgrounds are starting to open
group camping sites, yurts and cabins will be closed this season
private campgrounds can operate at 100 per cent capacity and must continue to follow their sector plan

As of today, July 2, Nova Scotia has 1,064 confirmed cases of COVID-19. One new case was identified Wednesday, July 1.
The new case is an individual who is in Nova Scotia as a temporary foreign worker. They have been self-isolating since arriving in the province, as required. The likely source of infection for this case, as well as the two previously announced this week, is from travel outside of Canada.
“These new cases highlight the importance of our public health directives, particularly the 14-day self-isolation period upon arrival in Nova Scotia,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “These directives are in place to protect us and I ask all Nova Scotians to continue to take care and respect the rules.”
The QEII Health Sciences Centre's microbiology lab completed 284 Nova Scotia tests on July 1 and is operating 24-hours.
There are no licensed long-term care homes in Nova Scotia with active cases of COVID-19. 
To date, Nova Scotia has 53,994 negative test results, 1,064 positive COVID-19 cases, 63 deaths and three active COVID-19 cases. Cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. Nine-hundred and ninety-eight cases are now resolved. Two people are currently in hospital. Both patients’ COVID-19 infections are considered resolved but they are being treated in hospital.

Bubble up, Atlantic Canada – and bring your identification with you.
Starting Friday, July 3, if people live in another Atlantic Canadian province and want to visit Nova Scotia, they will need to show proof of residency to enter the province.
Every adult will need to show either a drivers’ licence, government identification card, health card, or a utility bill or bank statement with a valid Atlantic Canadian address to provincial officials at airports, ferries or the land border when they arrive in the province. No self-declaration form will be required.
If people can prove with these documents that their permanent home is in Atlantic Canada, they will not have to self-isolate for 14 days when coming into Nova Scotia.
“Businesses and communities are looking forward to welcoming Atlantic Canadian visitors,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “We’ve worked hard to get to the point where we can welcome our neighbours safely and it’s important for everyone to respect the public health guidelines.”
It is important to remember that Nova Scotia’s borders are restricted, not closed. People from outside Atlantic Canada are welcome in the province. They must self-isolate for 14 days when they arrive. If they have already self-isolated in another Atlantic Canadian province, they may enter Nova Scotia without self-isolating again.
“I know many people are still nervous about this virus. Our visitors may be, too,” said Dr. Robert Strang, chief medical officer of health. “We can make their visits a safe experience for everyone by being patient and kind, by practising good hand hygiene, distancing and by wearing a mask when you can’t stay six feet apart.”
Nova Scotians who are planning to visit another Atlantic province should check before they leave to ensure they have the information documentation required in that province.

","
The province continues to move forward with the largest health-care infrastructure project in Nova Scotia's history. 
A tender to design and build a parkade across from the Halifax Infirmary on Summer Street was awarded to Lindsay Construction Limited, today, July 2, as part of the QEII New Generation project’s parking strategy. The parkade, with about 500 spaces, will be located north of the Museum of Natural History on provincially owned land. 
The existing parkade on Robie Street will be taken down to allow for the construction of an expanded inpatient centre and operating rooms. The replacement parkade is necessary before construction starts on the hospital site to provide parking for patients, visitors and staff as spaces will be lost during construction when the existing parkade comes down. 
A second larger parkade of about 1,000 spaces will be built at the former CBC Building site, part of the Halifax Infirmary’s design-build-finance and maintain project.

Quick Facts:

the expansion of the Halifax Infirmary (HI) is the heart of the QEII New Generation project
a parking study conducted for the province indicated 92 per cent of hospital
visitors either drive or are driven to the hospital and park on site; about 2,700 parking spaces are needed at the HI site
more than 14,000 people visit the QEII Health Sciences Centre every day
the province worked closely with HRM on the HI parking strategy, which received unanimous HRM council support this spring
the Summer Street parkade will have about 500 parking spaces including the required barrier-free and vehicle-charging stations
a pedway connecting the parkade with the hospital will improve accessibility 
the cost of the parkade, pedway and burying the power lines on Summer Street is about $29 million
construction of the parkade is scheduled to start next month
public open space is planned along Bell Road and Summer Street
the Lindsay design team consists of Walter Fedy Architects, Fathom Studios, SDMM, Smith and Andersen, and BMR Engineering

","
Health and Wellness Minister Randy Delorey announced today, June 30, a review of the COVID-19 outbreak at Northwood’s Halifax campus. 
The Northwood review is being done under the Quality-improvement Information Protection Act. Mr. Delorey has appointed infectious disease consultant Dr. Chris Lata and former British Columbia associate deputy minister of health Lynn Stevenson to a quality-improvement committee. They will analyze the outbreak and the response to determine what factors contributed to the spread of COVID-19 at Northwood. 
“Like all Nova Scotians, we are very concerned and saddened about what happened at Northwood and want answers for the families and friends who lost loved ones to this terrible virus,” said Mr. Delorey. “The recommendations will help Northwood and other long-term care facilities better prepare for future waves of this virus.”
The Northwood review will consider: 

whether the preparedness for and response to COVID-19 infections were appropriate and timely during each stage of the outbreak, as revealed by interviews with staff, physicians, administrators and others
staff scheduling practices and processes
best practices in effectively controlling and preventing the introduction and spread of COVID-19 in long-term care settings

Government will also do a separate, internal review of broader infection prevention and control within the long-term care sector. It will consider overall infection prevention and control practices in long-term care facilities and review actions taken during the first wave of COVID-19. 
Both reviews will make recommendations to help avoid or contain future outbreaks. 
The recommendations will be delivered to the minister by Sept. 15 and will be made public after the review period.

Quotes:
COVID-19 has disproportionately affected seniors both locally and nationally. The long-term care system and its safe and efficient function is critical to serving our elderly population and to the overall delivery of health care. The investigation into Northwood will help identify areas of improvement and safety factors that may prevent serious outcomes at all of our long-term care facilities in the future.

","
Government announced today, June 30, the Human Organ and Tissue Donation Act will come into effect on Jan. 18, 2021. 
The new law will make it possible for more Nova Scotians to donate their organs and tissues at the time of their death. 
“This change will help more people get the good news they have been waiting for and ensure more potential donors have the chance to save and improve lives,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “I am very proud that when it comes into effect, Nova Scotia will be the first jurisdiction in North America to have such legislation.” 
A single organ donor can save up to eight lives, and a single tissue donor can help up to 75 people. As of June 29, 108 Nova Scotians are waiting for an organ transplant. Last year, 53 Nova Scotians received organ transplants. 
Starting on Jan. 18, people who do not record a decision on their health card, and are eligible, will be seen as agreeing to be a donor after death. This is known as deemed consent. 
Examples of those not eligible for deemed consent are: 

people under 19 years of age
people without decision-making capacity
people who have lived in Nova Scotia less than 12 months 

People who want to opt out of donation before the new law takes effect can now do so at www.novascotia.ca/organtissuedonation or by calling MSI at 1-800-563-8880. They can also change their decision at any time. 
To learn more about the changes and Nova Scotians’ donation options, visit www.novascotia.ca/organtissuedonation. 

Quotes:
Donation saved my life. It’s an incredible gift to give. One that I am very grateful for and never take for granted. Because of this legislation, so many others who are in desperate need will receive a second chance at life sooner.
Tammy Ripley, heart recipient from Amherst

Today is an important day for health care in Nova Scotia. Changes to the Human Organ and Tissue Donation Act will have a positive impact on recipients awaiting transplants, how we provide end-of-life care to our donors and our ongoing work with donor families. I encourage all Nova Scotians to learn more about the benefits of organ and tissue donation, register your decision and discuss it with your family and loved ones.
Dr. Stephen Beed, Medical Director of the Nova Scotia Organ and Tissue Donation Program



Quick Facts:

the Multi-Organ Transplant Program, based in Halifax, provides organ transplant services for the four Atlantic provinces. The Regional Tissue Bank, part of the Nova Scotia Health Authority, is one of the largest comprehensive tissue centres in Canada
organs that can be donated include kidneys, heart, lungs, liver, pancreas, and small bowel. Tissues that can be donated include corneas, sclera, skin, heart valves, bone, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments
Nova Scotians who want to donate their organs and tissues can continue to indicate that through their health cards. Donation decisions are recorded in the province’s health card registry
an awareness campaign to make Nova Scotians aware of the changes, the choices they can make and how they can opt out if they choose will start in early July
the Human Organ and Tissue Donation Act received unanimous support of the Nova Scotia Legislature when it passed in April 2019.

","
Nova Scotians can enjoy their favourite beaches this summer under the watchful eyes of trained lifeguards starting Wednesday, July 1.
The Nova Scotia Lifeguard Service provides 82 lifeguards to supervise 23 beaches in 12 counties. Last summer, more than 370,000 people visited the beaches and more than 110 rescues took place.
A list of supervised beaches is found on the Nova Scotia Lifeguard Service website, http://www.lifesavingsociety.ns.ca/index.php/nsls-home/beaches
Beaches will be supervised daily between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. until Aug. 30.
""We are preparing to help beachgoers enjoy another summer at the province's most popular beaches. Lifeguards are trained and ready to respond to any situation,"" said Lands and Forestry Minister Iain Rankin. ""I encourage beachgoers to make safety a priority when swimming and to stay between the red and yellow flags that designate the supervised area.""
The Nova Scotia Lifeguard Service also helps government test water quality to ensure the safety of all swimmers.

Quotes:
New safety measures are in place this summer to ensure lifeguards are working in the safest way possible during the pandemic. It's a high-risk activity so lifeguards are equipped with extra training and equipment so they can work safely to meet their goal of keeping Nova Scotians safe. We encourage all Nova Scotians to continue to follow public health measures, like social distancing, while at the beach this summer.
Paul D'Eon, director of the Nova Scotia Lifeguard Service



Quick Facts:

lifeguards hold a Lifesaving Society National Lifeguard certification, Standard First Aid, Oxygen Administration and CPR Automated External Defibrillation certification
Nova Scotia Lifeguard Service has supervised the province’s most popular beaches for 48 years
lifeguards have supervised nearly 20 million people and made nearly 4,800 rescues since 1973

","
Nova Scotians with cognitive impairments like significant memory loss or brain injury want more flexibility and control over how care is provided in their homes. That is why government is expanding a program to help more people get the care they need at home. 
Government is doubling the amount available through the Supportive Care Program from $500 to $1,000 per month, based on assessed need and expanding eligibility to include those with acquired brain injuries. 
“We are giving people more flexibility to choose how care is provided in their homes and supporting people with acquired brain injuries to live full and independent lives,” said Health and Wellness Minister Randy Delorey. “These changes will help more Nova Scotians who want to stay at home get the care and support they need.”
The Supportive Care Program provides funding to eligible Nova Scotians with cognitive impairments, including difficulty thinking, concentrating and remembering to hire services like personal care, respite, meal preparation and housekeeping. The care could come from private agencies or local community supports.
Changes take effect July 1. More information about this program is available by calling 1-800-225-7225. 

Quote:
Brain injury tends to be a sudden event that changes lives in an instant, but recovery and return to life, work and community is possible with ongoing meaningful support. As the only organized voice for some 70,000 Nova Scotians affected by brain injury, we hear from families every day struggling to manage support for their loved ones at home. This expansion will help hundreds of families with more options and flexibility and improve the lives of our brain injury community.
Leona Burkey, executive director, Brain Injury Association of Nova Scotia



Quick Facts:

eligibility criteria include being 65 years or older or, if under 65, having a diagnosis of dementia or an acquired brain injury that affects daily functioning, needing at least 25 hours per month of care support and having a substitute decision maker 
an acquired brain injury is temporary or permanent brain damage or dysfunction caused by trauma from an external force, or by a medical issue or disease
485 current Supportive Care Program clients now have expanded options in how their care is provided. An additional 1,015 Nova Scotians are eligible and could benefit from the expansion 
the Supportive Care Program is one of several home-based care options (in addition to home care and self-managed care) that eligible Nova Scotians can choose based on their assessed need and preference
the $1.6 million in funding for this initiative comes from the Canada-Nova Scotia Home and Community Care and Mental Health and Addiction Services Funding Agreement
June is Brain Injury Awareness Month in Nova Scotia and across Canada

Anyone who has travelled outside of Nova Scotia must self-isolate for 14 days. As always, any Nova Scotian who develops symptoms of acute respiratory illness should limit their contact with others until they feel better. 
It remains important for Nova Scotians to strictly adhere to the public health order and directives - practise good hand washing and other hygiene steps, maintain a physical distance when and where required, and wear a non-medical mask when physical distancing is difficult.
Beginning Friday, July 3, interprovincial travel within Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador, without the requirement to self-isolate for Atlantic Canadian residents, will be permitted. All public health directives of each province must be followed. Under Nova Scotia's Health Protection Act order, visitors from other Canadian provinces and territories must self-isolate for 14 days. Other visitors from outside the Atlantic provinces who have self-isolated for 14 days in another Atlantic province may travel to Nova Scotia without self-isolating again.

","
Nova Scotia is continuing efforts to support people living on lower incomes.
In July, government will expand the Nova Scotia Child Benefit to include more families, while also raising the amount eligible families receive. 
The $18 million investment, included in the 2020-21 budget, is the largest single increase to the benefit since it was created in 1998.
“We’re putting more money directly in the hands of families who need it,” said Kelly Regan, Minister of Community Services. “This is another major investment in the children of our province.”
Families with incomes below $34,000 will now be eligible.
Previously, only those earning $26,000 or less qualified. The amount will also increase from $625 per year to $925 annually for the first child for all eligible families.
The first monthly payment will be issued July 20, in combination with the federal government’s increase to the Canada Child Benefit payment. Families do not have to apply.

Quick Facts:

the benefit is a tax-free, monthly payment to families with children under 18
families that are newly eligible will also now qualify for the Low-Income Pharmacare for Children Program for children under the age of 18 
for each additional child, families will receive between $412 and $900 annually depending on income level
the expanded child benefit will support an additional 6,100 families including 10,000 more children - a total of 28,000 families and 49,000 children across Nova Scotia 
receipt of the Nova Scotia Child Benefit is tied to when Nova Scotians file their 2019 personal income tax return. For that reason, there may be a delay in payments for newly eligible families or a retroactive correction for those who chose to take advantage of the extended deadline to file tax returns

","
Premier Stephen McNeil and Dr. Robert Strang, chief medical officer of health for Nova Scotia, announced today, June 26, further lifting of restrictions given Nova Scotia’s continued low rates of COVID-19. 
“We’ve now had more than two weeks with no new cases of COVID-19, and Nova Scotians are getting back to normal activities while maintaining precautions,” said Premier McNeil. “Continuing the core measures of physical distancing and hand hygiene is how we will keep our case numbers low, especially as we increase gathering limits and welcome Atlantic Canadian visitors to Nova Scotia.” 
Effective Friday, July 3, some gathering limits will increase. If a recognized business or organization is planning an event outdoors, 250 people can attend with physical distancing rules in place. For an indoor event, the limit is 50 per cent capacity to a maximum of 200, again with physical distancing. 
Gatherings not run by a recognized business or organization, for example a family event in the backyard, are still subject to the 50-person maximum limit with physical distancing unless you’re in your close social group of 10. 
The expanded gathering limits apply to social events, faith gatherings, weddings, funerals and other cultural events, and arts and culture events like theatre performances, dance recitals, festivals and concerts. Guidelines for these types of events are available at https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/docs/Events-theatres-and-venues-COVID-19-prevention-guidelines.pdf

People can continue to gather in close social groups of up to 10 without physical distancing. People in a group are not required to be exclusive but they are strongly encouraged to maintain a consistent group. People should not gather in random or spontaneous groups of 10.
Businesses that are too small to ensure physical distancing can still have no more than 10 people on their premises at a time with as much physical distancing as possible. 
In addition, the following restrictions are being eased, effectively immediately:

restaurants and licensed liquor establishments can operate at 100 per cent capacity and serve patrons until midnight with appropriate distancing between tables. Patrons must leave by 1 a.m. They must continue to follow their sector plans
private campgrounds can operate at 100 per cent capacity. They must continue to follow their sector plan
public pools can reopen with physical distancing for lane swimming and aquafit classes, and one or more groups of 10 for other activities based on pool size.

Dr Strang now recommends that all Nova Scotians wear a non-medical mask in situations where distancing may not be able to be kept, such as in stores, on public transit, or at gatherings. The exceptions are children under two or anyone who has a medical reason for not wearing a mask.
“Reopening our economy and society is important but it also increases risk, so it is paramount that we continue our public health measures to minimize a second wave of COVID-19,” said Dr. Strang. “That includes physical distancing as much as possible, good hand hygiene, cough etiquette, staying home if you’re sick and wearing a non-medical mask when you’re in public places like the grocery store where physical distancing is difficult.”
To date, Nova Scotia has 52,553 negative test results, 1,061 positive COVID-19 cases, and 63 deaths. The province currently has no active cases. Cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. Nine-hundred and ninety-eight cases are now resolved. Two people are currently in hospital. Both patients’ COVID-19 infections are considered resolved but they are being treated in hospital.

","
Nova Scotia’s iconic Bluenose II will sail into ports and harbours around the province this summer in a unique tour fit for the times dubbed Sail Past Summer.
“Ninety-nine years ago, Captain Angus Walters took up the mantle of the Bluenose, representing the hopes and pride of Nova Scotians,” said Communities, Culture and Heritage Minister Leo Glavine. “Today, the young crew aboard Bluenose II aims to again help Nova Scotians and Canadians remember their strength and resilience. We hope that seeing the ship sail along our sea-bound coast will help communities remember that as with all storms, the sun will shine again.”
Due to COVID-19, the 20-person crew has created a Bluenose bubble for training, maintenance and sailing the vessel this season. Visitors will not be permitted onboard and there will be no harbour cruises with passengers.
Nova Scotia’s sailing ambassador is scheduled to depart Lunenburg in late July and visit 26 communities in southwestern Nova Scotia, the South Shore, Halifax Regional Municipality and Cape Breton. Bluenose II will also sail along parts of the coast of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island but will not dock in any ports.

Quotes:
Through our teamwork onboard we hope to embody the unity that is being shown ashore. It is the crew’s belief that seeing Bluenose II sailing in our waters will inspire communities to remember their strengths as they work together for a better future.
Phil Watson, captain, Bluenose II



Quick Facts:

the original Bluenose, designed by William Roué and built by the Smith and Rhuland Shipyard, was launched as a Grand Banks fishing and racing schooner on March 26, 1921 in Lunenburg
starting in 1921, Bluenose won the International Fishermen’s Trophy and brought it home to Nova Scotia for the next 17 years
celebrations are planned to recognize the Bluenose’s centenary next year
built in 1963, Bluenose II is a replica of the famed schooner
on April 6, Transport Canada issued an interim order prohibiting the operation of commercial vessels carrying more than 12 passengers for non-essential purposes, including tourism, until June 30, and Bluenose II cancelled scheduled passenger cruises and issued refunds to those who had purchased tickets

","
Nova Scotia is taking action to protect youth and decrease youth vaping by strengthening regulations on the sale of vaping products. That is why Nova Scotia will be the first province in Atlantic Canada to introduce a tax on vaping products and among the first in the country to require sales permits.
“We need to do everything we can to make sure vaping products do not appeal to younger Nova Scotians, particularly in light of concerning health consequences,” says Karen Casey, Minister of Finance and Treasury Board. “We have been concerned about growing vaping rates among our youth and we are responding to keep our youth safe. We continue to be a leader in this area.”
The regulatory process to introduce sales permits was delayed due to COVID-19. Not all permits will be in place July 1, as expected. The province will use this time to continue to inform and educate retailers and wholesalers and is targeting Aug. 1 for permits to be in place.
The Vaping Products Tax will begin Sept.15. The changes were first announced as part of Budget 2020-21. 
The province has also banned the sale of flavoured vape products and passed legislation to assume regulatory authority over the nicotine content of tobacco, e-cigarettes and other products, protecting youth from potentially hazardous nicotine levels.

Quotes:
Vaping can cause direct harms, as well as lead youth to start smoking cigarettes. Pricing is an important part of our efforts to reduce vaping rates, as we know youth are particularly sensitive to the cost of these products. Nova Scotia has taken a comprehensive approach to address vaping, which includes controls on marketing and nicotine content, a ban on flavoured products and enforcement of sales to minors. Our goal is to prevent more Nova Scotians from taking up vaping. We also encourage Nova Scotians who currently vape or smoke to use proven cessation supports.
Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health



Quick Facts:

retailers and wholesalers/manufacturers will be required to obtain a permit from Service Nova Scotia Internal Services by Aug. 1
the permit fee is $124.60 for a three-year period for retailers and $124.60 annually for wholesalers/manufacturers
vaping substances, with the exception of cannabis vaping substances already taxed under the Coordinated Cannabis Taxation Agreement, and tobacco products taxed under the Revenue Act, will be taxed at the rate of $0.50 per millilitre for liquids, $0.50 per gram for solids
vaping devices will be taxed at a rate of 20 per cent of their suggested retail selling price

","
Nova Scotians rely on first responder organizations to protect us from fires and other emergency situations. That is why the budget of the Emergency Services Provider Fund was increased to purchase equipment used to respond to an emergency.
The program budget for 2020-21 is $1 million, an increase of $500,000.
A new category was added to the program this year for emergency power for buildings. Applicants can choose standby generators, including electrical and wiring, fixed fuel supply tanks and posts to protect generators.
“First responders from across the province benefit from the equipment purchased under this fund and in turn, this directly supports our communities,” said Chuck Porter, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “Most of them volunteer their time and put themselves at risk helping us in dangerous situations. This funding supports the purchase of equipment they need to carry out this essential work.”   
The annual program provides funding to emergency first responders, including volunteer fire departments, ground search and rescue organizations and hazardous material (HAZMAT) organizations. Applicants can purchase equipment from up to three of the seven categories.

Quick Facts:

program provides up to 75 per cent of eligible costs to a maximum of $20,000
categories include personal protective equipment and self-contained breathing apparatus, communications, rescue equipment, miscellaneous firefighting equipment, hazardous material (HAZMAT) equipment, water supply and suppression equipment, emergency power for building
applications will be accepted until July 13
organizations can apply every three years

","
Today, June 21, is National Indigenous Peoples Day, a time to recognize and celebrate the cultures and contributions of the First Nations, Inuit and Métis in Canada.
The celebrations will be much different this year because of COVID-19, but the spirit and meaning of this important day are in no way diminished.
In fact, given the experiences and tragedies in different parts of our country in recent months, this day takes on even more significance.
There have been many conversations about the sad reality that Indigenous people are still subject to racism, both systemic and overt. This is unacceptable and we all have a role to play in ensuring we have a fair and just society for all.
A key part of that journey is raising cultural awareness and understanding, something we have committed to do with the strong, vibrant Mi’kmaw culture in Nova Scotia. We continue to develop resources in our schools and have made the promotion of Mi’kmaw culture a major part of our Culture Action Plan.
I am proud of how much we have achieved together to recognize the Mi’kmaw language, promote treaty education and celebrate Mi’kmaw culture and heritage, and I look forward to accomplishing much more.
Unfortunately, we have lost a wonderful educational opportunity this summer with the postponement of the North American Indigenous Games due to COVID-19. This celebration of sport and culture would have drawn more than 5,000 participants from across the continent to our province. While disappointing, we continue to work with the games’ host society on the way forward.
In Nova Scotia, we recognize the importance of Mi’kmaw culture every day. On National Indigenous Peoples Day, let us all reflect on the contributions of Indigenous people across the country.

","
Premier Stephen McNeil and Dr. Robert Strang, chief medical officer of health for Nova Scotia, announced today, June 18, changes to gathering limits given Nova Scotia’s low rates of COVID-19. 
“We’ve now had well over a week with no new cases of COVID-19 and low rates for the last several weeks. That is thanks to Nova Scotians who have been following public health protocols,” said Premier McNeil. “Our aim is to safely open as much of the economy and our province as we can so that Nova Scotians and the business community can have a good summer. The core measures of social distancing and good hygiene that have kept case numbers low will stay in place. But effective today, household bubbles are down and gathering limits are up.” 
People can now gather in groups of up to 10 without physical distancing. People in a group are not required to be exclusive but they are strongly encouraged to maintain a consistent group. 
This is especially important for Nova Scotians who are more at risk of complications from COVID-19. This change replaces the concept of family household bubbles.
Gatherings of up to 50 will now be allowed but people must observe physical distancing of two metres or six feet.
The larger gathering limit of 50 applies to social events, faith gatherings, sports and physical activity, weddings and funerals, and arts and culture events like theatre performances, dance recitals, festivals and concerts.
Businesses that are too small to ensure physical distancing can have no more than 10 people on their premises at a time.
Effective today, playgrounds can start reopening. Municipalities and other owners of playgrounds will need time to prepare them for reopening so Nova Scotians should not expect them to be open immediately.
“We’re providing a new option for close social interaction because it’s important for our well-being, but everybody needs to make decisions that take into consideration the risks, their own circumstances, and how they help keep everyone safe,” said Dr. Strang. “It’s important that we all continue physical distancing as much as possible, good hand hygiene, cough etiquette, staying home if you’re sick and making informed decisions about the groups and activities we choose to join.”
To date, Nova Scotia has 50,240 negative test results, 1,061 positive COVID-19 cases, 62 deaths, and two active COVID-19 cases. Cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. Two individuals are currently in hospital, one of those in ICU. Nine-hundred and ninety-seven cases are now resolved. Cases have been identified in all parts of the province. Cumulative cases by zone may change as data is updated in Panorama. A map and graphic presentation of the case data is available at https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/data .

","
A three-member trustee board will oversee spending decisions of a $50 million trust fund that will continue to advance the transition and development of Nova Scotia’s forestry sector. 
First announced in February, the Forestry Innovation Transition Trust may be accessed by companies, organizations or post-secondary institutions working and researching in the forestry and biological resources sectors. 
The trustees are:

Sandra McKenzie, Waverley, HRM, nominated by government as chair  
Douglas Hall, Halifax, as a transition team nominee

“The trust creates an opportunity to transform Nova Scotia’s forestry sector as a leader in the bioeconomy,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “There is great potential in using our rich forests and skilled workforce to find new ways to respond to emerging market needs and develop a new knowledge base to create a stronger sustainable future.”
Projects may include:

the development of new high-value products
the development of new or enhanced business models, processes or services
new inclusive economic growth opportunities in forestry
new ecological services

The trust will support projects that align with the vision, principles and priorities developed by the Forestry Transition Team for Nova Scotia’s forestry sector. Advice and guidance will be sought from sector leaders and innovators. 
The trust expects to open for applications in July. Further details on the application process will be released later this month.
Government will continue to support transition programs already announced and endorsed by the transition team, valued at more than $25 million.

","
The Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation (NSLC) released its year-end financial results today, June 16, for April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020.
Strong sales growth exceeded projections with a 4.2 per cent increase in earnings to $247.3 million compared to the previous fiscal year. This growth was driven by the first full year of cannabis sales, the introduction of new cannabis categories, sales growth in all local product categories and an influx in sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
There continues to be strong growth in all local product categories. Nova Scotia ready-to-drink sales, driven primarily by vodka coolers, were up 101.4 per cent to $16 million over the previous fiscal year, while Nova Scotia craft beer sales were up 21.5 per cent, to $20.1 million. Nova Scotia spirit sales grew by 22.2 per cent to $9.4 million, while Nova Scotia wine sales increased by eight per cent to $12.5 million. Nova Scotia cannabis accounted for 18.3 per cent of cannabis sales at $13 million.
The 2 million cannabis transactions had an average dollar value of $34.74, which was down from $38.29 the previous year. The average dollar value of each beverage alcohol transaction grew by 4.6 per cent to $32.08.
Total sales were up 9.7 per cent to $726 million with $655.1 million in beverage alcohol sales and $71 million in recreational cannabis sales.

","
As prosecutors, Crown attorneys of the Nova Scotia Public Prosecution Service are committed to the fair treatment of all members of the public who encounter the criminal justice system, including African Nova Scotians. We are disgusted by the recent acts of violence that have resulted in the loss of black lives including George Floyd. We condemn the past and present-day violence that continues to be inflicted upon black people, including violence by people sworn to protect and serve our community.
We are mindful of the legacy of colonialism, centuries of slavery and segregation. We recognize that anti-black racism and racial profiling remain an ongoing and deeply entrenched social problem. Many African Nova Scotians experience systemic and direct racism, including racial profiling everyday. We acknowledge the effects of these experiences, as well as the historical disadvantages, have led to lack of opportunities and over-representation of African Nova Scotians in correctional facilities.     
Our courts have acknowledged the existence of institutionalized racism in Nova Scotia. In the Supreme Court of Canada’s 1997 decision in R.D.S. v. Her Majesty the Queen, the Court stated:
“The reasonable person must thus be deemed to be cognizant of the existence of racism in Halifax, Nova Scotia. It follows that judges may take notice of actual racism known to exist in a particular society. Judges have done so with respect to racism in Nova Scotia. 
“Racism is a pernicious reality. The issue of racism existing in Nova Scotia has been well documented in the Marshall Inquiry Report, previously known as the Royal Commission on the Donald Marshall, Jr. Prosecution. A person would have to be stupid, complacent or ignorant not to acknowledge its presence, not only individually, but also systemically and institutionally.”
The Public Prosecution Service was established as a direct result of the Royal Commission on the Donald Marshall Jr. Prosecution. We understand our obligation to seek justice by applying laws fairly and equitably to all whom encounter the criminal justice system, including African Nova Scotians. A fair and equitable justice system is essential to a free and democratic society.     
As mentioned in our last news release, the Public Prosecution Service was contacted by members of the public asking for the charges against Santina Rao to be withdrawn. To protect the fundamental right of due process of law, our prosecutors do not publicly debate matters before the courts. However, we can say that our prosecutors are duty-bound to look at both the availability of sufficient evidence and whether it is in the public interest to proceed with a prosecution. In doing this, our prosecutors are empowered to consider systemic racism, including racial profiling, faced by African Nova Scotians as an important factor on both grounds of this analysis.     
Our prosecution service acknowledges that much work is still required to meaningfully address this longstanding issue. However, it is important to highlight some of the work we are doing toward improving prosecutions involving members of marginalized communities, either as accused persons or as victims of crimes:
Building organizational change:

in 2015, the Public Prosecution Service renewed an Equity and Diversity Committee. The committee’s mandate is to support the Public Prosecution Service by promoting, monitoring and providing advice about programs and policies that enhance equity and diversity within the service, in the delivery of prosecution services and in our efforts to contribute to addressing equity and diversity issues across the criminal justice system to enhance the administration of justice

Engaging in education/training for Crown attorneys: 

spring 2019 – Dr. Scot Wortley, professor of criminology at the University of Toronto and author of the Wortley Report on HRM street checks, spoke to our Crown attorneys about his report and on equity and diversity
October 2019 – Public Prosecution Service Fall Education Conference – education session on the history of slavery and racism in Nova Scotia and how that history impacts our prosecution process, including sentencing

Contribution to reversing overrepresentation:

work is underway on a comprehensive Public Prosecution Service policy respecting the fair treatment of African Nova Scotians in criminal prosecutions, which will be patterned after our policy Fair Treatment of Indigenous People in Criminal Prosecutions in Nova Scotia, issued to Crown attorneys in October of 2018. Central to both policies is the acknowledgment that racism and discrimination have contributed to the over-representation of Indigenous persons and African Nova Scotians in our criminal justice system

Increased support for existing initiatives:

for the first time ever, an articled clerk position with Public Prosecution Service will be offered exclusively to a graduate of the Indigenous Black and Mi’kmaq Initiative at the Schulich School of Law at Dalhousie University

The Nova Scotia Public Prosecution Service continues to strive everyday to deliver on our mission to prosecute with professionalism, integrity and fairness for all Nova Scotians. We want to assure all Nova Scotians that we are committed to the hard work of tackling this complex issue. We remain committed to ensuring the fair treatment within the criminal justice system of African Nova Scotians by striving to be sensitive to and acknowledging their unique history and experiences.

","
Older Nova Scotians helped build this province and continue to make great contributions to our communities. However, older people may be more vulnerable to abuse, particularly as people are staying home due to COVID-19. 
Today, June 15, is World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, a time to remind all Nova Scotians to stay connected with older people. 
“Now more than ever it’s important to reach out, to listen and to appreciate our loved ones who built the foundations we live on today,” said Leo Glavine, Minister of Seniors. “Social distancing is important to prevent the spread of COVID-19, but it can also make it more difficult to recognize abuse when it happens. Keeping in touch with each other can make a big difference.”
Elder abuse can take many forms, including financial, emotional, psychological, physical or sexual. Abuse can also come in the form of neglect – failing to provide the necessities of life such as food, clothing, safe shelter, medical attention or personal care.
Abuse of older adults is more common than many of us realize and often occurs within a relationship where there is an expectation of trust.
If people think they or someone they know is experiencing abuse or having difficulties, help is available. They can call 211 or reach out to the seniors’ safety program in their area for advice and information. 

Quotes:
The abuse of older adults is a real and serious issue in our communities. All Nova Scotians deserve to be treated with fairness, dignity and respect.
Michelle Parker, Kings County seniors' safety co-ordinator

Abuse thrives in silence and isolation. We don’t always recognize that our actions and behaviours may be causing harm or allowing it to happen. It is important that we reflect on our own attitudes and assumptions about growing older that may be negatively impacting the well-being of older people.
Sharon Elliott, Annapolis County seniors' safety co-ordinator



Quick Facts:

according to the World Health Organization, it’s estimated that one in six older adults worldwide experiences elder abuse, often by someone they know and trust
World Elder Abuse Awareness Day is an official United Nations International Day acknowledging the significance of elder abuse as a public health and human rights issue

","
A new student transportation policy will come into effect in September.
The policy was developed with input from a November 2018 online school bus consultation survey that more than 8,000 Nova Scotians responded to.
“After consulting with school communities throughout Halifax Regional Municipality, we have made substantial changes to provide safe and reliable transportation for our students and school communities,” said Zach Churchill, Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development. “While families and students outside HRM are quite satisfied with existing bus services, it is clear from conversations with families and the education community that changes were necessary to improve how we help students get to school.”
The student transportation policy will:

set new provincial criteria for school bus eligibility. Students and pre-primary children who attend an elementary school and live at least 1.6 kilometres away will be eligible for busing. Junior and senior high school students will be eligible if they live 2.4 kilometres away. Most regional centres and the Conseil scolaire acadien provincial are currently operating at or below the new criteria
address communication plans between service providers and families
include a new review process when families are not in agreement with a transportation decision

In September, all eligible pre-primary children will also have access to a school bus.
Families can contact their regional centre for education or the Conseil scolaire acadien provincial to determine bus eligibility. 

Quick Facts:

more than 77,000 students ride a school bus every day
the previous distance criteria were 2.4 kilometres for elementary schools and 3.6 kilometres for secondary students

","
Day camps across Nova Scotia can reopen provided they have a plan in place to address public health measures. 
Dr. Robert Strang, chief medical officer of health, released COVID-19 guidelines all summer day camps must follow, today, June 12.
“With these guidelines, children will have opportunities to learn, grow, be active, and have fun this summer in an environment that’s safe for them, their families and staff,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “This is an important step for Nova Scotia families to have more support and some sense of normalcy this summer.” 
Guidelines for day camps are based in part on child care guidelines which were created with input from infection control experts at the IWK Health Centre. 
“Every day camp that wants to reopen must have a plan in place to mitigate risks,” said Dr. Strang. “Our guidelines will help day camp operators develop plans that are tailored to their activities.”
The guidelines also include feedback from some day camp providers. They offer guidance on how day camps can prevent and reduce the spread of COVID-19, manage disease outbreaks, advise staff on the use of personal protective equipment and outline public health measures that address physical distancing, hygiene practices, cleaning practices, outdoor activities and other considerations. 
Based on these guidelines, all day camp operators must have an individual plan in place to support reopening. Plans will cover key areas such as:

increased cleaning
staggered pick up and drop off times
screening staff and campers
limiting group sizes to 10, keeping the same groups of children together
multiple groups are allowed but they must be kept separated 
increased hand washing and minimizing sharing of equipment

Day camps will communicate directly with families about their specific reopening plans.

Quick Facts:

day camps are run by a variety of organizations such as municipalities, universities, recreation facilities, and others
day camps that choose to open must have plans based on the guidelines but do not need to submit them for approval

","
Over the next few weeks, we need to monitor COVID-19 cases to ensure they stay low and we have little to no community spread. If we continue to flatten the curve, our first priority is to ease restrictions in our own province, including expanding the family bubble. 
Nova Scotia is open to an Atlantic bubble, but we cannot put a date on it until we are sure our case numbers are low and the cases in other provinces remain low. 
Currently in Nova Scotia, anyone who wants to come is welcome, as long as they don’t have any symptoms of COVID-19 and can self-isolate for 14 days when they arrive. We will decide when to lift those restrictions based on science.

","
Premier Stephen McNeil and Dr. Robert Strang, chief medical officer of health, announced today, June 10, the easing of some visitor restrictions in long-term care homes and homes for persons with disabilities .
Effective Monday, June 15, visits can resume at long-term care facilities, provided they happen outdoors and visitors stay two metres or six feet away from residents and staff. 
This change also applies to homes funded by the Department of Community Services under the Homes for Special Care Act.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has been challenging for all of us but in many ways, it has been hardest on our seniors in nursing homes and those living in homes for persons with disabilities,” said Premier McNeil. “That’s why we are easing visitor restrictions while keeping many of our public health directives in place to protect our most vulnerable.”
Individual long-term care facilities and homes for persons with disabilities will communicate directly with residents and their families to arrange visits. 
“I can only imagine how tough it has been for long-term care residents and participants in homes for persons with disabilities to not be able to connect with their loved ones,” said Dr. Strang. “Outdoor visits are a way to bring residents and their friends and families back together safely.”
To ensure resident and visitor safety, the following measures will be in place:

visits will only take place outdoors, in designated areas on the facility’s grounds 
a maximum of two visitors may attend at one time
visitors must maintain physical distance of two metres or six feet
visitors must be screened for COVID-19 upon entry and wear a non-medical mask; anyone with symptoms will not be permitted to enter
visitor information must be logged, including date and time of visit to the facility
visitors who are self-isolating are not permitted to enter the facility or grounds 
visits will be monitored by staff, who will escort visitors to the designated area and provide personal protective equipment if needed

Facilities will be provided with materials to support this change, including screening guidelines and staff education materials. 

Quick Facts:

there are 132 long-term care facilities in Nova Scotia that are home to almost 8,000 residents
there are over 300 homes for persons with disabilities in Nova Scotia with more than 2,000 people living in them
visitors have not been permitted at long-term care facilities since March 15

COVID-19/HEALTH/WELLNESS—Province Updates Data, Reports No New Cases of COVID-19

As of today, June 10, Nova Scotia has 1,061 confirmed cases of COVID-19. No new cases were identified June 9. 
The province has reconciled and consolidated data sources to ensure all publicly reported data comes from a single source, Panorama, the province's public health reporting system. Updated data is available at https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/data .
“Nova Scotia is the first province in the country to integrate our lab data with our public health reporting system,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health. “Panorama is the gold standard and gives us the most up-to-date and comprehensive COVID-19 data.” 
This change altered some data points. The total number of cases increased by one additional case, to reflect a Nova Scotian who tested positive for COVID-19, but who is not currently in the province and was not tested here. The ‘recovered’ category has been renamed ‘resolved’ to more accurately account for all COVID-19 cases whose investigations are considered completed and closed by public health. The breakdown of total number of cases by location is now based on the Nova Scotia Health Authority zone of the individual’s residence, not where their sample was collected for testing. 
The QEII Health Sciences Centre's microbiology lab completed 691 Nova Scotia tests on June 9 and is operating 24-hours.
There are no licensed long-term care homes in Nova Scotia with active cases of COVID-19.
To date, Nova Scotia has 46,668 negative test results, 1,061 positive COVID-19 cases, 62 deaths, and five active COVID-19 cases. Cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. Two individuals are currently in hospital, both in ICU. Nine-hundred and ninety-four cases are now resolved. Cases have been identified in all parts of the province. 
The list of symptoms being screened for has recently expanded. If you have any one of the following symptoms, visit https://811.novascotia.ca to determine if you should call 811 for further assessment: 

fever (i.e. chills, sweats)
cough or worsening of a previous cough
sore throat
headache
shortness of breath
muscle aches
sneezing
nasal congestion/runny nose
hoarse voice
diarrhea
unusual fatigue
loss of sense of smell or taste
red, purple or blueish lesions on the feet, toes or fingers without clear cause

Public health is working to identify and test people who may have come in close contact with the confirmed cases. Those individuals who have been confirmed are being directed to self-isolate at home, away from the public, for 14 days.
Anyone who has travelled outside of Nova Scotia must self-isolate for 14 days. As always, any Nova Scotian who develops symptoms of acute respiratory illness should limit their contact with others until they feel better. 
It remains important for Nova Scotians to strictly adhere to the public health order and directives - practise good hand washing and other hygiene steps, maintain a physical distance of two metres or six feet from those not in your household or family household bubble and limit planned gatherings of people outside your household or family household bubble to no more than 10.

","
Communities will be able to celebrate their 2020 graduates this year, provided they are led by an established organization and follow public health guidelines to ensure celebrations are safe.
Dr. Robert Strang, chief medical officer of health for Nova Scotia, announced today, June 5, an exemption under the Public Health Act order to allow community organizations, businesses or municipalities to hold celebrations to recognize graduates due to the loss of traditional graduation ceremonies.
All public high schools in Nova Scotia will recognize and honour Grade 12 graduates receiving diplomas. This will be separate from any celebrations that might be held in the community.
All non-school based, community celebrations of graduates must be held by a recognized business, municipality or community organization (like a club, association, society, volunteer group, faith-based group), and the local municipality, police and fire departments and EHS must be informed and supportive of the planned event.
“Graduation ceremonies are an important tradition not only for the students who worked so hard to get there, but for their loved ones who supported them along the way,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “The class of 2020 is moving on from high school during a unique time and while their festivities will look different this year, there are ways to celebrate safely. Congratulations to all of the graduates of 2020. I know the last few months of school looked quite a bit different, but I hope you’re proud of all you’ve accomplished.”
“Living with COVID-19 continues to be a balance for us all. Unfortunately, students leaving school this year won’t have a traditional graduation ceremony or prom,” said Dr. Strang. “We want to support communities in recognizing these students, but it’s vital these celebrations are done safely, without risking the health of participants.”
Conditions under the exemption include:

attendees must arrive in a vehicle 
all passengers in the vehicle must be from a single household or household bubble 
graduates can be out of their vehicle to do things like cross a stage or take part in a parade of graduates as long as physical distance (two metres or six feet) is maintained between all graduates while they are out of their vehicle
organizers must communicate clearly with attendees in advance and ensure other public health protocols, like physical distancing, are followed

","
Nova Scotia’s agricultural businesses continue to produce food and generate economic activity, even when faced with the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The province is responding to the sector’s immediate needs to help keep it strong.
“This support package will help farmers manage risks that are currently threatening the viability of their farm operations and our food supply system,” said Agriculture Minister Keith Colwell. “We need a strong agriculture sector and by taking these steps, we are helping our farm families improve their competitiveness, productivity and profitability at a time of significant change.”
In partnership with the federal government, the assistance includes a new COVID-19 Response and Mitigation Program, funded under the Canadian Agricultural Partnership, that helps mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The program will help food producers with the costs of meeting extra health requirements due to COVID-19, help producers get their crops to market, fund projects aimed at maintaining competitiveness, productivity, profitability, and support abattoir efficiency and development.
Nova Scotia and the Government of Canada have agreed to increase the 2020 AgriStability interim benefit payment percentage from 50 to 75 per cent for producers. The program supports producers experiencing a large decline in farm income.
They are also providing a 10 per cent discount on producers’ share of AgriInsurance premiums, saving farmers from making these payments during difficult times. AgriInsurance is an insurance against natural hazards to reduce the financial impact of production losses.
Agricultural businesses can apply for the assistance now.

Quotes:
Working with the province, our government is there every step of the way to help Nova Scotia farmers with the challenges they face to bring their high-quality products to market. This investment made through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership will help Nova Scotia’s food sector remain resilient and strong.
Marie-Claude Bibeau, federal Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food

Farmers have faced a lot of challenges over the last three seasons. We continue to advocate on behalf of our members and are pleased to see the government releasing support programs for Nova Scotia agriculture. We look forward to our future discussions so that we can ensure the continued support for our food system.

Nova Scotia’s licensed child care centres and family daycare homes will reopen June 15.
Child care centres will open beginning at a minimum 50 per cent capacity and can move up to 100 per cent if they are able to meet public health’s COVID-19 guidelines for child care settings. Family daycare homes will open at full capacity. All facilities must follow COVID-19 guidelines outlined by public health.
“I want to thank licensed child care providers and families for their patience and understanding since the COVID-19 pandemic began,” said Zach Churchill, Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development. “Now, we are working together to support centres to open in a manner that follows the public health guidelines provided to all licensed providers.""   
The public health guidelines were created with input from pediatrics at the IWK Health Centre and includes feedback received through a sector-led consultation with more than 2,500 participants. The guidelines provide guidance on how centres can prevent and reduce the spread of COVID-19, manage disease outbreaks, advise staff on the use of personal protective equipment and outline public health measures that address physical distancing, hygiene practises, cleaning practises, outdoor activities and other considerations.
Based on these guidelines, all licensed child care providers are required to have an individual site-based plan in place to support reopening. They will communicate directly with families in the coming days about their specific reopening plans. Plans will include measures such as:

increased cleaning 
staggered pick-up and drop-off times
limit the number of essential visitors entering the facility
have children sleep six feet apart during nap time
create groups so the same children are together every day
limit contact with other groups in the centre
practise social distancing among staff, visitors and other groups when and where possible

Government will also provide hand sanitizer and single-use surgical masks to licensed facilities for the next six months. 
Families will not be required to pay fees if they cannot access their child care space or are not ready to return. Providers will receive funding on a sliding scale until September as they increase their capacity from 50 per cent in accordance with public health guidelines.  Families are encouraged to talk to their providers regarding timing of re-enrolling their child in licensed child care.
The public health guidelines for licensed child care are available at, https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/education .

Quick Facts:

licensed child care and family daycare homes under an agency closed on March 17.

","
The Shubenacadie Wildlife Park and Nova Scotia’s 20 provincial camping parks are set to reopen in June with new measures in place to ensure Nova Scotians can safely enjoy their visits.

Visitors are encouraged to practise physical distancing and pay by debit or credit. A one-way route around the park is marked with arrows for visitors to follow. Some trails will be closed. Visitors cannot bring food into the park for the animals and coin feeders will not be available. Portable washrooms, including accessible facilities, and canteen service will be available.
Provincial campgrounds will open Monday, June 15, at a reduced capacity. The number of available campsites has been reduced by 30 per cent to ensure physical distancing requirements are met. Campers can expect more frequent cleaning of common areas, signs to promote physical distancing and other healthy practices, and changes to the on-site check-in process to minimize physical contact with park employees.
Campsite reservations will open over four days starting Monday, June 8. A schedule of which campgrounds open for reservations and the days they open is posted on the provincial parks website. Reservations can be made online or by phone starting at 9 a.m. on those days.

","
Premier Stephen McNeil and Dr. Robert Strang, chief medical officer of health for Nova Scotia, announced today, May 29, a new gathering limit of 10 and more steps toward reopening the province. 
“Nova Scotians have done the hard work to flatten our curve and with that, we will soon be getting back to work, eating in restaurants, getting back to the gym and getting haircuts,” said Premier McNeil. “This next step to allow people to gather in slightly larger groups is good for our mental health and well-being.”
The new gathering limit of 10 is effective immediately. Physical distancing of two metres or six feet is still required, except among members of the same household or family household bubble. 
The limit is the same indoors and outdoors, with an exception for outdoor weddings and funeral services which can have 15 people. 
The gathering limit applies to things like social gatherings, arts and culture activities like theatre performances and dance recitals, faith gatherings, and sports and physical activity. It also applies to businesses whose main function is gatherings, such as theatres, concerts, festivals and sporting activities, and to businesses that are too small to ensure physical distancing.
Other steps being taken include:

starting June 5, private campgrounds can open for all types of campers. They can only operate at 50 per cent capacity and must ensure public health protocols are followed including adequate distance between campsites
provincial campgrounds will open to Nova Scotians on June 15, with the reservation line opening June 8. They will operate at a reduced capacity to ensure a minimum of 20 feet between individual campsites 
pools can start maintenance work to prepare for reopening, likely in time for summer 
sleepover camps are not permitted this year

“As we create more opportunities for Nova Scotians to regain some normalcy in their lives, it’s important that we all continue to take protective measures like good hand hygiene, cough etiquette and staying home if you’re sick,” said Dr. Strang. “It’s also important for people to think about their own health and circumstances in order to make good decisions about the activities they choose to do.”
To date, Nova Scotia has 40,914 negative test results, 1,055 positive COVID-19 test results and 59 deaths. Confirmed cases range in age from under 10 to over 90.

Government is adding 23 new long-term care beds to help meet the need caused by the pandemic.
The beds are necessary because some long-term care facilities have slowed or stopped admissions due to COVID-19.
“Long-term care facilities have worked hard at managing COVID-19, but the pandemic has increased the need for nursing home beds,” said Randy Delorey, Minister of Health and Wellness. “This will help get Nova Scotians into the long-term care accommodations that they need.”
The province is entering into a two-year agreement with renewal option with Shannex RLC Ltd. to convert a floor at the Caritas Residence, a private assisted-living home in Bedford, into nursing home beds. Residents will be able to move into the facility in early June.

Quotes:
We are very pleased to provide a solution to help during these challenging times. Caritas Residence is a wonderful community and our teams look forward to working with our partners at the Department of Health and Wellness to make these new beds available very soon.
Jason Shannon, president and chief operating officer, Shannex

","
Premier Stephen McNeil and Dr. Robert Strang, chief medical officer of health for Nova Scotia, announced today, May 27, the next steps toward reopening the province. 
“Nova Scotians have done a lot of hard work to get us to this point,” said Premier McNeil. “I know many are eager to get back to business and restart our economy. That’s why we have worked with Dr. Strang and our public health experts and consulted many businesses and associations to land on these next steps to reopen our province safely.”
Effective June 5, most businesses required to close under the public health order can reopen. Businesses must follow protocols in the plan that is tailored to their sector. This includes following public health protocols to ensure physical distancing, increased cleaning and other protective measures for staff and customers.
The following can open if they are ready and choose to do so:

restaurants for dine-in, as well as takeout and delivery
bars, wineries, distilleries and taprooms
lounges are not permitted to reopen at this time 
personal services, such as hair salons, barber shops, spas, nail salons and body art establishments
fitness facilities, such as gyms, yoga studios and climbing facilities 
veterinarians

Other health providers can also reopen on June 5, provided they follow protocols in their colleges’ and associations’ plans, as approved by public health. These include:

dentistry and other self-regulated health professions such as optometry, chiropractic and physiotherapy
unregulated health professions such as massage therapy, podiatry and naturopathy

Public health continues to work with the child care sector on a plan to reopen safely. June 15 is now the goal, but the reopening date will be confirmed and shared with Nova Scotians once the plan is fully approved. The primary focus is the safety of children. 
Existing public health directives around physical distancing and gathering limits remain in place. People must keep two metres apart and not gather in groups of more than five.
“I’m impressed by the comprehensive plans I have reviewed so far,” said Dr. Strang. “They clearly show these sectors are taking the health of their staff and the public very seriously and it gives me confidence they can reopen while mitigating public health risks.”
Eligible businesses, non-profits, charities and social enterprises will be able to access the new Small Business Reopening and Support Grant, a $25 million fund that will provide grants to help them open safely and business continuity vouchers for advice and support to become more resilient in the coming months. More information is available online at https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus and applications will begin June 1.
Nova Scotians are encouraged to continue to:

wash their hands frequently, or use hand sanitizer if soap and water is unavailable
cough or sneeze into their sleeve
avoid touching their face
limit non-essential travel
clean high touch surfaces frequently
wear a non-medical mask when it may be difficult to maintain two metres distance

To date, Nova Scotia has 39,441 negative test results, 1,053 positive COVID-19 test results and 59 deaths. Confirmed cases range in age from under 10 to over 90.

Dry conditions across the province are fueling several wildfires and the province’s crews and partner organizations are responding.
“We have teams of expert wildfire fighters and they are all being deployed to where they are needed, working alongside local fire departments and other response agencies,” said Iain Rankin, Minister of Lands and Forestry. “It’s extremely important for the public to keep updated on the latest information, stay away from these areas and reduce the risk of further fires by adhering to provincial and municipal fire restrictions.”
There are three significant wildfires underway now.
On Monday, May 25, ground and air crews and volunteer fire departments responded to a wildfire near Frankville, Antigonish Co. An incident command centre has now been established with 17 provincial wildfire crew, a helicopter and 31 volunteer firefighters on scene today, May 26. The wildfire is estimated to be about 200 hectares in size and is about 40 per cent contained. It is considered to be out of control. 
Wildfire crews on the ground and in the air continue working today with multiple volunteer fire departments in responding to a fire near Alton Road in the Springfield area of Kings County. This wildfire is still estimated to be about 120 hectares and is currently considered out of control.  
In the southern end of the province near Argyle, Yarmouth Co., Department of Lands and Forestry personnel are back on the scene of a wildfire estimated to be about 30 to 50 hectares, considered under control. 
Currently no fires are near residential areas and no structures have been lost.

Quick Facts:

the cause of each of these fires will be investigated 
Nova Scotia experiences an average of 225 wildfires each season

The Nova Scotia Securities Commission is alerting investors that CoinsFM is not registered to trade in securities or derivatives in Nova Scotia.  
CoinsFM claims to be an online trading platform for cryptocurrencies and contracts for difference in crypto assets. Contracts for difference allow investors to speculate on the change in price in underlying instruments and are considered a type of derivative trading.
At least one Nova Scotia resident has lost money after investing with CoinsFM. This investor learned of CoinsFM through an online advertisement. CoinsFM offers a broker to assist with trades and a bonus on deposits to entice investors and to give the appearance of legitimacy. Investors are required to provide specific personal and financial information when opening an account. 
The commission urges Nova Scotians to exercise extreme caution when dealing with unregistered firms. If you have had contact with CoinsFM, please contact the commission. Nova Scotians can contact the commission to report scams or suspicious behavior from anyone offering investment opportunities.

Quotes:
The internet can be a dangerous place to shop for investments. Always take the time to check registration and understand the risks and costs associated with your investments. Never give out personal and financial information without independent verification of the legitimacy of operations. There may be long-term damaging effects to your financial well-being as a result. Becoming an informed investor is your best protection from falling victim to scams.

The wildfire in the Porters Lake area of Halifax Regional Municipality that reached an estimated 50 hectares, is now considered under control. About 60 per cent is contained and crews remain on site to ensure it is properly extinguished. The two helicopter crews that were on the scene today, May 24, have been released from duty.
“The dry, warm and windy conditions across the province pose significant risk in our forests, so we must remain vigilant about fire safety,” said Iain Rankin, Minister of Lands and Forestry. “These fires create anxiety within communities and have the potential to cause serious harm to homes, infrastructure and our natural environment. Many agencies are called to respond and I would like to thank everyone who was involved in the effort this weekend.”
The fire started at about 12:30 p.m. Saturday, May 23, on the north side of Highway 107. The fire quickly intensified and covered difficult terrain. Dozens of the province’s highly trained wildfire fighters have been on scene, including up to three helicopter crews at one time and onsite command.
As the wildfire threatened a nearby residential area, Halifax Regional Fire and Emergency ordered the evacuation of about 1,000 residents. That evacuation order has now been lifted.

Public safety will remain the focus of our actions going forward.”
The QEII Health Sciences Centre’s microbiology lab completed 561 Nova Scotia tests on May 22 and is operating 24-hours.
“New case numbers are staying low and we continue to head in the right direction. We can, and should, be proud of how we’ve fared,” said Dr. Robert Strang, chief medical officer of health. “With nicer weather and looser restrictions, I ask all Nova Scotians to continue practising good hygiene, limiting non-essential travel, staying home if you’re feeling unwell, limiting large groups and wearing non-medical masks when and where appropriate.”
There are two licensed long-term care homes and unlicensed seniors' facilities in Nova Scotia with active cases of COVID-19. Northwood in Halifax currently has 12 residents and four staff with active cases. One other facility has one resident with an active case.

","
Premier Stephen McNeil and Dr. Robert Strang, chief medical officer of health, announced today, May 15, the easing of some additional public health restrictions around COVID-19 to support physical and mental well-being.
“It’s been two weeks since we eased some restrictions. What we’ve all been doing is working and I thank all Nova Scotians for continuing to follow public health advice,” said Premier McNeil. “We know people need a break from being shut in. That’s why we’re easing a few more restrictions, while keeping our public health directives in place to fight the virus.”
“We’re continuing to consult and Dr. Strang will present a plan soon that will see Nova Scotia reopen slowly and safely. We need to get this right.”
Nova Scotia is introducing the immediate family bubble, allowing two immediate family households to come together without physical distancing. The families must be mutually exclusive to each other to minimize risk of COVID-19 spread. This change takes effect immediately.
“Connecting with family and friends is important for our mental health. For the last week we’ve seen low case numbers – your actions are helping to flatten the curve,” said Dr. Strang. “This is a first step to allow immediate family to gather in small groups. We’re asking you to take it slow and make informed choices. We want to reconnect families, but we can’t put anyone at risk.”
Families cannot have large family gatherings like birthday celebrations or reunions. When selecting which other family household they’ll connect with, families should to consider three factors – age, occupation and health condition of all household members.
Other restrictions being loosened include:

archery, equestrianism, golf, paddling, sailing/boating and tennis can resume at outdoor facilities as of Saturday, May 16 at 8 a.m. provided social distancing, environmental cleaning and participant hygiene can be maintained; organized coaching or training, competitions, tournaments, regattas or similar events are not permitted
public beaches can also reopen as of May 16 at 8 a.m.; people must stay two metres apart and not gather in groups of more than five 
the provincewide ban on open fires – those within 305 metres (1,000 feet) of woods anywhere in the province including domestic brush burning and beach fires – has been extended to Monday, June 1 at 11:59 p.m. Use of backyard appliances like chimineas and fire pits will be temporarily permitted for households. The ban does not apply to private campgrounds.

A phased plan to further lift public health restrictions is under development. It will be informed by local data and consultation, and guided by a national framework developed by chief medical officers of health. The timing of each phase will be determined by the result of the easing of restrictions.

Now that the Northern Pulp mill has stopped discharging wastewater into Boat Harbour, Nova Scotians expect the remainder of the shutdown of the mill site to be completed in a way that is safe and protects the environment.  
Government owns the pipe that runs from the mill to Boat Harbour and is funding work to decommission the pipe along with other key elements of the environmental clean up.
Government is providing Paper Excellence, the mill’s parent company, a maximum of $10 million, or about half of the cost of shutting down the Boat Harbour effluent treatment facility, as part of the work to hibernate the mill. The funding will pay for the removal of the leachate, decommission the pipes, ditches, and settling and aeration basins on the site.
“We are committed to seeing the clean up is done right, and through the funding agreement, we will hold the company accountable to make sure it does,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “Completing this work is an important part of the process to return Boat Harbour - A’se’k - to its original state for the people of Pictou Landing First Nation and surrounding communities.”
The company’s work plan is in line with orders from the Minister of Environment and needs to be complete before Nova Scotia Lands can remediate Boat Harbour in 2021. 

Quick Facts:

the company has estimated the total shutdown process will cost about $20 million and is expected to be completed by June 30, 2021
the company will provide reports to the province and all costs will be validated by a third party, Grant Thornton

","
High-speed internet is now available in Shelburne County and areas surrounding Canning in Kings County. Other accelerated projects are underway to connect more homes and businesses across the province. 
In March, the province announced an additional $15 million to speed up delivery of high-speed internet for Nova Scotians, where possible, to assist Nova Scotians through the COVID-19 pandemic.
The accelerated plans under the Internet for Nova Scotia initiative includes $2.2 million to bring service six months sooner to 18,000 connections in the Elmsdale, Shelburne and Caledonia, Queens Co. areas, and Cumberland and Colchester counties. As part of the work, Cumberland and Colchester counties will see 19 towers installed within 100 days.
Develop Nova Scotia has led the work with internet service providers to identify opportunities to accelerate projects. More than 260 kilometres of pole lines have been prepared, including trimming vegetation, replacing poles and dealing with water crossings.
Government is also working with providers to ease congestion on existing services to enhance the quality of internet connections. This will help Nova Scotians working differently and from home during COVID-19, while still staying connected to friends and family. 
Government remains committed to cover more than 95 per cent of Nova Scotia homes and businesses – and as close to 100 per cent as possible. With the first round of projects announced, 86 per cent of homes and businesses will have access to the service. 

Quotes:
The importance of high-speed internet for Nova Scotians is pressing. We engaged our internet service provider partners to help solve this critical challenge with ingenuity and urgency and we are seeing results. We will continue to look at projects from every angle to get access to high-quality internet for Nova Scotians as soon as possible.
Jennifer Angel, chief executive officer, Develop Nova Scotia.



Quick Facts:

access to connections will be substantially complete within 12 months for the more than 42,000 homes and businesses announced in the first round of projects
after the first round of projects were announced in February, Develop Nova Scotia issued another request for proposals to capture areas that remain underserved or unserved. These projects are expected to be announced this August
wired technology projects will provide minimum speeds of 50 Mbps to download and 10 Mbps to upload, while wireless technologies will provide minimum speeds of 25 Mbps to download and 5 Mbps to upload. This will allow users to browse email, download music and large files, play online games, and stream high definition video

","
Premier Stephen McNeil and Dr. Robert Strang, chief medical officer of health, provided an update on COVID-19 today, May 8, announcing that the school year for students will end June 5 and licensed daycares will remain closed until at least June 5. They also outlined how government will determine the best way to reopen Nova Scotia.
Teachers will continue to work until the end of June to complete assessments and other tasks.
“I have been hearing amazing reports about how students, parents and teachers have been doing with at-home learning,” said Premier McNeil. “I want to thank the parents and family members who have done their best to support their children’s learning. And I want to thank the education workers who balanced home and work, too. You will have to do this for a little bit longer, but I believe in you and I know you’ve got this.”
The goal is for daycares to reopen by June 8 but the timeline for them to resume operating will be determined in consultation with the sector. Those consultations are underway and will help inform Nova Scotia’s reopening plan.
Nova Scotia’s reopening plan is under development. It will be based on the following:

advice from the Public Health Agency of Canada’s recommendations and guidelines to lift public health measures
status of COVID-19 in the province
consultation with sectors
the ability for people and businesses to continue to follow public health measures

“We must take a slow and methodical approach if we are to safely bring Nova Scotia back to normal,” said Dr. Strang. “No decisions have been made. We are working on a reopening plan that balances public safety with the need to increase economic and social activity. The first phase is still some weeks away.”
Reopening will be done in phases, over time. Each phase could last a minimum of 28 days. Readiness to reopen – and to move onto the next phase – will be assessed weekly.

","
The COVID-19 pandemic has placed extensive demands on front-line health-care workers but the majority did not initially qualify for the federal top-up program. That is why Premier Stephen McNeil lobbied the federal government for flexibility around its program.
Today, May 7, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced changes to the program and now Nova Scotia has signed on to provide a cash bonus for those in the health-care sector supporting the COVID-19 response. 
“Front-line health-care providers are working flat out to keep Nova Scotians safe and healthy during this unprecedented time, sometimes putting their own lives at risk,” said Premier McNeil. “We are pleased to partner with the federal government on a program that recognizes the hard work and unique challenges front-line health-care workers face due to COVID-19.”
The Essential Health Care Workers Program will see health-care workers receive a bonus of up to $2,000 after a four-month period, beginning March 13. It includes eligible employees at the Nova Scotia Health Authority, IWK Health Centre and in long-term care, home care and in-home support and emergency health services. Employees who volunteered to be redeployed to work at a facility experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak will also receive this benefit.
The program is expected to benefit up to 43,000 health-care workers in the province. The Department of Health and Wellness will work with its partners to deliver the money.

Quick Facts:

the province will contribute $13.4 million, with the federal government contribution being $80.5 million

","
Government has taken another significant step toward making the highway between Sutherland’s River, Pictou Co. and Antigonish safer for motorists. 
A consortium with a strong Nova Scotia presence has been awarded the contract to design, build, finance, operate and maintain the 38 kilometre twinned section of Highway 104.
Dexter Nova Alliance, led by local contractors Dexter Construction and Nova Construction, with BBGI as an equity partner, outbid two other companies shortlisted for the $717.9 million project.
Construction will start in June and will be completed no later than the end of 2023.
“This project will save lives,” said Lloyd Hines, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal. “Nova Scotians were clear that they want safe roads now. This will mean a safer, affordable and more efficient highway being opened years earlier than a conventional highway project.”
The Highway 104 project consists of construction of a twinned highway beginning east of New Glasgow, near Exit 27 at Sutherlands River, and running east for a distance of 38 kilometres. 
The project includes 28 kilometres of new two-lane twinned highway and 10 kilometres of new four- lane twinned highway. 
There are two new interchanges and about 24 new bridges.  Dexter Nova Alliance will also upgrade the existing section of highway, which will include repaving the entire section of old road and replace seven existing bridges. 
The federal government is contributing $90 million to the project under the National Trade Corridors Fund.

Quotes:
This is great news. It is a dream come true to see this project now becoming a reality. This will mean a lot to have a safer road from Sutherlands River to Antigonish. I believe many lives will be saved.
Joe MacDonald, chief of Barneys River Volunteer Fire Department.



Quick Facts:

the project will result in a continuous twinned Highway 104 from the New Brunswick border to Antigonish, just west of Exit 31
the proponent will take over ongoing operating and maintenance responsibilities for the twinned portion of the highway and another 25 kilometres of existing highway. That includes snow removal, pothole repair and any repaving that may be required over the 20-year agreement
total cost of the project is $717.9 million, which includes $364.3 million for construction and $196.4 million for ongoing operations and maintenance and a major upgrade of the existing stretch of highway during the 20-year operating period. Insurance, professional fees and financing and other costs make up the remainder of the total
a request for qualification was issued on July 23, 2018 resulting in a shortlist of three bidders. The shortlisted bidders were invited to submit proposals, which were received Nov. 20, 2019. Dexter Nova Alliance was identified as the preferred proponent on Jan. 31, 2020
the request for proposals and a project development report will be released publicly later this spring following a Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act review. The project agreement will also be released

","
Premier Stephen McNeil and Dr. Robert Strang, chief medical officer of health, announced today, May 1, the easing of some public health restrictions around COVID-19.
“We know that getting outdoors for recreation is important for people’s physical and mental health,” said Premier McNeil.” That’s why we are easing some restrictions, while still keeping the majority of our public health directives in place to continue fighting the virus. But I need to be clear: if we see an increase in positive cases or people not continuing to adhere to all the public health measures, the restrictions will return.”
Existing public health directives around social distancing and social gatherings remain in place. People must keep two metres apart and not gather in groups of more than five.
The initial steps are:

provincial and municipal parks can reopen, but playground equipment will continue to be off limits
trails are allowed to open
people are allowed to use and visit community gardens
garden centres, nurseries and similar businesses can open
sportfishing is permitted from shore or boat, but fishing derbies are not allowed
people can attend boating, yacht or sailing clubs for the purpose of preparing boats for use
golf driving ranges can open, including those at golf clubs, but the course must remain closed; golf clubs can perform necessary maintenance and preparations for opening
people can use their cottages. Use is restricted to one household unit at a time, travel must be directly to the cottage and back, and travelling back and forth frequently from cottage and primary residence is discouraged
provincial and private campgrounds remain closed, but they can perform necessary maintenance and preparations for opening. An exception is recreational vehicles parked year-round at private campgrounds, which can be used but must follow the same rules as cottages
drive-in religious services will be allowed, as long as people stay in their cars, they are parked two metres apart and there are no interactions between people in cars or between people in cars and others

These measures take effect immediately.
Details on these adjustments can be found at, https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/
“Our ability to open things up further – for example, beaches, golf courses and campgrounds -- depends on how each of us does with these adjustments, how well Nova Scotians comply and how the pandemic continues to impact people’s health,” Dr. Strang said. “We can’t let our guards down. We need to continue to flatten the curve.”
A phased plan to further lift public health restrictions is under development. It is based on science and the timing of each phase will be determined by the result to the easing of restrictions.
To date, Nova Scotia has 28,883 negative test results, 959 positive COVID-19 test results and 29 deaths. Confirmed cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. Ten individuals are currently in hospital, three of those in ICU. Five-hundred and ninety-two individuals have now recovered and their cases of COVID-19 are considered resolved.

On behalf of the entire province, I extend my sincere and heartfelt condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of Sub.-Lt. Abbigail Cowbrough.

A new operating loan program is being introduced to help municipalities with financial losses due to COVID-19. 
The $380 million loan program, which was developed in collaboration with the Nova Scotia Federation of Municipalities and the Association of Municipal Administrators, will be available through the Municipal Finance Corporation.
“During this unprecedented time, municipalities need support to address the financial issues they are facing as a result of lost revenue,” said Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Chuck Porter. “This program will help to bridge that gap so they can continue to deliver programs and services to Nova Scotians.”
Municipalities interested in accessing a loan will first need to determine their revenue shortfall. Municipal councils will be required to pass a resolution and submit it to the Department of Municipal Affairs and Housing. The department will analyze requests and if approved will forward the approval to the Nova Scotia Municipal Finance Corporation. Upon approval by the corporation’s board of directors it will administer a loan agreement.

Quotes:
Nova Scotia municipalities are struggling right now as a result of fallout from COVID-19 with lost revenue, coupled with the inability to run a deficit. This funding option will allow municipalities to continue to provide vital services to our businesses and residents. This is a good first step as municipalities still face much uncertainty due to the ongoing financial uncertainty related to the pandemic.
Pam Mood, president, Nova Scotia Federation of Municipalities



Quick Facts:

municipalities will have six months to begin repayment and three years to fully repay the loan  
funds will be disbursed to municipalities by the Nova Scotia Municipal Finance Corporation within 24 hours of the agreement being signed

","
Nova Scotia small businesses negatively impacted by COVID-19 need access to financial support.
That is why the province announced today, April 24, the COVID-19 Small Business Credit and Support Program as a temporary stream for access to credit, cash grants and support delivered through participating credit unions. The program will be available starting Wednesday, April 29.  
“Many small businesses don’t qualify for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and need our help,” said Business Minister Geoff MacLellan. “We’re focused on offering programs that complement federal programming and bridge gaps. This new stream provides small businesses much needed access to cash and other business supports to help them now and after the pandemic.”
To be eligible, small businesses must have a payroll less than $20,000 in the previous fiscal year and have experienced a decline in revenue from sales of at least 15 per cent in March or at least 30 per cent in April, May or June.
As part of the package of supports for small businesses, the province is working with post-secondary education partners to deliver education, training and guidance to small businesses. A centralized hub hosted by the Nova Scotia Community College will connect businesses to support programs available from post-secondary institutions and other regional organizations. 
As well, Nova Scotia is partnering with the federal government to provide commercial rent relief for small businesses that have temporarily ceased operations or experienced a 70 per cent revenue decline due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The province is contributing $9 million to the program.

Quick Facts:

the program is 100 per cent guaranteed by the province. Maximum loan amount is $25,000 
upon approval, businesses will receive a grant up to $1,500, as well as a COVID-19 Business Continuity Voucher of up to $1,500, to help hire a private consultant for advice and support 
an additional $20 million has been made available through the Small Business Loan Guarantee Program that will help fund the new temporary COVID-19 response. The grant has a cap of $3 million
funding for the grant will come from the existing contribution agreement between the province and Dalhousie University
the Business Continuity Voucher Program will be administered by Nova Scotia Business Inc. (NSBI). The grant will be delivered through the Nova Scotia Co-operative Council. Applicants will be referred to the NSBI regional business development advisor to identify other COVID-19 related programs they might be eligible for
the package will be available until June 30
this is in addition to other supports previously announced, including the Small Business Impact Grant, Rent Deferral Guarantee Program, Worker Emergency Bridge Fund, deferring fees, loan and interest payments

","
Nova Scotia’s most vulnerable families, seniors and youth will receive additional support for food, shelter, basic necessities and staying connected during the province’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Nova Scotia Power, EfficiencyOne and the province are redirecting $3 million from the HomeWarming program to fund organizations that deliver prepared meals, operate soup kitchens, help the homeless and provide other services. Nova Scotia Power has contributed $1 million, while EfficiencyOne is providing $2 million of provincial funding for the program.
“Nova Scotians are doing a tremendous job of stepping up to support and care for their neighbours during this difficult time, and we want to make sure no one is left behind,” said Energy and Mines Minister Derek Mombourquette. “We know there are gaps and challenges including increased demand at a time when we are seeing a shortage of staff and volunteers. That’s why we are providing more support for this vital work.”
HomeWarming normally provides free home energy assessments and upgrades for low-income Nova Scotians. COVID-19 restrictions mean this work won't be happening for the time being. Approved projects will go ahead once the restrictions are lifted and applications are still being processed and accepted.
“Now is not the time to unnecessarily have workers coming into your home, it is a time to stay home and social distance,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health. “The fact that this funding can be repurposed to help those in need tells us that a lot of people understand they need to follow public health direction to slow the spread of the virus and saves lives.”

Quotes:
Supporting the communities we serve and assisting those most in need has never been more important. I am so pleased that together, our teams at Nova Scotia Power, EfficiencyOne and the Nova Scotia Government have been able to find ways to provide additional support to Nova Scotians.
Wayne O’Connor, president and CEO, Nova Scotia Power

“We know these are uncertain times for so many Nova Scotians and repurposing HomeWarming funds in this way will allow us to continue to help those who are most in need.

Stephen MacDonald, CEO, EfficiencyOne


United Ways are nimble, knowledgeable about local needs and ready to ensure this investment will have meaningful and timely impact on the lives of those who need support most. Through our Atlantic Compassion Fund, we have already provided funding to 80 frontline programs across Nova Scotia that are helping people in need of safe shelter, food, connection or mental health care to make it through this crisis. The funding announced today will enable us to do more to meet our communities’ needs and help the most vulnerable Nova Scotians make it through this.
Sara Napier, president and CEO, United Way Halifax

","
Government released COVID-19 projections today, April 14, that show how COVID-19 could progress through the province through to June 30 if people continue to follow public health orders to stay home, social distance, limit essential gatherings to no more than five people and practise good hygiene.
Today, Nova Scotia reported 517 positive cases of COVID-19. According to the projections, if Nova Scotia had not put strong public health measures in place, the province could have instead had 943 cases as of today. They also show that if Nova Scotians continue to follow public health orders, there could be 1,453 cases by June 30, but with poor compliance, cases could grow to 6,269 over that time period. It is important to note the numbers are only modelling estimates.
The projections show a flattened peak in total cases in May that continues into June if public health measures continue. 
“The public health directives we’ve put in place are working,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “These projections clearly show complying with social distancing and other measures can save lives. But we have to stay vigilant. The coming weeks are crucial, and we must continue to follow the protocols.”
Testing has proven to be effective. The QEII Health Sciences Centre's microbiology lab is operating 24-hours. Nova Scotia is second in Canada in the number of people tested per million.
Other highlights of the projections include:

without public health measures, the model projects hospitalizations of COVID-19 cases would peak at about 85 in May then slowly begin to decline. With strongly sticking to public health orders there would be a peak of about 35 in May and then decline throughout June
currently, the most cases in the province are in the Dartmouth/southeastern community health network, almost double of nearby Halifax

The pandemic modelling was developed by staff from the Department of Health and Wellness, Nova Scotia Health Authority and IWK Health Centre.  Details can be found here, https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/modelling/

","
Front-line workers in every public and private long-term care home, residential care facility and home-care agency across the province will now be expected to wear masks to help reduce the spread of COVID-19. Distribution to workers began over the weekend. 
Effective Tuesday, April 14, masks will be distributed to all front-line workers in residential care and continuing care facilities and to home-care employees. 
“Masks are in high demand around the world and we wanted to be sure we had the supply before we started to distribute,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “I know front-line staff are concerned and I’m sorry if we contributed to that. But I can tell you that making sure we have adequate supplies is a full provincial effort – with government and the private sector working together to protect front-line workers who are working to protect Nova Scotians every day.”
Details include:

the protocol applies to nursing homes and residential care facilities licensed by the Department of Health and Wellness and to private, unlicensed assisted-living facilities, retirement homes, memory-care homes and enriched-care homes 
home-care workers must also wear a mask under the protocol
the protocol also applies to direct-care staff in residential facilities funded by the Disability Support Program and licensed by the Minister of Community Services under the Homes for Special Care Act: adult residential centres, regional rehabilitation centres, residential care facilities, small option homes, developmental residences and group homes
all facilities must continue to get masks through existing supply chains. Government will only provide masks to these facilities on an emergency basis 
government is partnering with the Health Association of Nova Scotia to distribute the masks to all facilities

“We’re now seeing increased community spread and we know from other jurisdictions that this means an increase in cases in long-term care facilities,” said Dr. Robert Strang chief medical officer of health. “It’s almost impossible for people working in long-term care facilities to practise physical distancing given they are helping people who need hands-on care. Wearing a surgical mask is another measure we can use to prevent further spread of infection and protect healthcare workers and those most at risk of becoming severely ill.” 
Nova Scotia has recorded three deaths related to COVID-19 and a total of 474 positive test results. Confirmed cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. Nine individuals are currently in hospital, four of those in ICU. One hundred and one individuals have now recovered and their cases of COVID-19 are considered resolved.

","
The Nova Scotia Securities Commission has launched a new webpage and online video to provide COVID-19 investing information to the public. 
The new webpage, which can be found at https://nssc.novascotia.ca/covid19 , compiles all news releases, notices and blanket orders issued to provide relief for a number of individuals or applicants from a regulatory requirement about COVID-19 by the commission, the Canadian Securities Administrators and the North American Securities Administrators Association. 
The webpage also houses a new video highlighting the increased prevalence of COVID-19 related investment fraud. While scammers find many angles to perpetrate frauds in uncertain times, the video focuses on specific frauds that securities regulators are warning investors about. They are pump and dump scams, fake emails, texts and phone calls and fake securities trader jobs.
The commission’s COVID-19 investing webpage also has information on stock market volatility and working with an adviser to help investors make informed investment decisions.

Quotes:
The commission wants to make it as easy as possible for investors, registrants, issuers and other industry members to find COVID-19 investing information in one place. Unfortunately, during uncertain times like the COVID-19 pandemic, fraudsters try to take advantage of investors’ fears to steal their money. We are reminding investors to be vigilant and to heavily scrutinize any investment opportunities that involve COVID-19.

Halifax and Associates is soliciting investments over the phone and through its website, halifaxandassociates.com . Investors are required to provide specific personal information after opening an account.
The commission urges Nova Scotians to exercise extreme caution when dealing with anyone that is not registered in Nova Scotia. If you have had contact with Halifax and Associates, please contact the commission. Nova Scotians can contact the commission to report scams or what is believed to be suspicious behavior from anyone offering investment opportunities. 

Quotes:
The internet can be a dangerous place to shop for investments. Always take the time to check registration and understand the risks and costs associated with your investments. Further, never give out personal information without verification of the legitimacy of operations. This is particularly important where the entity or individual is unknown. Becoming an informed investor is your best protection from falling victim to scams.
Stephanie Atkinson, acting director of enforcement, Nova Scotia Securities Commission

","
More options for testing of COVID-19 were announced today, April 5, to help identify spread within Nova Scotia communities. 
The province will work with the Nova Scotia Health Authority (NSHA) and Emergency Health Services (EHS) on the following options: temporary primary assessment centres, EHS assessment units, a mobile assessment centre and expanded lab testing.
“This virus is in our communities, it’s dangerous and it’s up to all of us to slow it down,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “Expanding testing will help us identify and respond more quickly to spread in communities but the best defence continues to be following the public health orders. People need to stay home.”
More detail on the four expanded testing options includes:

temporary primary assessment centres: will be established in communities with more known cases. The first temporary assessment centre opened today, April 5, in Elmsdale. Like the other assessment centres, people must be referred by 811. Those directed to an assessment centre will have a physical assessment onsite and swabbed if appropriate
mobile assessment centre: NSHA is working on a mobile assessment centre. Once operational, the centre could be brought into communities temporarily to do assessment and testing
EHS assessment units: there are now two mobile units, one in the Halifax Regional Municipality and one for the most populated areas of Cape Breton Regional Municipality, staffed by paramedics trained to do at-home testing. They will be used for people who have mobility issues and cannot get to an assessment centre or in situations where a cluster of testing needs to be done, for example at a long-term care home. When someone is referred to an assessment centre via 811, it will be determined whether an EHS assessment unit should be used
expanded lab capacity: to accommodate the increase in testing, starting April 6, the QEII Health Sciences Centre Microbiology Lab will move to full 24-hour operations. The lab will be capable of processing over 1,000 tests per day

“Expanding our testing options means we have the ability to act quickly if we’re seeing clusters of disease in communities or locations and ensures we’re able to accommodate vulnerable Nova Scotians and those living in harder-to-reach communities,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health. “But testing is only half the battle. We know the disease is in our communities and that’s why it’s more important than ever before to keep your physical distance and only gather in groups of no more than five if it’s absolutely essential to reduce the spread of this virus.”
Today Nova Scotia announced 26 new cases of COVID-19 for a total of 262 positive cases to date. Nova Scotia has 9,510 negative test results.

A map and graphic presentation of the case data is available at https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/data .
Public health is working to identify and test people who may have come in close contact with the confirmed cases. Those individuals who have been confirmed are being directed to self-isolate at home, away from the public, for 14 days.
Anyone who has travelled outside Nova Scotia must self-isolate for 14 days. As always, any Nova Scotian who develops symptoms of acute respiratory illness should limit their contact with others until they feel better. If they are concerned about COVID-19 they can go to https://811.novascotia.ca/ and use the online assessment tool. Anyone referred to an assessment site by 811 will be tested. 
It is now more important than ever for Nova Scotians to strictly adhere to the public health orders and directives - practise good hygiene, maintain a physical distance of two metres or six feet from others, limit essential gatherings to no more than five people and stay at home as much as possible.

Premier Stephen McNeil and Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health, gave an update today, April 2, on efforts to help Nova Scotians dealing with COVID-19.
“Our small businesses and those who are self-employed have always been at the heart of our economy but now that COVID-19 is here, layoffs and closures have slowed the pace of our economy,” said Premier McNeil. “Our economic support plan has added two new programs that will put more than $40 million in the pockets of those out of work and small businesses affected by COVID-19. The goal is to begin processing applications early next week – to get cash out the door as quickly as possible.”
New measures announced today:

a $20 million Worker Emergency Bridge Fund to help the self-employed and those laid-off workers who do not qualify for Employment Insurance. Government will provide a one-time, $1,000 payment, to bridge the gap between layoffs and closures and the federal government’s Canada Emergency Response Benefit
$20 million to fund a new program -- the Small Business Impact Grant. Eligible small businesses and social enterprises will receive a grant of 15 per cent of their revenue from sales -- either from April 2019 or February 2020, up to a maximum of $5,000. This flexible, one-time, upfront grant can be used for any purpose necessary 

Today’s announcements, totalling $40 million, will come out of a new $50 million fund that will be administered by Dalhousie University in Halifax.
Eligibility for the programs is not affected by a person or business being enrolled in another provincial program or the federal initiatives. 
An announcement on when the programs are ready for applications will come early next week.
Other measures announced today include:

the current state of emergency is extended until noon, April 19
a new extended hours phone line has been set up for people wanting information on income assistance eligibility from the Department of Community Services. Call toll-free 1-833-722-1417 from Monday to Friday 4:30 p.m. to 7 p.m., Saturday, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., and Sunday, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. During regular business hours, Monday to Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. call the regular toll-free line at 1-877-424-1177.

To date, Nova Scotia has 7,446 negative test results and 193 confirmed cases. Those cases range in age from under 10 to over 80. A map and graphic presentation of the case data is now available at https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/data .
“As I have said before, we have cases in all parts of the province,” said Dr. Strang. “So it is imperative that all Nova Scotians follow the public health directives and orders – practise good hygiene, keep a distance of two metres or six feet away from others, limit essential gatherings to five or fewer people, and self-isolate for 14 days after travel or if you have come in contact with a known case.”

No student will be penalized because of COVID-19. Students and families will have access to e-learning and at-home learning materials will be provided for students without internet access. Families who feel at-home learning may be a burden are asked to speak to their child’s teacher.
“These are extraordinary times and that requires innovation and co-operation.” said Premier McNeil. “We are focused on math and literacy, we are making sure Grade 12s who were on track to graduate will graduate, but we also want to make sure families have what they need to support learning at home.”
Students who were on track to graduate will graduate and Grade 12 students who need a preliminary paper-based transcript for bursaries, scholarships or university entrance will receive one by contacting their Regional Centre for Education or Conseil scolaire acadien provincial (CSAP). Students who were on track to proceed to their next grade will move to their next grade on time. Students will receive end of year report cards. 
During the ongoing closure of public schools:

all Grade primary to 9 students will receive at-home learning packages distributed bi-weekly by SaltWire Network
students in grades 10 to 12 who require at-home learning packages will work with their individual teachers to address their specific needs; additional information on distribution will be forwarded to schools
learning will be assignment and project focused
a dedicated learning website for families is available at https://curriculum.novascotia.ca/learning-home
all school trips planned for May and June are cancelled
Provincial Assessments, Nova Scotia Exams and final exams in all courses are cancelled
Diplôme d'Études en Langue Française (DELF) and International Baccalaureate (IB) exams are cancelled
students in grades 9 to 12 will receive additional access to the Homework Hub, a free online resource and tutoring for math
teachers will connect directly with students and families to help support learning

Students and families will continue to have access to student support services. SchoolsPlus facilitators and community outreach workers continue to support students and families via phone, email and text. The facilitators are also available to accept new referrals to support students and families not currently using SchoolsPlus. Mental health clinicians continue to work with students and their families by phone, secure video conferencing or in person, where possible. For those who require additional supports, ask your teacher or principal and they will connect you to the support you need.
To better support students and adults with special needs, the province is modifying existing policies and agreements to allow teaching assistants and child and youth care support workers to provide paid respite care in the community.
Next year, teachers will help students prepare for their new grade and conduct additional review.
“Nova Scotia’s Learning Continuity Plan is meant to be flexible and provide the most support possible to students in these challenging times.,” said Zach Churchill, Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development. “Co-operation is critical in making this work and I want to thank teachers, principals, unions and administrators for keeping a shared focus on the health and education of our students.”
Additionally, the province has created an online tool to help businesses and non-profits clarify if they may remain open and how they can comply with public health orders and workplace safety requirements. This tool is available at https://covid19-employer-assessment.novascotia.ca/en .
Five new cases were identified Sunday, March 29. Most are connected to travel or a known case. To date, Nova Scotia has 5,054 negative test results and 127 confirmed cases.
It is imperative that anyone who has travelled outside Nova Scotia self-isolate for 14 days and for everyone to adhere to the five-person social gathering limit. As always, any Nova Scotian who develops symptoms of acute respiratory illness should limit their contact with others until they feel better. If they are concerned about COVID-19 they can go to https://811.novascotia.ca/ and use the online assessment tool. Anyone referred to an assessment site by 811 will be tested.

As of today, March 30, Nova Scotia has 127 confirmed cases of COVID-19. 
Five new cases were identified yesterday, after more than 600 tests were processed. While most cases to date have been connected to travel or a known case, public health has now reached a point with one of its current investigations where no such links can be made and must conclude that this case is the result of transmission within the community. 
While this is not unexpected, it is now more important than ever for Nova Scotians to strictly adhere to the public health orders and directives – practise good hygiene, maintain a physical distance of two metres or six feet from others, limit essential gatherings to no more than five people and stay at home as much as possible. 
The individuals affected range in age from under ten to mid-70's. Four individuals are currently in hospital. Ten individuals have now recovered and their cases of COVID-19 are considered resolved. Cases have been identified in all parts of the province. 
Public health is working to identify people who may have come in close contact with the confirmed cases. Those individuals who have been confirmed are being directed to self-isolate at home, away from the public, for 14 days.
Anyone who has travelled outside Nova Scotia must self-isolate for 14 days. As always, any Nova Scotian who develops symptoms of acute respiratory illness should limit their contact with others until they feel better.

I want to thank Deputy Hudson very much for her public service. Her focus on access to justice, particularly for those who struggle most and her leadership within the department and across the justice system is to be celebrated.”
The Office of Social Innovation and Integrative Approaches will work across government, with strong links to African Nova Scotian Affairs, Aboriginal Affairs, Status of Women and the Department of Community Service.

The 12 individuals affected range in age from under 10 to mid-70s. Three individuals are currently in hospital. Seven individuals have recovered and their cases of COVID-19 are considered resolved. Cases have been identified in all parts of the province.
A non-resident at the Magnolia residential care home in Enfield has tested positive. Residents, their families and staff at the facility have been notified.

There are no cases of COVID-19 among residents of long-term care facilities in Nova Scotia.
“I am still hearing stories of people driving to our parks and beaches – even though they are closed. Grocery stores packed, groups out playing sports,” said Premier McNeil. “These people are the reckless few and not only are Dr. Strang and I upset with them, their fellow Nova Scotians are upset with them. To those reckless few: if you won’t do your part to keep physical distance to help flatten the curve, police will do it for you.”
To date, Nova Scotia has 4,731 negative test results and 122 confirmed cases.

“The recent cases in the homes for seniors is a strong reminder that our older population is more vulnerable: They need our help and they deserve our vigilance,” said Dr. Strang, Nova Scotia’s medical officer of health. “Everyone has to take great care if they know they will be in contact with our vulnerable people, like our seniors and those with autoimmune issues. If you are feeling unwell at all, it is very important that you stay home and maintain social distancing.”

We will continue to be diligent through these uncertain times.”

Michelle Thompson, CEO, R.K. MacDonald Nursing Home

While this has been an unsettling day for the residents, families and team members at Lewis Hall, we have been preparing our teams for this circumstance for some time. We took early and concrete steps to implement our pandemic plan, including strict employee screening measures, visitor restrictions, and reinforcing our infection prevention and control practices. Today, we moved quickly in collaboration with Public Health to notify residents, families and team members, and have taken additional appropriate precautions when interacting with residents.

","
Premier Stephen McNeil and Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health, gave an update today, March 27, on efforts to help Nova Scotians dealing with COVID-19.
“It is important that we all do our part to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 by following the rules. Get groceries or go to the pharmacy but not in groups. Walk to exercise, not to socialize and as much as you can, stay at home but stay in touch with others,” said Premier McNeil. “We are also focused today on supporting our small businesses and our most vulnerable citizens and the measures we are taking today will not be the last.”
Measures announced today:

government is encouraging retail and commercial landlords to defer lease payments for the next three months for businesses that had to close directly due to the public health order. Landlords who participate by granting such businesses a three month deferral and register by April 3 will be able to claim losses of up to $5,000 per month, if the renting business does not continue operating. Landlords are not permitted to change locks or seize property of businesses who cannot pay rent, if the business closed directly because of COVID-19 public health orders
Department of Health and Wellness will distribute up to 800 iPads across the province to long-term care homes so residents can connect with family and friends; the tablets will begin arriving at facilities in April.
restaurants will be allowed to include alcohol purchases with takeout and delivery orders as long as the alcohol cost is not more than three times the value of food ordered, effective March 30.
an amendment to Dr. Strang’s health protection order allows veterinarians to provide virtual care, prescription refills and in-patient urgent or emergencies services.

Measures announced to help vulnerable Nova Scotians by the Department of Community Services are:

partnering with Telus to provide 100 phones and calling plans to most-vulnerable clients who have no other means of communication and who may be self-isolated and alone at a cost of $50,000 for the phones and $5,000 per month for the calling plans 
investing $200,000 to support transition houses as well as other organizations that serve vulnerable women and children
investing $55,000 to support 12 smaller community food banks
extending the hours of its toll-free line for income assistance supports soon, including weekends 

“I’ve been encouraged by the way most Nova Scotians have responded – with caring, compassion, community-building and common sense,” said Dr. Strang. “I have also been troubled by reports of people harassing those who test positive. This is when people need the love and support of their community and neighbours the most. So, I am asking you to be kind. Be caring. Be considerate. Be there. Be a friend.”
Seventeen new cases were identified yesterday. Most are connected to travel or a known case. To date, Nova Scotia has 3,649 negative test results and 90 confirmed cases.
It is imperative that anyone who has travelled outside Nova Scotia self-isolate for 14 days and for everyone to adhere to the five-person social gathering limit.

","
Premier Stephen McNeil, Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health, Dr. Brendan Carr, president and CEO of Nova Scotia Health Authority (NSHA) and Dr. Krista Jangaard, president and CEO of IWK Health Centre gave an update today, March 26, on the health system and efforts to help Nova Scotians dealing with COVID-19.
“Our health-care system is being examined from top to bottom to ensure we are ready for COVID-19,” said Premier McNeil. “Our hospital administrators, our doctors and nurses, cleaning staff – everyone is focused on containing the spread. But none of this matters if you don’t stay at home and avoid social gatherings.”
Dr. Strang said testing to confirm COVID-19 is being expanded to include:

anyone referred by 811 to an assessment centre
all close contacts of people who test positive
people in hospital that meet the criteria for testing

An alternate phone line has been set up to ensure health-care workers are virus-free, able to safely provide care and not burden the 811 system. The service deals with NSHA and IWK staff, home-care and long-term care providers, pharmacists and health providers in First Nations communities.
“Over the next two weeks as travellers come home, we need to control and limit spread of this virus,” said Dr. Strang. “We can do this by strictly following public health measures – physical distancing and self-isolation.”
Other measures announced today include:

reservations for the 2020 camping season are on hold; an announcement will made when they are available
open fires are banned for any purpose in woods or within 305 metres of woods in any part of the province and will be in effect until May 15 (the public can report wildfires by calling 911 in an emergency or by calling 1-800-565-2224)

Quotes:
I want to reassure IWK patients and families across Nova Scotia and those living in P.E.I., New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador that we are still here for you. Your urgent care needs will continue to be met and you will be permitted to cross the border for urgent and specialized appointments.
Dr. Krista Jangaard, president and CEO, IWK Health Centre

While most people are being told not to go to work, our staff and physicians are showing up every day to ensure Nova Scotians get the care they need. As we continue to plan, prepare and respond to COVID-19, we appreciate your patience, support and co-operation with the important public health measures that are in place. This will help reduce the impact the pandemic will have on Nova Scotians and our health system. It is a difficult time for everyone, but if we all do our part, we will reduce the spread of the virus and life will return to normal sooner.
Dr. Brendan Carr, president and CEO, Nova Scotia Health Authority

As of today, March 26, Nova Scotia has 73 confirmed cases of COVID-19. 
Five new cases were identified Wednesday, March 25. Most are travel-related or connected to earlier cases. One of the new cases cannot currently be linked to travel or an earlier case. The investigation to determine the source of the exposure and whether any others may have been exposed is ongoing. At this point, public health cannot confirm that this case is linked to community spread. 
That is why it is imperative that anyone who has travelled outside Nova Scotia to self-isolate for 14 days and for everyone to adhere to the five-person social gathering limit.
The 73 individuals affected range in age from under ten to mid-70's. Two individuals are currently in hospital. Two individuals have recovered and their cases of COVID-19 are considered resolved. Cases have been identified in all parts of the province. 
Public health is working to identify people who may have come in close contact with the confirmed cases. Those individuals who have been confirmed are being directed to self-isolate at home, away from the public, for 14 days. 
To date, Nova Scotia has 3,201 negative test results and 73 confirmed cases. 
If you have travelled outside of Nova Scotia or been in close contact with someone who has travelled and are experiencing fever or new cough you should complete the online questionnaire before calling 811. The online questionnaire can be found at: https://811.novascotia.ca/

","
Premier Stephen McNeil and Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health, announced further measures today, March 24, to strengthen the health system and help Nova Scotians dealing with COVID-19.
“Keeping Nova Scotians safe and healthy is our number one job. Everything we are doing, we are doing to keep you safe,” said Premier McNeil. “We all need to keep working together, support one another and make sure we are following the public health advice. That is the only way we can control the spread of this virus.”
Measures announced today include:

increased testing for COVID-19 -- public health officials have begun testing all close contacts of positive cases
lab capacity is doubling to accommodate increased testing 
expanding virtual care for physicians, nurse practitioners and others so they can offer appointments to patients through telephone or video, minimizing the need to leave the house; more than 80 providers have signed up for video so far
811 has increased staff and technology and is now answering 50 per cent more calls; on April 3, 811 will again double its capacity
enhanced infection control measures at hospitals to protect health-care workers and the public include reassigning and adding new staff to increase the frequency of cleaning and disinfection; focusing on high-risk areas and high-traffic areas and high-touch surfaces; using stronger cleaning products
regulated health professions can only stay open for emergency or urgent cases or to provide virtual care (excluding doctors, pharmacists, nurse practitioners, nurses and paramedics) as long as they can meet social distancing requirements in their waiting room or other non-clinical areas and follow the cleaning protocol
non-regulated health professions (such as naturopaths) must close. One exception is podiatrists who must follow the directive related to regulated health professions
Access Centres and Registry of Motor Vehicle Offices will start to resume operations in a scaled back, limited contact business model. Staff working out of Access Centres and Registry of Motor Vehicle offices in Amherst, Bridgewater, Dartmouth, Kentville, Stellarton, Sydney and Yarmouth will be available to help people with urgent matters by calling 1-800-670-4357. In addition, government has extended deadlines for more vehicle permits, registrations and renewals until Aug.31. Drop-off boxes for applicable services will also be available at Access Centres in Amherst, Bridgewater, Dartmouth, Kentville, Stellarton, Sydney and Yarmouth. Many of the services are also available online.

Essential service sectors in Nova Scotia, which are exempt from the five-person-or-fewer gathering rules, have been clarified and are:

health
food, agri-food and fisheries
transportation, including trucking, rail and transit
construction and manufacturing
IT, telecommunications and critical infrastructure
public services, such as police, fire and ambulances

Individual business in these sectors must still maintain social distancing and other public health protocols.
“We need your help to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” said Dr. Strang. “It is critically important to wash your hands, practise social distancing and self-isolate if you need to. It’s also important to be truthful in your interactions with health-care workers and don’t call 911 unless you have an emergency. Working together we can protect our communities and our most vulnerable citizens.”
Ten new cases were identified Monday, March 23. The cases are travel-related or connected to earlier reported cases. Several of the new cases are connected to groups or families who have returned to Nova Scotia following travel outside of Canada. None of these cases are from spread within the community.
The 51 individuals affected range in age from under 10 to mid-70s. Cases have been identified in all parts of the province. One individual remains in hospital. One individual has recovered and their case of COVID-19 is considered resolved.
Public health has been in contact with these individuals and is working to identify others who may have come in close contact with them. Those individuals are also being directed to self-isolate at home, away from the public, for 14 days. 
To date, Nova Scotia has 2,474 negative test results and 51 confirmed cases.

","
Today, March 22, Nova Scotia declared a provincial state of emergency to help contain the spread of COVID-19. Nova Scotians should not leave the province and only leave home for essential items and services.
A state of emergency gives government broad powers to do whatever is necessary for the safety and protection of Nova Scotians. 
“These decisions were not made lightly and should signal to Nova Scotians the seriousness of what’s before us,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “These orders may seem harsh but they are absolutely necessary. We all have a moral and legal obligation to obey if we want to bring the spread of COVID-19 under control.”  
Under the state of emergency:

Nova Scotia borders will tighten to travellers and all entry points (land, sea, air) will be closely managed starting Monday, March 23, at 6 a.m., Nova Scotians should only leave if essential. Anyone entering the province will be stopped, questioned and told to self-isolate for 14 days. Exemptions for cross-border travel include healthy workers in trades and transportations sectors who move goods and people (e.g. truck drivers); healthy people going to work (e.g. health-care workers); and people travelling into the province for essential health services (e.g. chemotherapy treatment)
effective immediately, provincial parks, beaches and tourist attractions are closed. Provincial trails will remain open for exercise. Gathering limits and social distancing guidelines must be followed
police will be authorized to enforce orders under the Health Protection Act. If Nova Scotians and businesses do not practice social distancing and self-isolation, they will face fines of $1,000 for individuals and $7,500 for businesses. Multiple fines can be given each day an individual or business fails to comply. Police can also enforce offences under the Emergency Management Act. For example, fines for charging higher than fair market prices for goods and services
there are several groups who are essential and exempt from gathering limits. They include but are not limited to grocery stores, gas stations and pharmacies. If possible, one person per family should be designated to do these tasks. Other groups include construction sites, health-care services, community services (e.g. child protection), criminal justice services and law enforcement

New orders in effect under the Health Protection Act include:

effective immediately, social gatherings of more than five people are prohibited
any workplace or business that is not deemed essential can remain open as long as a two-metre or six-foot distance can be maintained. Workspaces must also be cleaned and disinfected at a minimum of twice daily or as required and employees follow proper hygiene
dentists can no longer practice dentistry in their offices unless they deem it necessary to perform an emergency dental procedure in the best interest of the patient’s health (in effect March 21)

“This is a significant adjustment for all of us and people are understandably anxious about the changes in our daily lives,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health. “Nova Scotians must follow public health direction - practice good hygiene, keep a social distance of six feet and self-isolate for 14 days if you have travelled outside the province or are feeling unwell. It’s up to all of us.” 
Seven new cases were identified on Saturday, March 21. All are travel-related or connected to an earlier case. To date, Nova Scotia has 28 positive test results and 2088 negative cases. The 28 individuals affected range in age from late-teens to mid-70’s. Two cases are hospitalized. 
The QEII Health Sciences Centre’s Microbiology Lab is now certified to report positive and negative tests for COVID-19. Tests no longer have to be sent to the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg.

","
As of today, March 21, Nova Scotia has nine confirmed cases and 12 presumptive cases of COVID-19, for a total of 21.
Six new cases were identified Friday, March 20. All are travel-related. The original hospitalized case has been released and is recovering at home. One of the other confirmed cases is hospitalized. 
The cases are located across the province. The 21 individuals affected range in age from late-teens to mid-70’s.
Public health has been in contact with these individuals and are working to identify others who may have come in close contact with them. Those individuals are also being directed to self-isolate at home, away from the public, for 14 days. 
“This is an unprecedented time for all of us and I want to thank Nova Scotians for their cooperation given the disruption to all of our daily lives,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “If we follow public health advice, support our neighbors, friends and family, and do our part, we will slow the spread of this virus in our province.”
The province is testing daily, working with partners at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. To date, Nova Scotia has 1,826 negative test results, 12 presumptive positive cases and nine confirmed cases. 
“This is just the beginning for Nova Scotia and we all need to stay vigilant, practise good hygiene and social distancing, and self-isolate for 14 days if you have travelled outside Canada or are feeling unwell,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health. “The prevention measures we’ve put in place can work and there is still time for our actions to influence the impact that COVID-19 has on Nova Scotia.”
As of today, dentists can no longer practice dentistry in their offices unless they deem it necessary to perform an emergency dental procedure in the best interest of the patient’s health. This is an order under the Health Protection Act. 
In addition to prevention measures put in place by government and the chief medical officer of health, the Nova Scotia Health Authority and the IWK Health Centre have taken steps to ensure the health system is ready to respond to COVID-19, including:

making changes to non-essential services so staff are available to focus on COVID-19 and essential services, such as cancer care
providing options for virtual care and telehealth care so doctors and other health-care providers can reduce face-to-face visits but also help patients regardless of where they are
restricting visitors to protect the vulnerable patients in our hospitals
providing support to public health as they give advice on measures to slow down the spread of the virus
ensuring facilities are well-prepared to meet the health-care needs of Nova Scotians during a pandemic
opening new assessment centres to meet the need for assessments (there are now 14 centres around the province)

Anyone who has travelled outside of Canada must self-isolate for 14 days when they return to Nova Scotia. If you have been in close contact with someone who has travelled and are experiencing fever (above 38 C) and/or new cough you should complete the online questionnaire before calling 811.

Our teams are working very hard to maintain essential services and deliver safe and supportive care in a challenging environment. The difficult decisions that we’ve made to reduce services and limit access to our facilities will help ensure we can continue to provide the most urgently needed care and create capacity in the system for Nova Scotians needing care related to COVID-19, while protecting the health and wellness of our staff and physicians.
Dr. Brendan Carr, president and CEO, Nova Scotia Health Authority

We had to reduce the number of people who enter the health centre, which was a difficult decision for us to make as we pride ourselves on being patient and family centred. This decision and others are important as we decrease foot traffic and support social distancing in facilities, like the IWK, to keep patients, their families and our staff safe.

","
The fishing and aquaculture industries are a vital part of the province’s economy and an important source of food.
Fisheries and Aquaculture Minister Keith Colwell is meeting regularly with the ministers responsible for fisheries and aquaculture in the other Atlantic provinces and Quebec to discuss ways to support the seafood industry during the COVID-19 crisis. 
The province announced one measure in support of Nova Scotia’s fishery sector today, March 20, that it is deferring payments and interest for government lending programs until June 30. This includes loans under the Fisheries and Aquaculture Loan Board.
The five provincial ministers have begun weekly discussions to share ideas and discuss developments and options. Today, the ministers also had a joint call with federal Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Bernadette Jordan.
“Nova Scotia’s ongoing collaboration with Minister Jordan and the federal government, and our strong working relationship with the other Atlantic provinces and Quebec benefit the commercial fishery in our region. I look forward to our continued co-operation in the future as we gather information from our local industry and hear their concerns during this difficult time coping with COVID-19. By communicating and working closely together and with the federal department, we can better help our fishing industries meet today’s challenges, “said Mr. Colwell.
In their call this week, the ministers discussed the importance of the fishing and aquaculture sector to their individual provinces, the importance of food supply, and their desire to work together with their respective industries to minimize the impact of COVID-19 as much as possible, to ensure people remain safe. They agreed to work collectively with the federal government on ways to lessen impacts.

Quotes:
The public health measures put in place to combat the COVID-19 pandemic have created a unique situation with both economic and social consequences for our seafood industry and or coastal communities. Unique solutions will be required, but working together as a region provides an advantage for all of Atlantic Canada’s seafood producers. The health of our citizens is top priority but we are also committed to helping this vital industry remain strong.
Prince Edward Island Minister of Fisheries and Communities Jamie Fox

It is imperative that we work together to support Atlantic Canada’s seafood industry in these difficult times. Our harvesters, aquaculture producers and seafood processors have always been ready to adapt to make sure they maintain their livelihood for current and future generations, and this is no exception. We will continue to focus efforts to support this resilient industry and to ensure it remains a sustainable way of life for rural, coastal and Aboriginal communities.
New Brunswick Minister of Agriculture, Aquaculture and Fisheries Ross Wetmore

As the pandemic’s impact on the Atlantic region’s seafood sector evolves, I will continue to work in close collaboration with my Atlantic colleagues to secure the necessary strategies and supports that ensure our respective fishing industries correctly respond and ultimately recover.
Newfoundland and Labrador Minister of Fisheries and Land Resources Gerry Byrne

","
To help further prevent COVID-19 from impacting inmates and staff at correctional facilities, 41 people who are serving intermittent sentences in the province’s four adult correctional facilities will be released on temporary absence.  
An intermittent sentence is ordered by a court and allows a person to serve a sentence in small blocks of time – usually on weekends - instead of all at once. 
The person serving the sentence continues to live at home and work in the community most of the time so they can work and fulfill family obligations. Under the Criminal Code, a judge can impose an intermittent sentence if the term of imprisonment is 90 days or less. 
This health protection measure is being made with the guidance and advice of public health officials. This measure is allowed under the Nova Scotia Correctional Services Act, and is in effect until further notice.
On March 15, Correctional Services closed its facilities to all visitors until further notice.

The Nova Scotia Securities Commission is alerting investors to be wary of people taking advantage of COVID-19 and economic turmoil to engage in investment scams.
A Nova Scotia investor contacted the commission after receiving a call from someone saying they were with National Bank. They were told that their investment plan was collapsing and they needed to immediately put money into their account to save it. The caller was using fear around the current economic conditions to attempt to steal the investor’s money.
Anyone who believes they have been contacted by someone engaging in investment fraud or fraudulent activities is advised to contact the commission at  https://nssc.novascotia.ca/recognize-and-report-scam or by email at NSSCEnforcement@novascotia.ca .

Quotes:
Unfortunately, in times of economic turmoil many fraudsters try to take advantage of investors’ fears to steal their money. If you are contacted by anyone with warnings about your investments or finances, never give out any information and contact your adviser, bank, or investment firm to ensure the caller is legitimate.
Stephanie Atkinson, acting director of Enforcement, Nova Scotia Securities Commission

","
No one knows communities better than the people who live and work in them. That is why government is supporting two community-led projects in the Annapolis Valley designed to support doctor recruitment and retention. 
“We know when community leaders and volunteers get involved in recruiting new doctors and their families to their communities and supporting them as they settle in, there are positive results,” said Kings South MLA Keith Irving on behalf of Leo Glavine, Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage. “In Kings County, we are taking a partnership approach -- pooling government resources and drawing on expertise in our communities with the ultimate goal of attracting and retaining more doctors.”
The Valley Regional Hospital in Kentville hosts up to 10 medical residents at a time who spend the first two years of their career in the region. The Annapolis Valley Chamber of Commerce is kicking off a new project that will connect medical residents with volunteers in the community to provide one-on-one support to encourage doctors to stay once their residency is complete. The organization will also gather information to help the community better understand local issues and opportunities related to doctor recruitment and retention. Government will provide $20,000 toward this project. 
The Town of Middleton will use a $10,000 grant to continue its work to build a community of support for doctors and their families. This project includes conducting focus groups and interviews with doctors and families who have moved to the area in the last five years and building programs that draw from best-practices in other communities. Representatives from the counties of Annapolis and Kings, villages of Kingston and Greenwood, and the Soldiers Memorial Hospital Foundation will be invited to sit on the steering committee for this project. 
Quotes:
As an organization that has supported and celebrated the Annapolis Valley business community for many years, we see this work to create a more welcoming community for doctors and their families as a natural fit. We recognize the work of government and the health authority in recruiting and retaining doctors, and believe community-level engagement is a critical component to ensure continued access to essential health care for all citizens.
Mark Vardy, vice president, Annapolis Valley Chamber of Commerce

We are very appreciative of this assistance as we work with our neighbouring communities towards building a welcoming and supportive place for both new and existing physicians and their families. Our focus is to retain physicians who are completing a residency, a short-term contract or new assignment in the area. With the upcoming completion of the new Primary Health Care Centre in Middleton, this is the perfect compliment to support new and existing health care practitioners in our community.
Sylvester Atkinson, mayor of Middleton

To date, there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nova Scotia.
Health-care workers, teachers, civil servants and other public sector employees who travel anywhere outside Canada will have to stay at home/self-isolate away from the public for 14 days after returning to the country. These measures also apply to students of Nova Scotia public schools and children in regulated child care centres who have travelled with their families, even if their parents or caregivers are not public sector employees. 
“While we are fortunate to have no cases of COVID-19 in the province, we expect to see cases here very soon,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “We all need to do our part to reduce the spread, protect our most vulnerable and keep Nova Scotians healthy and safe.” 
The private sector is encouraged to take the same approach and support employees to self-isolate for 14 days after travelling outside Canada. 
The chief medical officer of health is also encouraging individuals, employers and community organizations to limit social gatherings to no more than 150 people to limit spread. This could include events like weddings, church services, movie theatres and concerts. This measure will help protect vulnerable Nova Scotians who are at greatest risk and will be reassessed as the situation evolves. 
The province is also working with the federal government to delay the start of the cruise ship season.
Nova Scotians should think about additional measures they can take to help reduce the spread of COVID-19, such as: 

avoiding close contact with others (keeping at least two metres or roughly six feet apart) 
avoiding crowds and gatherings like parties and other group activities
staying home if ill, especially if you have a fever and or a new cough

“Nova Scotia has so much to offer doctors and their families in communities throughout the province,” said Lloyd Hines, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal on behalf of Communities, Culture and Heritage Minister Leo Glavine. 
""Government is pleased to support three projects, led by the Town of Port Hawkesbury, Eastern Memorial Hospital Foundation in Canso and Guysborough Memorial Hospital Foundation, that help make our communities more welcoming for doctors and their families.” 
Government has provided $10,000 to the Town of Port Hawkesbury to support a new program that aims to connect community volunteers with new physicians. 
Eastern Memorial Hospital Foundation has also received $10,000 to support the creation of a new team, which will develop a welcome and promotion plan for the community. The group will consult and support new physicians and build an online portal for newcomers to find cultural events and activities in the area. 
Guysborough Memorial Hospital Foundation has also received a $9,400 grant to help form a Welcome Home committee, which will develop a web-based video guide to the community designed to introduce new doctors and their families to the community.

All parties voted to support the government’s legislation to enable couples to remain together when it comes time for them to enter long-term care. 
Government also passed bills to discourage young people from vaping and to address the wage gap between women and men. 
“We are always better together. I am proud of the way Nova Scotians, the business and academic communities and government have worked together to get the finances of the province on stable ground so more investments can be made in Nova Scotians’ priorities,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “Our government will keep working with Nova Scotians to build our province, grow our population, create opportunities for young people and support those who need our help.”

New national screening protocols have been established as the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to expand globally. 
Anyone who has travelled outside Canada may have come in contact with the novel coronavirus and should closely monitor their health for 14 days after returning to the country. Travellers who start to feel unwell, should stay at home/self-isolate away from the public. Individuals who develop a fever, with a temperature 38°C or higher, and/or cough should call 811 for assessment.
To date, there have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nova Scotia.
To help protect older Nova Scotians and those most at risk for severe illness, the province is restricting visitors who have travelled outside the country in the last 14 days from entering long-term care homes.  As always, anyone who is feeling unwell should not enter a facility.
“We are expanding our screening to include travel outside of the country as the virus continues to spread,” said Dr. Robert Strang, chief medical officer of health. “With more cases expected in Canada and spread into the community likely, we are adapting our processes to respond to this rapidly evolving situation.”
To prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including COVID-19, it is important that all Nova Scotians:

practise good handwashing hygiene
use cough and sneeze etiquette 
avoid touching your face
minimize close face-to-face contact with people who appear ill
stay away from others if you feel unwell
regularly clean and disinfect high touch surfaces

","
March 8 is International Women’s Day. It’s a day to recognize and celebrate women and girls – in all our diversity – and the difference we make to this world. 
When it comes to the issue of gender equality, all of our actions matter. I wish gender equality was no longer an issue in 2020. Unfortunately, this is not the case. 
Addressing gender equality also means addressing pressing and complex challenges like gendered-based violence, economic insecurity and underrepresentation in leadership. 
In 2018, more than 2000 women in Nova Scotia were victims of police-reported domestic violence. This crime is under-reported, so we know these numbers don’t reflect the actual number of victims. We also know that Aboriginal women experience violent victimization at a rate three times higher than non-Aboriginal women. This needs to change. 
That’s why our government committed $9 million to Standing Together: A Provincial Action Plan to Prevent Domestic Violence. This plan is government’s commitment to work differently with community organizations, groups and experts to build an action plan to disrupt harmful cycles of violence. 
Human trafficking is another form of gender-based violence that’s rooted in gender inequality. Human trafficking and sexual exploitation have a devastating impact on families and communities. That’s why government is investing an additional $1.4 million per year, for the next five years, into programs, services and supports focused on prevention, raising awareness and directly helping victims and survivors.  
Gender-based violence isn’t the only manifestation of gender inequality. There continues to be a gap in the salaries earned by women versus the salaries earned by men doing the same work. This gender wage gap persists across virtually all industries and occupations – even though women have the highest rates of high school completion and post-secondary enrollment. This needs to change. 
Research shows that greater pay transparency leads to a smaller gender pay gap. That’s why our government has changed the Labour Standards Code so employers could no longer prohibit employees from sharing information about their salaries. It also means employers will no longer be able to ask a prospective employee what they made in a previous job as a basis for their current salary. For women, this can put an end to a lower salary following her throughout her career. This is an important step in addressing the gender wage gap.
Despite higher rates of educational enrollment and attainment, women also continue to be under-represented in leadership and decision-making roles. In more than 250 years, only 50 women have been elected to the provincial legislature. At the municipal level, fewer than one third of seats are held by women. This, too, needs to change. Our systems should reflect the diversity of those we serve.
The Local Government Leadership School for Women happening in Port Hawkesbury in May is a great example of how communities are providing knowledge and tools for women who want to run for elected positions. The school is a collaborative model with women leaders from municipalities in the region and women leaders from the Unama’ki First Nations communities. 
The Nova Scotia Advisory Council on the Status of Women works across these three areas that touch all our lives: living free from violence, economic security and leadership. It’s through working with community, government, and public and private institutions and enterprises that we can advance gender equality.  
The theme for International Women’s Day 2020, Each for Equal, is a call for each of us to work together to build a world where all women and girls have equal opportunity to thrive. I invite all Nova Scotians to answer this call. 
We are stronger together.

","
Nova Scotians want and deserve to be able to get the health care they need when they need it. That is why government is investing even more into improving access to care across the province. 
Government will continue to work with universities to train more doctors and nurses this year. Twelve new first year medical seats will be added at Dalhousie University in August. 
Government and its partners will also continue to provide more training and educational opportunities in rural Nova Scotia through expanded residency and clerkship programs. Based on the success of the clerkship program in Cape Breton, it will be launched on the South Shore this fall. Research shows people are more likely to stay in communities where they have trained.
More nurses will be trained from one end of the province to the other with 62 new first-year nursing seats being added at Cape Breton University and eight more at Dalhousie University’s Yarmouth campus. This is the largest and only increase in undergraduate nursing seats in 12 years.
These new training initiatives will complement other recruitment efforts such as the practice ready assessment program to help internationally trained doctors work in Nova Scotia and immigration programs specifically for doctors and other health professionals and a new fund to support community efforts around doctor recruitment. 
Government also wants people to be able to get the medication they need. Nearly $21 million more will go toward things like family and seniors pharmacare and low-income family drug support programs. A new agreement with Nova Scotia’s 1,300 pharmacists allows them to prescribe birth control and medication for urinary tract infections and shingles. Pharmacists can renew prescriptions for 180 days for many items and as of April 1, government will cover the fee for all residents with a valid health card. It is all about giving Nova Scotians more options when it comes to accessing care.
“Nova Scotians have told us access to quality health care is their priority and it is our priority too,” said Health and Wellness Minister Randy Delorey. “We are training and hiring more care providers, introducing new incentives and ensuring our trained professionals are working to their full scope of practice.” 
This year’s budget sees an additional $75.3 million dedicated for doctor services and salaries. Under the new four-year agreement, family, emergency and anesthesia doctors will become the highest paid in Atlantic Canada and other specialties, like psychiatry, obstetrics and gynecology will be among the highest paid in the region. Incentives to recruit and retain specialists in rural communities have been doubled and hourly rates for psychiatry outside Halifax increased.
Other health-care investments this year include: 

$1 million for ovarian cancer research 
$3.2 million to hire staff and for public education on the upcoming proclamation of the Human Organ and Tissue Donation Act
Long-Term Care budget has increased to $612.4 million, up $5.3 million 
Mental Health and Addictions budget has increased to $316.5 million, up $0.5 million  
funding to Nova Scotia Health Authority and IWK Health Centre has increased to $2.1 billion, up $86 million


Quotes:
The Cape Breton University Nursing Program has been a strong contributor to the registered nurse supply for many years. The additional seats now added to the program builds upon this success and will enable CBU to better assist the registered nurse workforce needs in Cape Breton, but more broadly, provincewide. We are particularly pleased this new initiative seeks to encourage more African Nova Scotian and Indigenous students to pursue nursing careers and we look forward to substantial progress in achieving these desired outcomes.

","
Opioid use and overdose has taken a personal and financial toll on many Nova Scotians, their families and communities.
The province wants to hold opioid manufacturers and distributors accountable for the harmful impact of their drugs which is why Government introduced the Opioid Damages and Health Care Costs Recovery Act today, March 3. 
“Hundreds of Nova Scotians are dealing with opioid use and dozens die each year from opioid-related overdoses,” said Health and Wellness Minister Randy Delorey. “Too many families have been affected and we believe drug companies need to take responsibility for the role they have played.”  
This legislation will ensure Nova Scotia has an option to proceed with action against opioid manufacturers and distributors. This may include supporting British Columbia’s class action lawsuit or taking legal action of its own, to recover health-care costs and other direct costs incurred due to opioid-related disease, injury and illness.
The bill will also simplify the procedure for proving damages caused by opioid manufacturers and distributors by allowing the use of aggregate health data instead of individual health records.
The act will take effect on proclamation.  

Quotes:
The prescription of opioids over the past 20 years has created large numbers of people who are dependent on opioids. It is also a tremendous strain on our health-care system - opioid overdoses needlessly take lives, place significant stress on communities, and can overwhelm first responders and emergency departments.
Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health



Quick Facts:

an average of 60 Nova Scotians die every year from confirmed and probable opioid-related overdose
the province’s first Opioid Use and Overdose Framework was launched in July 2017
government invested $5.68 million last year to treat opioid-use disorder, provide naloxone for overdose reversal and train health providers 
government’s continued investment has improved access to treatment by reducing wait times, saved lives with the distribution of more than 13,000 take-home naloxone kits, trained dozens of police officers on trauma-informed care and built ongoing public awareness

This funding will be used to buy more equipment, like beds, wheelchairs and specialized mattresses for residents in long-term care facilities funded by the Department of Health and Wellness.
For those Nova Scotians who need more support and care, increased investment will enhance long-term care in the province, making more beds available to Nova Scotians and better supporting those with complex needs and improving facilities. Investments in community and business accessibility programs, community transportation and age-friendly community programs will help ensure those who want to stay in their homes longer can stay connected to their communities. 
Additional investments that could benefit older adults include:

$496,000 annually, for three more years for NS GovLab, Nova Scotia’s first social innovation lab that works to address complex issues associated with aging 
$1.2 million is being invested to support Let’s Get Moving Nova Scotia, the action plan to create a more active, inclusive and healthier population. This funding will support work to build upon existing physical activity networks, programs and resources and addresses gaps to make it easier for all Nova Scotians, including seniors, to move more and sit less. A focus will be on Mi’kmaw communities
$8.3 million to offer free home energy assessments and upgrades for homeowners through the Home Warming Program
$2 million to sustain the Affordable Renters Program which can lower energy bills for low-income renters, make homes more comfortable and ensure rents remain stable through energy efficiency upgrades to multi-unit buildings


Quotes:
NS GovLab takes on the complex realities of aging and invites new thinking, new perspectives and asks, how might we do this better? The social innovation lab offers individual Nova Scotians the chance to help shape how we collectively respond to the opportunities and challenges created by our aging demographics. I am pleased to see this worthwhile initiative is receiving continued funding.

","
Couples deserve to be able to stay together when they are in long-term care.
That is why government is introducing the Life Partners in Long Term Care Act to protect a couple’s right to be placed together. 
“We want to do everything we can to help life partners stay together as they age, it’s the right thing to do,” said Randy Delorey, Minister of Health and Wellness. “Couples should be able to stay together even if one person may need a different level of care.”
Right now, if spouses, common law and domestic partners need different levels of long-term care, placing them together often cannot be accommodated. The new act will allow couples to be placed together at the highest care level required. For example, if one spouse requires nursing home care and one requires residential care, the couple would be placed in a nursing home.  
Government will also work with Veterans Affairs Canada to ensure this right applies to spouses of veterans.  
This will apply to couples as defined in the act for admission to one of the 132 long-term care homes licensed and funded by the province.

Quotes:
Fostering close spousal connections can have a profound positive impact on a senior. The mere presence of a familiar voice or touch for a senior suffering from cognitive decline can bring about an overwhelming sense of calm. In a recent case at our home, keeping spouses together has decreased responsive behaviours and provided an engaging, purposeful, quality of life for the couple.

Nova Scotians can be vulnerable to financial schemes targeting life insurance policies. That is why government is making changes to protect both consumers and insurance companies.
Amendments to the Nova Scotia Insurance Act introduced today, Feb. 28, will better protect Nova Scotians by providing insurance companies with legal grounds to refuse to transfer ownership of life insurance policies to third parties. Government is also closing the loophole on the use of side accounts. 
Currently, third parties are potentially able to buy life insurance policies from seniors or people who are critically ill at a fraction of face value. In addition, they can transfer large sums of money into side accounts to take advantage of fixed interest rates.
“We have listened to concerns from industry and are making these changes to better protect vulnerable Nova Scotians,” said Finance and Treasury Board Minister Karen Casey. “Unfortunately, seniors and critically ill Nova Scotians have typically been the most vulnerable to these predatory tactics and government needs to do what we can to help prevent this from occurring.”
Changes will come into effect upon proclamation.

“There are currently a number of gaps and other deficiencies in the legislation which make it challenging for the government to ensure small railways maintain and repair their infrastructure,” said Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal Minister Lloyd Hines. “These amendments will improve our oversight and increase the obligations on railway owners to take more responsibility for their rail infrastructure. It is important we have the regulatory authority we need to ensure public safety on discontinued or abandoned rail lines.” 
The amendments will require the province’s three short-line railway companies to have their infrastructure inspected by a qualified inspector every five years to ensure that any rail assets do not become public safety issues.
The changes will also bring the Sydney Coal Railway, formerly regulated under the federal Railway Safety Act, under the regulatory authority of the province.
The authority of the Utilities and Review Board, as the licensing body, is clarified under the act.

Quick Facts:

there are three short-line railways in the province
the Windsor-Hantsport Railway is non-operational. The company owns 34 kilometres of track from Windsor to New Minas
Sydney Coal Railway owned by Nova Scotia Power, is unlicensed and has no direct regulatory oversight although it abides by federal rules; it is classified as an industrial railway and currently falls outside provincial legislation
Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway discontinued the Sydney subdivision, from St. Peter’s Junction to Sydney, in 2015 due to low traffic volumes. It is responsible for about 389 kilometres of rail line between Truro and Sydney
all provinces, except Prince Edward Island, have legislation to govern short-line railway operations. The federal Railway Safety Act governs interprovincial and international railways.

The type of firearm or other weapons must be those approved for use in Nova Scotia by police officers. 
“Those who work and visit the Nova Scotia Legislature can be assured that safety and security at Province House is a priority,” said Mr. Furey. “Province House represents one of the key cornerstones of our province’s democratic values and processes. These changes simply ensure that the requirements of the sergeant-at-arms job are included in the legislation. This will provide clarity and set out – in law - the required authorities and powers of the position. This is a proactive, best practice which helps ensure our democracy continues to be protected.”  
The changes also include:

requiring the sergeant-at-arms to have the same training and certifications that police officers must have in Nova Scotia to possess and use a firearm, and other equipment 
permitting the sergeant-at-arms to pursue persons that leave the premises, when appropriate and required 
giving the speaker the authority to appoint the sergeant-at-arms and the governor-in-council the authority to determine the salary. Currently the salary is set in legislation

","
Amendments to the Tobacco Access Act and the Smoke-free Places Act aim to prevent a new generation of Nova Scotians from becoming addicted to nicotine.
These legislative changes build on a first-of-its-kind in Canada ban on flavoured e-cigarette products announced in December.
Amendments to the acts tabled today, Feb. 27, will:

give the province regulatory authority over the nicotine content of tobacco, e-cigarettes and other products, protecting youth from potentially hazardous nicotine levels
broaden the definition of tobacco to include other types of tobacco-less nicotine products, allowing the province to better address emerging nicotine products that may be appealing to youth
allow peace officers to require individuals to provide information and reasonable assistance in investigating a potential breach of the act and provide peace officers the authority to confiscate and dispose of e-cigarettes from youth who are underage, similar to what is done for tobacco and alcohol
clarify language about smoking and vaping on unlicensed outdoor patio spaces, ensuring locations where people work and frequent remain smoke-free

“Nova Scotia has long been a leader in promoting a smoke-free culture, especially for our youth,” said Randy Delorey, Minister of Health and Wellness. “Vaping rates among young people have been growing and we’re concerned with what we’re seeing. We believe these legislative changes, along with the flavour ban, new taxation measures and stronger licensing and inspection, will help us gain ground once again.”
As announced in Budget 2020-21, the province will implement a tax on vaping products sold in Nova Scotia. All retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers of vaping products will be required to be licensed to sell their products in Nova Scotia.
The province will also roll out a public education campaign about the risks of vaping to youth.

Quotes:
As we work to strengthen legislative measures around vaping, it’s important for youth to hear a straightforward message – if you don’t smoke or vape, don’t start. Vaping products are addictive and contain chemicals that can harm your development and long-term health. If you’re ready to quit, reach out for help. Talk to your parents, your doctor, or visit a youth health centre.
Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health

Whether it’s a fetus in the womb, a young child or an adolescent, we know nicotine is toxic to the developing brain. It physically changes the brain’s structure and has strong addictive properties that can last a lifetime. Anything we can do to reduce the nicotine content in these products is a big win.
Dr. Dimas Mateos, pediatric respirologist, IWK Health Centre

The Lung Association of Nova Scotia supports the government taking measures that improve the lung health of Nova Scotians. We believe these enhanced measures will help make Nova Scotia a healthier place to live and breathe.

","
Nova Scotians want to have peace of mind in their retirement years. That is why government is introducing regulations under the Pensions Benefit Act to improve the flexibility and stability of defined-benefit pension plan funding.
“These regulations will help stabilize contribution requirements for employers, while maintaining the security of benefits for plan members under the Pensions Benefit Act,” said Finance and Treasury Board Minister Karen Casey. 
The regulations include amending the funding requirements for defined-benefit pension plans. This includes reducing required solvency funding to 85 per cent of solvency liabilities instead of 100 per cent and strengthening going-concern funding to add a funding cushion above the 100 per cent funding threshold. Any going-concern deficit will have to be paid off faster than was previously allowed; over ten years instead of fifteen. Going-concern funding assumes that a pension plan will continue indefinitely.
Additional changes in the regulations include incorporating federally permitted investment rules, reducing reporting requirements for solvency-exempt plans, allowing employers to take holidays from making normal contributions when the plan is overfunded, exempting individual pension plans from sections of the Pensions Benefit Act, reducing restrictions on benefit improvements, and defining and clarifying conditions around reserve accounts and annuity buy outs as introduced in recent amendments to the Pensions Benefit Act. 
The regulations will come into effect April 1. 

Quick Facts:

current solvency funding requirements for private sector defined-benefit pensions plans are at 100 per cent of liabilities measured on a solvency basis – this requirement will be reduced to 85 per cent
going-concern funding requirements for private sector and some public section defined benefit pension plans will require a cushion and will ensure that any deficiencies are paid over 10 years instead of 15, so that shortfalls are addressed in a timely manner
benefits for plan members will not change as a result of the amendments

The quality of life for Nova Scotians greatly depends on access to safe and affordable housing. That is why government is investing hundreds of millions to fight homelessness, provide affordable housing and raise the income level of those who need it most. 
This year, government will make the largest single investment in homelessness prevention with $20.5 million over five years for the Integrated Action Plan to Address Homelessness. The action plan will focus on finding permanent, stable and safe homes for people who are experiencing or at risk of homelessness. 
Efforts to strengthen Nova Scotia’s housing programs will continue with an investment of $18.7 million to deliver on year two of the three-year Canada-Nova Scotia Housing Action Plan and additional housing priorities. This will include initiatives like the construction of new affordable housing units, repair and renewal of public housing units and improved accessibility of public housing units. 
“A big part of this year’s budget is about helping to ensure Nova Scotians have access to things they need most to thrive,” said Chuck Porter, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “Having an affordable place to call home, with access to services and supports, helps build safe and connected communities.”
This year will also see the largest single increase to the Nova Scotia Child Benefit since it was created in 1998. The income threshold for the Nova Scotia Child Benefit will be increased and families with incomes of $34,000 or below will now be eligible. The expanded child benefit will support almost 28,000 families and 49,000 children.  
The amount families receive will also increase. Eligible families will now receive $925 per year for their first child. That is up to $300 more for some families. For each additional child, families will receive between $412 and $825 depending on income level. 
“Supporting healthy children, youth and families is key to building a stronger province,” said Kelly Regan, Minister of Community Services. “Government’s investment in the enhanced Nova Scotia Child Benefit will put more money directly in the hands of families who need it.”
Additional investments include:

$250,000 to double the budget for the Down Payment Assistance Program, for a total of $500,000. This will expand the program’s lending capacity from $1.1 million to $2.2 million and allow more low and modest income home buyers to enter the housing market
$2 million to sustain the Affordable Renters Program which can lower energy bills for low-income renters, make homes more comfortable and ensure rents remain stable through energy efficiency upgrades to multi-unit buildings
$400,000 to keep children out of shelters
$17.3 million to support the Standard Household Rate under the Income Assistance program to improve the monthly income of Nova Scotia’s most vulnerable

","
Changes to the Companies Act, tabled today, Feb. 25, will increase transparency and help to prevent companies incorporated in Nova Scotia from being used for illegal activity.
The amendments will require companies to collect, maintain and update information about who owns, controls or benefits from a company and the income it generates. Law enforcement and tax authorities will be able to access this information from the company to help counter illegal activity like international tax evasion and avoidance, money laundering and other criminal activities.
“Helping to prevent companies operating in our province from being used for tax evasion, money laundering and other illegal activity will protect our citizens and support a strong economy,” said Service Nova Scotia and Internal Services Minister Patricia Arab.
The amendments will come into effect on proclamation.

Quick Facts:

an incorporated company or corporation is a legal entity separate from its owners and is incorporated through the Companies Act
a beneficial owner is the person who directly or indirectly owns, controls or benefits from a company and the income it generates
at the December 2017 federal-provincial-territorial Finance Ministers meeting, ministers agreed in principle to put safeguards in place to prevent the misuse of corporations and other legal entities for illegal activities
similar amendments are in effect federally and in Manitoba, Prince Edward Island and British Columbia

“We want to build a province with no limitations – a place where all Nova Scotians live their best lives,” said Mr. McNeil. “The social and economic impact social enterprises have on their participants and their communities is invaluable. I encourage all Nova Scotians to take a moment this week to celebrate and recognize Nova Scotia’s social enterprises for all they do.”
Social enterprises help adults with diverse abilities gain vocational skills while participating in their local communities. Through training and meaningful employment in areas like woodworking, food services, retail and more, participants work as part of a team and develop valuable social skills. 
This year, the province will invest over $6.1 million to help disability service providers maintain or expand day programming services, which includes supporting several social enterprises.

","
Government is inviting Nova Scotians to share their views on proposed changes to the province’s parenting and support laws.
People can share their opinions starting today, Feb. 24, through an online survey https://novascotia.ca/proposed-changes-to-the-parenting-and-support-act-consultation/ .
Proposed changes to the Parenting and Support Act aim to more closely align provincial laws with upcoming changes to federal legislation, including updating current language and considerations for parenting arrangements. 
“We want to ensure families are able to easily navigate family legal matters and not be burdened with the added stress and potential confusion of dealing with inconsistent laws,” said Attorney General and Minister of Justice Mark Furey. 
The Parenting and Support Act is the provincial law which deals with child and family matters in cases where parents are separating. When parents’ divorce, their parenting and support issues are covered under the federal Divorce Act. 
Having provincial and federal laws that are similar will make it easier for people to understand those laws especially for those who represent themselves for court matters. It would also mean that children and families are treated similarly, no matter their parent’s relationship or family situation.
The online consultation will remain open until March 4.

Quick Facts:

about 90 per cent of family law cases in Nova Scotia involve self-represented parties at some point
the Divorce Act has not changed since 1985. Major changes to the Divorce Act will come into effect on July 1
the Parenting and Support Act was last amended in 2017 after consultation with family law experts, community groups and justice stakeholders. These changes were made prior to amendments to the federal Divorce Act

Government is making it easier for Nova Scotians to vote for their Member of the Legislature and better support those who wish to serve their communities and fellow citizens by running for office.
Attorney General and Minister of Justice Mark Furey, introduced over 40 changes to modernize the Elections Act today, Feb. 21, which will improve voting access for families, provide greater clarity for voters and candidates, reduce the risk of human error in vote counting and help Elections Nova Scotia streamline the running of elections.  
“These changes will make voting easier for Nova Scotians, including those who serve in uniform,” said Mr. Furey.  “Our military members make tremendous sacrifices to protect and defend our democracy. We want to make it easier for them to exercise their democratic right to vote. We are also reducing barriers to run for provincial office, especially for women and others who are primary caregivers in their families. Public service is foundational to our democracy, and candidates and their families make sacrifices. My hope is more Nova Scotians will feel better supported to consider serving their communities by running for provincial office.”     
Proposed changes will support the participation of more Nova Scotians to seek elected office by reimbursing candidates for additional family and accessibility related expenses incurred during the election. This funding will support greater accessibility for candidates with a disability and assist them with additional expenses for child care, spousal care, eldercare or care for a person with a disability regularly supported by the them.
Voting will be modernized. The change will give Elections Nova Scotia the option to provide internet voting to military members deployed outside of Nova Scotia and the ability to offer electronic ballots during early voting inside the province.   
Other changes include: 

making it optional for voters to provide their gender 
giving Elections Nova Scotia the option to remove the requirement for two witnesses to be present prior to counting ballots as long as two election officials are present  
allowing tax receipts for contributions to registered candidates once the election writ is issued, rather than when their nomination is approved 
extending the right to vote to candidates and their spouses who live outside the district of a byelection
simplifying the rules around location of campaign offices and campaign signage in proximity to polling locations
requiring a candidate to provide rationale for requesting a judicial recount

These changes are based on recommendations made by the chief electoral officer and Elections Nova Scotia to improve the administration of elections.

","
Universities play an important role in Nova Scotia’s economic growth. As they continue to advance education and research across the province, government wants to ensure their operational needs are supported and regulatory burdens are reduced. 
Amendments to the University Foundations Act introduced today, Feb. 21, will allow universities who no longer wish to operate their foundations to dissolve them. 
“We’ve heard from our universities and for many of them, there is no longer a need to operate a foundation in addition to the university itself,” said Minister of Labour and Advanced Education Labi Kousoulis. “These changes will help ensure the legislation reflects the current landscape and better support our universities by allowing them to streamline operations.” 
Currently, the University Foundations Act requires all 10 universities to operate a foundation. At the time the act was established, there were tax advantages associated with donations to Crown foundations, however these tax advantages no longer exist. 
The additional amendments will:

add transitional provisions to transfer all assets, property, liabilities and obligations associated with the dissolved foundations to the affiliated university
outline that any outstanding gifts or bequests to a dissolved foundation would go to the affiliated university
remove the requirement for the minister to table the annual report of each foundation before the legislature 
add that the minister can require that additional information be included in a foundation’s annual report
update the name of the minister
include an amendment to the University Pension Plan Transfer Act to remove reference to the University Foundations Act

Seven of the 10 universities have chosen to dissolve their university foundations. Acadia University, Cape Breton University and the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design have opted to continue running their foundations. 

Quick Facts:

the University Foundations Act was enacted in 1991 
the act was originally established to support the tax advantages associated with donating to a Crown foundation that existed at that time 
the changes will not impact the universities’ ability to fundraise
these amendments align with government’s broader commitment to reduce undue regulatory burden to businesses

","
Nova Scotians deserve the opportunity to grow and thrive in workplaces that value fairness and equality. That is why government is taking action to address the gender wage gap.
Amendments to the Labour Standards Code introduced today, Feb. 20, will help ensure that the salary of a woman who may be paid less than her male counterpart doing the same work, will not follow her throughout her career. The amendments will also expand the equal pay provisions currently in the Labour Standards Code to employees who do not identify exclusively, or at all, as men or women. 
“These changes represent a simple principle – equal pay for equal work,” said Minister of Labour and Advanced Education Labi Kousoulis. “This is an important step toward narrowing the gender wage gap in our province and ensuring all Nova Scotians are paid what they deserve.” 
Research has shown that greater transparency in wage information leads to a smaller gender pay gap. The proposed amendments will allow individuals to have greater access to pay information when accepting or discussing compensation for a new job. They will also prohibit employers from inquiring about the wage history of a job applicant or employee, as well as prohibit employers from barring employees from discussing or disclosing their own wages or those of other employees. 
The changes will also allow government to expand through regulations the equal pay provisions to employees who possess certain characteristics, such as those related to race and ethnicity. 
Additionally, the amendments will allow government to make regulations related to administrative penalties to provide the department with the ability to ensure compliance with the Labour Standards Code. 
If passed, the amendments would take effect in the spring. 

Quotes:
“Gender equality not only benefits women and girls, it benefits the whole province,” said Kelly Regan, minister responsible for the Advisory Council on the Status of Women. “It’s important to have legislative and policy frameworks in place that support gender equality in the workforce.”

based on the average employment income of all workers in Nova Scotia, women earn $0.73 for every $1 earned by men (2017)
these amendments are part of government’s commitment to address the complex and structural challenges to advancing gender equality

Canadian Armed Forces reservists make significant sacrifices to help serve and protect the country. The province is taking steps to improve their job protection when they take leave from work to serve our country.  
“We greatly value the sacrifice and bravery of our country’s reservists,” said Minister of Labour and Advanced Education Labi Kousoulis. “By updating our legislation, we will ensure their jobs are protected when they are called upon for training and deployment.”
New legislation introduced today, Feb. 20, would see the Nova Scotia Labour Standards Code better align with recent federal government changes made to the reservist leave provisions under the Canada Labour Code.
The proposed amendments include:

reducing the eligibility period required to have access to reservist leave from one year to three months    
increasing the length of the leave from 18 months, within a three-year period, to 24 months within any 60-month period and allowing for a longer period of leave in a situation involving a national emergency 
reducing the notice period to employers from 90 days to 30 days, or as much notice as reasonably possible when an employee receives less than four weeks notice of the requirement to participate as a reservist

","
Government remains committed to adopting ecological forestry. That is why the Department of Lands and Forestry is consulting on two key recommendations from the Lahey review of forest management practices.
Today, Feb. 20, the department opened public consultations on draft criteria for high productions zones and is also moving ahead with the next phase of consultations on the draft forest management guide.
“We are committed to fully implementing ecological forestry in Nova Scotia and each leg of the triad model is dependent on the other for success,” said Lands and Forestry Minister Iain Rankin. “This is a fundamental shift to how we manage our forests and it’s important we hear from Nova Scotians as we put in place the necessary programs and measures to move forward.” 
The triad model, recommended by Professor Bill Lahey in his forestry review in 2018, includes conservation zones, high production zones and mixed use or matrix zones. These three categories work together to allow ecological and economic goals to coexist, leading to healthy forests and a sustainable forestry sector. 
High productions zones are a key part of the triad model where trees are planted and harvested in rotation like crops. These zones will make up the smallest percentage of land in the triad. They help ensure enough wood is available for harvest for a sustainable forestry sector, while less cutting occurs to protect biodiversity in the mixed use areas and no commercial harvesting occurs in conservation areas. 
A discussion paper has been posted at https://novascotia.ca/ecological-forestry/high-production-forestry/  and feedback can be sent to ecologicalforestry@novascotia.ca .
The draft forest management guide was developed with input from stakeholders in 2019. Those groups will provide feedback on this revised draft guide before it moves to public consultations later this winter. 
Operations in mixed use ecological zones, also called matrix zones, will be regulated by the forest management guide. The central focus of the new guide will place more emphasis on ecological values, including biodiversity, while still providing a certain amount of wood for harvest.
Conservation zones will not have any commercial tree harvesting. 

Quotes:
The new forest management represents an historic paradigm shift for Nova Scotia’s natural forests. It moves away from excessive reliance on even-aged silvicultural approaches, where trees in a stand end up being the same age, to management practices that will result in forests being made up of trees with a variety of ages through the practice of irregular shelterwood silviculture.
Robert Seymour, professor emeritus of silviculture, University of Maine School of Forest Resources

“Human trafficking and sexual exploitation have a devastating impact on all our communities,” said Kelly Regan, Minister of Community Services and Minister responsible for the Status of Women. “They are crimes that disproportionately affect women and girls. It will take the combined efforts of government, non-profit and community organizations to create meaningful change.” 
The province will provide an additional $1.4 million a year over the next five years, to support new and current initiatives.
“Only by working together can we put a stop to these horrific crimes and help victims and survivors begin to heal and move forward,” said Mark Furey, Minister of Justice. “We know this is a pressing issue and we are taking immediate action to address it, while ensuring that programs, supports and services for victims and survivors are readily and easily accessible.”

Four new internationally trained family doctors from Nigeria are now ready to work in Nova Scotia.  
They are the first to successfully complete the new Nova Scotia Practice Ready Assessment Program – a program designed to ensure family doctors trained outside Canada meet Nova Scotia licensing requirements. These doctors will practice under certain conditions and supervision. 
“We know doctors trained in other countries who come to Canada often end up working in other jobs because of differences in their medical licences. The Practice Ready Assessment Program was created to give these trained professionals an opportunity to show they have the knowledge and skills required to practise in Nova Scotia,” said Health and Wellness Minister Randy Delorey. “I welcome the first group through the program and know they will provide great care in communities.” 
As part of the program, the doctors will work in designated communities, based on need, for at least three years.  They will be practising family medicine in Truro, New Glasgow, Hubbards and Glace Bay.
The program is entering its second year. Nine potential candidates are being interviewed for the next group.
The Practice Ready Assessment Program is a partnership between the Dalhousie Department of Family Medicine, Nova Scotia Health Authority, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Nova Scotia and the Department of Health and Wellness.

","
Doctors often stay in the communities where they get their training. That is why a program designed to introduce medical students to what it is like to practise in rural Nova Scotia is expanding to the South Shore.
Starting this September, five medical school students from Dalhousie University will spend their entire third year getting hands-on training in Bridgewater, Lunenburg and Liverpool through the Longitudinal Integrated Clerkship Program. Traditionally, third-year students do their clerkships with short placements in various communities. 
“This program is a really effective way to show students what it’s like to practise in rural areas,” said Health and Wellness Minister Randy Delorey. “We hope the early exposure to smaller communities on the South Shore will interest them in eventually building careers there.”
The medical students will gain community-based education under the supervision of local doctors during their 48-week clerkship. They will also work with other health-care providers in the community.
The Health Services Foundation of the South Shore, South Shore Regional Hospital Auxiliary and Queens General Hospital Foundation will provide funding to make necessary upgrades to both South Shore Regional and Queens General Hospitals to prepare for the clerkship program. 
The clerkship program was first launched in September 2019 in Cape Breton, with four students training in North Sydney and New Waterford.  
Government is investing about $130,000 in the South Shore program.

Quotes:
The continued investment by government in Nova Scotian longitudinal clerkships will provide Dalhousie Medical School students an excellent educational experience and expose them to 48 weeks of patient-centred, community-based care on the South Shore.
Dr. David Anderson, dean, Dalhousie Faculty of Medicine

I’m excited to return to the area where I grew up and become involved in the community as a medical student and future physician. I chose the clerkship because of the educational experience and the ability to follow patients throughout the clerkship. I look forward to learning from physicians who live and practice medicine in rural communities, which I plan to do when I finish training.
Emily Rogers, second year medical student doing clerkship in Bridgewater

The launch of the South Shore Longitudinal Integrated Clerkship would not be possible without the commitment of local physicians who are passionate about practising rural medicine. Our physicians value the merits of medical education and look forward to training future doctors.
Dr. Gregory Thibodeau, site director, South Shore Longitudinal Integrated Clerkship



Quick Facts:

government is providing more training opportunities in rural areas through the clerkship program and the expansion of residency seats in rural Nova Scotia
the residency training program is an effective recruitment tool; for example, 21 of 29 residents who trained at the Annapolis Valley site from 2012-17, stayed to practise in the same or similar communities
the university’s goal is to have one third of its medical students take part in the clerkship program around the province, over the next four years
clerkships give students the opportunity to participate as part of the clinical team and begin to care for patients
four first-year medical seats were added to Dalhousie Medical School last August; 12 more will be added this August, for a total of 94 first-year seats 
the local hospital foundations and auxiliary will contribute approximately $890,000 to create on-call sleep spaces at both South Shore Regional and Queens General Hospitals, which will also benefit physician recruitment and retention in the area

","
More Nova Scotia Liquor Corp. (NSLC) stores across the province will start selling cannabis to address geographical gaps and to better combat the illicit market.
Finance and Treasury Board Minister Karen Casey announced today, Feb. 14, that renovations will begin in 14 stores as soon as possible. Some of the new locations will be ready this fall and all stores will be completed by the end of the next fiscal year.
“We have said all along that we will move slowly and safely and need to be socially responsible and we are ready to take the next step, said Ms. Casey. “We have recognized that online sales so far have not addressed areas of the province where there was a gap and it is apparent that new customers want the in-store experience. We feel that opening more stores is the most effective way to deal with the illicit market, protect our children and keep communities safe.”
Recent NSLC research showed that one of the reasons customers are buying from the illicit market is because there is no cannabis store in their area. 
New cannabis stores will be located in Annapolis Royal, Baddeck, Barrington Passage, Berwick, Elmsdale, Glace Bay, Liverpool, Mahone Bay, Bedford (Mill Cove), Port Hawkesbury, Sydney Mines, Dartmouth (Tacoma Drive), Tantallon and Tatamagouche.
A request for proposals is expected to be issued in April.

Quotes:
We’re pleased to announce that we will more than double the number of cannabis stores we have across the province. It’s an important step in fulfilling our mandate to make legal cannabis accessible to adult Nova Scotians who wish to purchase it and critical to making an impact on the illicit market.
Greg Hughes, president and CEO, NSLC



Quick Facts:

the addition of 14 new outlets will result in a total of 26 NSLC cannabis stores across Nova Scotia
the selected stores were based on their geographic location, space to accommodate a cannabis store and the ability to renovate the stores cost effectively

Pre-primary helps support educational, social and emotional development of children and supports their learning and growth the year before they start school. 
That is why every four-year-old in the province will have access to this free, universal program in September 2020.  
Premier Stephen McNeil announced today, Feb. 11, the final expansion of the program to the remaining 48 school communities.
“When we launched pre-primary, our goal was to give families of four-year-olds across our province an early learning opportunity, at no cost, the year before their child starts school,” said Premier McNeil. “That vision is about to become a reality. In September, every family with a four-year-old who wants pre-primary, will have access to pre-primary, regardless of income or where they live.

Lester Lilly, parent of a child in pre-primary at Chebucto Heights Elementary

Anna McCurdy, parent of a pre-primary graduate from Chebucto Heights Elementary

Pre-primary made a huge difference for my child because it allowed her to love school and interact with children. She has made friends along the way. She learned so much and it made the transition into primary easier for her, because she was familiar with how the school worked.

","
Children and teenagers who need mental health and addictions help are getting better care, faster, as a result of innovative work at the IWK Health Centre in Halifax. 
Over the last four years, access to community mental health and addictions care at the region’s children’s hospital has improved by 75 per cent. Young people who need emergency care are seen immediately and nearly all cases assessed as needing urgent care are seen in under four days. 
For non-urgent care, 72 per cent are seen within 28 days and the average wait is 22 days.
The improvements are the result of new innovative practices that have led to faster access to the IWK’s community mental health and addictions services. This work has meant families accessing care, frontline staff and senior staff working together and sharing input to identify where changes could be made to improve care. 
“I am pleased to see the success the IWK has had in improving access to care by working with families and clinicians. This work is making a positive difference to those looking for support as well as those caring for them,” said Health and Wellness Minister Randy Delorey.
The work focuses on four areas, access, quality of care, productivity and staff satisfaction. All have seen positive results:

75 per cent improvement in wait times
98 per cent of patients and families report satisfaction in the quality of care
82 per cent of staff report high levels of satisfaction
90 per cent of appointments are attended, due to changes to IWK’s referral and intake system which fills cancelled appointments

Anyone experiencing a mental health crisis should call the 24/7 toll-free provincial Mental Health Crisis Line at 1-888-429-8167. The line provides crisis intervention for children, youth and adults.

Quotes:
Our system has grown and changed in unbelievable ways over the past eight years. This has been a true team effort. As clinicians, we are striving to be transparent in our processes and engaging with families in new and innovative ways. It’s exciting.
Dr. Sharon Clark, advanced practice leader, IWK Mental Health and Addictions program

The IWK has been a valuable partner to our mental health-care staff and clients, and instrumental in assisting us in navigating the processes and care of complex cases, providing staff education and consultation and inviting us to joint training opportunities. The IWK has been incredibly open and willing to learn from us about the unique cultural, traditional, historical and linguistic needs of our mutual clients. Our experiences and journey with the IWK have been progressing working toward a two-eyed seeing system of care.
Sharon Rudderham, director, Eskasoni Health Centre

The IWK Mental Health and Addictions staff were absolutely wonderful. They were kind, caring, and professional. I was invited into a team-based, focused approach, that while sympathetic to my child’s condition, affects it had on our family, they were first of mind to support my daughter’s diagnosis and treatment plan. Nursing staff demonstrated leadership in managing my child’s illness while providing treatment during some very stressful days.
Suzanne MacDonald, mother of IWK patient

","
Nova Scotians deserve access to reliable, high-speed internet service, so they can live where they choose while staying connected and helping to grow our economy. 
That is why government is making sure more Nova Scotians will have access to high-speed internet connections, with the announcement today, Feb. 7, of the first round of Internet for 
Nova Scotia Initiative projects. 
Currently, about 70 per cent of homes and businesses have access to high speed internet. Today’s announcement means 86 per cent of homes and businesses will have access to the service, close to the goal of achieving more than 95 per cent.
“This is great progress. A better-connected Nova Scotia is critical to our expanding economy and our quality of life. Today’s Internet for Nova Scotia Initiative investments, and those to come, will ensure high-speed internet is available to as many homes and businesses as possible,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. 
Contracts with five internet service providers including Cross Country, in Canning, Kings Co., Mainland Telecom, in Middleton, Seaside Communications in Sydney, Bell Canada, and Xplornet, based in Woodstock, New Brunswick, have been signed with Develop Nova Scotia.
Multiple communities are captured under independent projects by Cross Country, Mainland, Seaside and Bell Canada using wired technology while Xplornet will cover about 16,000 unserved homes and businesses in Cumberland and Colchester counties through a mix of wired and fixed wireless services. Overall, the projects provide access to connections for more than 42,000 homes and businesses.
Through the Nova Scotia Internet Trust Fund -- a $193 million fund established in 2018 by the government -- an investment of almost $45 million is committed to these projects. The investment leverages funds of about $56 million in private and other public sector funding.
Work has already begun in a few areas and will start in most communities early this year. It is anticipated to be substantially complete over the next year. Another call for projects will be issued by Develop Nova Scotia next week to seek projects for areas that remain underserved and unserved. Announcements for those projects are anticipated to be announced this summer. 

Quotes:
Great places are accessible and they’re connected. The Internet for Nova Scotia Initiative is a transformative project - in the way services can be delivered and accessed, to support business startup and growth, for tourism and for residents. Our job is to ensure the project is managed with integrity, significant public investment is managed prudently and value is maximized and the service that is ultimately delivered is reliable and high quality now and in the future. We are committed to delivering this for Nova Scotians.
Jennifer Angel, CEO, Develop Nova Scotia

We are beyond excited for this announcement because it means not only Luckett Vineyards and the local wine industry, but all rural businesses in this part of the province, will have the opportunity to step into the 21st century. This empowers operators to modernize, increase efficiency, market our business and tell our stories on a broad scale. More comprehensive and faster operating systems will allow us to offer value-added services to our customers and continue to market our business in a modern and consistent manner.
Geena Luckett, owner/general manager, Luckett Vineyards

","
New national screening protocols to respond to novel coronavirus have been established. 
Travellers coming to Canada from Hubei province, China, continue to be at an increased risk for novel coronavirus infection. If you have travelled to Hubei province in the last 14 days, limit your contact with others (self-isolation, stay at home) for 14 days from your last day there.
Steps you should take include: 

avoiding close contact with individuals with chronic conditions, compromised immune systems and senior citizens
avoiding having visitors to your home
avoiding situations such as social gatherings, work, school, daycare, visiting other people who are in a health-care facility or senior’s residence
limiting taking public transit, taxis and ride sharing
washing your hands often with soap and warm water frequently for at least 20 seconds; use hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available
covering your mouth and nose with your arm when coughing or sneezing

People in Nova Scotia who self-isolate can receive supporting health information from Nova Scotia Health Authority public health by contacting the nearest office. Contact information for public health offices can be found at http://www.nshealth.ca/public-health-offices . 
People who have travelled from any other part of China in the last 14 days are asked to closely monitor their health for 14 days from their last day in China.
Anyone with either of the travel histories noted above who develop a fever, cough or difficulty breathing should call 811 to arrange an assessment and testing for novel coronavirus at their closest emergency department. 
Screening is now in place at ten Canadian airports, including Halifax Stanfield International. People who have been in Hubei province in the last 14 days will be asked questions about their health by Canada Border Services Agency personnel and provided information about symptoms and self-isolation, if applicable.
To date, there have been no cases of coronavirus in Nova Scotia. The small number of cases in Canada are directly connected to Hubei province or someone in the same household.
“The risk of novel coronavirus to Nova Scotians remains low. The best advice continues to be to follow proper hygiene practices, which help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses like the flu and coronavirus,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health. “I recognize this situation is creating uncertainty and even fear for some people. These measures are being put in place because we have a better understanding of this virus and its impact in China.”
“This is an evolving situation and Canada’s response will evolve with it. We have well-established provincial response plans in place should a case be confirmed in Nova Scotia.”
Nova Scotia public health officials are working closely with their colleagues across Canada to make sure cases of coronavirus are quickly identified and managed.

Quick Facts:

in December 2019, cases of pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, China caused by a new virus that hadn’t been seen in humans; this virus is known as the 2019 novel coronavirus or 2019-nCoV

","
Replacing imported fossil fuels with a locally sourced renewable resource will create a new market for lower grade forest fibre and reduce the carbon footprint of public buildings. 
That is why six public buildings have been chosen as the first ones to convert from older, fossil fuel heating systems to new, efficient wood chip heating systems. A tender has been issued to five pre-qualified vendors for the design, construction and operation of modern biomass boilers that use wood chips from private woodlots.
The sites are:

Hants East Rural High School, Milford, Hants Co.
Perennia Park Atlantic Centre for Agri-Innovation, Bible Hill
Bridgewater Provincial Court, Bridgewater
Centre of Geographic Sciences, Lawrencetown, Annapolis Co.
Memorial High School, Sydney Mines
Riverview High School, Sydney

""This initiative will help develop new, long-term markets for lower grade wood by replacing imported oil with locally sourced wood chips,"" said Lands and Forestry Minister Iain Rankin. ""Creating a new market for lower grade wood will improve the economics of sustainable forest management, leading to healthier forests and a stable market for woodlot owners. ""
A task team made up of 11 provincial departments and public sector agencies selected the sites, which make up the first phase of a long-term effort to develop a new market for modern wood heating and eventually district heat. These sites were chosen for high likelihood of success after geotechnical and environmental readiness evaluations were completed.
The tender closes March 5 and the wood heat systems should be operating by the end of November, in time for the next heating season.
Investigating efficiency of small-scale wood energy projects and converting some government buildings to wood heat energy was a recommendation from Prof. Bill Lahey’s Independent Review of Forest Practices. It also aligns with suggestions provided to the Forestry Transition Team, which is looking for new ways to market Nova Scotia’s wood chips following the closure of the Northern Pulp mill.

","
Bringing people together to develop new ideas around preventing domestic violence can help break the harmful cycle of such violence in communities around the province.
Community groups and organizations can now apply for two types of domestic violence prevention grants to develop and test new ways to prevent domestic violence, support victims and their families and share the story of what they are learning about how to address this complex issue. 
This is the second round of grants through Standing Together, government’s action plan to prevent domestic violence. 
“We’re learning so much from the projects underway across the province. This new call for proposals will mean more groups can test their ideas that could improve the safety and well-being of Nova Scotians,” said Kelly Regan, minister responsible for the Advisory Council on the Status of Women. “By working differently, we intend to build the capacity, collaboration and knowledge that will help us in mapping the best path forward for Nova Scotia.”
The new Connect grants provide up to $25,000 for up to 12 months. The grants bring people together to develop learning and teaching tools and ways to tell the story of how groups are working to prevent and disrupt cycles of violence. These projects will conclude by March 31, 2021.
In addition, the Advisory Council on the Status of Women is launching a second call for Shift grants, which provide up to $75,000 for up to 24 months to explore, develop, and test new ideas for preventing domestic violence and supporting victims. These projects will conclude by March 31, 2022.
Organizations can apply for the grants until March 4, 2020. Applications are available at http://www.novascotia.ca/standingtogether .

Quick Facts:

the grants are part of government’s $9 million investment in Standing Together 
over the next few years, the Advisory Council on the Status of Women will work with community organizations and groups to build a provincial plan to break the harmful cycles of domestic violence in homes, workplaces and communities. The knowledge gained from these projects will be used to help develop the plan 
in April 2019, 24 community organizations and groups received grants to prevent domestic violence. These grants supported projects focused on addressing domestic violence in specific communities, including African Nova Scotian and Mi’kmaw communities. Other projects focus on engaging and developing supports for groups such as children and youth, men and boys, girls and young women and women living with disabilities

","
Forestry contractors affected by the closure of the Northern Pulp mill can apply for short-term repayable financing, starting Tuesday, Feb. 4.
Last week, government announced it was working with credit unions to deliver a program that could help forestry contractors with payments on their equipment loans on a short-term basis.  
Eligible contractors include those who have been engaged in commercial forestry harvesting and trucking in Nova Scotia during the past 12 months and have external financing arrangements in place for at least one of the following classes of commercial forestry harvesting and trucking equipment: feller buncher, harvester, processor, forwarder, skidder, roundwood truck, or chip or hog fuel truck.
“We are monitoring, listening and working hard to respond to needs of forestry workers and businesses as they look for new customers and adjust to the changing dynamics in the sector,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “This program, along with other initiatives that have and will be rolled out, are meant to help the sector transition and ensure forestry has a strong future in Nova Scotia.”
Qualifying contractors can access a line of credit worth up to three months of scheduled principal and interest payments on qualified commercial forestry equipment to a maximum of $180,000. Within two years, the line of credit will convert to a loan with the term ending five years from the start of the line of credit. There is an option to renew for an additional five years, at the discretion of the lending credit union. The maximum interest on any loan under this program is the Atlantic Central prime rate plus four per cent. The assistance is guaranteed by the province.
The program will be available through the 16 credit unions across the province that offer the Small Business Loan Guarantee Program. The two programs are separate, and the Forestry Contractor Financing Program will have a more simplified application process.
The program will be available for applications at the participating credit unions until June 30, 2020.  

Quotes:
Credit unions and their employees are an integral part of the communities they serve. We’re ready and willing to do our part to help affected people in the forestry sector.
Mike Leonard, president and CEO, Atlantic Central and League Savings and Mortgage, the trade association for credit unions in Atlantic Canada



Quick Facts:

to date, the $50 million transition fund is supporting: $7 million for more silviculture and road work on both Crown land and private lands; $5 million for government to provide a guarantee for this financing program; $1.5 million to help workers from across the sector connect to customized programming in the skilled trades, at no cost, and emergency assistance funding for laid-off workers available through local Access Nova Scotia centres
a toll-free line (1-888-315-0110) is available for those affected and have questions
a confidential, 24-7 support line (1-866-885-6540) is available for anyone who may need emotional support

Six hospitals are getting upgrades to improve the space used to train family medicine residents.
Infrastructure funding of $3.15 million will help finish the work being done to accommodate new family residents in New Glasgow, Truro, Amherst, Antigonish and Inverness.  It will also allow for construction of a new building next to the Valley Regional Hospital in Kentville.
The work varies in each location. It ranges from renovating or creating space for training, adding a room for residents to stay when they are on call, furniture or technology.  
“We are working hard to train, attract and keep family doctors in Nova Scotia, and the family medicine residency program is one of best recruiting tools,” said Health and Wellness Minister Randy Delorey. “It is important they have the space and equipment they need to get the most out of their residency.”
Work is underway in New Glasgow, Truro, Amherst, Antigonish, and Inverness. A tender for the Kentville project will be issued in a couple of months. 

Quick Facts:

government announced 10 new family medicine residency spaces in 2018 as part of Dalhousie University’s Family Medicine Residency Training Program
residents spend two years in a family practice where they follow patients and gain skills and experience in areas like maternal care, mental health and senior care
the residency training program is an effective recruitment tool; for example, 21 of 29 residents who trained at the Annapolis Valley site (2012-17) stayed to practise in the same or similar communities

Cape Breton will soon have a new arts and culture hub thanks to funding through Invest Nova Scotia.
New Dawn Enterprises, a Cape Breton not-for-profit, will be able to complete the construction of The Convent into a space that will provide affordable studio and workspace for 150 artists and creative entrepreneurs.
The $1.4 million investment was announced today, Jan. 31, by Invest Nova Scotia’s independent board of directors.
“Arts and cultural spaces like The Convent allow people from all different backgrounds to collaborate and learn from one another, and that’s important to fueling an artist’s creativity,” said Business Minister Geoff MacLellan. “This investment from Invest Nova Scotia will help The Convent make space more accessible to the arts and cultural sectors, supporting more artists who want to grow their businesses.” 
The 40,000 square foot building is located at the former Holy Angels Convent in Sydney. New Dawn purchased the site in 2013, and in 2017 started the $15 million renovations to turn the space into an arts and cultural hub. The funding from Invest Nova Scotia helps to complete the building’s public art, outdoor grounds, furnishings and build a café.
When complete, the arts and culture hub will feature 21 private studios, 22 workspaces, two presentation spaces, a 400 square foot gallery and will house four anchor tenants.

Quotes:

Affordable work, collaboration and presentation space was noted as one of the biggest gaps in the creative community in Cape Breton, so we’re pleased to be able to support this project and help this valuable sector grow.
Kenneth Deveau, board chair of Invest Nova Scotia.

Our children, and our children’s children, will see the full revitalization and impact of The Convent – a powerful and progressive transformation of our economy and our culture. If we have a vibrant arts community here, there’s far more likelihood that people will be attracted to come to Cape Breton, and more likely to stay.
Dr. John Gainer, New Dawn board director and The Convent Advisory Committee chair

Celtic Colours International Festival has been committed to being a part of this project since it was just a concept. We recognize its full potential to support and energize the creative economy of Cape Breton and are thrilled to be among the first tenants in The Convent, and look forward to the opportunities for collaboration and innovation that will ensue for all who will be a part of this space.

","
A consortium with a strong Nova Scotia presence has been selected to design, build, finance, operate and maintain a section of the Highway 104 which will be twinned between Sutherlands River, Pictou Co. and Antigonish.
Dexter Nova Alliance was one of three proponents shortlisted to bid on the project.  The company submitted the highest scoring proposal, based on technical approach, financing and overall cost. As the preferred proponent, the province will negotiate terms of a final agreement, including costs, before the end of March.
“The successful proponent is highly qualified with a long history of building high-quality roads in Nova Scotia,” said Lloyd Hines, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal. “The selection of a preferred proponent represents another significant step toward making the highway between Sutherlands River and Antigonish safer for motorists.”
The project agreement with Dexter Nova Alliance is expected to be finalized in April. Once the contract is formally awarded, project cost information will be made public. 
Construction will start this spring and be completed no later than the end of 2023.
The province also approved an early works agreement that will allow for design and permitting work to proceed immediately so that construction can start this spring.

Quick Facts:

the Highway 104 Sutherlands River to Antigonish project involves building just west of Exit 31 in Antigonish. The completed project will provide a continuous twinned Highway 104 from the New Brunswick border to east of Antigonish at Taylors Road, near South River
the existing highway will be twinned except for an about 10 kilometres section of new four-lane highway that will go south of the existing highway near Barneys River Station to west of James River near Pushie Road
there have been 320 collisions, including 18 fatalities in 13 fatal collisions on the untwinned portion of Highway 104 from Exit 27 Sutherlands River to Exit 31 Antigonish since 2009
the public-private-partnership approach will result in new twinned portions of the highway being opened much earlier than a traditional build model. This approach will be done without tolls or staff reductions
the project also includes the proponent taking over ongoing operating and maintenance responsibilities for the twinned portion of the highway and another 25 kilometres of existing highway. That includes snow removal, pothole repair and any repaving that may be required over the 20-year agreement
a request for qualification was issued on July 23, 2018 resulting in a shortlist of three bidders. The shortlisted bidders were invited to submit proposals, which were received Nov. 13, 2019

The province has set up a website to provide Nova Scotians with information about novel coronavirus – https://www.novascotia.ca/coronavirus .
“While the risk to Canadians and Nova Scotians remains low, it is important to share accurate information about novel coronavirus,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health. “I want to assure all Nova Scotians that public health officials here in Canada, and around the world, are working together and that the provincial health system has the necessary screening, testing and infection control protocols in place.”
At this time there are no cases of novel coronavirus in Nova Scotia and no transmission of the virus anywhere in Canada.
As it is flu season, people are reminded of the importance of routine preventative measures to stay healthy. These include:

frequent handwashing
coughing and sneezing into your elbow or a tissue
staying home when you are sick
avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth
not sharing items that may have saliva on them
frequently cleaning surfaces like taps, doorknobs and countertops

","
As Nova Scotia’s economy continues to grow, government is committed to ensuring all workers can get ahead. That is why, on April 1, Nova Scotia’s minimum wage rate will increase by $1 an hour, to $12.55 per hour. 
This increase represents the largest annual increase to Nova Scotia’s minimum wage since 2010. 
“All Nova Scotians should benefit from our province’s economic growth and steadily improving business environment,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “We are committed to moving forward in a balanced way by making changes that benefit both workers and businesses.”
Government is also eliminating the inexperienced minimum wage. Currently, employers can pay an inexperienced rate when an employee has less than three months’ experience in the kind of work they do and has worked for them for less than three months. The decision to remove the inexperienced minimum wage will bring Nova Scotia in line with all other provinces and territories across Canada. 
Government will support businesses by eliminating the partial hour rule in Nova Scotia. Currently, the partial hour rule requires employers to round up time worked for minimum wage earners. This means if an employee works for 15 to 30 minutes, the employee must be paid for a half hour. If an employee works for 31 to 60 minutes, the employee must be paid for a full hour.  
Businesses have been advocating to remove the partial hour rule, as it will help lessen the costs and the administrative burden associated with the provision and reduce the overall regulatory burden.
“Our government is committed to building an economy that works for all of us,” said Minister of Labour and Advanced Education Labi Kousoulis. “These changes will help us to achieve that by fostering a stronger workforce and supporting businesses across the province.” 

Quick Facts:

a $12.55 per hour minimum wage means Nova Scotia will have the second highest minimum wage in Atlantic Canada
the increase brings Nova Scotia closer to the highest minimum wage in the country, which is $15 per hour
Nova Scotia has the lowest business incorporation fee in the country and there is no fee to register in the first year of business
in 2017, government committed to reducing regulatory burden to businesses by $25 million. The initiative was the first of its kind in Nova Scotia and was part of a broader strategy to build a strong foundation for economic growth
in January 2019, government reported on more than 60 regulatory initiatives that were estimated to save businesses $34 million annually, exceeding its $25 million target. Significant efforts included the modernization of the Registry of Joint Stocks Companies, estimated to save businesses over $7 million dollars annually and the Business Navigator Service, estimated to have saved businesses approximately $3.4 million dollars since being launched in 2017 
building on this momentum, government has set a new target of reducing undue burden to businesses by an additional $10 million annually by the end of 2020 
government continues to make investments in programs and initiatives aimed at saving businesses money. In 2017, an increase to the small business tax threshold from $350,000 to $500,000 was announced, meaning more savings to invest in their businesses and people
building a stronger workforce and retaining more young people is also a priority for government. Salary incentive programs like Graduate to Opportunity make it easier for businesses and employers to hire recent graduates

","
In order to ensure the province’s justice system is more responsive to the needs of Nova Scotians, government is extending the timeframe for people to file complaints about municipal police.
Changes to the Police Act Regulations, which come into effect Jan. 15, 2021, will extend the timeframe for someone to file a complaint regarding a municipal police service from six to 12 months. The changes also grant the police complaints commissioner the authority to extend the timeframe if there are good reasons for doing so and it is not contrary to the public interest. These changes align with legislation governing RCMP which allow 12 months for people to bring forth complaints. 
“It is important people have improved access to justice, including the same amount of time to file a complaint about police conduct, regardless of the police force that serves their community,” said Mark Furey, Attorney General and Minister of Justice.  “This change directly responds to a need that was identified by the Office of the Police Complaints Commissioner, the Halifax Board of Police Commissioners and Prof. Scot Wortley in his 2019 Halifax Street Checks report. A recent sexual assault victim’s experience with the complaints process also highlighted the need for change. We know that sometimes people, and often victims, require more time to decide if they want to bring a concern forward. This timeframe offers people greater flexibility.” 

Quotes:
The Halifax Board of Police Commissioners is in full agreement with this decision. We asked the Justice minister to make this change so that our timelines for complaints would be consistent with the RCMP.  This change also responds to community concerns with the six-month timeline for filing a complaint as outlined in Prof. Wortley’s report.
Carole McDougall, acting chair, Halifax Board of Police Commissioners

Increasing the time to file a complaint to one year is a positive change and one that I think will be welcomed by the public.  While most complaints come in soon after the interaction with the police, there are times when this is not possible.  Having more time to submit a complaint will help someone make the decision that is right for them.
Judith McPhee, police complaints commissioner



Quick Facts:

the Nova Scotia Police Act provides oversight of municipal police forces and assigns the duties of the police complaints commissioner
the Office of the Police Complaints Commissioner investigates complaints by people alleging misconduct by municipal police officers. The office does not handle complaints against members of the RCMP
in 2018, the commissioner received 197 complaints 
people may file a complaint directly with the Office of the Police Complaints Commissioner, at the police agency or with the local board of police commissioners in the municipality in which the incident allegedly occurred
this change responds to recommendation 4.11 in the Wortley Report

The replacement parkade is necessary before construction starts on the hospital site, as it will replace about 800 spaces lost when the existing parkade comes down.  
The parkade will have up to 900 parking spaces and sit on the current parking lot of the Museum of Natural History. A small portion of land, about a half-acre, owned by Halifax Regional Municipality is needed to build the replacement parkade. This will not be built on recreational space. 
Work is already underway on a temporary parking lot on the other side of the museum to replace the spaces lost as a result of the new construction.
About 2,700 parking spaces are needed based on a parking study conducted for the province. To meet the future parking needs, the parking strategy also includes underground parking at the new cancer centre, inpatient centre and outpatient centre buildings and the use of existing lots on the Halifax Infirmary site. 
The parkade tender closes March 5. 
A fact sheet on parking is available at:  https://healthredevelopment.novascotia.ca/updates/halifax-infirmary-expansions-parking .

Quick Facts:

14,000 people visit the QEII Health Sciences Centre every day, 40 per cent of whom travel from outside HRM

the expansion of the Halifax Infirmary site involves constructing 1.4 million square feet of new space, which includes the construction of a new cancer centre, outpatient centre, research and innovation centre, and an expanded inpatient centre (hospital beds and operating rooms)
there has been ongoing discussion about parking with the municipality since April 2019 and the matter will be referred to Regional Council in the coming weeks
this work will support the eventual closure of the Centennial and Victoria buildings on the Victoria General site of the QEll Health Sciences Centre in Halifax
the QEII New Generation project is the largest health-care infrastructure project in the province’s history

","
Post-secondary students now have easier access to mental health supports with the launch of the HealthyMindsNS website.
The site provides access to a suite of online mental health supports and services that are free to students and complement the in-person counselling services available on campuses.
“Mental health issues affect many of us at certain times throughout our lives. Post-secondary students may be at particular risk due to the changes and pressures they often experience,” said Minster of Labour and Advanced Education Labi Kousoulis. “I am pleased this initiative is providing access to valuable mental health supports.”
Mental health issues require a spectrum of care, including in-person treatment and counselling. Online services can play an important role in providing students with a variety of support options that can be accessed at any time and in a private way.
HealthyMindsNS recognizes that mental health is not just the job of the individual to manage – as a community, we all play a role in caring for one another. Kognito was introduced as part of the suite of services within HealthyMindsNS to assist faculty and staff to prepare for conversations with students and refer them to the supports they need. 

Quotes:
“Student mental health is not a nine to five issue. This suite of services complements in-person care by providing anonymous, around the clock services to help students in need. As students, we all face routine stressors–academics, work, extra curriculars, finances, relationships and more. These tools help students by providing several free, accessible outlets to help mitigate hardships when students need it most”.

Mary Navas, chair of StudentsNS

Safe, healthy and welcoming campuses are a priority for all our universities. The delivery of online mental health services is an important element in our universities’ commitment to the active promotion of student health and wellness.
William Lahey, president and vice-chancellor, University of King’s College and chair, Council of Nova Scotia University Presidents

The wellness of our students and employees is a top priority for NSCC. Kognito's online training offers NSCC employees an additional tool to strengthen their ability to lead meaningful conversations with students about their academic, social, emotional and physical health.

","
Staying healthy, active and connected to your community is important as you age. That is why government is asking those involved in a well-established adult day program in the Annapolis Valley to create a model other rural communities can use to start their own programs to support older Nova Scotians. 
Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC) is receiving $210,000 from the province to build on the success of the Adult Day Program that started at its Annapolis Valley Campus in Middleton 10 years ago. It is a caregiver respite care program offering recreation and social programming for seniors. NSCC students also help seniors with haircuts and styling, preparing meals and staying socially active.
The investment will allow NSCC to work with its partners, including Nova Scotia Health Authority (NSHA), to develop best practices to help other communities interested in starting a Centre of Rural Aging and Health (CORAH) program. The goal is to make it easier for older Nova Scotians to access services and resources in their communities by offering them in one location. It will be expanded to three more communities across the province.
“We want to leverage the great work happening at NSCC’s Annapolis Valley Campus and see how we can apply its knowledge to help other communities benefit from this innovative co-operative approach,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “We hope more communities will look to start programs like this to support aging Nova Scotians in their communities.”
The college will develop an evaluation framework to ensure subsequent programs meet the needs of seniors and the communities they serve. NSCC is also developing a Community Transportation Map of Nova Scotia to enable seniors to navigate their communities.

Quotes:
Through programs and partnerships such as the Adult Day Program and now CORAH, we’re leveraging the immense strength of the college to inspire sustainable, vibrant, resilient communities. It’s my hope that NSCC’s culture of collaboration, which is so plainly infused into this project, will not only work to improve the health and well-being of our province’s seniors, it will serve as a demonstration of what’s possible when partners in industry, community and government come together.
Don Bureaux, president, Nova Scotia Community College

With help from many people along the way, my husband Fred and I were able to access the many resources we needed during his journey with Parkinson’s. The Adult Day Program in Middleton stands out because it kept him healthy in mind and body, and the social interaction with the staff and the other clients, as well as the NSCC students, daycare children and other visitors was invaluable.
Maggie Rice, caregiver to her late husband Fred Rice

The Adult Day Program has enhanced our studies by allowing us to see the joy that spending quality time together to chat and learn about new topics can bring to the people who participate. It’s reinforced my desire to work hard in my studies as a continuing care assistant student and to give back to seniors in my community.
Carly Dawn Floris, continuing care certificate student, NSCC Annapolis Valley Campus

Government is working with credit unions to offer short-term repayable financing for forestry contractors affected by the pending closure of the Northern Pulp mill. 
The program will be available to eligible forestry contractors with the intention of helping  them with payments on their equipment loans on a short-term basis.
The transition team endorsed the approach at its latest meeting on Jan. 21.
“We are hearing from the industry that contractors need some help to make sure they can cover loan payments while they are looking for new customers and adjusting to changes in the sector,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “As a government, we want and need a forestry industry in Nova Scotia because it helps drive our rural economy and that’s why we are making sure these businesses have options. I appreciate the leadership of credit unions and their willingness to offer this program.”

Government is inviting Nova Scotians to share their views on how property is divided at the end of a domestic relationship.
People can share their opinions on the Matrimonial Property Act starting today, Jan. 23, through an online survey https://novascotia.ca/family-property-law-survey/ .
Currently, in Nova Scotia, the law on how family property - such as homes, vehicles, land, money and investments - is divided differs based upon whether a couple is married or common-law.
Government is seeking feedback on whether common-law relationships should be treated the same as married couples and registered domestic partnerships when it comes to dividing property at the end of a relationship. Feedback is also being requested on possible changes affecting rights to possess the family home, as well as the treatment of business assets, property owned before a relationship began, family debt and pensions. 
“Relationships and families today look different than they did 40 years ago when these laws were created,” said Attorney General and Minister of Justice Mark Furey.  “We know that most common-law partners or non-married couples in long-term relationships do not register as domestic partners. This means that if they separate, it is not clear, under current laws, how they should divide their property. We want to hear from Nova Scotians on whether they feel changes are needed.”

in Nova Scotia, you can register a domestic partnership for a fee of $24.95
in British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Northwest Territories and Nunavut, common-law couples who have lived together for one to three years have the same legal rights as married couples when it comes to dividing family property upon separation

Since its launch in 2017, more than 15,000 employees across the province have completed the training. 
The training is free and available at www.servingall.ca or by visiting the commission’s website at humanrights.novascotia.ca. 
Serving All Customers Better was adapted for national use by the Canadian Association of Statutory Human Rights Agencies in 2018. 
It is free and available in both French and English at http://cashra.ca/classroom/

Quick Facts:

consumer racial profiling appears as a variety of behaviours targeting individuals who may be seen as a visible minority. They include refusal of service, degrading comments, following in stores and searching without cause
in 2013, the commission released a consumer racial profiling study, Working Together to Better Serve All Nova Scotians, that engaged over 1,200 people in four geographic locations:  Halifax Regional Municipality, Millbrook, Sydney and Digby
according to the research, members of visible minority groups were three times more likely to be followed and four times more likely to be searched while shopping

","
A new service will help businesses, particularly startups, prepare for and schedule inspections required by municipal and provincial governments. 
The Inspection Navigator Service is a partnership between the Office of Regulatory Affairs and Service Effectiveness and Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM), and will serve businesses across the province. 
“Our government has made improving the business environment in our province a priority and this new service reflects that commitment,” said Premier Stephen McNeil, who is also Minister responsible for the Office of Regulatory Affairs and Service Effectiveness. “Knowing what inspections are needed and how to prepare for them can take a lot of time for a business owner — time we want them to spend on their business. This new service will help make it easier for them to do just that.”
The Inspection Navigator Service will help business owners understand the inspections that are needed. The new service is closely linked to the Business Navigator Service, launched in 2017, that helps businesses navigate the province’s regulatory system. To date, navigators have responded to 5,000 requests for support and have saved owners an average of 10 hours each, allowing them to focus on running their business.
The Inspection Navigator Service will also develop customer service training, specifically for inspectors. 

Quotes:
Inspections can be a challenge for small business. We are pleased that Nova Scotia is the first to recognize and work to improve this area and that it’s doing so in partnership with HRM. If other jurisdictions aren’t watching and learning, they should.
Jordi Morgan, vice-president Atlantic, Canadian Federation of Independent Business

Knowing what inspections you need and which level of government does them, in addition to scheduling and preparing for them, takes a lot of time and a lot of work, particularly for small businesses. Government can and should help with this.
HRM Mayor Mike Savage

The business navigators were a huge help while I was working to get The Tare Shop open. They provided me with lots of information and were always quick to respond. I’m excited about the new Inspection Navigator Service that they will be offering — it is definitely needed!
Kate Pepler, owner of The Tare Shop, HRM

","
Government wants to help casino patrons manage their play and access the support they need through a more flexible Voluntary Self Exclusion program.
New regulations that are now in effect will modernize the Voluntary Self Exclusion program to align with best practices in responsible gambling. 
In addition to the current lifetime exclusion option, participants can choose shorter minimum options ranging from six months to three years. The new process for reinstatement includes a seven-day waiting period after the expiry of the term and completion of reinstatement requirements before being allowed to re-enter a casino. Information on responsible gambling resources will also be provided for participants. 
“We heard that only having the lifetime ban option was a barrier for people thinking about enrolling in the program, as was the onerous process for reinstatement,” said Patricia Arab, Minister responsible for Part II of the Gaming Control Act. “The updated regulations are consistent with other provinces in Canada and best practices in responsible gambling.”
The new regulations will also make it less attractive to gamble while enrolled in the program. Participants in the casino in violation of their Voluntary Self Exclusion agreement will be required to forfeit any casino winnings. 

Quotes:
This is about offering a better program for Nova Scotians who want to take a break from gambling at the casino. It's important to ensure our practices provide players with more options to manage their play.

","
The province is making way for construction of a new outpatient centre on the Halifax Infirmary site of the QEll Health Sciences Centre, that will see more than 700,000 visits a year.
A tender to demolish the former CBC building on Bell Road was issued today, Jan. 21, as part of the QEll New Generation project. 
“The expansion of the Halifax Infirmary site is the heart of the QEII redevelopment,” said Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal Minister Lloyd Hines. “Removing the former CBC building is an important step to make way for a new health care facility that will serve hundreds of thousands of Nova Scotians each year.” 
Most of the services at the new outpatient centre are currently offered at the Victoria General (VG) site of the QEll and do not require an overnight stay in hospital.  The new centre will allow for the services to be offered in one location.  They include:

dialysis
diagnostic imaging (X-rays, ultrasounds and CT scan)
QEII eye care centre
heart health clinics and cardiology services such as stress testing and electrocardiogram (ECG) 
endoscopy, ear, nose and throat procedures
blood transfusions and drug therapy 
orthopedics, plastic surgery, urology and oral surgery clinics 

Along with the new outpatient centre, the Halifax Infirmary expansion also includes a new cancer centre, inpatient centre (operating rooms and hospital beds) and a new research, innovation and learning centre. 
This work will allow services to be moved out of the aging Centennial, Victoria and Dickson buildings on the Victoria General site, supporting their eventual closure.
The tender closes Feb. 6.

Quotes:
This is another significant step in moving the redevelopment project forward. Each step gets us closer to improving and creating new care spaces for our patients that are not only better equipped, but reflect a new generation of health care.

","
The province and the Municipality of the District of Argyle are partnering to establish aquaculture development areas that help grow the economy.
The two levels of government have entered into a three-year agreement to identify areas with potential for environmentally sustainable aquaculture. The agreement is the first of its kind in Nova Scotia and the first example in Canada of this approach to aquaculture development.
“I want to commend municipal leaders in Argyle for approaching us to work with them to reduce barriers to growth for aquaculture operators in their area,” said Fisheries and Aquaculture Minister Keith Colwell.  “Aquaculture, carried out environmentally, is important to food security, economic development, job growth and the growing success of Nova Scotia’s leading seafood exports.” 
Under the agreement, the province will work with the municipality to research and identify potential development areas while considering the environment, other marine users and opportunities for shellfish and marine plant aquaculture sites. This work will take the burden off potential operators as well as current operators who may not have the resources to carry out these important steps.  

Quotes:
As a council, we focus on the assets we have in the region, which include ideal conditions for oyster and other aquaculture growth. Our interest in establishing an aquaculture development area is to remove some of the barriers of entry into this complex regulatory environment, to support new and existing companies in this industry, and provide more opportunities for our residents to work, live and play here.
Danny Muise, warden of the Municipality of the District of Argyle



Quick Facts:

aquaculture development areas, once identified through professional research, analysis and public consultation, will be subject to the approval process outlined in the act
a lease and licence are required to operate a marine aquaculture site, including within aquaculture development areas
investors are not limited to aquaculture development areas and may explore other areas within the province for marine aquaculture development
Nova Scotia has been Canada’s top seafood exporter for four years in a row, valued at more than $2 billion, accounting for nearly 30 per cent of Canada’s total seafood exports
in 2018, aquaculture in the province was valued at more than $88 million and directly employed 520 Nova Scotians with 149 companies farming fish

","
Government is creating new training paths in response to concerns from workers affected by the pending closure of the Northern Pulp mill who say they want to stay in Nova Scotia. The Nova Scotia Apprenticeship Agency and Nova Scotia Community College are working together to enhance programming to connect these workers to opportunities in the skilled trades. 
Workers who participate will have free access to one-on-one career counselling and a skills training plan customized to their individual needs. Those who are ready to be certified in a skilled trade can have the fees waived.   
“I’m pleased to see ideas like this coming forward from the transition team and people in the industry,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “Providing training opportunities to help people stay and work in Nova Scotia is an important part of the commitment we made to support affected workers.”
Government will use $1.5 million of the $50 million transition fund to support this initiative, which is estimated to support about 200 workers from either the Northern Pulp mill or across the broader forestry sector.
Some workers will pursue apprenticeship in a skilled trade as a career option while others, with work experience in a trade, may challenge for certification, which would improve re-employment opportunities. Interested workers will be assessed to determine how to get the training or certification they need in the least amount of time, based on previous work experience and training.  
Opportunities could include a steamfitter/pipefitter in an industrial setting who may want to become a plumber, a person who operates heavy equipment in the woods and wants to become a heavy duty equipment technician, someone who has done electrical work at a sawmill and wants to become a construction electrician or someone who works with equipment or technologies or as a labourer who would like to acquire a skilled trade.
Workers who are interested can register by calling the Nova Scotia Apprenticeship Agency at 1-800-494-5651.

Quotes:
The community college system is designed to be highly responsive to meet the needs of individuals, employers and sectors. This training pathway will enhance an individual’s ability to be employed in sectors with a strong labour market and improve the workforce available to the forestry sector of the future.
Don Bureaux, president and CEO, Nova Scotia Community College

The Nova Scotia Apprenticeship Agency partners with industry, community organizations and equity groups to promote apprenticeship and the skilled trades, ensure that trades specific training is responsive to the needs of industry and connect Nova Scotians to employment opportunities here at home.

","
Nova Scotians can be confident in the continued safety and stability of credit unions as updated regulations and legislation take effect on July 1.
Regulatory changes have been finalized and will come into effect with the Credit Union Act and amendments that will include modernizing membership rules, such as clarifying the process for notifying members prior to a branch closure and requiring bylaws to include the appeal process for member termination. The regulations are being released now to provide credit unions with time to make the appropriate adjustments. 
“We are pleased that the regulations and oversight of credit unions will continue to foster a strong financial sector and support communities,” says Finance and Treasury Board Minister Karen Casey.  
Credit unions and Atlantic Central will now be able to foster growth across provincial boundaries to encourage diversification and to manage risk, in keeping with recent federal changes. The federal government changed its legislative and regulatory framework making oversight of Atlantic Central, a Nova Scotia incorporated company, a provincial responsibility. 
Credit unions are an important part of the financial sector in Canada, offering a wide range of products in direct competition with other financial institutions.

","
The public can help solve a missing persons case through a unique partnership between the Nova Scotia Medical Examiner Service, RCMP, National Research Council and the New York Academy of Arts.
A human skull found in Digby in September 2019 was one of 15 skulls from Canada that were reconstructed at the New York Academy of Arts Forensic Sculpture workshop last week. Students used clay to create facial reconstructions which were photographed and placed on Canada’s Missing, the national public website that features information on missing children, missing persons and unidentified remains cases. 
A photo of the reconstruction is posted on the Canada’s Missing website. Anyone who may have information about who this person is are asked to contact the Nova Scotia Medical Examiner Service, Digby RCMP or Crime Stoppers. Individuals may also wish to send an email to the National Centre for Missing Persons and Unidentified Remains.
“We’re hoping that this reconstruction may help identify who this person was,” said Attorney General and Minister of Justice Mark Furey. “Seeing a face may prompt people to recall important information that could help identify this individual and solve their case.”
The National Research Council made its way to Nova Scotia late last year to perform a 3D scan of the skull found in the province. The scan was then printed and later turned over to the RCMP’s National Centre for Missing Persons and Unidentified Remains, which is leading the co-ordination of the facial reconstruction initiative. 

Quotes:
The RCMP is very pleased to be part of this unique partnership, which was made possible through the support and co-operation of many parties, including the Nova Scotia Medical Examiner. Our hope is that by unveiling the reconstructed faces on Canada's Missing, someone may see a face they know.
Chief Supt. Marie-Claude Arsenault, officer in charge, Sensitive and Specialized Investigative Services, RCMP

This partnership offers a unique opportunity for Canadians to take part in helping give these individuals a name. I encourage Nova Scotians to view the photo and where appropriate, submit a tip. Your contribution could help solve a mystery and help provide closure for families.
Dr. Matthew Bowes, chief medical examiner, Province of Nova Scotia



Quick Facts:

facial reconstruction is a method used to identify unknown missing persons after traditional identification methods such as fingerprinting and DNA testing fail to provide a result
skulls were selected based on their condition. No considerations were given to gender, race or circumstances of death
while this skull was found in the province, it does not mean the individual was a resident of Nova Scotia
Since 2015, four visual identifications have been directly attributed to facial reconstructions performed during the workshop
