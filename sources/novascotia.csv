The Tourism Accommodations Real Property Tax Rebate Program will provide qualified operators a 25 per cent rebate on payment of 2020-21 commercial property tax. The program opens Nov. 16. “We know that hotels, motels and inns have immediate cash flow needs because of the decline in visitors due to COVID-19,” said Geoff MacLellan, Minister of Business. “They are facing commercial tax bills assessed on the previous year’s revenues with a significantly reduced ability to pay. This is another in our range of response programs designed to fill gaps in federal programing.” To be eligible, a business must meet the definition of a roofed accommodation as set out in the Tourist Accommodation Registration Act, be registered as a host under the act, have more than five rooms and have paid their tax bill in full.  Qualified operators must, for the period from April 1, 2020 to Oct. 31, 2020, have incurred a year-over-year revenue loss for room accommodation of greater than 30 per cent compared to same period the previous year. New operators who were not in business before April 1, 2020 may still be entitled to a rebate if they can demonstrate lower than 50 per cent occupancy rate since opening their business.  Program information and eligibility criteria is available at: https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/support/#support-for-business  Quote: This program is a great first step in opening conversations with the province about the need for relief that can assist us at this time.

The province’s new eCourt pilot program provides an online platform where legal counsel for both parties are able to engage in real time, online exchanges with a judge for dispute resolution. The program, which began in July, is the first online judicial dispute resolution service in the country. “This innovative and transformative project will provide quicker and more direct access to resolutions for those experiencing divorce, child custody or spousal or child support issues,” said Mark Furey, Attorney General and Minister of Justice. “By providing legal counsel with expedited and more efficient ways for advancing their cases, we are able to improve the family justice system and better support Nova Scotia families.” eCourt offers an alternative to the traditional in-person court process, which for some can be confrontational. The online platform will also better support those who would otherwise need to arrange for childcare, transportation, time off from work or other accommodations to attend court in person. Additional features of the program include electronic filing and exchange of motions, affidavits and other court documents, virtual conferencing and the creation of an electronic record of all online proceedings.

This public inquiry will play a critical role in the ongoing response to establish the facts and circumstances of this tragedy.” The commissioners’ first task is setting up their secretariat which will be located in Nova Scotia. This includes hiring support staff, creating their work plan and other tasks. They must submit two reports on their findings, lessons learned and recommendations – an interim report by May 1, 2022 and a final report by Nov. 1, 2022.

Small Business Week 2020 (Oct. 18 to 24) is an opportunity to recognize the hard work of small business owners in Nova Scotia and their resilience and determination throughout the pandemic. “COVID-19 has had an unprecedented impact on small businesses across all sectors,” said Geoff MacLellan, Minister of Business. “Our small businesses create jobs, fuel innovation and play a key role in our economy. I encourage everyone to buy local. Supporting our small businesses this week – and every week – is good for all of us.” Small business owners and entrepreneurs develop new products, services and ways of working. This has been especially true as many small companies in Nova Scotia adapted their business models during the COVID-19 pandemic to produce hand sanitizer, protective barriers and non-medical, washable face masks. Others saw opportunities to help Nova Scotians stay safe or stay home by developing shopping websites, online platforms for concerts and home product delivery. Nova Scotia’s Crown corporations are helping small businesses become more competitive through the pandemic by helping them access and adapt to digital technology. This includes the Internet for Nova Scotia Initiative, programs to help small businesses adapt to the changing pace of business, online sales training, vendor connections (Innovacorp) and events like the in-person/online holiday Evergreen Market (Develop NS).  QUOTES: Small businesses play a critical role in our economy, especially now as we recover from the impacts of COVID-19. These companies have shown resilience as they changed their models to include e-commerce or home delivery and they’ve made their businesses safe and welcoming for customers. I encourage everyone to rediscover what your neighbourhood small businesses have to offer and make buying local your first choice. Wendy Luther, president and chief executive officer, Halifax Partnership  My tartan products business was supposed to supply the cruise ship pavilion and a number of other events that were cancelled because of COVID-19, so we knew we had to come up with something else.

The seasonal influenza vaccine is now available from most pharmacies, family doctors, family practice nurses, nurse practitioners and clinics. It can take up to two weeks for the vaccination to provide protection. Nova Scotians are encouraged to get vaccinated in the coming weeks to see the full benefit before flu season is expected to arrive in late December to early January. “With flu season nearly upon us, we need to be diligent in following public health directions and in practising the core public health practises for COVID-19,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia's chief medical officer of health. “The symptoms for influenza can be similar and we want to limit the spread of any respiratory illness in our communities. We can protect ourselves and our loved ones from influenza safely and effectively by getting our annual flu shot.” In addition to the annual vaccine it is important to practise good hand washing and proper coughing and sneezing etiquette to help prevent the spread of influenza. Flu symptoms are similar to COVID-19 and often include a sudden high fever, headache, general aches and pains, fatigue and weakness, a runny, stuffy nose, sneezing and sore throat. This year, due to COVID-19 precautions, the process for getting the flu shot may look different. Changes could include pre-screening for illness/exposure to COVID-19, making appointments rather than walking into a clinic, keeping physical distance whenever possible, requiring hand washing and mask wearing.  Quick Facts:  Nova Scotia has ordered 493,750 doses of the flu shot this year  influenza is a contagious respiratory illness caused by viruses.

The new funding stream expands eligibility criteria to include health and education infrastructure. As two areas impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, this makes it possible to address relevant COVID-19 needs in schools, nursing homes and hospitals. “Across our province and country, the COVID-19 pandemic has deeply affected life as we know it,” said Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal Minister Lloyd Hines. “In order to move forward into a new normal safely and efficiently, we need to maximize opportunities that will support job creation, contribute to the stability of our economy, and help our health and education infrastructure evolve to meet COVID-19 safety standards.” On Aug.5, the Government of Canada announced changes to the program making it possible for provinces and territories to transfer up to 10 per cent of their existing allocation to the new COVID-19 Resilience Infrastructure Stream. Under the new terms, projects under the COVID-19 Resilience Infrastructure Stream may be eligible to receive a federal contribution of up to 80 per cent of total eligible project costs. This creates a savings of about $57.7 million for the province. The COVID-19 Resilience Infrastructure Stream is one of several funding agreements the province has negotiated to help address impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of the Safe Restart Agreement announced Sept. 16, municipalities will receive $67.5 million to help address lower revenue from transit and taxes, as well as increased costs associated with COVID-19 infection prevention measures.

We have been fortunate to have few or no new cases recently, but as we have seen with our neighbouring provinces, COVID-19 can quickly find its way back into our communities. We must continue to follow all public health measures.” Tips for Halloween celebrations:  adhere to the gathering limits and celebrate with family and friends from your consistent group of 10. People can continue to gather in close social groups of up to 10 without physical distancing if attending a party or event at a home, the gathering limit is 10 people if attending a community event, 50 people with physical distancing is the maximum both indoors and outdoors. A physical distance of two metres/six feet must always be maintained from people outside of your close social group of 10 if attending an event held by a recognized business, 50 per cent of the venue’s capacity up to 200 people maximum is permitted indoors, or 250 outdoors. A physical distance of two metres/six feet must always be maintained from people outside of your close social group of 10 requirements for wearing masks in indoor public places need to be followed don’t replace your non-medical mask with a Halloween costume mask. Most Halloween masks that cover the whole face have holes for breathing. While this type of mask is fine to wear outdoors or in your home, it is not a non-medical mask that fits snugly and protects others practise good hand washing, cough/sneeze etiquette and regular cleaning of common surfaces only serve food and drinks if physical distancing and good hand hygiene practices are being followed. If you do choose to offer food, it should be either serve yourself from pre-served single servings, or a single person designated to serve food and beverages.  Now is not the time to be sharing food or drinks or using common serving cutlery  If you are planning on trick-or-treating, here are some important things to consider:  do not go trick-or-treating if you are feeling unwell or are self-isolating only trick-or-treat with people you live with, or friends from your close social group, and no more than 10 people if you see other kids getting treats from a house or pass another group on the street, stay six feet away and wait until they leave before proceeding if a house does not have any lights on, Halloween decorations or has a sign saying they are not participating, skip the house and go on to the next house try to trick-or-treat in outdoor spaces. If that is not possible and you need to trick-or-treat indoors, wear a non-medical mask and adhere to the gathering limits  keep conversations short. Do not sing or shout in exchange for Halloween candy try not to ring doorbells; instead gently knock on the door do not take treats in situations where everyone has to reach into a single container bring hand sanitizer with you and clean your hands often, especially if you are putting on and taking off a mask or face covering and touching high-touch surfaces wash your hands as soon as you get home wash your hands before and after handling and eating your treats. There is no need to clean, disinfect or quarantine treats  Advice for households giving out treats:  do not participate in any Halloween activities, including handing out store bought pre-packaged treats if you are feeling unwell or self-isolating if you are not participating in trick-or-treating this year, turn off your lights, take down decorations and put up a sign saying you are not participating if possible, sit on your porch, driveway, front yard or at your front door welcoming trick-or-treaters if you are unable to sit outside then regularly clean and disinfect doorbells, handrails, door handles wash your hands often throughout the evening with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer  try to have only one person from your household give out treats do not have many hands reaching into the same container. Use tongs or other utensils to hand out treats or place individual amounts on a table wear a non-medical mask when physical distancing cannot be maintained do not ask trick-or-treaters to sing or shout for their treats  Guidance for upcoming holidays will be released closer to the date of each holiday and will reflect the epidemiology of the province at that time.

To support this, more opportunities have been added to a second year of the bursary program for continuing care assistants. Qualified applicants will be enrolled in continuing care assistant (CCA) programs through the Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC) or private career colleges. The bursary will provide successful applicants $4,000 for full-time students or $2,000 for part-time students. The purpose of the program is to increase enrolment in the program by removing financial barriers for students. “Continuing care assistants provide tremendous contributions not only to the residents to whom they provide care, but also to the sustainability of our health-care system,” said acting Health and Wellness Minister Kelly Regan. “By continuing to support students who are interested in a career in this field, we can ease the financial responsibility often associated with post secondary programs and support growth in the workforce.” A minimum of 115 bursaries will be available through this investment. NSCC will award at least 75 bursaries, depending on the number of part-time recipients, at campuses across the province. Another 40 will be awarded through private career colleges. This is the first year the bursary program is open to students enrolled in private career colleges. Eligible students must be enrolled as a student in the CCA Education Program starting in the 2020-21 school year and must meet the application deadline of Oct. 31 for NSCC students and Dec. 31 for private career college students.   Quotes: We’ve seen these last few months just how vital our continuing care sector is to our communities. I’m so pleased the province has come forward for a second year with this positive investment in CCA students. We hope it will help encourage those wishing to study, and then work in this caring profession, to take that step. Don Bureaux, NSCC president    Quick Facts:  the bursaries are one of several Health and Wellness initiatives aimed at enhancing the continuing care workforce by focusing on the education and training of continuing care assistants   bursaries will be prioritized based on communities with greatest continuing care staffing needs  the bursary program was recommended by the Expert Advisory Panel on Long-Term Care to support workforce staffing and recruitment continuing care assistants usually undergo one year of training  funding for this initiative comes from the Canada-Nova Scotia Home and Community Care and Mental Health and Addictions Services Funding Agreement and represents a total investment of $460,000 the bursary program was first launched July of last year    Additional Resources: NSCC bursary: https://www.nscc.ca/sites/ccabursary/ Health Care Human Resource Sector Council: https://hcsc.ca/careers/continuing-care-assistant  -30- "

The province is using agricultural lime to reduce the effects of acid rain and support restoration of trout and wild Atlantic salmon habitat in the West River near Sheet Harbour and the St. Mary’s River watershed, Guysborough County. “We are continuing this successful, multi-year liming project to help protect the environment and support the freshwater fishery as well as forestry in the area,” said Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture Keith Colwell. “Liming helps fish thrive, which helps sustain popular sportfishing activities that contribute to our economy.” Lime is a natural mineral that reduces acidity in soil and water. Dropped by helicopter onto forested land, the lime works into the soil and eventually seeps into rivers. Eighty hectares will be treated this month.  The Departments of Fisheries and Aquaculture and Lands and Forestry are carrying out the liming in partnership with the Nova Scotia Salmon Association, Perennia Food and Agriculure Inc., and Dalhousie University. The project began in 2016.  Quotes: Data suggests that this helicopter liming project effectively repairs the damaging effects of acid rain on forests, soils, streams and fish. It also demonstrates that multiple partners working together can contribute to a healthier Nova Scotia environment and renewable economy. Edmund Halfyard, research scientist, Perennia Food and Agriculture Inc.    Quick Facts:  more than 263 hectares (650 acres) of land in the province has been treated with more than 2,600 tonnes of agricultural lime to date. By 2023, 575 hectares will have been treated with lime the Nova Scotia Salmon Association has been adding lime to the West River near Sheet Harbour since 2005 the Nova Scotia Sportfish Habitat Fund contributed $35,000 in 2020 to support liming efforts on the West River near Sheet Harbour this is the first time the St. Mary’s River watershed has been treated with lime Fisheries and Oceans Canada has provided $25,000 this year to the Nova Scotia Salmon Association to support the helicopter liming project, part of $250,000 they provided this year for the broader acid rain mitigation program in Nova Scotia    Additional Resources: Nova Scotia Salmon Association: https://www.nssalmon.ca  Perennia Food and Agriculture Inc.: https://www.perennia.ca  To learn about sportfishing in Nova Scotia: https://www.novascotia.ca/fish/sportfishing/ To learn about the Department of Lands and Forestry’s forest management planning: https://www.novascotia.ca/natr/forestry/   -30- "

With $1.1 million over three years, the association will help people through one-on-one counselling, creative expression, skill-building and transitional support. The project was one of 13 submissions considered under the Community Crime Intervention Initiative Fund.  “To grow strong and resilient communities, people need to be able to see a role for themselves and how they can contribute to society,” said Mark Furey, Attorney General and Minister of Justice. “iNSpiRe can help offenders chart a new path for their future and bring new and important skills back to their families and communities.” iNSpiRe: Rehearsing Reintegration is a three-phase project that uses narrative therapy,  which helps people to find their own voice and creative expression to help offenders integrate into supportive communities and rebuild a sense of self outside of the correctional system.   Phases include:   Kintsugi Monologues – uses narrative theory and therapy during incarceration to show offenders their future can be different than their past Exit Strategy Program – one-to-one counselling to identify issues three months prior to release  iNSpiRe in the Community – provides a transitional space for skill-development, mentorship, housing, employment and community support following their release  Nova Scotia has also extended the funding provided through the Nova Scotia Guns and Gang Violence Action Fund to the following crime prevention and intervention services and initiatives until March 31, 2023:   Mi’kmaw Legal Support Network, bail verification and supervision program - $292,200 Halifax Regional Municipality, community mobilization team, $225,500 Mi’Kmaw Native Friendship Society, Seven Sparks, $225,000.

This has been a common theme delivered by the sector and that is why government has developed an improved lending program for forestry companies. The Nova Scotia Timber Loan Board now has improved lending terms, eligibility and a revised fee structure. The latest regulatory improvements are modelled on recent amendments to the regulations governing the Farm and Fisheries and Aquaculture Loan Boards and address needs experienced most acutely by small and medium sized enterprises central to the forestry sector. “We have worked hard to modernize the province’s lending boards for our key economic sectors and we’re pleased to extend the same to the forestry sector,” said Keith Colwell, Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and Aquaculture. “Now, the Timber Loan Board can provide services to help develop and innovate our forestry sector when it is needed most.” The Timber Loan Board can provide businesses with access to financing for buildings and equipment, developing business cases, upgrading facilities and land purchases at market interest rates.  Loans are administered by the Department of Agriculture’s Crown Lending Agency that also supports the Nova Scotia Farm Loan Board and the Fisheries and Aquaculture Loan Board. The regulatory changes provide uniformity among the three boards under the same operational structure and standardized service fees. The Forestry Transition Team has endorsed this plan.

Thirty-nine of 46 municipalities holding elections this fall are using some form of e-voting. There are also phone-in and advanced poll options in most municipalities. Your local government can help you find the options available in your area. It is my sincere hope that these options help more people vote.

These changes will allow people to be tested easier and faster.” The IWK Health Centre will expand its primary assessment centre to double its capacity and increase the speed of testing for children. The expansion will be fully operational by the third week of October. The IWK will also start using the gargle test tomorrow, Oct. 7, to diagnose COVID-19 in children ages four to 18. It is a more comfortable test for children. Once they’ve piloted the process, the gargle test will soon be available for children at all primary assessment centres. With the online COVID-19 self-assessment now in place, online booking for testing appointments will also be established. It will dramatically reduce the wait time to book an appointment. The online process will take about 10 minutes, down from 24 to 48 hours. Other improvements include:  expanding most primary assessment centres around the province with larger locations, longer hours and more staff so that Nova Scotians can get tested faster increasing lab capacity in Halifax to process 2,500 tests per day by mid-November adding equipment in Sydney in early November to eventually process tests instead of sending them to Halifax  “Testing is a key part of our overall COVID-19 response,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia's chief medical officer of health. “When active cases and new cases are low, we can become complacent. It can be easy to not want to get a test or wear a mask if you think there’s no virus here. In fact, it is just as important as ever.”  Quick Facts:  primary assessment centres have collected an average of 752 samples for testing per day since the beginning of September current lab capacity in Halifax is 1,500 tests per day and an average of 958 samples per day have been processed since the beginning of September    Additional Resources: More information about the gargle test is available at http://www.iwk.nshealth.ca/COVID-19/testing   -30- "

It is called the Diversity and Inclusion Program and funding will come from the Canada-Nova Scotia Labour Market Development Agreement; $2.5 million will allow the permanent career practitioner positions to be created. They work one-on one with clients to support access to quality employment and training. ""We know that access to quality employment services can be a barrier for African Nova Scotians,"" said African Nova Scotian Affairs Minister Tony Ince. ""Employment service providers are connecting the people in their communities to training and jobs.   This program will enable service providers to better reflect the communities they serve, and in turn, they’ll be able to provide increased support and outreach to other members of their communities."" The program is led by the Centre for Employment and Innovation at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish and is guided by Black leaders within the Nova Scotia Works employment services system. Nova Scotia Works centres are posting jobs individually in their communities. For information on how to apply, visit https://www.novascotia.ca/works for a full list of centres.   Quotes: I believe this is the first initiative of its kind done in this way, across the province, with Black practitioners and leaders in a system that is meant to serve everyone. As an African Nova Scotian woman, this program gives me hope. African Nova Scotians have historically experienced multiple systemic barriers to training and employment. This initiative works with African Nova Scotians and persons of African descent to open doors and create meaningful employment opportunities. Angela Bear, project lead, Centre for Employment Innovation  This is a wonderful opportunity to develop an initiative in an inclusive manner from a culturally relevant position. This is the first time in my career that government and institutions have asked, what do you need? and when we answered, they replied, we hear you. Lynda Thomas, director, YMCA Halifax Dartmouth, Nova Scotia Works  The Valley African Nova Scotian Development Association is pleased to participate in implementing this initiative.

24,2020-10-05 10:45:00,Canada,Nova Scotia,,https://novascotia.ca/news/release/?id=20201005002,Government Website,Guidance for Thanksgiving Gatherings ," Thanksgiving celebrations may look different in 2020 and government is reminding Nova Scotians of the current public health measures as the holiday approaches. People can continue to gather in close social groups of up to 10 without physical distancing. Nova Scotians are strongly encouraged to celebrate Thanksgiving with family and friends from their consistent group of 10. “Nova Scotians have made changes to their daily lives to help reduce the spread of COVID-19, and it’s no different for Thanksgiving,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health. “When deciding who to invite, consider the impacts on family and friends who may be more vulnerable and adjust your Thanksgiving celebrations to be as safe as possible.” It remains important for Nova Scotians to strictly adhere to the public health order and directives - practise good hand washing and other hygiene steps, maintain six feet of physical distance when and where required.  Here are a few other tips:  regularly clean while preparing food and disinfect other high touch surface areas in the household such as washrooms, doorknobs, countertops, tables, chairs, etc. do not host if you or someone in your household are feeling unwell or are self-isolating for any reason do not host guests who are feeling unwell or are self-isolating for any reason; you can send a meal home for them think about how to make food service more COVID-safe – for example, designate one person to prepare plates instead of passing around bowls and platters with common utensils  Rotational workers who are self-isolating are reminded that although government has eased some of the self-isolation requirements, they are not permitted to have people from outside their household to visit them on their property or in their home or go to another person’s home during their self-isolation period. Anyone who leaves the Atlantic Bubble for Thanksgiving celebrations must self-isolate for 14 days upon returning to Atlantic Canada. Guidance for upcoming holidays will be released closer to the date of each holiday and will reflect the epidemiology of the province at that time.

25,2020-10-05 09:56:00,Canada,Nova Scotia,,https://novascotia.ca/news/release/?id=20201005001,Government Website,Recognizing Older Nova Scotians ," SENIORS—Recognizing Older Nova Scotians  Older Nova Scotians are leaders in the province. They are business owners and entrepreneurs, volunteers, mentors, caregivers and have a wealth of knowledge and expertise to share with other generations.  Seniors’ Week, Oct. 1-7, is a time to celebrate older Nova Scotians and recognize the unique impact they have on their communities and the province.  “Older Nova Scotians are the backbone of our communities and make valuable contributions through their work, interests and volunteerism,” says Leo Glavine, Minister of Seniors. “This year’s theme, Seniors for Nova Scotia Strong, highlights how older adults continue to show their strength, especially in difficult times and their ability to adapt and lead.” SHIFT: Nova Scotia’s Action Plan for an Aging Population is changing the narrative about older adults. Under this plan, government is investing in age-friendly communities, expanding community transit, supporting older workers and their employers, encouraging entrepreneurship and increasing funding for home repairs and accommodations. The guiding principles of SHIFT are to value the social and economic contributions of older adults, promote healthy, active living and support seniors staying in their homes so they can stay connected to their communities as long as they can. This spring, Senior Safety Programs received emergency funding totalling $360,000, and Community Links received $110,000 to help them respond to increased needs due to COVID-19.  Last year, an investment of $390,000 supported 30 projects through the Age-Friendly Communities Grant program, which supports projects that help overcome social isolation of older adults and help them stay active, healthy and engaged in their communities.  For example, the Live Well Community Church was able to offer affordable food boxes to low-income residents of Digby Neck and Islands through their Connect Care initiative, and the Shelburne County Mental Health and Wellness Association set up a toll-free telephone line to serve vulnerable populations dealing with loneliness or isolation. Older Nova Scotians continue to step up to the plate when faced with challenges. They are innovative, creative and adaptable to changing times and there are countless reasons why they should be celebrated this Seniors’ Week.   Quotes: I’ll always try and encourage others, there is always someone you can encourage and help. Joy Saunders, turning 102 this month, Lunenburg    Quick Facts:  the world is aging, and so is Nova Scotia. By 2030 more than one in four Nova Scotians will be aged 65 and over one in four Nova Scotians between the ages of 65 and 69 are in the workforce; 25 per cent of them are self-employed entrepreneurs people over 50 have the highest business startup rates. Five years after opening, 70 per cent of businesses started by older entrepreneurs were still operating, compared to 28 per cent started by younger people Most older Nova Scotians live at home as active members in their communities     Additional Resources: -- Age Friendly Community Grants: https://novascotia.ca/age-friendly-grant/ -- Updates on SHIFT: https://novascotia.ca/shift/  -30- "

Premier Stephen McNeil visited Colby Village Elementary School, in Dartmouth today, Oct. 2, to celebrate the full rollout of the program.  “Pre-primary is an investment in the future of our province by supporting our youngest Nova Scotians and their families,” said Premier McNeil. “Thousands of children and families across Nova Scotia have benefited from pre-primary since it launched in 2017, and now countless more will have the same opportunity.”  Pre-primary is available in all 253 school communities with elementary schools. Government will invest about $51.4 million this year to deliver the program. “We are giving children a head start and better future by preparing them today for tomorrow. Families have told us about the positive changes they see when their kids are part of the program,” said Zach Churchill, Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development. “Thank you to the children, their families and our early childhood educators for making this program such a success.” In addition to universal pre-primary, the province has completed its rollout of busing for eligible pre-primary children. Access to busing reduces barriers for families, especially in rural areas, to access the program. Families who wish to register their child for pre-primary can still contact their Regional Centre for Education or the Conseil scolaire acadien provincial.  Quotes: My children were not in preschool or daycare, so being able to attend pre-primary has helped them make friends, learn about routines, develop socialization skills, try new foods and simple things like how to line up in a line, and become more independent.

Soon, any new restaurants, cafés, lunch counters and delis must be accessible to all Nova Scotians. In order to get a food safety permit, any new restaurant with seating will need to have accessible entrances, pathways and washrooms. These changes will be paired with updated Nova Scotia Building Code requirements around accessibility, which take effect Oct. 31. These changes will apply to new eateries opening in a new space, or spaces that have not been used as a restaurant in the past 12 months. If a restaurant is undergoing major renovations, these changes may also apply. Accessibility advocates, building owners, the restaurant industry and several government departments took part in a restorative process to address washroom accessibility in restaurants. This process began in 2019. “Ensuring any new restaurant opening in the province is accessible is a positive step forward to achieving a more inclusive Nova Scotia,” said Environment Minister Gordon Wilson. “This is a first and important step, and we are committed to working with stakeholders as we consider additional changes that support improved accessibility.”    Quotes: The Restaurant Association of Nova Scotia was pleased to participate in the restorative process. We support having all new restaurants accessible, and eventually, as many restaurants as possible. This is an important and positive step forward to improve accessibility for all people.

The study found the threat to Highway 104 is low, provided the province continues to regularly monitor for ground movement and take additional measures to control water run off from the highway and its ramps. “Keeping the travelling public safe is our number one job,” said Lloyd Hines, Minister of Transportation. “We are moving immediately on the recommendations in the report by improving ditching and also by strengthening our monitoring program.”  The department will also develop a contingency plan to be followed if subsidence is observed near the highway and ramps. The study, conducted by Harbourside Geotechnical Consultants, examined subsurface soil and rock conditions along and beneath the highway west of Exit 6. It found that while deposits that can dissolve in water (water soluble) such as gypsum are prevalent in the area, the deposits that can result in sink holes were deep underground. Water diversion efforts from the highway area with work underway will further reduce risk. The study was prompted after a sinkhole formed beside the Oxford Lion’s Club in the Town of Oxford in 2018.  Quick facts:  the study focused on a 500 metre section of Highway 104 just south of the Town of Oxford the investigation included or laser imagery, topographic and geological mapping, aerial photos, the drilling of six boreholes and lab analysis of the core samples the area investigated is more likely to experience gradual settling of the ground surface than a sudden collapse, according to the study. A monitoring system to detect ground deformations was recommended to manage risk at the site water soluble deposits ranged from just under 10 metres to almost 60 metres below the surface    Additional Resources: The study is available at, https://novascotia.ca/tran/roadsafety/NSTIR-Oxford-Hwy-104-Sinkhole-Investigation.pdf  -30- "

This will reduce the wait time to be screened for testing from 12 hours to about 10 minutes. If the online assessment determines that a person requires a test, the Nova Scotia Health Authority or the IWK Health Centre will call them within 24 to 48 hours to book an appointment.  811 will continue to take calls from people who cannot access the online tool or who wish to speak with a nurse about their symptoms. “It is reasonable to expect a resurgence of COVID-19 in Nova Scotia and the improvements we’re making in our testing process will help us be prepared for it,” said Dr. Strang. “We can minimize any resurgence by continuing to follow all the public health measures to keep COVID-19 out of our communities as much as possible.”  Quick Facts:  811 has received an average of 1,467 calls per day and served an average of 1,024 patients per day since the beginning of September there are 26 primary assessment centres around the province: https://www.nshealth.ca/coronavirus-assessment    Additional Resources: -- the COVID-19 self-assessment is at https://covid-self-assessment.novascotia.ca/  -30- "

The communities of Bridgewater, Lunenburg and Liverpool are welcoming five medical school students from Dalhousie University in Halifax, who will spend their entire third year in the area through the Longitudinal Integrated Clerkship Program. Traditionally, third-year students do their clerkships with short placements in various communities. “This is a great way to offer on-the-job training and show students what it’s like to practise in rural areas,” said Health and Wellness Minister Randy Delorey. “It can also help with recruitment. We hope that exposing students to rural medicine early in their studies will interest them in eventually building careers there.” Starting this week, the students will gain community-based education under the supervision of local doctors during their 48-week clerkship, while also working with other health-care providers in the community. The Health Services Foundation of the South Shore, South Shore Regional Hospital Auxiliary and Queens General Hospital Foundation contributed $890,000 to create duty rooms, lounges, and learning space at South Shore Regional and Queens General Hospitals, which also supports recruitment and retention. The clerkship program was first launched in September 2019 in Cape Breton, with four students training each year in North Sydney and New Waterford.

The Black Lives Matter movement in Nova Scotia and around the world has brought to the forefront the systemic failures of our current reliance on policing and law enforcement for public safety. This approach has privileged some and marginalized others, and it has perpetuated racism and inequality for generations.  Nova Scotians deserve better. We must do better. It is time for change. That was Premier Stephen McNeil’s message today, Sept. 29, as he delivered an apology for the systemic racism that has marked our system of justice, including policing and the courts. The premier explained that the province is responsible for policing and public safety. He acknowledged that these institutions have not been just for many and apologized for the harms, trauma and pain many Nova Scotians have endured over generations. “Our system of justice has failed members of our Black and Indigenous communities. This system is supposed to keep all Nova Scotians safe, but because of the colour of your skin, many of you live in fear. Today, I say: enough,” said Premier McNeil. “I see you, I hear you, I believe you and I am sorry. On behalf of my ministers, my caucus, our government, we are sorry racist institutions have failed you, your families and your ancestors. I can’t take away your pain or bring back the opportunities and lives lost. But I am showing up today to try to work with all of you to find a new approach to public safety.” The premier committed to set a course for fundamental change in public safety, including the role and approach to policing and law enforcement. He committed to a restorative process to transform the approach to public safety in Nova Scotia and announced a design team to begin this process. The design team includes members from community, government and policing. The design team will work collaboratively and seek out and listen to voices, and perspectives from across the province. The design team will determine what is required to support the fundamental changes needed across systems and structures to secure safety and justice for all Nova Scotians. The team will carry out its work over the next 12-18 months.  Quotes: Responsibility for public safety related to policing lies with the justice system but, at its core, the care for what it takes to make community safe is the business of many connected systems. We must pay attention to the intersecting needs and ways people have been marginalized so we can bring about change. Each team member has expressed a desire to make a difference, and an insistence that this will not be another ‘review.’ This is about mobilizing and creating the conditions and connections needed for action and change, and we stand on the shoulders of all the work of the past that has showed so clearly the problems and failings and the need for fundamental change.

It is important to continue recognizing these individuals who help build vibrant communities all year long.  That is why today, Sept. 28, the annual Lieutenant Governor’s Community Spirit Award and the Provincial Volunteer Awards combined into one virtual ceremony, Celebrating Community Spirit and Volunteers Awards.  “Nova Scotians have experienced some difficult times and disruptions to their lives since March, but I have been immensely impressed at how resilient they have been in adapting to the significant changes in their lives,” said Lt.-Gov. Arthur J. LeBlanc.  “Our many communities have demonstrated their amazing spirit and resourcefulness in helping their residents cope and it proved to me that no matter the circumstances, you cannot dampen or stifle Nova Scotians’ wonderful generosity and their innate desire to volunteer and help those in need.”    The 13 Mi’kmaw communities, and all municipalities, towns and villages across the province received the Lieutenant Governor’s Community Spirit Recognition Plaque. Sixty-nine Provincial Volunteer Awards were given which included 67 Representative Awards, one Youth Volunteer Award and one Family Volunteer Award.  “These past few months have been some of the most challenging in our province’s history,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “But they have also been some of the most inspiring, as we have seen individual Nova Scotians and communities come together to support and take care of each other. We celebrate that enduring spirit of kindness and strength here today.” During the ceremony, a new Provincial Volunteer Award entitled the Nova Scotia Strong Award was announced and will be given each year to recognize the deep level of caring that Nova Scotians demonstrate towards each other. The award was presented to the six individuals who organized the Nova Scotia Remembers Online Tribute to commemorate the 22 Nova Scotians lost in the April 18 and 19 tragedy in the province.  The ceremony can be watched on the Communities, Culture and Heritage Facebook page, https://www.facebook.com/NOVASCOTIACULTURE   Quotes: It is our communities who gathered together to support each other especially during times of doubt. It is encouraging to know that in this province, we are surrounded by people who act with compassion towards others. Communities, Culture and Heritage Minister Leo Glavine.  ""Nova Scotia Remembers was the product of what we Nova Scotians do best: in times of darkness, band together to look for the light.""  Jonathan Torrens, Colchester County, Nova Scotia Strong Award recipient   “As I have been very fortunate in life, I believe I should give back to the community and particularly to those in need. Helping newcomers settle into our province encourages me and my team as we see their growth as new Canadians. These families also move on to help others to have better lives.  Dianne West, Halifax Regional Municipality, Representative Volunteer Award recipient    “As part of our Africentric ways and cultural background, we believe volunteering is a collective responsibility – the Africentric principle of “Ujima”. Volunteering is our moral responsibility, a way to honour those that have paved the way and laid the foundation for us which leads to our overall development. It is about sharing and contributing to others, developing skills and forming relationships on a path to a common goal.

Four companies have been selected to convert fossil fuel heating systems at six sites to new, efficient wood chip heating systems. The contracts to design, build and operate new boilers include long-term agreements to source wood chips from private woodlots and sawmills. The contracts were awarded to:  Mira Forestry Development Limited, Albert Bridge, Cape Breton Regional Municipality, to convert Memorial High School in Sydney Mines and Riverview High School in Sydney Wood4heating Canada, Inc. in Charlottetown, to convert Perennia Park Atlantic Centre for Agri-Innovation in Bible Hill and Hants East Rural High School in Milford, Hants Co.

ACFOR Energy Inc. of Cocagne, New Brunswick, to convert Bridgewater Provincial Court   The province is assessing additional sites to expand the program. A district heating network will be formed at Perennia Park and three buildings will be heated by the new boiler. Bridgewater provincial court will be converted to a two-building district heating network that includes the Nova Scotia Community College’s Lunenburg campus.  ""These projects help us progress towards a greener economy and reduce the carbon footprint of government buildings by replacing fossil fuels with a renewable resource,” said Lands and Forestry Minister Iain Rankin. “Using lower grade wood for heat will create new and stable markets for Nova Scotia's wood chips and opportunities for private woodlot owners and sawmills to sell lower grade wood locally.” The wood heat systems should be in place during this heating season.

On this eighth annual Medic Monday, the province wants to recognize and thank the many highly skilled and dedicated paramedics for their service. “When Nova Scotians need urgent medical care, paramedics are there to help,” said Health and Wellness Minister Randy Delorey. “They are highly trained and experienced to respond in emergencies and save lives. Many also work on collaborative health-care teams in communities across the province. We are all grateful for their dedication and expertise.”  Last year more than 1,200 paramedics responded to over 180,000 calls across Nova Scotia. Paramedics are involved in a wide range of health-care activities, from responding to emergencies, to providing in-home support for palliative care patients, to providing care to seniors in nursing homes through initiatives such as the Extended Care Paramedic Program.  This year, paramedics have been on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring the health and safety of Nova Scotians.   Quotes: I’ve been incredibly fortunate that I’ve able to maintain a career for 21 years doing a job that I love. It is a privilege and an honour providing care for Nova Scotians, but to me there is a lot more to this profession than what we do out there each and every day. Being a paramedic would simply not be possible without family – people at work and at home who continually offer support and encouragement so that we’re able to do this job to the best of our ability.

In 2012, the Paupins bought a 40 hectare woodlot near Shinimicas Cumberland Co. with the goal of restoring the forest to harvest firewood and non-timber forest products. Using treatments like thinning, they have improved the forest health by encouraging growth of native species. Stacey and Norman use solar powered pumps to collect sap and have adapted technology to make birch syrup, which sells for a higher price than maple syrup. Norman has continually refined his process to produce a syrup that won the World Birch Syrup Championships in 2018. He is now further developing the process with a researcher at the Dalhousie University’s Agricultural Campus in Truro. ""Private woodlot owners like Stacey and Norman are vital to our province's forestry sector. They've created a healthier environment and a business opportunity through good forest management and resource stewardship,"" said Lands and Forestry Minister Iain Rankin. “The Paupins are gaining value from their forest and enjoying the many rewards that can come from running a sustainable woodlot.” The Paupins are hosting a field day Saturday, Oct. 3, so the public can tour their operation, see demonstrations of birch syrup production and learn about woodlot management. COVID-19 safety measures will be in place. The public can RSVP by contacting woodlot@novascotia.ca or visiting the Woodland Owner of the Year website, https://novascotia.ca/woodlandaward , for more information.  Quotes: Initially, we purchased the property as a source of firewood to heat our home, as a way to get exercise and we saw it as an investment. Our approach has been to take what was there and make every attempt at improving its overall value. To us, it has more than an economic value; it is a quiet place to walk, to appreciate the trees themselves, to observe wildlife and just enjoy nature and think. It has allowed us the opportunity to experiment with some pretty awesome ideas.

Those individuals who have been confirmed are being directed to self-isolate at home, away from the public, for 14 days. Anyone who has travelled outside of Atlantic Canada must self-isolate for 14 days. As always, any Nova Scotian who develops symptoms of acute respiratory illness should limit their contact with others until they feel better.

Wearing a non-medical mask is mandatory in most indoor public places. As of July 3, interprovincial travel within Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador, without the requirement to self-isolate for permanent Atlantic Canadian residents, is permitted.

As a result, the province suffered minimal damage and power lost during the storm has been fully restored to homes and businesses. “I want to thank Nova Scotians for taking this potentially dangerous situation seriously and for showing compassion toward friends and neighbours in need,” said Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Chuck Porter. “First responders, municipalities and our partners in critical infrastructure also did a tremendous job of preparing, keeping the province informed and restoring services where needed.” Hurricane Teddy made landfall as a post tropical storm on Wednesday, Sept. 23, near Ecum Secum on the Eastern Shore. The Nova Scotia Emergency Management Office (EMO)is no longer monitoring the storm, and the provincial co-ordination centre ended its response at 10 a.m. today, Sept. 24.

57,2020-09-24 13:13:00,Canada,Nova Scotia,,https://novascotia.ca/news/release/?id=20200924004,Government Website,Province Reduces Burden on Ride Hailing Services ," Nova Scotians want more choices when it comes to local transportation. That is why the province announced today, Sept. 24, that it is reducing costs and administrative burdens for taxi and ride hailing services. “Making it easier to do business is an important step toward providing Nova Scotians with more transportation options,” said Lloyd Hines, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal. “The changes should help open the sector to healthy competition, reduce unnecessary regulatory burden and ensure our roads continue to be safe by keeping the medical requirement, which strikes a balance between business growth passenger safety. This is especially important in our rapidly growing metro areas and in underserviced areas across rural Nova Scotia.” The department is establishing a modernized, restricted Class 4 licence that no longer requires taxi or potential ride hail drivers to retake the road and knowledge tests. It will also reduce costs to drivers because the retests are no longer necessary. All other requirements for a Class 4, including a medical assessment, will remain. Exempting drivers from the additional testing will also simplify the licensing process of upgrading from a Class 5 to Class 4 restricted. The new regulations come into effect immediately.  Quotes: Having more convenient, accessible transportation options is a key way to reduce impaired driving. We welcome the news that Nova Scotians will be able to access ridesharing services such as Uber and thank the Government of Nova Scotia for moving forward with this. The more safe ride options available to people, the more likely they are to plan ahead for a sober ride home, and that makes roads and communities safer. MADD Canada chief executive officer Andrew Murie.    Quick Facts:  Nova Scotia is now one of seven provinces requiring a Class 4 to drive a cab or ride hail service vehicle. PEI, Quebec and now Nova Scotia, are the only provinces that waive the additional knowledge and road tests the new regulations eliminate the knowledge and road tests for ride share and taxi drivers, saving them the $68 testing fee a standard Class 4 licence, including a knowledge and road test, will continue to be required to drive an ambulance or small buses with 24 or fewer passengers Nova Scotia’s municipalities are legislatively responsible for licensing taxis and other ride hailing companies, as well as their drivers, with respect to additional safety standards. These include requiring clean driver records, criminal record checks, child abuse registry checks   -30- "

These paramedics have dedicated their careers to providing high-quality care to Nova Scotians in their time of greatest need, sometimes at their own personal risk.  Lt.-Gov. Arthur J. LeBlanc, who presented the medals, noted the dedication they exemplify daily. “It is my great pleasure to invest these members of the Emergency Medical Services with the Exemplary Service Medal,” said Lt.-Gov. LeBlanc.  “Their dedication and commitment to the people they serve – quite often in the most distressing of circumstances – is most deserving of this recognition, which I am honoured to present to them on behalf of Her Majesty The Queen.” The paramedics who received the medals are:  Francine Butts, Chaswood, Halifax Regional Municipality Colleen Carey, Hammonds Plains Kevin Carey, Hammonds Plains Charles Charmichael, Georges River, Cape Breton Regional Municipality Joseph Gallant, New Germany, Lunenburg Co. Ryan Grist, Dayspring, Lunenburg Co. Rhonda Helpard, Steep Creek, Guysborough Co. Angela Hickox, Truro Greg MacKinnon, Kentville Angie Matheson, Port Hastings, Inverness Co.

Sean Teed, Glen Haven, Halifax Regional Municipality Matthew Vaughan, Westville, Pictou Co. Mark Walker, Hammonds Plains Jim Wells, Brookside, Halifax Regional Municipality Kelsey Wells, Brookside, Halifax Regional Municipality   From a young age, recipient Francine Butts was interested in finding a path to help support the needs of people in her community. She found that path in paramedicine.  “Throughout my 23-year career, I have met some of the strongest and bravest people – our patients and their families. As a paramedic, you can share in life's most precious and unfair moments all in the same day with people you just met,” she said. “It certainly takes a special person to be able to do this line of work. Thanks to the trailblazing men and women that have and continue to wear the uniform, lead this profession, and be pioneers in clinical care, patient safety and advocacy.”   Queen Elizabeth II created the Exemplary Service Medal in 1994.   It is part of a national recognition program for people who work in high-risk jobs that enhance Canada's public safety.  Police, firefighters, corrections officers, coast guard members and peace officers are also eligible for exemplary service medals, which are part of the Canadian honours system. Emergency Medical Services professionals can be nominated by their peers or the public. Recipients must have demonstrated exemplary service in their careers for at least 20 years, including 10 years in an emergency medical services position that involves potential risk.

The province recognizes and supports the legal, constitutional Aboriginal and treaty rights of the Mi’kmaq, and while many of the details surrounding the nature and extent of those rights are not clear, clarification is best addressed through open and respectful dialogue. Nova Scotia Mi’kmaq are working as a Nation to determine what is required to implement those treaty rights, what it means, what it looks like and what rules should be put in place.  It’s good that the federal fisheries minister continues to speak with interested parties regarding this latest fishing dispute in southwest Nova Scotia. It is essential to find a path forward and that can only happen if all sides come together in a respectful and constructive way.  Discussions continue within communities and with the province on topics such as wildlife and forestry through the Made in Nova Scotia negotiation process. Meanwhile, the province of Nova Scotia and the Mi’kmaq have entered into a number of interim collaborative management agreements, including moose population management and a forestry initiative. Our objective is to have a safe and enjoyable moose hunt for Mi’kmaq and licensed hunters. Any potential disruption of the legal moose hunt will be jointly addressed. While we respect the right for peaceful protests, it is illegal to interfere with a lawful hunt. -30- "

Some of their key recommendations include:  improving infection prevention and control within the existing architecture at Northwood  reviewing and updating pandemic plans creating a mobile infection prevention and control resource to support facilities facing outbreaks addressing staffing challenges with more employees for housekeeping, resident care, screening and visits, and a human resources plan for the sector clarifying roles and responsibilities within the Department of Health and Wellness and the Nova Scotia Health Authority, restructuring their disaster response teams and improving communication  In collaboration with partners including the Nova Scotia Health Authority and sector representatives, the department led a review of broader infection prevention and control within the long-term care sector. It considered overall infection prevention and control practices in long-term care facilities and actions taken during the first wave of COVID-19. The findings were consistent with those of Dr. Lata and Dr. Stevenson. The Department of Health and Wellness will work with its partners to take immediate action to make improvements, including:  ensuring existing long-term care rooms have no more than two residents each. Since 2007, new facilities are built with single rooms and private bathrooms establishing one mobile infection prevention and control response team in every zone to support facilities facing outbreaks, as well as an infection prevention and control resource person per zone dedicated to long-term care ensuring there are processes in place for long-term care staff to get tested and return to work as quickly as possible funding for all facilities to increase cleaning (staff and supplies)  funding for small capital projects and equipment purchases to support infection and prevention control in long-term care facilities, such as lock boxes and carts for medications, hand-sanitizing stations, personal protective equipment (PPE) carts and room dividers funding for staff who can be deployed as needed to manage outbreaks   A longer-term action to develop a robust infection prevention and control program for the long-term care sector, including education and training, online learning platforms, resources, tools and best practices, monitoring and reporting, and guidance for outbreaks and surveillance. Government is investing $26 million this fiscal year and $11 million over the next two years to support this work.

Current forecast models indicate Nova Scotia is expected to feel the effects from Hurricane Teddy early next week. “Last year, we weathered Hurricane Dorian because we started preparing long before the storm arrived, and now it’s time to get ready again,” said Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Chuck Porter. “Being prepared is the best thing we can do for ourselves and our neighbours and everyone needs to do their part.” Strong winds, heavy rains and storm and power surges can cause significant damage. All Nova Scotians are asked to prepare in advance and monitor local weather forecasts this weekend. The basic checklist includes:  enough food and water for 72 hours monitoring local media outlets for updates securing gates, doors and windows moving yard furniture and securing trash cans, hanging plants and anything that can be picked up by wind checking radio batteries filling vehicles with gas and parking them away from trees keeping pets inside moving any type of watercraft to high ground ensuring the safety of you and your family checking on neighbours  if the power goes out, do not leave candles unattended   Nova Scotians should also remember that they need to continue to follow COVID-19 public health direction as they prepare. Stores often have longer lineups in advance of a storm, and physical distancing of two metres (six feet) and mask wearing are still required. EMO is working with Environment Canada and partners on the approaching storm, gathering municipal information, identifying possible local risk areas and conducting information sessions with provincial and municipal emergency management officers and co-ordinators.

Effective Oct. 1, the number of people who can participate in one of these activities without physical distancing will increase from 10 to 50. For most sports, this will allow full team practises and competition to resume, while for the performing arts, this will allow for larger rehearsals and performances. This change also applies to recreational league sports, like adult hockey, and drop-in activities, like open swims and skates. Unorganized or casual games, like pickup basketball or soccer in the park, must adhere to existing gathering rules of small groups of 10 without physical distancing within a maximum of 50 with physical distancing.  “Art and sport are vital to our physical, mental and social well-being. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has put some of these activities on hold,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health. “Nova Scotia continues to see low COVID-19 activity, allowing us to safely resume important activities Nova Scotians enjoy.” The gathering limit of 50 without physical distancing includes:  players/participants, officials, coaches, instructors or anyone else who is required to be on or near the field of play  performers, directors, cast, crew or anyone else required to be within the performance space   The limit of 50 applies to practises, competitions, games, rehearsals and artistic performances. While mask use is not required while doing physical activity, wearing masks and maintaining distance as much as possible continues to be encouraged for these activities.  “This will be welcome news, especially for children and families for whom participation in sport and other activities is such an important part of their lives,” said Leo Glavine, Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage. “Getting back to the arts, culture and sport activities we love requires that we follow the guidelines in place to protect our health and safety and that of others in our communities.”  Existing gathering requirements for audiences/spectators at sport/recreation facilities and performances venues must continue to be followed. All organizations are asked to have a rollback plan in place, should gathering limits need to be reduced again. Quick Facts:   the gathering limits for day camps and after school programs remains at 15 the gathering limit for events and performances is 250 outside with physical distancing and 50 per cent of a facility’s capacity, up to 200 inside, with physical distancing and mandatory masks for spectators testing numbers are updated daily at https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus a state of emergency was declared under the Emergency Management Act on March 22 and extended to Oct. 4   Additional resources: Government of Canada: https://canada.ca/coronavirus Government of Canada information line 1-833-784-4397 (toll-free) The Mental Health Provincial Crisis Line is available 24/7 to anyone experiencing a mental health or addictions crisis, or someone concerned about them, by calling 1-888-429-8167 (toll-free) Kids Help Phone is available 24/7 by calling 1-800-668-6868 (toll-free) For help or information about domestic violence 24/7, call 1-855-225-0220 (toll-free)  -30- "

The proposed drivers regulations are being made available online for public comment effective today, Sept. 17.  The draft regulations are being released in stages, beginning with drivers regulations, followed in sequence by the regulations for vehicles, rules for using the road and penalties and other administrative changes. Each phase for public input will last 30 days. It is the first time Nova Scotia has made draft regulations of this magnitude available for public comment prior to proclamation. “Many months and extensive consultation with targeted stakeholder groups have gone into the development of these draft regulations. Now it is time to hear what Nova Scotians have to say,” said Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal Minister Lloyd Hines. “The existing act was written in the early 1920s and we need to modernize our laws. We want the new act to be more flexible and responsive.” The new Traffic Safety Act, replacing the Motor Vehicle Act, was passed in 2018. The new act will govern and regulate the registration and identification of motor vehicles and the use of provincial highways and roads. This includes drivers licences, the registration and inspection of vehicles, traffic laws and equipment standards. The drivers regulations address standards, licensing, training and suspension. Key improvements to the more than 80 regulations affecting drivers include:  updating the licence classification system to reflect the national standard changes to the demerit point system to harmonize with the rest of the country by reducing suspension time and eliminating conditional licenses simplifying the steps for obtaining a graduated drivers licence and learners permits for commercial vehicles clarity and consistency for driver education courses eligibility and medical requirements for different drivers classes application and renewal processes for drivers licences  The act and regulations will take effect following the public review phase and once upgrades to the Registry of Motor Vehicles computer system are completed. Nova Scotians can get more information and provide feedback by going to: https://novascotia.ca/traffic-safety-act-public-engagement/ The deadline for feedback on the drivers regulations is Friday, Oct. 16.   Quick Facts:  the Traffic Safety Act was passed unanimously in the fall of 2018 and will replace the Motor Vehicle Act, which was written in the early 1920s the act is designed as a framework, setting broad policy and regulatory authority to quickly address changing technologies and future road-safety needs since the last major revision in 1989, the Motor Vehicle Act has been amended more than 62 times the legislation, once in effect, will be more concise than the current Motor Vehicle Act, moving technical detail to regulation and allowing more flexibility and responsiveness to emerging issues the Traffic Safety Act reflects significant stakeholder engagement with 31 groups and 23 partners including Bicycle Nova Scotia, Insurance Bureau of Canada, Road Safety Advisory Committee, Nova Scotia Chiefs of Police and Nova Scotia Federation of Municipalities    Additional Resources: Bill 80 – The Traffic Safety Act: https://nslegislature.ca/legc/bills/63rd_2nd/1st_read/b080.htm  -30- "

A rotational worker is someone who has a set schedule where they alternate between living in Nova Scotia and working outside the province, such as an Alberta oil worker.  The changes are only for rotational workers who are residents of Nova Scotia who travel to another province or territory in Canada to work. They do not apply to rotational workers who work outside of Canada. “While self-isolation is important, we know it isn’t always easy, particularly for those who travel back and forth from Nova Scotia to other parts of Canada to work,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “These Nova Scotians play a vital role in our communities and our economy. We want to ensure that the self-isolation requirement does not negatively impact the health, well-being and family lives of rotational workers, so we are making changes.” Effective immediately, rotational workers are allowed the following activities alone or with their household members:  interacting with people who live in their household.  Maintaining physical distance from household members is not necessary unless the rotational worker becomes unwell. Household members do not need to self-isolate unless they become unwell spending time outside on their own property going for a drive going for a walk, run, hike, bike or ATV ride for exercise and recreation off their property (if they encounter people from outside their household, they must wear a mask and maintain a distance of two metres) visiting a park, beach or other outdoor public space (if they encounter people from outside their household, they must wear a mask and maintain a distance of two metres) spending time at their cabin or vacation home (or a rental location) within the province, following the same rules as if at home dropping off and picking up household members at school, work or recreational activities without getting out of the vehicle no-contact pick-up of groceries or other items purchased online without getting out of the vehicle attending a drive-in theatre without getting out of the vehicle going through a drive-thru, for example at a restaurant or bank  Effective Monday, Sept. 14, the following activities are allowed:  attending necessary (urgent and routine) medical appointments. This includes appointments with physicians and nurse practitioners, dentists, optometrists and other regulated health professionals where in-person treatment is required  The following activities continue to be restricted:  entering public places (e.g. schools, grocery stores, shopping malls, banks, religious institutions, restaurants/bars) attending indoor and outdoor gatherings visiting people from outside their household allowing people from outside their household to visit them on their property or in their home  volunteering or working in any capacity that requires them to be in contact with people outside their household    Quote: “There are many rotational workers in the province and exempting all of them from the requirement to self-isolate could significantly increase the risk to Nova Scotians,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health. “We have expanded the list of allowable activities that focuses on the mental and physical well-being of rotational workers while ensuring we minimize the risk of transmission within Nova Scotia.”    Additional Resources: Government of Canada: https://canada.ca/coronavirus Government of Canada information line 1-833-784-4397 (toll-free) The Mental Health Provincial Crisis Line is available 24/7 to anyone experiencing a mental health or addictions crisis, or someone concerned about them, by calling 1-888-429-8167 (toll-free) Kids Help Phone is available 24/7 by calling 1-800-668-6868 (toll-free) For help or information about domestic violence 24/7, call 1-855-225-0220 (toll-free) For a list of regulated health professionals, visit: http://www.nsrhpn.ca/member-listing/   -30- "

Her education journey was paused when she married at age 14 and became a mother shortly thereafter. Her family, who lived in a Jordanian refugee camp after having fled the Syrian civil war, was sponsored by Syria-Antigonish Families Embrace and settled in Nova Scotia in 2017. Ms. Alahmad is a mother of four and had no English language skills when she arrived in Nova Scotia. She enrolled in English literacy classes at the Antigonish County Adult Learning Association and achieved a level five in English in less than three years. She is currently taking courses to improve her math and science skills.  Ms. Alahmad hopes to enrol in community college soon with the eventual goal of obtaining her high school diploma.  Quotes: I wanted to learn English so I could help my children in school, so I could understand the doctors, the daycare workers, and others. The amount of support we have received here in Antigonish is truly amazing. In two and a half years, I've learned about and adjusted to the enormous differences in Canadian and Syrian cultures. I’ve learned what it feels like to have a sense of freedom. My family feels comfortable and safe. I am blessed and very lucky.

That is why government is investing nearly $75,000 to support the creation of a digital broadcasting studio at The Convent in Sydney.  “The digital market is growing every day and it is important that we continue investing in creativity, innovation and technology,” said Energy and Mines Minister Derek Mombourquette on behalf of Communities, Culture and Heritage Minister Leo Glavine, in announcing the funding. “The new digital broadcasting studio will not only benefit the members of The Convent but encourage other community organizations to work in new ways to help grow our province’s vital creative economy.” The Convent is a community hub operated by the New Dawn Centre for Social Innovation. It is a mixed-use facility with sustainable working and gathering spaces that help strengthen Cape Breton’s economy with new energies, concepts and ideas. The new digital broadcasting studio space will be available to individuals, businesses and community organizations such as The Coast 89.7 CKOA-FM community radio station that wants to expand its creative initiatives. The studio is expected to be completed this November. The federal government has also contributed $75,000 towards the digital broadcasting studio.

Additional investments by the federal government will also ensure schools remain a safe environment for students, teachers and staff. “Schools are vibrant and social communities, so it is important that we all do our part to support the safe return of students and staff to school. Families should monitor the health of their children daily and keep them home if they feel ill,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health. “There is no one-size-fits-all approach to addressing a COVID-19 exposure, but we are ready to respond quickly if or when it happens in a school.”  Managing a case or cases of COVID-19 in a school will depend on the level of exposure and the risk to students, staff or essential visitors.  The risk levels are high, moderate and low. Each risk level has an appropriate and corresponding response based on public health guidance:  an individual is at high risk if they are a close contact. A close contact is someone who was in close and prolonged contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 up to 48 hours before symptoms presented. This could include everyone in the class an individual is at moderate risk if there has not been prolonged contact and they have maintained two metres or six feet from the confirmed case. This would include all students and staff in a shared space who were able to physically distance  an individual is at low risk if they have had limited or casual contact with a confirmed case. This could be incidental contact such as walking past or near the individual in a hallway or other common area  Public health and the education system are taking a cautious approach in responding to COVID-19 cases in schools, to slow the spread of the virus and keep students and staff safe. Key elements of the response to a case will include:  public health will immediately launch an investigation to determine and arrange testing for all close contacts. Close contacts may include everyone in the class, school bus, or before and after school program all close contacts will be required to self-isolate at home while waiting for results. If they are negative, they need to complete their 14-day isolation; if they are positive, they have to isolate as a case and follow public health guidelines all families at the school will be notified about the exposure and measures being taken school closures due to COVID-19 will occur on the advice and recommendation of public health and only if there is deemed to be a risk to all staff and students students required to self-isolate will be supported to continue their learning until they can return to school  Students who become ill while at school will be monitored, isolated away from other students and a family member will be called to pick them up. In addition to new public health measures for September, there are several other changes students and families will see:  the Provincial Student Attendance and Engagement Policy will be relaxed so that no student is penalized for absences due to illness this year modified guidelines are in place to support the delivery of music class, band and physical education families with children with special needs will continue to be supported. A new inclusive education policy announced last September will come into effect and the back to school plan ensures that students can access the support they need, where they need it, while observing COVID-19 safe practices  the Nova Scotia Pre-primary Program will be fully implemented across the province and this includes busing for all eligible pre-primary students more students across the province will become eligible to ride the school bus, as the student transportation policy comes into effect with new provincial criteria for eligibility   Additional Resources: Nova Scotia Back to School Plan: https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/docs/back-to-school-plan.pdf Nova Scotia Back to School site: https://www.novascotia.ca/backtoschool  Provincial Student Attendance and Engagement Policy – Suspension of Loss of Credit Decisions: https://www.ednet.ns.ca/docs/covid19andattendanceen.pdf Inclusive Education Policy: https://www.ednet.ns.ca/docs/inclusiveeducationpolicyen.pdf School Transportation Policy: https://www.ednet.ns.ca/docs/schooltransportationpolicyen.pdf  -30- "

One new case was identified on Sunday, Aug. 30. The other new case was identified late day, Aug. 31. The Aug 30 case is in the Eastern Zone and is related to travel outside of Atlantic Canada. The individual has been self-isolating, as required. The Aug. 31 case is in the Western Zone and is a student attending Université Sainte-Anne. More information will be shared about this case in tomorrow’s case update. The province is also reporting two probable cases of COVID-19 at two universities. The students, one at Dalhousie University in Halifax, and one at Acadia University in Wolfville, have received indeterminate test results. Both students are from outside the Atlantic bubble, live off-campus and have been self-isolating, as required. Based on public health assessment, these two cases are being treated as though they are lab-confirmed positives to ensure all precautions are taken. They will be tested again before their 14-day self-isolation period is finished, as part of the testing strategy for post-secondary students. Indeterminate test results do not provide a negative or positive. They may occur because someone previously had COVID-19 and the virus is still detectable in their system, or someone has been tested before the virus is fully detectable. In these situations, public health conducts further assessment, including whether someone had or has symptoms or was recently exposed to someone with COVID-19, to inform how the case is treated. Since probable cases are not confirmed to be positive, they are not included in the total number of positive cases of COVID-19 in Nova Scotia. Nova Scotia Health Authority’s labs completed 862 Nova Scotia tests on Aug. 30. To date, Nova Scotia has 75,707 negative test results, 1,085 positive COVID-19 cases and 65 deaths. No one is currently in hospital. Cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. One thousand and thirteen cases are now resolved. Cases have been identified in all parts of the province. Cumulative cases by zone may change as data is updated in Panorama.

Those individuals who have been confirmed are being directed to self-isolate at home, away from the public, for 14 days. Anyone who has travelled outside of Atlantic Canada must self-isolate for 14 days. As always, any Nova Scotian who develops symptoms of acute respiratory illness should limit their contact with others until they feel better.  It remains important for Nova Scotians to strictly adhere to the public health order and directives - practise good hand washing and other hygiene steps, maintain a physical distance when and where required. Wearing a non-medical mask is mandatory in most indoor public places. As of July 3, interprovincial travel within Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador, without the requirement to self-isolate for permanent Atlantic Canadian residents, is permitted.

Immunizations are an important and safe way to protect children and adults from serious illnesses. “I know many Nova Scotians right now are focused on protecting themselves and their loved ones from COVID-19 and I’d like to encourage them to take this time to also be aware of the vaccines that are available for a number of other serious diseases,” said Dr. Gaynor Watson-Creed, deputy chief medical officer of health. “Vaccines lower the risk of infection and help us develop immunity to many diseases like whooping cough, measles and others. Back-to-school season is a good reminder to check your records and get any needed vaccines for you and your children. As much as possible, we are asking Nova Scotians to take the necessary steps to reduce additional communicable disease circulating during this time.” Infants should receive vaccines listed in Nova Scotia’s Routine Immunization Schedule. Before starting school, children between the ages of four and six should receive a booster of Tdap-IPV vaccine to protect them against tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough and polio. They may also need a second dose of MMRV vaccine if they had not received it at 18 months to protect against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox. Youth in grade 7 receive HPV, hepatitis B, meningococcal quadrivalent and Tdap vaccines at school-based clinics. Clinics were offered earlier this summer for grade 7 students who did not receive these vaccinations last school year. Additional clinics will be available this fall for the grade 7 immunization program and for those students entering grade 8 who have not received them. Families will receive information from their school in the coming weeks about these clinics.  Parents may always contact their local public health office to learn more about the recommended vaccination schedule and to book vaccinations covered by public health.  Adults born in 1970 or later who have not received two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine should be immunized. Adults should also receive a booster dose to protect against diphtheria and tetanus every 10 years, and where appropriate, pertussis. Pregnant women should receive a dose of Tdap with every pregnancy. Anyone with high-risk conditions may require additional doses and may be eligible for additional vaccines.  Quick Facts:  vaccines listed on Nova Scotia’s Routine Immunization Schedules for Children, Youth and Adults are provided free of charge a health-care provider can help you determine what vaccines you or your children need those who do not have a health-care provider can call their local public health office to discuss options    Additional Resources: More information on Nova Scotia’s Routine Immunization Schedules for Children, Youth and Adults: https://novascotia.ca/dhw/CDPC/documents/Routine-Immunization-Schedules-for-Children-Youth-Adults.pdf  -30- "

Two new cases were identified on Saturday, Aug. 22. Nova Scotia is reporting one additional death related to COVID-19, bringing the total to 65. A male over 80 has died in the Northern Zone. His case is related to a previous case of a traveller coming from outside the Atlantic bubble. He was not a resident of a long-term care home.

Seniors Minister Leo Glavine opened the first-round call for applications for the 2020-21 Age-Friendly Communities Grant program today, Aug. 21. “The Age-Friendly Communities Grant program supports projects that improve the health and well-being of older Nova Scotians by helping them stay active, healthy and engaged in their communities,” he said. “This year groups may need to think differently because of COVID-19. While we expect to see a range of great ideas, we hope to see projects that help address some of the challenges that have faced many older adults through the pandemic, such as social isolation.” Partnerships with a local government and between two or more organizations are encouraged, to help reach more people and impact more lives. For example, last year the Live Well Community Church was able to offer affordable food boxes to low-income residents of Digby Neck and Islands through their Connect Care initiative, and the Shelburne County Mental Health and Wellness Association set up a toll-free telephone line to serve vulnerable populations dealing with loneliness or isolation.

Students inside the Atlantic bubble only need to self-isolate if they travelled outside the bubble in the past 14 days. The testing requirement applies to all university and NSCC students arriving in Nova Scotia from outside Atlantic Canada, effective immediately, including those who are currently self-isolating.  Students will be tested at three different times during their 14-day isolation period. Even with negative test results, the full 14-day self-isolation must be completed. Students cannot attend in-person classes until their testing and self-isolation are complete and they have received negative test results. Universities and NSCC are contacting their students directly with information about these requirements and the process for getting tested. Students should direct any question to their institutions. “Testing university and NSCC students during their self-isolation periods can help with early detection and management of cases in the post-secondary population,” said Dr. Gaynor Watson-Creed, deputy chief medical officer of health for Nova Scotia. “Along with testing, everyone following the public health measures -- students completing their self-isolation and social distancing – and the plans the institutions have put in place will help keep students, staff and surrounding communities safe during the school year.” Government is also enhancing the border form for everyone arriving in the province from outside the Atlantic bubble.

That’s why the province is contributing $3.5 million to a new Ronald McDonald House in Halifax that, once complete, will double the number of families it can serve annually. Premier Stephen McNeil announced the funding at an event today, Aug. 19, at the future site of the new Ronald McDonald House on South Street in Halifax. “Having a sick or injured child puts a tremendous amount of stress on a family,” said Premier McNeil. “Ronald McDonald House has been there for families from across Nova Scotia and the Maritimes for over 35 years, and I’m proud that we are helping them support more families for years to come.”    Quotes: We can’t thank RMHC Atlantic enough. They are a blessing in disguise. RMHC was there when we needed them the most. To see our child interact with other children, baking cookies and playing games, after he had been so ill and isolated from others, warmed our hearts. RMHC allowed me to focus my energy on Grayson’s well-being and nurture him back to good health without having to worry about the financial burden of paying for hotels and restaurants. For this, I am truly grateful. Natasha MacNeil, mother of 4-year-old Grayson  This announcement marks the beginning of a journey to ensure all Maritime families have a place to call home while dealing with the stress of a sick child. The new house will enable RMHC Atlantic to serve an additional 600 families annually, eliminate their wait list, and help keep more families together when they need each other most. Scott McCain and Leslie McLean, co-chairs of the capital campaign for Ronald McDonald House Charities Atlantic  Investing in social infrastructure that supports families is essential to building healthy and resilient communities. With the construction of the new Ronald McDonald House in Halifax, families with sick children from across the Maritimes will be well supported when they come for care.

The decision stems from a 2014 grievance involving almost 400 LPNs in the former Capital District Health Authority who are represented by NSGEU. An arbitrator determined the scope of practise of those LPNs had widened and compensation should increase to reflect that. In June 2020, a second arbitrator provided those LPNs with a 12-per-cent increase retroactive to March 2014, the date of the original grievance. Government will now extend the 12-per-cent increase to almost 2,600 more LPNs across the public sector effective June 11, 2020. Only those LPNs included in the original grievance process will receive the increase on a retroactive basis.  “This action ensures our commitment to wage parity of LPNs across the province and addresses issues raised by the Nova Scotia Nurses’ Union and other healthcare labour groups,” said Labour Relations Minister Mark Furey. “All LPNs do the same important work, and deserve the same rate of pay, wherever they are employed. This is the fair and appropriate step to take, and we wanted to move forward without delay.” The new annual compensation for a full-time LPN at the top of the regular salary scale will be $58,634, up from the current $52,707, an increase of about $6,000 annually.  The annual cost to government to extend the increase to the additional LPNs is $19 million.    Quotes: We value the important role LPNs play across the health-care system. They make important contributions daily to the care of Nova Scotians by working collaboratively with other health-care professionals. Health and Wellness Minister Randy Delorey    Quick Facts:  LPNs care for patients who are considered stable with predictable outcomes in a variety of settings. LPNs provide nursing services under the direction of an RN, physician or other authorized health care professional the annual cost of the 12-per-cent increase for all LPNs, including former Capital District LPNs, is $21.8 million retroactive increases for former Capital District LPNs will cost $19.3 million    	    "

These past seven years, as your premier, have been the most rewarding of my professional career. It has been a privilege and an honour, and something I have never taken for granted. Today, I am announcing I will be stepping down and leaving public office.  I have informed the Liberal Party of Nova Scotia to plan for a leadership campaign, which I expect will take months. I will stay on and continue to govern and will be here to work with public health to keep Nova Scotians safe until the next leader is chosen. I am grateful to my team of elected colleagues. My caucus has shown so much courage. We’ve made some tough decisions and we stuck together because we believed we were doing the right thing for the future of this province. I am also grateful to Nova Scotians who have worked with us to get our province heading in the right direction. Our population is growing with our immigration success, our businesses and citizens are gaining more confidence as we compete on the world stage and we are giving our young people the foundation they need with programs like pre-primary. We have also worked hard to break down systemic racism in our province. There is more work to do, but I am proud that more Nova Scotians are starting to see themselves reflected in our institutions. I want to thank Nova Scotians for giving me the opportunity to be your premier. We have accomplished so much together. I may not have always gotten it right. But here’s what I know for sure: we are better together and being kind matters.

The Nurse Practitioner Education Incentive covers the salaries of six registered nurses while they attend Dalhousie University’s two-year Master of Nursing nurse practitioner program full-time. In return, recipients will commit to work in one of several designated communities for five years.  “Supporting more registered nurses to become nurse practitioners will fill a growing workforce need and improve Nova Scotians’ access to primary care,” said Health and Wellness Minister Randy Delorey. “There are registered nurses who took part in the first round of this incentive program who are now nurse practitioners working in smaller, underserved communities.”  An expression of interest will be issued to those already accepted to Dalhousie’s nurse practitioner program, family all-ages stream. Recipients will be selected based on whether they live in or are affiliated with one of the designated communities and are willing to relocate upon completion of the program. Recipients must commit to work in one of the designated communities for five years. This expands on the 10 spaces announced in 2018. Three of those participants have graduated and are working as nurse practitioners in Digby, Cumberland County and Victoria County.  Four more will graduate this fall and will practice in Shelburne, Cape Breton County, Inverness and Pictou, and the final three will graduate next May and will practice in Cumberland County, Digby and Sheet Harbour. The eligible geographic areas for the additional six spaces are:  Inverness, 60 km radius including the town and surrounding area Caledonia, 60 km radius including the community and surrounding area Truro, 60 km radius including the town and surrounding area Shelburne, 60 km radius including the town and surrounding area Pugwash, 60 km radius including the community and surrounding area Guysborough or Canso, 60 km radius including the towns and surrounding areas  An arrangement between Dalhousie and Cape Breton University will continue to allow students in Cape Breton to complete some program requirements locally, minimizing the need to travel to Halifax.  Quotes: Having worked in the Digby emergency department, I recognized the need for primary care to promote and protect the wellbeing of our community. This is one of the many reasons why I wanted to become a nurse practitioner. I look forward to accepting new patients and developing a practice in the place I’ve called home for most of my life. Yarrow Merritt, nurse practitioner, Digby Collaborative Family Practice Team  Today’s announcement is great news, especially for rural Nova Scotia as these new nurse practitioners are committed to working there. It’s also in line with our 2019 Nursing Potential report which recommended government continue to invest in nurses so that underserviced areas receive the care they deserve. Educating more nurses in the nurse practitioner program gets us closer to achieving NSNU’s goal of having a 500-strong nurse practitioner network across all sectors of care, based on our projected needs, by 2028. Janet Hazelton, president, Nova Scotia Nurses’ Union    Quick Facts:  this is one of several initiatives underway to improve Nova Scotians’ access to primary care, including additional family medicine residency spaces, a practice-ready assessment program, and a streamlined immigration process for doctors government will invest $900,000 over two years in this round of the Nurse Practitioner Education Incentive this initiative is part of Nova Scotia’s Nursing Strategy, designed to ensure Nova Scotia has the right number, mix and distribution of nurses now and in the future    Additional Resources: Nova Scotia Nursing Strategy: https://novascotia.ca/dhw/nurses/  -30- "

192,2020-07-27 10:32:00,Canada,Nova Scotia,,https://novascotia.ca/news/release/?id=20200727001,Government Website,Province to Phase Out Wine Regions Policy ," The Governments of Canada and Australia have reached an understanding concerning certain measures in the World Trade Organization dispute, Canada – Measures Governing the Sale of Wine. This agreement will see Nova Scotia phase out a markup policy applied to wine from emerging wine regions, including Nova Scotia.  In January 2018, Australia filed a complaint against various measures of Canada, Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia in relation to Canada’s commitments under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994. At any stage during the dispute settlement process, parties can settle the dispute by finding a mutually agreed solution.  The Government of Nova Scotia worked closely with the Government of Canada to defend the Nova Scotia Liquor Corporation’s Emerging Wine Regions Policy as being fully consistent with Canada’s international trade obligations. Notwithstanding its confidence in the defence of the policy, the province has decided to end years of litigation with an important trading partner through the NSLC’s transition away from the policy. The policy must be phased out over the next four years. “We are fortunate to have a unique climate and talented winemakers producing world-class products in Nova Scotia,” said Agriculture Minister Keith Colwell. “Government is working with industry to build on its success, and to find ways that balance the interests of our local industry while being compatible with Canada’s trade obligations.” The province will collaborate with the local wine industry in this transition.  Quotes: Government takes its trade obligations seriously. We stand by our position that the Emerging Wine Regions Policy is origin neutral and, to date, no international body has ruled against the NSLC. That said, Australia is an important trading partner for Canada and prolonged litigation means uncertainty for our industry.

The back to school plan is supported by public health, the IWK Health Centre and education partners.  “Children need safe and supportive learning environments and that means being back in school with their peers,” said Zach Churchill, Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development. ""Our plan supports the full, safe return of students and staff, while allowing us to adapt how students will learn if anything changes.” Developed with survey feedback from more than 28,000 parents and students, and input from union and education partners, the plan outlines public health guidelines and enhanced safety measures for students and staff. It also includes measures to enhance student learning. “Our current epidemiology shows that virus activity remains low in the province and education leaders have developed a plan with appropriate public health measures for returning to the classroom,” said Dr. Robert Strang, chief medical officer of health. “I’m comfortable with our schools reopening and my public health team and I will continue to work with education leaders to keep our students, teachers and other school staff safe.” While overall, learning at-home during the spring went well, parents said there were some challenges, like access to technology. Government has invested $4 million to secure 14,000 computers to support student learning for those with limited or no access to technology.  In September, students, families and staff can expect:  Regional Centres for Education and the Conseil scolaire acadien provincial will have plans to support enhanced cleaning, physical distancing and situations specific to schools in their area classrooms to be reorganized to increase spacing treating a class as a bubble, to minimize contact with other students enhanced cleaning on school buses. All school bus riders and drivers will need to wear a mask all staff and students in high school will be required to wear a mask in school spaces where social distancing is not possible, for example hallways and common areas. Students and staff do not have to wear a mask in class, unless they want to, or if they are working with a student whose individual program plan requires a mask be worn regular handwashing or hand sanitizing by students and staff before entering school for classes and throughout the day  in-school assemblies and other large gatherings will not be permitted cafeterias and school food programs will deliver food to students. Students will eat lunch at their desks students will have the opportunity to engage in all subject areas, although some subject areas may look different  The plan includes contingencies if it becomes necessary to adjust based on public health advice.   Quotes: Government has a back to school plan with the appropriate public health measures to support the return of students and staff. Pediatricians across the province agree with this direction because the best place for our children and youth is in school, where they can receive enhanced learning, mental, social and physical well-being, and school support services such as breakfast programs. During the Pandemic, our Provincial Pediatric Advisory Group will continue to review worldwide evidence and work with parents, education and public health leaders to ensure we reduce COVID risks and promote student well-being.

As an independent officer of the legislature doing independent audits, I want to pass on my deepest thanks to current and former members of the legislature for the respect and interest shown in the work of my office. During my six years as auditor general the office has tabled 32 reports to assist members in holding government accountable and to positively impact how programs and services are delivered to Nova Scotians. I also want to commend the public service and all members of public sector organizations, which include government departments, Crown corporations and other organizations, that have been subject to audits by the office. It is worthwhile to note that organizations we audit improved their rates of completing our recommendations from about 50 per cent to 75 per cent during the past six years and public sector employees should be proud of the improvements in delivering programs and services to Nova Scotians. In addition to conducting an extensive number of performance audits, during my time as auditor general, the office chose to become the annual financial statement auditor of both the IWK Health Centre and the Nova Scotia Health Authority. I want to extend equal appreciation to my team for their hard work, dedication and output to conduct independent audits with impact for Nova Scotians. During my term the team grew by 10 per cent and represents the diverse culture of Nova Scotia. Thanks to my team for being agile and adaptive and waking up each morning to work hard to do independent audits for the legislature that have improved government for Nova Scotians. One example of this was the office being the first legislative audit office in Canada to report during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic the office tabled three reports to the legislature. Finally, I want to thank my family and friends for their understanding of the long hours, including the weekends and evenings, spent working. I came into this position knowing it would be a 24 hour / 7 day a week job and it pretty much was, and I have no regrets for that. I wish all Nova Scotians well and say thank you for a wonderful six years. -30- "

Crews and machinery broke ground today, July 17. The $718 million project will make the highway safer for motorists and improve the efficiency of one the province’s most important transportation corridors. “This project will save lives and provide travellers and business with a high-quality highway for many years to come,” said Lloyd Hines, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal. “A safe and efficient highway system is essential to the economic and social well-being of Nova Scotia. Our partnership with Dexter Nova Alliance will deliver on that goal.” Dexter Nova Alliance, led by local contractors Dexter Construction and Nova Construction, with BBGI as an equity partner, was awarded the contract to design, build, finance, operate and maintain a section of Highway 104 in May. Construction will be completed before the end of 2023. The Highway 104 project, part of the Trans-Canada Highway, consists of construction of a twinned highway beginning east of New Glasgow near Exit 27 at Sutherlands River, and running east to just west of Exit 31. The project includes 28 kilometres of new two-lane twinned highway and 10 kilometres of new four-lane twinned highway. There are two new interchanges and about 24 new bridges. Dexter Nova Alliance will also upgrade the existing section of highway. The federal government is contributing $90 million to the project under the National Trade Corridors Fund.  Quotes: This is a significant project that will have a positive impact on our province for decades to come. It will be built by Nova Scotia-based companies for Nova Scotians and we are proud of that.

While safety remains our top priority, it’s time to bring some normalcy back into the lives of those in long-term care.” Changes to the province’s directive to long-term care homes will allow for more visitors outdoors, limited indoor visits, and some return to activities. Effective July 22, the following changes can be implemented by long-term care facilities:  both indoor and outdoor visits will be allowed with limited numbers of visitors and scheduled appointments. Residents and visitors must wear masks and observe physical distancing, except for limited physical contact like a hug residents and staff can gather in groups of 10 or less for dining, recreation or socializing without physical distancing. Groups should remain consistent and visitors cannot join sightseeing bus trips for groups of up to 10 people (including residents, staff and driver) are allowed. Residents and staff cannot get off the bus and thorough cleaning before and after each trip is required licensed hair salons within long-term care homes can reopen to serve residents only  Individual long-term care homes can decide which of these changes they will implement, based on operational considerations and the availability of appropriate space. Adult Residential Centres and Regional Rehabilitation Centres licensed by the Department of Community Services will also implement indoor visits under the same guidelines. Starting July 24, it will be mandatory for drivers and passengers to wear a non-medical mask on public transportation. Children under two and people with a valid medical reason for not wearing a mask are exempt. Passengers are asked to use their own masks as much as possible. Government will help public transportation services with supplies of masks for people who can’t bring their own. Public transportation includes:  municipal transit buses and ferries school buses community transit vehicles private taxis and shuttles  “Wearing a non-medical mask is important to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 when physical distancing is difficult, along with all the other public health measures,” said Dr. Strang. “By making masks mandatory on public transportation, we are taking a first step in this priority environment as we continue to look at the epidemiology and mask use in different settings.”  Quick Facts: -- information about wearing a non-medical mask can be found at https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/staying-healthy/#masks   Additional Resources: Government of Canada: https://canada.ca/coronavirus Government of Canada information line 1-833-784-4397 (toll-free) The Mental Health Provincial Crisis Line is available 24/7 to anyone experiencing a mental health or addictions crisis, or someone concerned about them, by calling 1-888-429-8167 (toll-free) Kids Help Phone is available 24/7 by calling 1-800-668-6868 (toll-free) For help or information about domestic violence 24/7, call 1-855-225-0220 (toll-free)  -30- "

NSCC issued a tender on June 26 to start the construction phase of the project. This tender is expected to be awarded within two weeks. Other construction tenders will be issued over the next 18 months. “The new campus will create a dynamic learning environment with state-of-the-art technology that will attract students from across the province,” said Derek Mombourquette, Minister of Energy and Mines on behalf of Labi Kousoulis, Minister of Labour and Advanced Education. “This project will contribute to our skilled workforce and have long-term economic benefits for the region.”  Working with Cape Breton Regional Municipality (CBRM), the playground adjacent to the boardwalk near the fire station will be removed and a section of the boardwalk south of Falmouth Street will be closed to the public starting at the end of July for the duration of the project. A pedestrian walkway will be maintained on Falmouth Street with appropriate signs to redirect pedestrians to the sidewalk on Esplanade.  Nova Scotia’s post-secondary sector plays an important role in the province’s economic growth. The relocation of NSCC’s Marconi campus to the Sydney waterfront will help revitalize the downtown and create a destination campus in Cape Breton’s busiest centre.  Quotes: In less than a year since the location was announced, the groundwork for our new Sydney campus has moved forward quickly. I’m so pleased to now see this tremendous investment from the province which will fuel the construction phase for our new campus – an invaluable investment in the college’s work and mission and in the community itself. Don Bureaux, president, NSCC  It is exciting and rewarding to see construction begin.

That is why a new pilot program will provide funding for people to have their skills and experience assessed and to complete the Recognizing Prior Learning process to become certified to work as continuing care assistants.  This process will help those who may be currently working as long-term care assistants, or care workers who have come to Nova Scotia who want their credentials and experience recognized.  “Continuing care assistants look after our loved ones in long-term care as well as at home,” said Health and Wellness Minister Randy Delorey. “By helping more people have their skills and experience recognized and become certified continuing care assistants, we are supporting the workforce to provide more care for those who need it.” The Recognizing Prior Learning process has two phases. The first is an assessment, where the participant shows what they know. The second phase is education, where the participant completes any outstanding training, education modules, or skills demonstration, and writes the certification exam.  The pilot program will support up to 200 participants by waiving the assessment phase fees ($800), and/or reducing the education phase fees by $800.  To qualify, participants must:  be accepted as a participant in the Phase One or Two of the Recognizing Prior Learning program between March 1, 2020 and March 1, 2021 provide a letter from a Nova Scotia continuing care employer indicating the participant is currently employed or has been offered employment sign a letter of intent to work in Nova Scotia for one year after certification  The pilot program will also provide for 10 new assessors and more support for employers to screen participants.  Funding for this initiative comes from the Canada-Nova Scotia Home and Community Care and Mental Health and Addiction Services Funding Agreement. To apply, visit http://www.novascotiacca.ca/.  Quotes: The Recognizing Prior Learning process acknowledges the knowledge, skills and attitudes gained through on-the-job training, formal education, and life experiences. It allows people to demonstrate their abilities and become certified continuing care assistants more quickly. Pam Shipley, Continuing Care Assistant Program Manager    Quick Facts:  the pilot program will run until March 1, 2021 and will be managed by the Health Association of Nova Scotia costs for the education phase vary, depending on the additional training needed, and typically range between $800 and $1,800 293 people have been certified through the Recognizing Prior Learning process in the last five years this is one of several initiatives underway to recruit and retain more continuing care assistants. Others include launching a bursary program in 2019 and making it easier for retired and internationally-trained nurses to work in the field   -30- "

Starting Friday, July 3, if people live in another Atlantic Canadian province and want to visit Nova Scotia, they will need to show proof of residency to enter the province. Every adult will need to show either a drivers’ licence, government identification card, health card, or a utility bill or bank statement with a valid Atlantic Canadian address to provincial officials at airports, ferries or the land border when they arrive in the province. No self-declaration form will be required. If people can prove with these documents that their permanent home is in Atlantic Canada, they will not have to self-isolate for 14 days when coming into Nova Scotia. “Businesses and communities are looking forward to welcoming Atlantic Canadian visitors,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “We’ve worked hard to get to the point where we can welcome our neighbours safely and it’s important for everyone to respect the public health guidelines.” It is important to remember that Nova Scotia’s borders are restricted, not closed. People from outside Atlantic Canada are welcome in the province. They must self-isolate for 14 days when they arrive.

In July, government will expand the Nova Scotia Child Benefit to include more families, while also raising the amount eligible families receive.  The $18 million investment, included in the 2020-21 budget, is the largest single increase to the benefit since it was created in 1998. “We’re putting more money directly in the hands of families who need it,” said Kelly Regan, Minister of Community Services. “This is another major investment in the children of our province.” Families with incomes below $34,000 will now be eligible. Previously, only those earning $26,000 or less qualified. The amount will also increase from $625 per year to $925 annually for the first child for all eligible families. The first monthly payment will be issued July 20, in combination with the federal government’s increase to the Canada Child Benefit payment. Families do not have to apply.  Quick Facts:  the benefit is a tax-free, monthly payment to families with children under 18 families that are newly eligible will also now qualify for the Low-Income Pharmacare for Children Program for children under the age of 18  for each additional child, families will receive between $412 and $900 annually depending on income level the expanded child benefit will support an additional 6,100 families including 10,000 more children - a total of 28,000 families and 49,000 children across Nova Scotia  receipt of the Nova Scotia Child Benefit is tied to when Nova Scotians file their 2019 personal income tax return.

If a recognized business or organization is planning an event outdoors, 250 people can attend with physical distancing rules in place. For an indoor event, the limit is 50 per cent capacity to a maximum of 200, again with physical distancing.  Gatherings not run by a recognized business or organization, for example a family event in the backyard, are still subject to the 50-person maximum limit with physical distancing unless you’re in your close social group of 10.  The expanded gathering limits apply to social events, faith gatherings, weddings, funerals and other cultural events, and arts and culture events like theatre performances, dance recitals, festivals and concerts. Guidelines for these types of events are available at https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/docs/Events-theatres-and-venues-COVID-19-prevention-guidelines.pdf  People can continue to gather in close social groups of up to 10 without physical distancing. People in a group are not required to be exclusive but they are strongly encouraged to maintain a consistent group. People should not gather in random or spontaneous groups of 10. Businesses that are too small to ensure physical distancing can still have no more than 10 people on their premises at a time with as much physical distancing as possible.  In addition, the following restrictions are being eased, effectively immediately:  restaurants and licensed liquor establishments can operate at 100 per cent capacity and serve patrons until midnight with appropriate distancing between tables. Patrons must leave by 1 a.m. They must continue to follow their sector plans private campgrounds can operate at 100 per cent capacity. They must continue to follow their sector plan public pools can reopen with physical distancing for lane swimming and aquafit classes, and one or more groups of 10 for other activities based on pool size. They must follow the Nova Scotia Lifesaving Society plan for change rooms and washrooms. It will take municipalities and other public pools time to prepare for reopening  people living in homes funded by disability support programs can resume going out into their communities, although it may take time for homes to make arrangements  Dr Strang now recommends that all Nova Scotians wear a non-medical mask in situations where distancing may not be able to be kept, such as in stores, on public transit, or at gatherings. The exceptions are children under two or anyone who has a medical reason for not wearing a mask. “Reopening our economy and society is important but it also increases risk, so it is paramount that we continue our public health measures to minimize a second wave of COVID-19,” said Dr. Strang. “That includes physical distancing as much as possible, good hand hygiene, cough etiquette, staying home if you’re sick and wearing a non-medical mask when you’re in public places like the grocery store where physical distancing is difficult.” To date, Nova Scotia has 52,553 negative test results, 1,061 positive COVID-19 cases, and 63 deaths. The province currently has no active cases. Cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. Nine-hundred and ninety-eight cases are now resolved. Two people are currently in hospital.

We hope that seeing the ship sail along our sea-bound coast will help communities remember that as with all storms, the sun will shine again.” Due to COVID-19, the 20-person crew has created a Bluenose bubble for training, maintenance and sailing the vessel this season. Visitors will not be permitted onboard and there will be no harbour cruises with passengers. Nova Scotia’s sailing ambassador is scheduled to depart Lunenburg in late July and visit 26 communities in southwestern Nova Scotia, the South Shore, Halifax Regional Municipality and Cape Breton. Bluenose II will also sail along parts of the coast of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island but will not dock in any ports.

The celebrations will be much different this year because of COVID-19, but the spirit and meaning of this important day are in no way diminished. In fact, given the experiences and tragedies in different parts of our country in recent months, this day takes on even more significance. There have been many conversations about the sad reality that Indigenous people are still subject to racism, both systemic and overt. This is unacceptable and we all have a role to play in ensuring we have a fair and just society for all. A key part of that journey is raising cultural awareness and understanding, something we have committed to do with the strong, vibrant Mi’kmaw culture in Nova Scotia. We continue to develop resources in our schools and have made the promotion of Mi’kmaw culture a major part of our Culture Action Plan. I am proud of how much we have achieved together to recognize the Mi’kmaw language, promote treaty education and celebrate Mi’kmaw culture and heritage, and I look forward to accomplishing much more. Unfortunately, we have lost a wonderful educational opportunity this summer with the postponement of the North American Indigenous Games due to COVID-19. This celebration of sport and culture would have drawn more than 5,000 participants from across the continent to our province. While disappointing, we continue to work with the games’ host society on the way forward. In Nova Scotia, we recognize the importance of Mi’kmaw culture every day. On National Indigenous Peoples Day, let us all reflect on the contributions of Indigenous people across the country. -30- "

287,2020-06-18 12:03:00,Canada,Nova Scotia,,https://novascotia.ca/news/release/?id=20200618004,Government Website,New Gathering Limits Announced ," Premier Stephen McNeil and Dr. Robert Strang, chief medical officer of health for Nova Scotia, announced today, June 18, changes to gathering limits given Nova Scotia’s low rates of COVID-19.  “We’ve now had well over a week with no new cases of COVID-19 and low rates for the last several weeks. That is thanks to Nova Scotians who have been following public health protocols,” said Premier McNeil. “Our aim is to safely open as much of the economy and our province as we can so that Nova Scotians and the business community can have a good summer. The core measures of social distancing and good hygiene that have kept case numbers low will stay in place. But effective today, household bubbles are down and gathering limits are up.”  People can now gather in groups of up to 10 without physical distancing. People in a group are not required to be exclusive but they are strongly encouraged to maintain a consistent group.   This is especially important for Nova Scotians who are more at risk of complications from COVID-19. This change replaces the concept of family household bubbles. Gatherings of up to 50 will now be allowed but people must observe physical distancing of two metres or six feet. The larger gathering limit of 50 applies to social events, faith gatherings, sports and physical activity, weddings and funerals, and arts and culture events like theatre performances, dance recitals, festivals and concerts. Businesses that are too small to ensure physical distancing can have no more than 10 people on their premises at a time.  Effective today, playgrounds can start reopening. Municipalities and other owners of playgrounds will need time to prepare them for reopening so Nova Scotians should not expect them to be open immediately. “We’re providing a new option for close social interaction because it’s important for our well-being, but everybody needs to make decisions that take into consideration the risks, their own circumstances, and how they help keep everyone safe,” said Dr. Strang. “It’s important that we all continue physical distancing as much as possible, good hand hygiene, cough etiquette, staying home if you’re sick and making informed decisions about the groups and activities we choose to join.” To date, Nova Scotia has 50,240 negative test results, 1,061 positive COVID-19 cases, 62 deaths, and two active COVID-19 cases. Cases range in age from under 10 to over 90. Two individuals are currently in hospital, one of those in ICU. Nine-hundred and ninety-seven cases are now resolved.

Strong sales growth exceeded projections with a 4.2 per cent increase in earnings to $247.3 million compared to the previous fiscal year. This growth was driven by the first full year of cannabis sales, the introduction of new cannabis categories, sales growth in all local product categories and an influx in sales due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There continues to be strong growth in all local product categories. Nova Scotia ready-to-drink sales, driven primarily by vodka coolers, were up 101.4 per cent to $16 million over the previous fiscal year, while Nova Scotia craft beer sales were up 21.5 per cent, to $20.1 million. Nova Scotia spirit sales grew by 22.2 per cent to $9.4 million, while Nova Scotia wine sales increased by eight per cent to $12.5 million.

294,2020-06-15 14:36:00,Canada,Nova Scotia,,https://novascotia.ca/news/release/?id=20200615007,Government Website,Fair Treatment of African Nova Scotians ," As prosecutors, Crown attorneys of the Nova Scotia Public Prosecution Service are committed to the fair treatment of all members of the public who encounter the criminal justice system, including African Nova Scotians. We are disgusted by the recent acts of violence that have resulted in the loss of black lives including George Floyd. We condemn the past and present-day violence that continues to be inflicted upon black people, including violence by people sworn to protect and serve our community. We are mindful of the legacy of colonialism, centuries of slavery and segregation. We recognize that anti-black racism and racial profiling remain an ongoing and deeply entrenched social problem. Many African Nova Scotians experience systemic and direct racism, including racial profiling everyday. We acknowledge the effects of these experiences, as well as the historical disadvantages, have led to lack of opportunities and over-representation of African Nova Scotians in correctional facilities.      Our courts have acknowledged the existence of institutionalized racism in Nova Scotia. In the Supreme Court of Canada’s 1997 decision in R.D.S. v. Her Majesty the Queen, the Court stated:  “The reasonable person must thus be deemed to be cognizant of the existence of racism in Halifax, Nova Scotia. It follows that judges may take notice of actual racism known to exist in a particular society. Judges have done so with respect to racism in Nova Scotia.  “Racism is a pernicious reality. The issue of racism existing in Nova Scotia has been well documented in the Marshall Inquiry Report, previously known as the Royal Commission on the Donald Marshall, Jr. Prosecution. A person would have to be stupid, complacent or ignorant not to acknowledge its presence, not only individually, but also systemically and institutionally.” The Public Prosecution Service was established as a direct result of the Royal Commission on the Donald Marshall Jr. Prosecution. We understand our obligation to seek justice by applying laws fairly and equitably to all whom encounter the criminal justice system, including African Nova Scotians. A fair and equitable justice system is essential to a free and democratic society.      As mentioned in our last news release, the Public Prosecution Service was contacted by members of the public asking for the charges against Santina Rao to be withdrawn. To protect the fundamental right of due process of law, our prosecutors do not publicly debate matters before the courts. However, we can say that our prosecutors are duty-bound to look at both the availability of sufficient evidence and whether it is in the public interest to proceed with a prosecution. In doing this, our prosecutors are empowered to consider systemic racism, including racial profiling, faced by African Nova Scotians as an important factor on both grounds of this analysis.      Our prosecution service acknowledges that much work is still required to meaningfully address this longstanding issue. However, it is important to highlight some of the work we are doing toward improving prosecutions involving members of marginalized communities, either as accused persons or as victims of crimes: Building organizational change:  in 2015, the Public Prosecution Service renewed an Equity and Diversity Committee. The committee’s mandate is to support the Public Prosecution Service by promoting, monitoring and providing advice about programs and policies that enhance equity and diversity within the service, in the delivery of prosecution services and in our efforts to contribute to addressing equity and diversity issues across the criminal justice system to enhance the administration of justice  Engaging in education/training for Crown attorneys:   spring 2019 – Dr. Scot Wortley, professor of criminology at the University of Toronto and author of the Wortley Report on HRM street checks, spoke to our Crown attorneys about his report and on equity and diversity October 2019 – Public Prosecution Service Fall Education Conference – education session on the history of slavery and racism in Nova Scotia and how that history impacts our prosecution process, including sentencing  Contribution to reversing overrepresentation:  work is underway on a comprehensive Public Prosecution Service policy respecting the fair treatment of African Nova Scotians in criminal prosecutions, which will be patterned after our policy Fair Treatment of Indigenous People in Criminal Prosecutions in Nova Scotia, issued to Crown attorneys in October of 2018. Central to both policies is the acknowledgment that racism and discrimination have contributed to the over-representation of Indigenous persons and African Nova Scotians in our criminal justice system  Increased support for existing initiatives:  for the first time ever, an articled clerk position with Public Prosecution Service will be offered exclusively to a graduate of the Indigenous Black and Mi’kmaq Initiative at the Schulich School of Law at Dalhousie University  The Nova Scotia Public Prosecution Service continues to strive everyday to deliver on our mission to prosecute with professionalism, integrity and fairness for all Nova Scotians. We want to assure all Nova Scotians that we are committed to the hard work of tackling this complex issue. We remain committed to ensuring the fair treatment within the criminal justice system of African Nova Scotians by striving to be sensitive to and acknowledging their unique history and experiences.  -30- "

However, older people may be more vulnerable to abuse, particularly as people are staying home due to COVID-19.  Today, June 15, is World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, a time to remind all Nova Scotians to stay connected with older people.  “Now more than ever it’s important to reach out, to listen and to appreciate our loved ones who built the foundations we live on today,” said Leo Glavine, Minister of Seniors. “Social distancing is important to prevent the spread of COVID-19, but it can also make it more difficult to recognize abuse when it happens. Keeping in touch with each other can make a big difference.” Elder abuse can take many forms, including financial, emotional, psychological, physical or sexual. Abuse can also come in the form of neglect – failing to provide the necessities of life such as food, clothing, safe shelter, medical attention or personal care. Abuse of older adults is more common than many of us realize and often occurs within a relationship where there is an expectation of trust. If people think they or someone they know is experiencing abuse or having difficulties, help is available. They can call 211 or reach out to the seniors’ safety program in their area for advice and information.   Quotes: The abuse of older adults is a real and serious issue in our communities. All Nova Scotians deserve to be treated with fairness, dignity and respect. Michelle Parker, Kings County seniors' safety co-ordinator  Abuse thrives in silence and isolation. We don’t always recognize that our actions and behaviours may be causing harm or allowing it to happen. It is important that we reflect on our own attitudes and assumptions about growing older that may be negatively impacting the well-being of older people. Sharon Elliott, Annapolis County seniors' safety co-ordinator    Quick Facts:  according to the World Health Organization, it’s estimated that one in six older adults worldwide experiences elder abuse, often by someone they know and trust World Elder Abuse Awareness Day is an official United Nations International Day acknowledging the significance of elder abuse as a public health and human rights issue    Additional Resources: For contact information for the seniors’ safety program in your area, please visit: https://novascotia.ca/seniors/senior_Safety_Programs.asp The Department of Seniors’ booklet, Understanding Senior Abuse, is available at https://novascotia.ca/seniors/stopabuse/ .

The policy was developed with input from a November 2018 online school bus consultation survey that more than 8,000 Nova Scotians responded to. “After consulting with school communities throughout Halifax Regional Municipality, we have made substantial changes to provide safe and reliable transportation for our students and school communities,” said Zach Churchill, Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development. “While families and students outside HRM are quite satisfied with existing bus services, it is clear from conversations with families and the education community that changes were necessary to improve how we help students get to school.” The student transportation policy will:  set new provincial criteria for school bus eligibility.

They offer guidance on how day camps can prevent and reduce the spread of COVID-19, manage disease outbreaks, advise staff on the use of personal protective equipment and outline public health measures that address physical distancing, hygiene practices, cleaning practices, outdoor activities and other considerations.  Based on these guidelines, all day camp operators must have an individual plan in place to support reopening. Plans will cover key areas such as:  increased cleaning staggered pick up and drop off times screening staff and campers limiting group sizes to 10, keeping the same groups of children together multiple groups are allowed but they must be kept separated  increased hand washing and minimizing sharing of equipment  Day camps will communicate directly with families about their specific reopening plans.

Dr. Robert Strang, chief medical officer of health for Nova Scotia, announced today, June 5, an exemption under the Public Health Act order to allow community organizations, businesses or municipalities to hold celebrations to recognize graduates due to the loss of traditional graduation ceremonies. All public high schools in Nova Scotia will recognize and honour Grade 12 graduates receiving diplomas. This will be separate from any celebrations that might be held in the community. All non-school based, community celebrations of graduates must be held by a recognized business, municipality or community organization (like a club, association, society, volunteer group, faith-based group), and the local municipality, police and fire departments and EHS must be informed and supportive of the planned event. “Graduation ceremonies are an important tradition not only for the students who worked so hard to get there, but for their loved ones who supported them along the way,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “The class of 2020 is moving on from high school during a unique time and while their festivities will look different this year, there are ways to celebrate safely. Congratulations to all of the graduates of 2020. I know the last few months of school looked quite a bit different, but I hope you’re proud of all you’ve accomplished.” “Living with COVID-19 continues to be a balance for us all. Unfortunately, students leaving school this year won’t have a traditional graduation ceremony or prom,” said Dr. Strang. “We want to support communities in recognizing these students, but it’s vital these celebrations are done safely, without risking the health of participants.” Conditions under the exemption include:  attendees must arrive in a vehicle  all passengers in the vehicle must be from a single household or household bubble  graduates can be out of their vehicle to do things like cross a stage or take part in a parade of graduates as long as physical distance (two metres or six feet) is maintained between all graduates while they are out of their vehicle organizers must communicate clearly with attendees in advance and ensure other public health protocols, like physical distancing, are followed  A full list of the conditions and protocols under this exemption can be found at https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/community-celebration-graduates .

The province is responding to the sector’s immediate needs to help keep it strong. “This support package will help farmers manage risks that are currently threatening the viability of their farm operations and our food supply system,” said Agriculture Minister Keith Colwell. “We need a strong agriculture sector and by taking these steps, we are helping our farm families improve their competitiveness, productivity and profitability at a time of significant change.” In partnership with the federal government, the assistance includes a new COVID-19 Response and Mitigation Program, funded under the Canadian Agricultural Partnership, that helps mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The program will help food producers with the costs of meeting extra health requirements due to COVID-19, help producers get their crops to market, fund projects aimed at maintaining competitiveness, productivity, profitability, and support abattoir efficiency and development. Nova Scotia and the Government of Canada have agreed to increase the 2020 AgriStability interim benefit payment percentage from 50 to 75 per cent for producers. The program supports producers experiencing a large decline in farm income. They are also providing a 10 per cent discount on producers’ share of AgriInsurance premiums, saving farmers from making these payments during difficult times. AgriInsurance is an insurance against natural hazards to reduce the financial impact of production losses. Agricultural businesses can apply for the assistance now.  Quotes: Working with the province, our government is there every step of the way to help Nova Scotia farmers with the challenges they face to bring their high-quality products to market. This investment made through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership will help Nova Scotia’s food sector remain resilient and strong.

A consortium with a strong Nova Scotia presence has been awarded the contract to design, build, finance, operate and maintain the 38 kilometre twinned section of Highway 104.  Dexter Nova Alliance, led by local contractors Dexter Construction and Nova Construction, with BBGI as an equity partner, outbid two other companies shortlisted for the $717.9 million project. Construction will start in June and will be completed no later than the end of 2023. “This project will save lives,” said Lloyd Hines, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure Renewal. “Nova Scotians were clear that they want safe roads now. This will mean a safer, affordable and more efficient highway being opened years earlier than a conventional highway project.” The Highway 104 project consists of construction of a twinned highway beginning east of New Glasgow, near Exit 27 at Sutherlands River, and running east for a distance of 38 kilometres.  The project includes 28 kilometres of new two-lane twinned highway and 10 kilometres of new four- lane twinned highway.   There are two new interchanges and about 24 new bridges.  Dexter Nova Alliance will also upgrade the existing section of highway, which will include repaving the entire section of old road and replace seven existing bridges.  The federal government is contributing $90 million to the project under the National Trade Corridors Fund.  Quotes: This is great news. It is a dream come true to see this project now becoming a reality. This will mean a lot to have a safer road from Sutherlands River to Antigonish. I believe many lives will be saved.

But I need to be clear: if we see an increase in positive cases or people not continuing to adhere to all the public health measures, the restrictions will return.” Existing public health directives around social distancing and social gatherings remain in place. People must keep two metres apart and not gather in groups of more than five. The initial steps are:  provincial and municipal parks can reopen, but playground equipment will continue to be off limits trails are allowed to open people are allowed to use and visit community gardens garden centres, nurseries and similar businesses can open sportfishing is permitted from shore or boat, but fishing derbies are not allowed people can attend boating, yacht or sailing clubs for the purpose of preparing boats for use golf driving ranges can open, including those at golf clubs, but the course must remain closed; golf clubs can perform necessary maintenance and preparations for opening people can use their cottages. Use is restricted to one household unit at a time, travel must be directly to the cottage and back, and travelling back and forth frequently from cottage and primary residence is discouraged provincial and private campgrounds remain closed, but they can perform necessary maintenance and preparations for opening. An exception is recreational vehicles parked year-round at private campgrounds, which can be used but must follow the same rules as cottages drive-in religious services will be allowed, as long as people stay in their cars, they are parked two metres apart and there are no interactions between people in cars or between people in cars and others  These measures take effect immediately. Details on these adjustments can be found at, https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus/ “Our ability to open things up further – for example, beaches, golf courses and campgrounds -- depends on how each of us does with these adjustments, how well Nova Scotians comply and how the pandemic continues to impact people’s health,” Dr. Strang said. “We can’t let our guards down. We need to continue to flatten the curve.” A phased plan to further lift public health restrictions is under development. It is based on science and the timing of each phase will be determined by the result to the easing of restrictions.

This step was taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic to help protect the drug supply and is similar to measures in place in other parts of the country. “We understand some people are feeling the financial strain of additional dispensing fees,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “This will help people keep a little more money in their pockets, while protecting the drug supply to ensure Nova Scotians can get the medications they need.” Government will also waive the $5.00 prescription co-pay for clients of the Income Assistance program and the Low Income Pharmacare for Children program.  These temporary measures take effect Thursday, April 23.  Nova Scotia has recorded 12 deaths related to COVID-19 and a total of 772 positive test results.

Today, Nova Scotia reported 517 positive cases of COVID-19. According to the projections, if Nova Scotia had not put strong public health measures in place, the province could have instead had 943 cases as of today. They also show that if Nova Scotians continue to follow public health orders, there could be 1,453 cases by June 30, but with poor compliance, cases could grow to 6,269 over that time period. It is important to note the numbers are only modelling estimates. The projections show a flattened peak in total cases in May that continues into June if public health measures continue.  “The public health directives we’ve put in place are working,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “These projections clearly show complying with social distancing and other measures can save lives. But we have to stay vigilant. The coming weeks are crucial, and we must continue to follow the protocols.” Testing has proven to be effective. The QEII Health Sciences Centre's microbiology lab is operating 24-hours. Nova Scotia is second in Canada in the number of people tested per million. Other highlights of the projections include:  without public health measures, the model projects hospitalizations of COVID-19 cases would peak at about 85 in May then slowly begin to decline. With strongly sticking to public health orders there would be a peak of about 35 in May and then decline throughout June currently, the most cases in the province are in the Dartmouth/southeastern community health network, almost double of nearby Halifax  The pandemic modelling was developed by staff from the Department of Health and Wellness, Nova Scotia Health Authority and IWK Health Centre.

The webpage also houses a new video highlighting the increased prevalence of COVID-19 related investment fraud.

Quotes: The commission wants to make it as easy as possible for investors, registrants, issuers and other industry members to find COVID-19 investing information in one place. Unfortunately, during uncertain times like the COVID-19 pandemic, fraudsters try to take advantage of investors’ fears to steal their money.

Halifax and Associates is soliciting investments over the phone and through its website, halifaxandassociates.com . Investors are required to provide specific personal information after opening an account. The commission urges Nova Scotians to exercise extreme caution when dealing with anyone that is not registered in Nova Scotia. If you have had contact with Halifax and Associates, please contact the commission. Nova Scotians can contact the commission to report scams or what is believed to be suspicious behavior from anyone offering investment opportunities.   Quotes: The internet can be a dangerous place to shop for investments. Always take the time to check registration and understand the risks and costs associated with your investments.

The province will work with the Nova Scotia Health Authority (NSHA) and Emergency Health Services (EHS) on the following options: temporary primary assessment centres, EHS assessment units, a mobile assessment centre and expanded lab testing. “This virus is in our communities, it’s dangerous and it’s up to all of us to slow it down,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “Expanding testing will help us identify and respond more quickly to spread in communities but the best defence continues to be following the public health orders. People need to stay home.” More detail on the four expanded testing options includes:  temporary primary assessment centres: will be established in communities with more known cases. The first temporary assessment centre opened today, April 5, in Elmsdale. Like the other assessment centres, people must be referred by 811. Those directed to an assessment centre will have a physical assessment onsite and swabbed if appropriate mobile assessment centre: NSHA is working on a mobile assessment centre. Once operational, the centre could be brought into communities temporarily to do assessment and testing EHS assessment units: there are now two mobile units, one in the Halifax Regional Municipality and one for the most populated areas of Cape Breton Regional Municipality, staffed by paramedics trained to do at-home testing. They will be used for people who have mobility issues and cannot get to an assessment centre or in situations where a cluster of testing needs to be done, for example at a long-term care home. When someone is referred to an assessment centre via 811, it will be determined whether an EHS assessment unit should be used expanded lab capacity: to accommodate the increase in testing, starting April 6, the QEII Health Sciences Centre Microbiology Lab will move to full 24-hour operations. The lab will be capable of processing over 1,000 tests per day  “Expanding our testing options means we have the ability to act quickly if we’re seeing clusters of disease in communities or locations and ensures we’re able to accommodate vulnerable Nova Scotians and those living in harder-to-reach communities,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health. “But testing is only half the battle. We know the disease is in our communities and that’s why it’s more important than ever before to keep your physical distance and only gather in groups of no more than five if it’s absolutely essential to reduce the spread of this virus.” Today Nova Scotia announced 26 new cases of COVID-19 for a total of 262 positive cases to date.

Nova Scotians should not leave the province and only leave home for essential items and services. A state of emergency gives government broad powers to do whatever is necessary for the safety and protection of Nova Scotians.  “These decisions were not made lightly and should signal to Nova Scotians the seriousness of what’s before us,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “These orders may seem harsh but they are absolutely necessary. We all have a moral and legal obligation to obey if we want to bring the spread of COVID-19 under control.”   Under the state of emergency:  Nova Scotia borders will tighten to travellers and all entry points (land, sea, air) will be closely managed starting Monday, March 23, at 6 a.m., Nova Scotians should only leave if essential. Anyone entering the province will be stopped, questioned and told to self-isolate for 14 days. Exemptions for cross-border travel include healthy workers in trades and transportations sectors who move goods and people (e.g. truck drivers); healthy people going to work (e.g. health-care workers); and people travelling into the province for essential health services (e.g. chemotherapy treatment) effective immediately, provincial parks, beaches and tourist attractions are closed. Provincial trails will remain open for exercise. Gathering limits and social distancing guidelines must be followed police will be authorized to enforce orders under the Health Protection Act. If Nova Scotians and businesses do not practice social distancing and self-isolation, they will face fines of $1,000 for individuals and $7,500 for businesses. Multiple fines can be given each day an individual or business fails to comply. Police can also enforce offences under the Emergency Management Act. For example, fines for charging higher than fair market prices for goods and services there are several groups who are essential and exempt from gathering limits. They include but are not limited to grocery stores, gas stations and pharmacies. If possible, one person per family should be designated to do these tasks. Other groups include construction sites, health-care services, community services (e.g. child protection), criminal justice services and law enforcement  New orders in effect under the Health Protection Act include:  effective immediately, social gatherings of more than five people are prohibited any workplace or business that is not deemed essential can remain open as long as a two-metre or six-foot distance can be maintained. Workspaces must also be cleaned and disinfected at a minimum of twice daily or as required and employees follow proper hygiene dentists can no longer practice dentistry in their offices unless they deem it necessary to perform an emergency dental procedure in the best interest of the patient’s health (in effect March 21)  “This is a significant adjustment for all of us and people are understandably anxious about the changes in our daily lives,” said Dr. Robert Strang, Nova Scotia’s chief medical officer of health. “Nova Scotians must follow public health direction - practice good hygiene, keep a social distance of six feet and self-isolate for 14 days if you have travelled outside the province or are feeling unwell.

That is why government is supporting two community-led projects in the Annapolis Valley designed to support doctor recruitment and retention.  “We know when community leaders and volunteers get involved in recruiting new doctors and their families to their communities and supporting them as they settle in, there are positive results,” said Kings South MLA Keith Irving on behalf of Leo Glavine, Minister of Communities, Culture and Heritage. “In Kings County, we are taking a partnership approach -- pooling government resources and drawing on expertise in our communities with the ultimate goal of attracting and retaining more doctors.” The Valley Regional Hospital in Kentville hosts up to 10 medical residents at a time who spend the first two years of their career in the region. The Annapolis Valley Chamber of Commerce is kicking off a new project that will connect medical residents with volunteers in the community to provide one-on-one support to encourage doctors to stay once their residency is complete. The organization will also gather information to help the community better understand local issues and opportunities related to doctor recruitment and retention. Government will provide $20,000 toward this project.  The Town of Middleton will use a $10,000 grant to continue its work to build a community of support for doctors and their families. This project includes conducting focus groups and interviews with doctors and families who have moved to the area in the last five years and building programs that draw from best-practices in other communities. Representatives from the counties of Annapolis and Kings, villages of Kingston and Greenwood, and the Soldiers Memorial Hospital Foundation will be invited to sit on the steering committee for this project.   Quotes: As an organization that has supported and celebrated the Annapolis Valley business community for many years, we see this work to create a more welcoming community for doctors and their families as a natural fit.

The chief medical officer of health is also encouraging individuals, employers and community organizations to limit social gatherings to no more than 150 people to limit spread. This could include events like weddings, church services, movie theatres and concerts. This measure will help protect vulnerable Nova Scotians who are at greatest risk and will be reassessed as the situation evolves.

Anyone who has travelled outside Canada may have come in contact with the novel coronavirus and should closely monitor their health for 14 days after returning to the country. Travellers who start to feel unwell, should stay at home/self-isolate away from the public. Individuals who develop a fever, with a temperature 38°C or higher, and/or cough should call 811 for assessment. To date, there have been no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nova Scotia. To help protect older Nova Scotians and those most at risk for severe illness, the province is restricting visitors who have travelled outside the country in the last 14 days from entering long-term care homes.  As always, anyone who is feeling unwell should not enter a facility. “We are expanding our screening to include travel outside of the country as the virus continues to spread,” said Dr. Robert Strang, chief medical officer of health. “With more cases expected in Canada and spread into the community likely, we are adapting our processes to respond to this rapidly evolving situation.” To prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including COVID-19, it is important that all Nova Scotians:  practise good handwashing hygiene use cough and sneeze etiquette  avoid touching your face minimize close face-to-face contact with people who appear ill stay away from others if you feel unwell regularly clean and disinfect high touch surfaces   Nova Scotians can find accurate, up-to-date information at: https://novascotia.ca/coronavirus .

499,2020-03-06 11:24:00,Canada,Nova Scotia,,https://novascotia.ca/news/release/?id=20200306002,Government Website,International Women’s Day: Why Gender Equality Matters in Nova Scotia ," March 8 is International Women’s Day. It’s a day to recognize and celebrate women and girls – in all our diversity – and the difference we make to this world.  When it comes to the issue of gender equality, all of our actions matter. I wish gender equality was no longer an issue in 2020. Unfortunately, this is not the case.  Addressing gender equality also means addressing pressing and complex challenges like gendered-based violence, economic insecurity and underrepresentation in leadership.  In 2018, more than 2000 women in Nova Scotia were victims of police-reported domestic violence. This crime is under-reported, so we know these numbers don’t reflect the actual number of victims. We also know that Aboriginal women experience violent victimization at a rate three times higher than non-Aboriginal women. This needs to change.  That’s why our government committed $9 million to Standing Together: A Provincial Action Plan to Prevent Domestic Violence. This plan is government’s commitment to work differently with community organizations, groups and experts to build an action plan to disrupt harmful cycles of violence.  Human trafficking is another form of gender-based violence that’s rooted in gender inequality. Human trafficking and sexual exploitation have a devastating impact on families and communities. That’s why government is investing an additional $1.4 million per year, for the next five years, into programs, services and supports focused on prevention, raising awareness and directly helping victims and survivors.   Gender-based violence isn’t the only manifestation of gender inequality. There continues to be a gap in the salaries earned by women versus the salaries earned by men doing the same work. This gender wage gap persists across virtually all industries and occupations – even though women have the highest rates of high school completion and post-secondary enrollment. This needs to change.  Research shows that greater pay transparency leads to a smaller gender pay gap. That’s why our government has changed the Labour Standards Code so employers could no longer prohibit employees from sharing information about their salaries. It also means employers will no longer be able to ask a prospective employee what they made in a previous job as a basis for their current salary. For women, this can put an end to a lower salary following her throughout her career. This is an important step in addressing the gender wage gap. Despite higher rates of educational enrollment and attainment, women also continue to be under-represented in leadership and decision-making roles. In more than 250 years, only 50 women have been elected to the provincial legislature. At the municipal level, fewer than one third of seats are held by women. This, too, needs to change. Our systems should reflect the diversity of those we serve. The Local Government Leadership School for Women happening in Port Hawkesbury in May is a great example of how communities are providing knowledge and tools for women who want to run for elected positions. The school is a collaborative model with women leaders from municipalities in the region and women leaders from the Unama’ki First Nations communities.  The Nova Scotia Advisory Council on the Status of Women works across these three areas that touch all our lives: living free from violence, economic security and leadership. It’s through working with community, government, and public and private institutions and enterprises that we can advance gender equality.   The theme for International Women’s Day 2020, Each for Equal, is a call for each of us to work together to build a world where all women and girls have equal opportunity to thrive. I invite all Nova Scotians to answer this call.  We are stronger together. -30- "

That is why government is investing even more into improving access to care across the province.  Government will continue to work with universities to train more doctors and nurses this year. Twelve new first year medical seats will be added at Dalhousie University in August.  Government and its partners will also continue to provide more training and educational opportunities in rural Nova Scotia through expanded residency and clerkship programs. Based on the success of the clerkship program in Cape Breton, it will be launched on the South Shore this fall. Research shows people are more likely to stay in communities where they have trained. More nurses will be trained from one end of the province to the other with 62 new first-year nursing seats being added at Cape Breton University and eight more at Dalhousie University’s Yarmouth campus. This is the largest and only increase in undergraduate nursing seats in 12 years. These new training initiatives will complement other recruitment efforts such as the practice ready assessment program to help internationally trained doctors work in Nova Scotia and immigration programs specifically for doctors and other health professionals and a new fund to support community efforts around doctor recruitment.  Government also wants people to be able to get the medication they need. Nearly $21 million more will go toward things like family and seniors pharmacare and low-income family drug support programs. A new agreement with Nova Scotia’s 1,300 pharmacists allows them to prescribe birth control and medication for urinary tract infections and shingles. Pharmacists can renew prescriptions for 180 days for many items and as of April 1, government will cover the fee for all residents with a valid health card. It is all about giving Nova Scotians more options when it comes to accessing care. “Nova Scotians have told us access to quality health care is their priority and it is our priority too,” said Health and Wellness Minister Randy Delorey. “We are training and hiring more care providers, introducing new incentives and ensuring our trained professionals are working to their full scope of practice.”  This year’s budget sees an additional $75.3 million dedicated for doctor services and salaries. Under the new four-year agreement, family, emergency and anesthesia doctors will become the highest paid in Atlantic Canada and other specialties, like psychiatry, obstetrics and gynecology will be among the highest paid in the region. Incentives to recruit and retain specialists in rural communities have been doubled and hourly rates for psychiatry outside Halifax increased. Other health-care investments this year include:   $1 million for ovarian cancer research  $3.2 million to hire staff and for public education on the upcoming proclamation of the Human Organ and Tissue Donation Act Long-Term Care budget has increased to $612.4 million, up $5.3 million  Mental Health and Addictions budget has increased to $316.5 million, up $0.5 million   funding to Nova Scotia Health Authority and IWK Health Centre has increased to $2.1 billion, up $86 million   Quotes: The Cape Breton University Nursing Program has been a strong contributor to the registered nurse supply for many years. The additional seats now added to the program builds upon this success and will enable CBU to better assist the registered nurse workforce needs in Cape Breton, but more broadly, provincewide. We are particularly pleased this new initiative seeks to encourage more African Nova Scotian and Indigenous students to pursue nursing careers and we look forward to substantial progress in achieving these desired outcomes.

The province wants to hold opioid manufacturers and distributors accountable for the harmful impact of their drugs which is why Government introduced the Opioid Damages and Health Care Costs Recovery Act today, March 3.  “Hundreds of Nova Scotians are dealing with opioid use and dozens die each year from opioid-related overdoses,” said Health and Wellness Minister Randy Delorey. “Too many families have been affected and we believe drug companies need to take responsibility for the role they have played.”   This legislation will ensure Nova Scotia has an option to proceed with action against opioid manufacturers and distributors. This may include supporting British Columbia’s class action lawsuit or taking legal action of its own, to recover health-care costs and other direct costs incurred due to opioid-related disease, injury and illness. The bill will also simplify the procedure for proving damages caused by opioid manufacturers and distributors by allowing the use of aggregate health data instead of individual health records. The act will take effect on proclamation.    Quotes: The prescription of opioids over the past 20 years has created large numbers of people who are dependent on opioids.

More than a quarter of our population is expected to be over the age of 65 by 2030.  That is why government is investing millions in programs and initiatives that support positive aging and make our communities a preferred place for older adults to live, work and connect. That has been the focus of SHIFT: Nova Scotia’s Action Plan for an Aging Population which government launched in 2017. Through SHIFT we are encouraging volunteerism and entrepreneurship, working to create age-friendly communities, expand community transit, increase funding for home repairs and home accommodations and expand home care. More details around the next phase of SHIFT will be announced in the spring. “I am proud of the considerable progress we have made in the last few years on the issues that matter most to older adults,” said Leo Glavine, Minister of Seniors. “This year’s budget is continuing that work by supporting senior entrepreneurs, retaining older workers, investing in housing options and health care, helping people stay healthy, improving accessibility, combating social isolation and more.” This year, government is investing $6.1 million in seniors pharmacare, to make it easier for older Nova Scotians to access medications when and where they need them.  Government is also addressing other important health-care needs that matter to older Nova Scotians including $1.1 million for the Red Cross Health Equipment Loan Program. This funding will be used to buy more equipment, like beds, wheelchairs and specialized mattresses for residents in long-term care facilities funded by the Department of Health and Wellness.

That is why government is making changes to protect both consumers and insurance companies. Amendments to the Nova Scotia Insurance Act introduced today, Feb. 28, will better protect Nova Scotians by providing insurance companies with legal grounds to refuse to transfer ownership of life insurance policies to third parties. Government is also closing the loophole on the use of side accounts.  Currently, third parties are potentially able to buy life insurance policies from seniors or people who are critically ill at a fraction of face value. In addition, they can transfer large sums of money into side accounts to take advantage of fixed interest rates. “We have listened to concerns from industry and are making these changes to better protect vulnerable Nova Scotians,” said Finance and Treasury Board Minister Karen Casey. “Unfortunately, seniors and critically ill Nova Scotians have typically been the most vulnerable to these predatory tactics and government needs to do what we can to help prevent this from occurring.” Changes will come into effect upon proclamation.

Additional changes in the regulations include incorporating federally permitted investment rules, reducing reporting requirements for solvency-exempt plans, allowing employers to take holidays from making normal contributions when the plan is overfunded, exempting individual pension plans from sections of the Pensions Benefit Act, reducing restrictions on benefit improvements, and defining and clarifying conditions around reserve accounts and annuity buy outs as introduced in recent amendments to the Pensions Benefit Act.

That is why government is taking action to address the gender wage gap. Amendments to the Labour Standards Code introduced today, Feb. 20, will help ensure that the salary of a woman who may be paid less than her male counterpart doing the same work, will not follow her throughout her career. The amendments will also expand the equal pay provisions currently in the Labour Standards Code to employees who do not identify exclusively, or at all, as men or women.  “These changes represent a simple principle – equal pay for equal work,” said Minister of Labour and Advanced Education Labi Kousoulis. “This is an important step toward narrowing the gender wage gap in our province and ensuring all Nova Scotians are paid what they deserve.”  Research has shown that greater transparency in wage information leads to a smaller gender pay gap. The proposed amendments will allow individuals to have greater access to pay information when accepting or discussing compensation for a new job. They will also prohibit employers from inquiring about the wage history of a job applicant or employee, as well as prohibit employers from barring employees from discussing or disclosing their own wages or those of other employees.  The changes will also allow government to expand through regulations the equal pay provisions to employees who possess certain characteristics, such as those related to race and ethnicity.  Additionally, the amendments will allow government to make regulations related to administrative penalties to provide the department with the ability to ensure compliance with the Labour Standards Code.  If passed, the amendments would take effect in the spring.   Quotes: “Gender equality not only benefits women and girls, it benefits the whole province,” said Kelly Regan, minister responsible for the Advisory Council on the Status of Women. “It’s important to have legislative and policy frameworks in place that support gender equality in the workforce.”   Quick Facts:  in Nova Scotia, women comprise over 51 per cent of the population and evidence shows that they are more likely to earn the lowest wages based on the average employment income of all workers in Nova Scotia, women earn $0.73 for every $1 earned by men (2017) these amendments are part of government’s commitment to address the complex and structural challenges to advancing gender equality other initiatives include Standing Together, an initiative to build a provincial action plan to prevent domestic violence, the introduction of domestic violence leave, and amendments to parental leave    Additional Resources: Nova Scotia’s Labour Standards Code can be found here: https://nslegislature.ca/sites/default/files/legc/statutes/labour%20standards%20code.pdf  Human Rights Act (which identifies gender identity as a protected ground from discrimination) – https://nslegislature.ca/sites/default/files/legc/statutes/human%20rights.pdf  The Nova Scotia Advisory Council on the Status of Women: https://women.gov.ns.ca//   -30- "

The province is taking steps to improve their job protection when they take leave from work to serve our country.   “We greatly value the sacrifice and bravery of our country’s reservists,” said Minister of Labour and Advanced Education Labi Kousoulis. “By updating our legislation, we will ensure their jobs are protected when they are called upon for training and deployment.” New legislation introduced today, Feb. 20, would see the Nova Scotia Labour Standards Code better align with recent federal government changes made to the reservist leave provisions under the Canada Labour Code. The proposed amendments include:  reducing the eligibility period required to have access to reservist leave from one year to three months     increasing the length of the leave from 18 months, within a three-year period, to 24 months within any 60-month period and allowing for a longer period of leave in a situation involving a national emergency  reducing the notice period to employers from 90 days to 30 days, or as much notice as reasonably possible when an employee receives less than four weeks notice of the requirement to participate as a reservist  There will also be housekeeping amendments to the pregnancy and parental leave provisions that fall under the code. This will bring them in line with changes that were previously passed.  If passed, the legislation would take effect in the spring.   Quotes: The reservists of Nova Scotia play an important role in the Canadian Armed Forces. These amendments will provide important support that is consistent with reservist leave provisions provided by the Government of Canada. This will help ensure all reservist in Canada are treated equally. John Young, chair, Canadian Forces Liaison Council (Nova Scotia)  As a reservist with 39 years of service in the Canadian Armed Forces I have benefited from civilian employers providing me time to complete training and operational deployment. I am encouraged to see these changes and believe that they will have a direct impact on Nova Scotian reservists who are serving our country. Col.

That is why the Department of Lands and Forestry is consulting on two key recommendations from the Lahey review of forest management practices. Today, Feb. 20, the department opened public consultations on draft criteria for high productions zones and is also moving ahead with the next phase of consultations on the draft forest management guide. “We are committed to fully implementing ecological forestry in Nova Scotia and each leg of the triad model is dependent on the other for success,” said Lands and Forestry Minister Iain Rankin. “This is a fundamental shift to how we manage our forests and it’s important we hear from Nova Scotians as we put in place the necessary programs and measures to move forward.”  The triad model, recommended by Professor Bill Lahey in his forestry review in 2018, includes conservation zones, high production zones and mixed use or matrix zones. These three categories work together to allow ecological and economic goals to coexist, leading to healthy forests and a sustainable forestry sector.  High productions zones are a key part of the triad model where trees are planted and harvested in rotation like crops. These zones will make up the smallest percentage of land in the triad. They help ensure enough wood is available for harvest for a sustainable forestry sector, while less cutting occurs to protect biodiversity in the mixed use areas and no commercial harvesting occurs in conservation areas.  A discussion paper has been posted at https://novascotia.ca/ecological-forestry/high-production-forestry/  and feedback can be sent to ecologicalforestry@novascotia.ca . The draft forest management guide was developed with input from stakeholders in 2019. Those groups will provide feedback on this revised draft guide before it moves to public consultations later this winter.  Operations in mixed use ecological zones, also called matrix zones, will be regulated by the forest management guide. The central focus of the new guide will place more emphasis on ecological values, including biodiversity, while still providing a certain amount of wood for harvest. Conservation zones will not have any commercial tree harvesting.   Quotes: The new forest management represents an historic paradigm shift for Nova Scotia’s natural forests. It moves away from excessive reliance on even-aged silvicultural approaches, where trees in a stand end up being the same age, to management practices that will result in forests being made up of trees with a variety of ages through the practice of irregular shelterwood silviculture. Robert Seymour, professor emeritus of silviculture, University of Maine School of Forest Resources    Quick Facts:  the criteria for high production forestry are expected to be finalized this spring with the process to identify the first zones to follow  work continues on the other recommendations from the forestry review and Prof. Lahey’s first evaluation on the department’s progress on implementing his recommendations, is expected this spring   a request for proposals was posted on Jan. 31 for prequalified bidders for the small-scale wood heat project. The deadline for proposals is March 5 with projects anticipated to be in operation by the 2020-21 heating season as part of the species at risk program renewal, the department, in collaboration with the recovery teams, are hosting recovery action forums in each region over the coming weeks the minister’s advisory committee had its first meeting earlier this week a new position to enhance external communications and engagement was created and filled in January a tender was posted in January to develop a guidelines to provide more clarity, transparency, and standardization to applications for long-term harvest plans Additional Resources: For an overview of ecological forestry, visit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB1j_0Dzno&feature=youtu.be   For more information on consultations, programs and initiatives related to ecological forestry, visit: https://novascotia.ca/ecological-forestry -30- "

That is why, on April 1, Nova Scotia’s minimum wage rate will increase by $1 an hour, to $12.55 per hour.  This increase represents the largest annual increase to Nova Scotia’s minimum wage since 2010.  “All Nova Scotians should benefit from our province’s economic growth and steadily improving business environment,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “We are committed to moving forward in a balanced way by making changes that benefit both workers and businesses.” Government is also eliminating the inexperienced minimum wage. Currently, employers can pay an inexperienced rate when an employee has less than three months’ experience in the kind of work they do and has worked for them for less than three months. The decision to remove the inexperienced minimum wage will bring Nova Scotia in line with all other provinces and territories across Canada.  Government will support businesses by eliminating the partial hour rule in Nova Scotia. Currently, the partial hour rule requires employers to round up time worked for minimum wage earners. This means if an employee works for 15 to 30 minutes, the employee must be paid for a half hour. If an employee works for 31 to 60 minutes, the employee must be paid for a full hour.   Businesses have been advocating to remove the partial hour rule, as it will help lessen the costs and the administrative burden associated with the provision and reduce the overall regulatory burden. “Our government is committed to building an economy that works for all of us,” said Minister of Labour and Advanced Education Labi Kousoulis. “These changes will help us to achieve that by fostering a stronger workforce and supporting businesses across the province.”   Quick Facts:  a $12.55 per hour minimum wage means Nova Scotia will have the second highest minimum wage in Atlantic Canada the increase brings Nova Scotia closer to the highest minimum wage in the country, which is $15 per hour Nova Scotia has the lowest business incorporation fee in the country and there is no fee to register in the first year of business in 2017, government committed to reducing regulatory burden to businesses by $25 million. The initiative was the first of its kind in Nova Scotia and was part of a broader strategy to build a strong foundation for economic growth in January 2019, government reported on more than 60 regulatory initiatives that were estimated to save businesses $34 million annually, exceeding its $25 million target. Significant efforts included the modernization of the Registry of Joint Stocks Companies, estimated to save businesses over $7 million dollars annually and the Business Navigator Service, estimated to have saved businesses approximately $3.4 million dollars since being launched in 2017  building on this momentum, government has set a new target of reducing undue burden to businesses by an additional $10 million annually by the end of 2020  government continues to make investments in programs and initiatives aimed at saving businesses money. In 2017, an increase to the small business tax threshold from $350,000 to $500,000 was announced, meaning more savings to invest in their businesses and people building a stronger workforce and retaining more young people is also a priority for government.

Changes to the Police Act Regulations, which come into effect Jan. 15, 2021, will extend the timeframe for someone to file a complaint regarding a municipal police service from six to 12 months. The changes also grant the police complaints commissioner the authority to extend the timeframe if there are good reasons for doing so and it is not contrary to the public interest. These changes align with legislation governing RCMP which allow 12 months for people to bring forth complaints.  “It is important people have improved access to justice, including the same amount of time to file a complaint about police conduct, regardless of the police force that serves their community,” said Mark Furey, Attorney General and Minister of Justice.  “This change directly responds to a need that was identified by the Office of the Police Complaints Commissioner, the Halifax Board of Police Commissioners and Prof. Scot Wortley in his 2019 Halifax Street Checks report. A recent sexual assault victim’s experience with the complaints process also highlighted the need for change. We know that sometimes people, and often victims, require more time to decide if they want to bring a concern forward. This timeframe offers people greater flexibility.”   Quotes: The Halifax Board of Police Commissioners is in full agreement with this decision. We asked the Justice minister to make this change so that our timelines for complaints would be consistent with the RCMP.  This change also responds to community concerns with the six-month timeline for filing a complaint as outlined in Prof. Wortley’s report. Carole McDougall, acting chair, Halifax Board of Police Commissioners  Increasing the time to file a complaint to one year is a positive change and one that I think will be welcomed by the public.  While most complaints come in soon after the interaction with the police, there are times when this is not possible.  Having more time to submit a complaint will help someone make the decision that is right for them.

That is why government is asking those involved in a well-established adult day program in the Annapolis Valley to create a model other rural communities can use to start their own programs to support older Nova Scotians.  Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC) is receiving $210,000 from the province to build on the success of the Adult Day Program that started at its Annapolis Valley Campus in Middleton 10 years ago. It is a caregiver respite care program offering recreation and social programming for seniors. NSCC students also help seniors with haircuts and styling, preparing meals and staying socially active. The investment will allow NSCC to work with its partners, including Nova Scotia Health Authority (NSHA), to develop best practices to help other communities interested in starting a Centre of Rural Aging and Health (CORAH) program. The goal is to make it easier for older Nova Scotians to access services and resources in their communities by offering them in one location. It will be expanded to three more communities across the province. “We want to leverage the great work happening at NSCC’s Annapolis Valley Campus and see how we can apply its knowledge to help other communities benefit from this innovative co-operative approach,” said Premier Stephen McNeil. “We hope more communities will look to start programs like this to support aging Nova Scotians in their communities.” The college will develop an evaluation framework to ensure subsequent programs meet the needs of seniors and the communities they serve. NSCC is also developing a Community Transportation Map of Nova Scotia to enable seniors to navigate their communities.  Quotes: Through programs and partnerships such as the Adult Day Program and now CORAH, we’re leveraging the immense strength of the college to inspire sustainable, vibrant, resilient communities. It’s my hope that NSCC’s culture of collaboration, which is so plainly infused into this project, will not only work to improve the health and well-being of our province’s seniors, it will serve as a demonstration of what’s possible when partners in industry, community and government come together. Don Bureaux, president, Nova Scotia Community College  With help from many people along the way, my husband Fred and I were able to access the many resources we needed during his journey with Parkinson’s.

A human skull found in Digby in September 2019 was one of 15 skulls from Canada that were reconstructed at the New York Academy of Arts Forensic Sculpture workshop last week.

Anyone who may have information about who this person is are asked to contact the Nova Scotia Medical Examiner Service, Digby RCMP or Crime Stoppers. Individuals may also wish to send an email to the National Centre for Missing Persons and Unidentified Remains. “We’re hoping that this reconstruction may help identify who this person was,” said Attorney General and Minister of Justice Mark Furey. “Seeing a face may prompt people to recall important information that could help identify this individual and solve their case.” The National Research Council made its way to Nova Scotia late last year to perform a 3D scan of the skull found in the province. The scan was then printed and later turned over to the RCMP’s National Centre for Missing Persons and Unidentified Remains, which is leading the co-ordination of the facial reconstruction initiative.
