Passing lane projects continue around the province this year, including Highways 7 and 39.  Pre-construction work is also underway on 24 to 26 new sets of passing lanes as part of the government’s stimulus package.  Passing lanes can reduce collisions by 25 per cent at 80 per cent less cost than that of twinning.

3,2020-08-13,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/august/13/wcu,Government Website,An Additional $1.5 Million For Pavement Paint On Provincial Highways This Year," Released on August 13, 2020  With the largest per capita highway system in the country, it takes plenty of paint to keep highways safe. “Good pavement marking is a cost-effective safety investment that reduces collisions and saves lives,” Highways and Infrastructure Minister Greg Ottrenbreit said.  “An additional $1.5 million will be invested this year to increase the ministry’s pavement marking program by 10 per cent.”  This year, five units will paint nearly 50,000 kilometres (km) of centre and shoulder lines as well as more than 34,000 pavement signs such as arrows and stop bars.  Pavement marking provides drivers with critical information, such as where their wheels should be in inclement weather and where they can safely pull over during an emergency.  They also alert drivers to passing opportunities and intersection locations.  The normal wear and tear from traffic, snowplow blades and the regular weather elements mean these important safety tools need to be repainted annually.  More than 1,000,000 litres of paint is applied to the roads in an average year.  Spherical glass beads are added to the paint to add reflection for nighttime driving and provide durability.  Pavement marking typically begins in late May or early June and continues into the early winter.  Drivers are required to slow to 60 km/hr when passing line painting trucks with lights flashing.  A weekly highway construction update is also published on www.saskatchewan.ca/residents/transportation/highway-construction-projects/weekly-highway-construction-update to provide the travelling public with the latest details on projects underway to help plan safe and efficient travel.  You can also report a highway work zone signing problem by calling 306-244-5535.

4,2020-08-13,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/august/13/agtech-investment,Government Website,Saskatchewan Invests $15 Million In Agtech," Released on August 13, 2020 The Government of Saskatchewan announced today it will provide $15 million to help develop new technologies in agriculture and position the province as a global leader in the agtech sector.  Through Innovation Saskatchewan, funds will be invested in a privately-managed fund targeted exclusively at agtech companies that require venture capital to develop past the startup phase and scale up their business operations and manufacturing.  “The proper support, combined with strong research in agricultural innovation and the success of agtech startups, can make Saskatchewan a global force in agtech,” Minister Responsible for Innovation Saskatchewan Tina Beaudry-Mellor said.  “This investment will bring jobs and new growth to our province and equip farmers and producers with game-changing technology.”    This investment will accelerate the province’s economic recovery from COVID-19 and build upon a record year for venture capital investment in Saskatchewan.  Deals worth $114 million were made in 2019, more than the previous five years combined, and most of those investments were made in Saskatchewan’s tech sector.  Once a partner is found, the $15 million investment is expected to leverage millions more from private investors, complementing Innovation Saskatchewan’s existing programs which support agtech startups but are not designed to scale companies to full business capacity.  Innovation Saskatchewan will issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) in the coming weeks to begin exploring fund options with the private sector.  “Saskatchewan is rising to the challenge of feeding a growing world population and innovation in agriculture technology plays an important role in meeting that growing demand,” Agriculture Minister David Marit said.  “This investment will ensure producers have made-in-Saskatchewan technology that supports their efforts to grow high-quality, sustainable food.”  With global demand for food anticipated to rise 70 per cent by 2050, Innovation Saskatchewan is helping farmers gain a competitive edge to meet the future by building upon a significant and historic economic driver.  The agency’s new investment, combined with its Saskatchewan Advantage Innovation Fund, Saskatchewan Technology Startup Incentive and the $1 million Agtech Growth Fund (https://innovationsask.ca/news/saskatchewan-launches-1-million-agtech-growth-fund) announced in July, will work with the rest of the province’s agricultural infrastructure to help stimulate the provincial economy, add value to Saskatchewan’s agricultural products, and grow the technology sector – all important objectives in Saskatchewan’s Growth Plan 2020-30.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Scott Brown Innovation Saskatchewan Phone: 306-787-0355 Email: scott.brown@gov.sk.ca "

Producers in the province have one per cent of the crop combined and two per cent swathed or ready to straight-cut.  The five-year average (2015-2019) for this time of year is two per cent combined and three per cent swathed or ready to straight-cut.  Fifty-two per cent of fall rye, 19 per cent of winter wheat, six per cent of field peas and three per cent of lentils are now in the bin.  Harvest is most advanced in the south and west-central regions, where two per cent of the crop in the southwest is combined and one per cent of the crop in the southeast and west-central is combined.  Producers in the central and northern regions have less than one per cent of the crop combined, but many expect to start in the coming weeks.  Much of the province received small amounts of rain this week, with parts of the northern, west-central and southeast regions receiving half an inch to an inch.  The Broadview area received the most rain this week with 39 mm.  The St. Walburg area has received the most rain in the province since April 1 with 433 mm.  More rain is needed to help crops during the seed-filling stage.  Moisture conditions were slightly reduced this past week.  Cropland topsoil moisture is rated as 51 per cent adequate, 37 per cent short and 12 per cent very short.  Hay and pasture land topsoil moisture is rated as 38 per cent adequate, 41 per cent short and 21 per cent very short.  Many producers reported that hay yields are below average this year.  Estimated average dryland hay yields for the province are 1.2 tons per acre for alfalfa, 1.1 tons per acre for alfalfa/bromegrass, 1.0 tons per acre for other tame hay, 1.0 tons per acre for wild hay and 1.8 tons per acre for greenfeed.  Estimated average irrigated hay yields are 3.0 tons per acre for alfalfa, 2.7 tons per acre for alfalfa/bromegrass and 2.8 tons per acre for greenfeed.  The majority of crop damage this week was due to wind, dry conditions, heat, wildlife and grasshoppers.  There were also isolated reports of hail.  Farmers are busy wrapping up haying and baling, getting ready for harvest, desiccating and swathing crops and starting to combine in some areas.

Battlefords MLA Herb Cox on behalf of Social Services Minister and Minister Responsible for Saskatchewan Housing Corporation (SHC) Paul Merriman, City of North Battleford Mayor Ryan Bater and Canadian Mental Health Association North Battleford Executive Director Jane Zielke de Montbrun, made the announcement today.  “Our government’s investment in North Battleford will improve the quality of life for individuals with complex needs while contributing to the social well-being of the entire community,” said Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister Responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC).  “Developments like these will help reach our goal of ensuring every Canadian has a home that meets their needs and they can afford.”  “This project will provide much needed affordable housing in North Battleford to support individuals with mental health challenges and complex needs to live independently in our community,” Cox said.  “These homes will provide a safe and stable living environment, along with the supports the residents require to participate more fully in life and build a better future.  We are pleased to work with our partners to continue to better serve and develop new housing opportunities for Saskatchewan people.”  “The City of North Battleford contributed the land because we were encouraged by the quick action by the Governments of Canada and Saskatchewan to support this important project,” Bater said.  “These homes will have a positive effect on the health of our community by providing an affordable, safe, and healthy living environment for the residents.  We are grateful for the contributions of all partners who have come together to make this project a reality.”  “Our project begins to close a transitional housing continuum gap in our community,” Zielke de Montbrun said.  “Its design will create a sense of community and belonging among tenants and provide space for social/recreational activities and group learning opportunities.  This project will empower those living with mental illness to live successfully in our community while supporting their unique journey of recovery.  We are grateful for the support of the Government of Canada, through CMHC, the Government of Saskatchewan, through SHC, the City of North Battleford and Saskatchewan Health Authority.  Together, we are making a difference in the lives of persons living with mental illness and complex needs in the Battlefords.”  Quick Facts:  The Government of Canada, through CMHC, and the Government of Saskatchewan, through SHC, contributed $830,000 to the project from the federal/provincial National Housing Strategy.  The City of North Battleford contributed the land for the project. Tenants will be individuals living with complex needs and mental health challenges, and will be provided support services to ensure they remain securely housed and live independently. The project is the new construction of two single level fourplexes in North Battleford located at 1942 Kramer Place.  The fourplexes face each other with a middle green space.  A support service and transitional shelter area equipped with a small kitchenette and washroom will be located at the end of the property to form a u-shaped building complex. The Government of Canada is currently rolling out its National Housing Strategy (NHS), an ambitious 10-year, $55 billion plan that will create 125,000 new housing units and lift 530,000 families out of housing need, as well as repair and renew more than 300,000 housing units and reduce chronic homelessness by 50 per cent. The NHS is built on strong partnerships between federal, provincial and territorial governments, and on continuous engagement with others, including municipalities, Indigenous governments and organizations, and the social and private sectors to make a meaningful difference in the lives of Canadians. This investment supports the Province’s Housing Strategy, Poverty Reduction Strategy and Mental Health and Addictions Action Plan to increase community capacity to ensure Saskatchewan people in greatest need, including people living with persistent and complex mental health and addictions issues, have access to affordable, safe, secure and stable housing and team-based supports they may require.

Wildlife is a core characteristic within this urban oasis and helps create a shared ecological and recreational space for all.”  Visitors can best spot the impressive songbird throughout the Wascana Marsh, which runs from Broad Street to Fleet Street, an area which contains both grassland and wetland areas.    Bobolinks have been nesting successfully in Wascana for many years.  As a threatened species, these birds have adapted their nesting habits from native prairie grasslands to taller grassland areas.  The male bobolink is very impressive with black and white stripes on its back which looks like a reverse tuxedo.  Keep a watchful eye for the striking yellow patch on its head or neck.  The untouched natural areas within Wascana Centre have become a safe and undisturbed sanctuary for a variety of birds, including the tundra swan, avocets, willets and the yellow warbler.  The ongoing conservation and ecological efforts by the team at the Provincial Capital Commission has created opportunities for research, outreach and education.  The thriving bobolink population is a celebration of Wascana Centre’s commitment to the protection and conservation of birds and wildlife.  About Wascana Centre  Wascana Centre is internationally known as a beautifully landscaped park surrounding a 120-hectare lake located in the heart of Regina.  It was established in 1962 to be a place for recreation and beauty.  Wascana Centre includes 2,300 acres of urban land that provides countless functions and services to the community resulting in an area of immeasurable value as a place of work, education, recreation and natural preservation.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Kerri Ward-Davis Provincial Capital Commission Regina Phone: 306-787-8544 Email: kerri.warddavis@gov.sk.ca "

The province and Saskatchewan’s Chief Medical Health Officer, Dr. Saqib Shahab have provided additional guidance for divisions wishing to move to Level 2.  This guidance is being made to provide consistent direction to school divisions which will implement specific plans and measures best suited to their location and facilities.  For those divisions exploring measures in Levels 2, the following guidance has been provided by Saskatchewan’s Chief Medical Health Officer:  Students in Grades 4 through 12 wear a mask in high traffic areas, such as in hallways and on buses. For those students in Grades 9 through 12, masks may be required in classrooms where it is not possible to maintain physical distancing or where students are outside of the cohort within their classroom, as well as all teachers and staff.  For those high schools that have a high density population, further discussions with Saskatchewan’s 27 school divisions have resulted in factors being developed for those considering Level 3.  Factors that would be considered include the location, structure and population density of the school.  School divisions may consider additional options, including alternating days for high school students.  Saskatchewan’s Chief Medical Health Officer has also directed the following additional measures to be included in all division plans:  teacher and class cohorting, with a focus on cohorting teachers to a limited number of students and keeping students in one cohort as much as possible; in elementary school settings, students’ cohorts will be the classroom; in high school settings where cohorting is more complex, school divisions will be encouraged to find creative solutions to move students in cohorts where possible; front-facing instruction for students, any exceptions will be identified for approval by public health; and staggered start times, breaks and end times, where possible.  Students are encouraged to bring their own non-medical cloth masks.  Mask guidelines can be found in the Re-Open Saskatchewan plan here at www.saskatchewan.ca/re-open.   The Government of Saskatchewan has procured six million disposable masks for schools in Saskatchewan with an investment of $2.3 million.  These masks will be made available to students, teachers and staff at the beginning of the school year and on a daily basis.  The Government of Saskatchewan continues to monitor the transmission of COVID-19 in the province and updates will be made to the Safe Schools Plan as necessary based on the advice of the Chief Medical Health Officer.  The RPT will continue to work with the education sector to develop and implement guidelines as the pandemic situation evolves.  Everyone should continue to practice preventative measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including washing hands frequently and staying home if you are sick.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Chris Hodges Education Regina Phone: 306-787-1069 Email: chris.hodges@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-533-7506 "

All schools must identify a designated isolation area for any student or staff presenting COVID-19 symptoms who are not able to immediately leave their school facility.  If a student is exhibiting symptoms consistent with COVID-19 at school, the students’ teacher must notify the designated school official to accompany the student from the classroom to the school’s pre-identified isolation space.  Physical distancing between the student who is exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 and the staff member should be maintained as much as feasible at all times.  Staff must wear a medical mask and face shield during all interactions with the student to avoid contact.  The student will also be provided with a medical mask, and requested to wear it if safe to do so. The student will be supervised at all times.  The designated school official will call parents or caregivers immediately to pick up and remove their child from the school.  They will then call their local Public Health contact to provide notification of the student being removed from the school.  Public Health will then conduct an initial assessment and provide direction to the school.  Arrangements will be made for the student to be transported appropriately from school by the student’s parent(s) or emergency contact.  School staff will not transport the student home.  Once the student has exited the school facility, staff must wash their hands adequately with soap and water and ensure high touch areas are cleaned and disinfected.  The school’s isolation area must be cleaned and disinfected by non-teaching staff.  The designated school official will arrange for the timely cleaning and disinfection of the student’s classroom and, in particular, the student’s desk and surroundings desks as well as any other common touch items in the classroom and/or other school facilities to which the student would have had access that school day, such as washrooms.  If a teacher develops symptoms consistent with COVID-19, they must inform their designated school official to provide alternative arrangements for in-class instruction, as well as to notify their local Public Health contact to conduct an initial assessment and provide direction to the school.  Once the teacher has notified their designated school official, they should immediately leave the school facility, and the school cleaning and disinfection procedures will take place.  If a case of COVID-19 is confirmed by the Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA), the school will be notified by SHA Public Health on the next steps that would be required.  These may include self-isolation or self-monitoring, contact tracing, testing and appropriate communication.  The school shall have record keeping of attendance and seating arrangements to support public health investigation and contact tracing.  School divisions will have alternative learning opportunities in place for students who are unable to attend school for medical reasons.  This will ensure students have continued delivery of education.  Self-monitoring practices are also being encouraged in schools as a preventative measure.  Parents and caregivers are asked to monitor their children for any signs or symptoms of illness.  If a student or staff member exhibit any symptoms, they are to remain home and self-isolate.  For those who are unsure if they present symptoms or may need to be tested for COVID-19, they should refer to the Saskatchewan COVID-19 Self-Assessment Tool at https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/health-care-administration-and-provider-resources/treatment-procedures-and-guidelines/emerging-public-health-issues/2019-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-self-assessment.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Chris Hodges Education Regina Phone: 306-787-1069 Email: chris.hodges@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-533-7506              "

20,2020-08-10,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/august/10/supports-for-tourism-sector,Government Website,Saskatchewan Announces $35 Million In Supports For Tourism Sector," Released on August 10, 2020 Program Invests In Saskatchewan Tourism Industry, Hard Hit By COVID-19  Today, the Government of Saskatchewan announced $35 million in support for Saskatchewan’s hard-hit tourism sector.  Under the Saskatchewan Tourism Sector Support Program, eligible hospitality and event/attraction operators will be able to apply for a one-time, non-repayable emergency payment.  For the accommodation sector and large event facilities, payments will range from $10,000 to $50,000, depending on sales revenue.  For attraction, tour or event operators with ongoing fixed costs, payments will range from $7,500 to $15,000.  Of the $35 million, $5 million will be used to support marketing and increasing the demand for Saskatchewan tourism experiences.    “Saskatchewan’s tourism industry is critically important to our quality of life and attractiveness as a destination for investment,” Trade and Export Development Minister Jeremy Harrison said.  “The Government of Saskatchewan recognizes that the sector’s recovery will take time.  This support will provide some immediate relief for accommodation properties, major event facilities and attractions, and will also focus on increasing demand, which will be essential to long-term recovery.”  Tourism in Saskatchewan, Canada and around the world has been brought to a standstill because of unprecedented measures taken to contain the virus.  There were nearly 12 million visits to and within Saskatchewan in 2019, with visitor expenditures totalling $2.2 billion.  Estimates indicate Saskatchewan’s tourism industry could see a decline of at least $730 million in visitor spending in 2020-21.  It may take two or more years for the industry to recover.  “The COVID-19 pandemic delivered a devastating blow to our province’s tourism sector,” Minister Responsible for Tourism Saskatchewan Gene Makowsky said.  “The new Saskatchewan Tourism Sector Support Program will provide critically needed support to accommodations, venues, attractions and tourism businesses.  The $35 million investment will stimulate the sector’s recovery, build resiliency and help tourism operators continue to deliver remarkable Saskatchewan experiences.”  “We are all painfully aware of the devastating effects of COVID-19 on the tourism and hospitality sector,” Saskatchewan Hotel and Hospitality Association President and CEO Jim Bence said.  “With severe reductions in revenues, organizations will be under extreme pressure to find ways to manage their fixed costs and expenses in 2020.  We are very pleased with this significant investment in our industry by the government and we much appreciate their continued support and willingness to collaborate with us during this crisis.”  Applications will be accepted starting 2 p.m. on August 24, 2020.  Applications will be accepted until October 1, 2020.     For more information, please visit www.saskatchewan.ca/tourism-sector-support.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Robin Speer Trade and Export Development Regina Phone: 306-519-5006 Email: robin.speer@gov.sk.ca "

The Government of Saskatchewan provided the Saskatchewan Youth in Care and Custody Network with annualized funding of $182,952 for 2020-21.  “Seven years ago youth members of the Saskatchewan Youth in Care and Custody Network asked the Minister of Social Services to proclaim one week a year as Child and Youth in Care Week,” Saskatchewan Youth in Care and Custody Network Provincial Outreach Coordinator Richard Rothenburger said.  “We acknowledge and appreciate the commitment of the Ministry of Social Services for continuing to proclaim Child and Youth in Care Week to highlight the unique experiences, and accomplishments youth in and from care encounter during and after care.”  The Saskatchewan Youth in Care and Custody Network is a non-profit community-based organization that supports and improves the lives of young people between the ages of 14 and 24 who are currently, or have previously been, in government care (foster care or custody).

Under current guidance in Level 1 of Saskatchewan’s Safe Schools Plan, mask and PPE usage recommendations are in place in many Saskatchewan school division plans.  The Government of Saskatchewan has been carefully monitoring the release of federal guidelines by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and feedback from provincial stakeholders including the Saskatchewan Medical Association (SMA) in regards to a safe return to schools.  In consideration of these guidelines and feedback, Saskatchewan’s Chief Medical Health Officer and the Ministries of Education and Health are actively considering a mandatory masking policy under Level 2 of Saskatchewan’s Safe Schools Plan.  As the situation with COVID-19 in Saskatchewan is fluid, the Safe Schools Plan provides consideration to changes and updates as needed, as accounted for within the four levels.  Under Level 2 of the plan, mask usage can be implemented under the direction of the Chief Medical Health Officer in consultation with Public Health either regionally or provincially, based on the most up-to-date situation and scientific information available.  The initial order of 6 million masks will be delivered and distributed to school divisions before the start of school year, which is set to start as early as September 1, depending on local school calendars.  These masks will be made available to students, teachers and staff at the beginning of the school year and on a daily basis.  In addition to face masks, the province has supported school divisions in obtaining access to free face shields for staff through a Canadian company based in Ontario.  The full-face shields will be another option available to staff.  The 27 provincial school divisions had a saving of approximately $40 million for last school year, which the province has encouraged be used towards costs associated with additional procurement as school divisions feel necessary.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Stephanie Ali Education Regina Phone: 306-787-6304 Email: stephanie.ali@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-533-6391              "

The province’s 27 school divisions have plans in place to ensure schools are properly sanitized and have hand washing protocols and routines in place to ensure students and staff are safe.  Following recent approval of these plans, specifics for individual schools are being coordinated with local medical health officers.  Common changes students and staff will see in schools include:  objects removed that cannot be effectively cleaned or disinfected, such as story time rugs; hand sanitizer at accessible entry points, like the main entrance to the school and classrooms; mobile sink stations in common areas along with signage and instructions; scheduled hand washing times and protocols incorporated into structured learning for younger students; and special consideration for cleaning products that are safe for food surfaces, including water fountains.  The province and school divisions have ensured that all students and staff will have regular access to hand sanitizer.  Together with the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education is working to supply schools with gel hand sanitizer in the 500 ml and 50 ml bottles.  This supply of hand sanitizer is in addition to the sanitizer, cleaning supplies and Personal Protective Equipment that schools have already procured either through government contracts or on their own.  The 27 provincial school divisions had a saving of approximately $40 million for last school year, which is being used for costs associated with a safe return to school, this may include increased custodial staff.  Teachers and staff are not expected to purchase their own products as school divisions and the province will provide these and additional supplies as needed.  As well, all requirements associated with the increased sanitization and disinfection of facilities including common areas will be completed by custodial staff throughout the day, and teachers are not expected to conduct this work.  All disinfectants and sanitizers used must be approved by Health Canada (DIN) and all label requirements, including contact time, should be followed.  This may mean additional training for custodial staff to ensure proper application.  Each school divisions’ plan, available for families to review online, outlines the additional measures that will be regularly completed during the school day to clean high-touch areas.

Crushing is also underway for future upgrades on Highway 4 from the U.S. Border to Grasslands National Park and Highway 36, north of Coronach to the U.S. Border.  In addition, work has begun on design and crushing for an additional 325 km of TMS through stimulus funding.  The ministry is also formulating partnerships with RMs to improve infrastructure such as the RM of Frenchman Butte, where work is underway on a $5.2 million improvement project.  The subgrade and surfacing of the access, from the junction of Highway 3, is scheduled to be completed this fall.  The Government of Saskatchewan operates and maintains approximately 26,000 km of provincial highway of which 4,650 km are TMS roads.  TMS highways were created in the 1950s to provide residents with a dust-free, mud-free driving surface.  The light traffic on this system at that time made these relatively inexpensive roads very functional with regular annual maintenance.  A weekly highway construction update is also published on www.saskatchewan.ca/residents/transportation/highway-construction-projects/weekly-highway-construction-update to provide the travelling public with the latest details on projects underway to help plan safe and efficient travel.  You can also report a highway work zone signing problem by calling 306-244-5535.  The Government of Saskatchewan has invested more than $9.8 billion in highways infrastructure since 2008, improving more than 15,800 km of Saskatchewan highways.  Another $300 million in highways stimulus funds will be invested over the next two years to stimulate Saskatchewan’s economic recovery.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Steve Shaheen Highways and Infrastructure Regina Phone: 306-933-5641 Email: steve.shaheen@gov.sk.ca "
33,2020-08-06,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/august/06/moose-jaw-airport,Government Website,Canada And Saskatchewan Invest In Improvements At Moose Jaw Municipal Airport," Released on August 6, 2020 The Government of Canada and the Government of Saskatchewan recognize the different ways that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected communities across the province.  Both governments are making strategic investments in infrastructure to meet the specific needs of Saskatchewan communities to help strengthen local economies.  Today, Maryam Monsef, Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Rural Economic Development, Saskatchewan Government Relations Minister Lori Carr and City of Moose Jaw Mayor Fraser Tolmie announced funding for important improvements to the Moose Jaw Municipal Airport which will benefit the local economy and increase safety.  The rehabilitation and expansion of the existing runway and taxiway will help accommodate larger planes, including business class, turbo props and light jets.  The construction of a new apron space will increase the parking area and allow for heavier aircrafts to be parked.  A new hangar access road will reduce the use of taxiways by vehicle traffic.  Improvements also include the installation of additional runway, taxiway and approach lights.  The Government of Canada is investing $1.2 million in this project through the Rural and Northern Communities Infrastructure Stream of the Investing in Canada plan while the Government of Saskatchewan is contributing $999,900.  The City of Moose Jaw is contributing $500,100 and is responsible for any additional costs.  “Canada’s experience under COVID-19 has demonstrated how interdependent Canadians are, as well as our need to stay connected,” said Monsef.  “Connecting Canadians through regional transportation hubs, like the Moose Jaw Airport, brings jobs to rural communities in the region, and will support Canada’s economic recovery.  Since 2015, the Government of Canada has supported five major broadband projects in Saskatchewan, impacting more than 56,000 households and 54 institutions, including schools, libraries, municipal offices and health centres.  More than 1,000 km of fibre has been deployed across the province to help connect homes and businesses.  This is in addition to 230 projects across the province to improve roads, bridges, drinking water, waste water, and build community recreation projects.  By investing in projects such as this, we are helping communities across Saskatchewan strengthen their economies and build more resilient infrastructure.”  “The Government of Saskatchewan’s investment of more than $900,000 toward this Moose Jaw area infrastructure project will ensure it becomes a reality,” Carr said.  “Work from this local initiative, along with job creation from other projects under our government’s $7.5 billion, two-year provincial capital plan will also kick-start economic recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic – investments that will strengthen local infrastructure and build a stronger Saskatchewan.”  “Today’s announcement demonstrates our continued commitment to growing our city and reinforces our confidence that Moose Jaw is moving forward,” Tolmie said.  “We thank the Government of Canada and the Government of Saskatchewan for recognizing the value of this project and making significant investments.  These improvements to the Moose Jaw Municipal Airport will benefit our local economy, and we thank the Moose Jaw Municipal Airport Authority and local business community for their hard work, support and commitment to the municipal airport.”  “The Moose Jaw Municipal Airport Authority team is very excited to see this runway expansion and rehabilitation of the airside facilities project begin to come to fruition,” Moose Jaw Municipal Airport Authority Chair Greg Simpson said.  “When construction is finished, these upgrades will improve safety and benefit current airport users in the health and agricultural sectors, along with potential new business that rely on general aviation.  This will improve access to critical health care services and help support economic development in our community, thanks to improved transportation infrastructure.  We are grateful for both the confidence demonstrated and the financial support provided.”  Quick facts:  Through the Investing in Canada plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities. $2 billion of this funding is supporting infrastructure projects that meet the unique needs of rural and northern communities like facilities to support food security, local access roads and enhanced broadband connectivity. Across Saskatchewan, the Government of Canada has invested more than $715 million under the Investing in Canada plan toward 368 infrastructure projects. The Rural Economic Development Strategy leverages ongoing federal investments and provides a vision for the future, identifying practical steps to take in the short-term, and serving as a foundation to guide further work.

Warm weather this week has continued to help crops progress throughout the province, with most farmers estimating their crops are at their normal development stage.  There was minimal rainfall throughout the province this past week, with no rain in many areas.  The Yorkton area received the most rainfall this week with 26 mm.  The St. Walburg area has received the most rain in the province since April 1 with 418 mm.  With much of the cereals and pulses in the seed filling stages, rain would be welcome in many areas.    Minimal rain and warm temperatures this past week have resulted in a reduction in provincial topsoil moisture.  Cropland topsoil moisture is rated as 57 per cent adequate, 33 per cent short and 10 per cent very short.  Hay and pasture land topsoil moisture is rated as one per cent surplus, 44 per cent adequate, 36 per cent short and 19 per cent very short.  Warm, dry conditions have resulted in reduced pasture growth in many areas.  Provincially, pasture conditions are rated as three per cent excellent, 34 per cent good, 39 per cent fair, 17 per cent poor and seven per cent very poor.  The majority of pastures in the west-central and northern regions are rated as fair-to-good condition.  The majority of crop damage this week was due to heat, dry conditions and wind.  Many parts of the province had high day and nighttime temperatures and farmers have reported heat blasting in canola and rapid progression through flowering and ripening stages.  There was also damage reported by insects such as grasshoppers, bertha armyworms, aphids and diamondback moths, as well as diseases.  Farmers are busy haying, hauling grain and getting ready for harvest.  A complete, printable version of the Crop Report is available online at https://www.saskatchewan.ca/crop-report.

Generalized information may vary in application due to the differences in specific schools and school divisions.

37,2020-08-05,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/august/05/emergency-flood-damage-reduction-program,Government Website,Water Security Agency To Increase Funding For Emergency Flood Damage Reduction Program," Released on August 5, 2020 The Water Security Agency (WSA) will be expanding the Emergency Flood Damage Reduction Program (EFDRP) by $2 million this year to help Saskatchewan communities and residents respond to the challenge of widespread flooding.  The EFDRP was established in 2011 to provide financial, technical and engineering assistance to help individuals, communities and rural municipalities prevent or reduce flood damage to property.  The 2020-21 EFDRP budget will be increased from $500,000 to $2.5 million and the $100,000 funding cap per applicant has been removed for this year.  The entire Northern Saskatchewan region remains at potential risk due to ongoing precipitation and high water levels.  While some Northern communities have recently passed peak levels, the La Ronge and Air Ronge area to the Manitoba border remain particularly vulnerable for the coming weeks.    “We are facing an unprecedented year with many areas of Northern Saskatchewan facing a record rainfall since April 1,” Minister Responsible for WSA Greg Ottenbreit said.  “It is clear we have to both expand the financial capacity of the program this year to provide immediate assistance, and for the long-term we also need to better understand certain watersheds where limited information is available.”  A very large area of the province encompassing the Churchill River Basin, including the Beaver River Watershed, and parts of the Saskatchewan River Basin have received excessive precipitation this spring and summer, resulting in high water levels and flooding in some locations.  To gain a better understanding of the effect of elevated water levels in these areas, where there is limited historical data and few hydrometric stations, WSA will also use EFDRP funds to undertake a study and analysis of the situation when this year’s flooding event is over.  The purpose of this analysis will be to both (i) analyze the impacts of this year’s flooding events and (ii) explore potential flood mitigation options for the future.  EFDRP expenditures do reap long-term preventative financial benefits.  WSA has reviewed the program and determined each dollar invested in flood prevention saves a future $20-$30 in property damage.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Patrick Boyle Water Security Agency Moose Jaw Phone: 306-631-6997 Email: Patrick.Boyle@wsask.ca "

The funding will support a mentorship program called Founders Table which brings together female tech entrepreneurs to gain new knowledge, business skills and industry connections.  Innovation Saskatchewan partnered with Women Entrepreneurs of Saskatchewan and Economic Development Regina in 2019 to launch the initiative.  “Founders Table addresses the historic gap in the number of female tech entrepreneurs in our province by providing support, mentorship and networking opportunities,” Minister Responsible for Innovation Saskatchewan Tina Beaudry-Mellor said.  “Feedback provided by participants of this program is pivotal in both supporting our women entrepreneurs and advancing Saskatchewan as a tech sector hub in North America.”    While Saskatchewan is home to more than 34,000 women entrepreneurs, national statistics indicate only six per cent of Canada’s tech companies are founded by women.  A 2018 study found women in the tech sector face discrimination, organizational bias and educational barriers.  Founders Table provides in-depth learning sessions presented by entrepreneurial leaders in Saskatchewan’s tech community on topics including creating and pitching your product, connecting with customers and building company culture.  Women involved in the 2019-20 program report positive developments in both their leadership and business growth, including better-focused products, stronger marketing and a surge in hiring additional employees.  “The current pandemic serves as a catalyst to pivot one’s business,” Women Entrepreneurs of Saskatchewan Chief Executive Officer Prabha Mitchell said.  “Founder’s Table provides the opportunity and platform for women entrepreneurs to adopt and adapt technology for business growth and scale.”  Applicants are being considered in August; 10 to 15 successful candidates will begin meeting in September.  Founders Table members can come from anywhere in Saskatchewan but must have less than five years in business and gross revenues under $250,000.

Generalized information may vary in application due to the differences in specific schools and school divisions.

42,2020-08-04,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/august/04/safe-school-plan,Government Website,Safe Schools Plan Released," Released on August 4, 2020 Saskatchewan’s 27 school divisions have plans in place for the safe return of students and staff to the classroom in September.  “Our guiding principle continues to be ensuring schools are a safe place for students and staff,” Deputy Premier and Education Minister Gordon Wyant said.  “These plans and eight areas of focus will allow school communities to have the guidance and appropriate time to implement the required safety measures.”  Saskatchewan school divisions had their draft plans reviewed by Saskatchewan Education’s Response Planning Team (RPT), in order to ensure that they adhere to the Primary and Secondary Institution Guidelines, developed by the RPT in consultation with Saskatchewan’s Chief Medical Health Officer.  All school division plans have incorporated eight safe components that include:  1. Safe Attendance  To allow for all members of our school communities to attend classes safely, self-screening measures will be implemented, including:  Parents and caregivers being asked to monitor their children for any signs or symptoms of illness.  If any symptoms are present, the student is to remain home. For those who are unsure if they or a student present symptoms or may need to be tested for COVID-19, should refer to the Saskatchewan COVID-19 Self-Assessment Tool. Dedicated quarantine area in every school where individuals exhibiting symptoms will properly isolate from the rest of the school until a parent or caregiver can safely pick them up.  2. Safe Transportation  The ministry has also developed the following transportation protocols to ensure students are coming to and from school safely, these include:  Assigned seating for students and a record of this seating plan on school buses. Students who live in the same household will be seated together. Where possible, the ministry is encouraging parents to transport their own children to and from school. Cleaning and sanitation of buses or other vehicles used to transport students is required between each run.  3. Safe Access  Students will be able to safely access and move throughout school facilities through the implementation of:  Dedicated entrance and exit doors. Staggered recess, lunch, and other class transition times to allow for additional space. Controlled flow of students and staff in common school areas, incorporating the use of directional signage and floor markings.  4. Safe Facilities  Increased sanitation measures in school facilities and the promotion of proper hygiene practices will be implemented.  This includes: • Increased availability of hand sanitizer wherever possible. • Custodial staff will provide consistent sanitation of school facilities. • Maintain hygiene of all frequently-touched surfaces and objects such as toys and classroom equipment.  5. Safe Classrooms  Measures are to be implemented to reduce risk of transmission in the classroom, including:  Wherever possible, limiting physical contact such as hugs and handholding, as well as encouraging the use of alternative greetings such as “air high fives”. Utilizing outdoor spaces for learning when possible. Clear protocols for bringing supplementary school materials such as backpacks and school supplies in and out of schools. Classroom configuration to minimize contact.  6. Safe Supports  Considerations have been taken to safely support the learning needs of all students.  Local health officials will be providing support to divisions for the implementation of these measures, including:  Personal interactions with intensive needs/immune-compromised students’ conditions will be in place to allow for the provision of supports within a safe and secure environment, which may include in-school setting or other appropriate spaces for the delivery of education. Medically fragile students will have supports in place to address their educational needs. School divisions will work with their local medical health officer to address the unique needs of immunocompromised students, to prepare for the ongoing safety of students and staff in proactive and responsive measures, and will have alternative learning opportunities in place for students who are unable to attend school for medical reasons. School divisions will communicate regarding these supports directly with their local school communities. The Ministry of Education will continue to support mental wellness through initiatives such as our work with Kids Help Phone to promote professional counselling services, which are available 24 hours a day. To facilitate constant communication between school divisions and local health officers as we move through the school year, weekly briefs will occur between the education sector and health officials to bolster monitoring and access to local context and needs.  7. Safe Activities  To ensure adequate safety measures are taken, schools will adapt group activities to reduce physical contact, including:  Established protocols for the reduced use of shared materials and classroom supplies. Identifying alternatives to in-person assemblies, such as virtual assemblies. Participation in extra-curricular activities will be dependent on the most current guidelines as provided by Saskatchewan’s Chief Medical Health Officer. Extra-curricular activities such as indoor sports are allowed as announced in the second part of Phase 4 of Re-Open Saskatchewan Plan.  8. Safe Alternatives  To ensure preparedness, there are four scenarios that may be activated regionally or provincially based on the advice of our Chief Medical Health Officer, they include:  Level 1: Return to school, as close to normal as possible, with additional health measures and precautions.  This is the scenario we are planning for come September 1. Level 2: Mask usage as determined by the Chief Medical Health Officer.  These masks are being purchased centrally by the ministry of education and distributed to school divisions. Level 3: In the event it becomes necessary, school capacity will be reduced.  This may include establishing cohorts and hybrid learning models as considerations. Level 4: Implementing learning continuity plans, which means transitioning to mandatory remote learning.  Divisions are asked to share their plan with the families, teachers and school staff they support.  As the situation with COVID-19 in Saskatchewan is fluid, plans may be updated and adjusted as needed.  The school year is set to start as early as September 1, based on local school division calendars.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Stephanie Ali Education Regina Phone: 306-787-6304 Email: stephanie.ali@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-533-6391 "

There may still be times when you are required to slow down when workers are not present in the work zone.  A sharp pavement drop-off or loose stones during a seal coat are examples of hazards that warrant a slower posted speed.  Report a highway work zone signing problem by calling 306-244-5535.  A weekly highway construction update is also published on www.saskatchewan.ca/residents/transportation/highway-construction-projects/weekly-highway-construction-update to provide the travelling public with the latest details on projects underway to help plan safe and efficient travel.  You can also report a highway work zone signing problem by calling 306-244-5535.

Livestock producers now have 26 per cent of the hay crop cut and 49 per cent baled or put into silage.  Hay quality is currently rated as seven per cent excellent, 68 per cent good, 20 per cent fair and five per cent poor.  Many farmers have indicated that hay yields are below normal this year, particularly in areas that received less rainfall in early summer.  Rainfall this past week varied throughout the province, with many areas not receiving any rain and areas around Indian Head and Neilburg receiving up to 50 mm.  The St. Walburg area has received the most rain since April 1 with 416 mm.    With the lack of rainfall in many areas and warm temperatures this past week, moisture conditions have reduced slightly in the province.  Cropland topsoil moisture is rated as two per cent surplus, 71 per cent adequate, 22 per cent short and five per cent very short.  Hay and pasture land topsoil moisture is rated as one per cent surplus, 63 per cent adequate, 25 per cent short and 11 per cent very short.  Crop development progressed rapidly this past week due to warm weather.  Winter cereals are starting to ripen and earlier seeded crops have started to mature.  Some farmers have indicated that harvesting of those crops will begin in the coming weeks.  While the majority of crops overall are in fair-to-good condition, most of the spring cereals, canola, field peas and soybeans are in fair-to-excellent condition.  Crop damage this past week was due to strong winds, lack of moisture, localized flooding, hail and wildlife.  There have also been reports of diseases such as root rots, ascochyta, sclerotinia, fusarium head blight and other foliar diseases and insects such as grasshoppers.  Farmers are busy haying, scouting for pests and getting equipment and bins ready for harvest.

Through a re-assessment of eligibility, the program has been further expanded to include all workers, regardless of income level, at integrated healthcare facilities which provide both short-term and long-term health care. A new application form is currently being developed for this expansion, and will be available in the coming days. Applications will be accepted until September 1, 2020.  “Our government wants to ensure that through this program we are helping workers who are caring for some of our most vulnerable,” Finance Minister Donna Harpauer said.  “Often family members help support their loved ones in long-term care in these facilities, but visitation restrictions due to public health orders have made that more difficult, putting more pressure on the workers in these integrated healthcare facilities.”  Previously, workers at integrated facilities were eligible if they had a gross salary from all sources of less than $2,500 per month and earned less than $24.00 per hour.  That income threshold has been lifted, as it was when the program was modified in June for workers at licensed personal care homes and special care homes.  For each eligible worker, the temporary wage supplement is $400 for each four-week period, up to 16 weeks, for the period from March 15, 2020 to July 4, 2020.  The wage supplement will be provided to full-time, part-time and casual workers, and includes anyone employed by an eligible facility, but does not include third-party contract service providers working at those facilities.  In addition to integrated healthcare facilities, eligible facilities include:  Personal care homes licensed pursuant to The Personal Care Home Act Special care homes designated pursuant to The Provincial Health Authority Act Approved private service homes defined in The Residential Services Act Licensed or unlicensed family child care homes as defined in The Child Care Act Unlicensed private assisted living facilities, where residents are provided with direct assistance or supervision of daily living activities Community-based group homes Licensed childcare facilities Emergency shelters Transition shelters - short stay/emergency, transition housing  Integrated healthcare facilities; and Home care workers providing care to seniors in their own homes.

Whatever your long weekend plans, remember that public health orders remain in place to prevent transmission of COVID-19.  Continue to practice preventative measures:  Wash your hands frequently. Practice physical distancing of two metres. Wear a mask in settings where physical distancing cannot be maintained. Limit contacts outside your home to your extended household group. Stay home if you are sick.  There may be social or peer pressure to attend events that you feel pose an unacceptable amount of risk to you and your family.  Decisions not to attend are your own, and are not cause for ridicule or shame.  Family and friends should understand and respect measures that people are taking to stay healthy and prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Women Entrepreneurs of Saskatchewan (WESK) received funding from the Government of Saskatchewan’s Status of Women Office to explore avenues of scaling up women-owned businesses.  With the funding, WESK assembled an Advisory Committee to identify recommendations that support the growth of women-owned businesses in Saskatchewan.    The Advisory Committee created a report titled Enabling Scale in Saskatchewan.  Recommendations include new financial and mentoring supports for women entrepreneurs and developing scale-enabling policy.  The report also identifies that the success of women entrepreneurs in Saskatchewan has a direct and positive impact on our economy, including job creation.  According to the report, women entrepreneurs contributed $23.1 billion to the Saskatchewan economy in 2019 and were responsible for 191,836 jobs.  However, more than 80 per cent of the province’s women-owned businesses have fewer than 10 employees.  “Saskatchewan has one of the highest rates of female entrepreneurship among all provinces, with one in every eight women employed running her own business,” Minister Responsible for the Status of Women Office Tina Beaudry-Mellor said.  “We can build on this and be one of the best places in Canada for female entrepreneurs.”  Enabling Scale in Saskatchewan recommends:  Enhancing access to capital; Developing scale-enabling policies; Streamlining access to data, programs and networks; and Enhancing awareness and support.  “Supporting women entrepreneurs is important to the success of Saskatchewan’s Growth Plan and our province’s future,” Beaudry-Mellor said.  “I applaud Women Entrepreneurs of Saskatchewan and its Advisory Committee for their work and look forward to continuing to collaborate, adding jobs and opportunities in the process.”  As well as supporting the efforts made by WESK and the Advisory Committee, the Status of Women Office is focused on increasing Saskatchewan women’s participation and prosperity.  Currently, the Office is conducting a study to identity educational and entrepreneurial pathways for women in the science, technology, engineering and math fields.

In 2018, he received the Canadian Sports Shooting National Recognition Award for outstanding contributions to the Canadian Firearms Community.  He is a firearms instructor for the Pal and RPal programs and also has close ties to both urban and rural Saskatchewan.  While Saskatchewan’s CFOs have previously been chosen by the federal government, the province made the decision earlier this year to select its own.  CFOs are responsible for administering the federal Firearms Act in the provinces, and have jurisdiction over the licensing, transporting and carrying of firearms.  The CFO also licenses instructors to deliver firearms safety courses in the province.  “We have many concerns about the decisions the federal government is making that affect law-abiding Saskatchewan firearms owners,” Tell said.  “A provincially-selected Chief Firearms Officer is an important step in ensuring that Saskatchewan and its firearms community have a strong voice on this issue.”  The province is currently working with the federal government to ensure a seamless transition from the federally-selected CFO to one that is provincially selected.  During this transition phase, the new CFO will work on getting the provincial office established, while the current CFO will continue their duties in the interim, ensuring that services for law-abiding firearms owners are not interrupted.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Marieka Andrew Corrections and Policing Regina Phone: 306-787-5510 Email: marieka.andrew@gov.sk.ca "

The SCFI is a non-refundable, non-transferable 15 per cent tax credit on capital expenditures valued at $10 million or more for newly constructed or expanded eligible chemical fertilizer production facilities in Saskatchewan.  “Our province has what the world wants in food, fuel and fertilizer,” Harrison said.  “This new program will build on Saskatchewan’s already world-class agriculture and fertilizer sectors, helping to diversify and strengthen those industries, our exports, and grow the larger economy right here at home.”  To accommodate projects that have been initiated, the program was effective November 1, 2017, and applications for conditional approval must be received before December 31, 2026, to be eligible.

Here are some red flags and preventative tips to help avoid exploitation:  If you receive “prize offers” without engaging or enrolling with the business offering the prize, do not reply to them. If someone emails, texts, or calls asking for personal or banking information, do not provide the information. If a stranger sends you a cheque, do not accept it as the cheque may bounce after you deposit it. If you receive an email with an attachment from people you do not know, do not open or download the attachments.

Campers can register with park staff when they arrive in the park, or use the self-registration envelopes that will be available after-hours.  While the campground looks different and it may take years for the trees to naturally re-grow, visitors can look forward to enjoying the beautiful sandy beach area in a sheltered bay, great for relaxing, swimming or enjoying a kayak or canoe.  A sheltered kitchen and barbecue are available near the beach, as well as a playground.  Also, the Murray Doell 1.7 km interpretive trail starts and ends at the beach, which is a great way to explore some of the boreal forest.  For more ideas on what to do in Meadow Lake Provincial Park, visit https://tourismsaskatchewan.com/places-to-go/provincial-parks/daytrip-meadow-lake.  Fall in Saskatchewan is a beautiful and peaceful time to extend the summer months!  This year, camping in all Saskatchewan Provincial Parks will be available until the end of September.

Between the Enhanced Intersection Safety Program and the Safety Improvement Program (SIP), the total 5-year investment for intersection safety is $100 million.    Additional intersection improvements are planned around the province including Highway 3 east of Prince Albert, Kalium Access on Highway 1 between Regina and Moose Jaw and Highway 342 south of Plato.  In addition to the enhanced intersection safety investments, another $7 million will be spent through SIP to reduce the frequency and severity of collisions on Highway 155 in Buffalo Narrows, Highway 14 east of Biggar and Highway 20 at Lumsden.  This year, the Government of Saskatchewan has plans to improve more than 1,000 kilometres of provincial highways, the first year of our 10-year Growth Plan goal to build and upgrade 10,000 km of highways.

Provincially, 89 per cent of fall cereals, 77 per cent of spring cereals, 74 per cent of oilseeds and 84 per cent of pulse crops are at their normal stages of development for this time of year.  With further hot temperatures in the forecast, many crops are expected to quickly catch up.  Some crops in southern areas are beginning to dry-down and local producers expect harvest operations to begin in the coming weeks.  Rainfall varied throughout the province this past week with many regions receiving at least half an inch.  The Kuroki area in the east central region received the greatest amount of rainfall with 51 mm.    Cropland topsoil moisture is rated as four per cent surplus, 84 per cent adequate, 11 per cent short and one per cent very short.  Hay and pasture land topsoil moisture is rated as three per cent surplus, 74 per cent adequate, 18 per cent short and five per cent very short.  Haying continues in between rain showers, although frequent rain and high humidity has prevented dry-down of many hay crops.  Livestock producers now have 22 per cent of the hay crop cut and 20 per cent baled or put into silage.  Hay quality is currently rated as 10 per cent excellent, 65 per cent good, 18 per cent fair and seven per cent poor.  Hay yields have been below normal for many producers and most are unsure if a second cut is possible this year.  Estimated average dryland hay yields at this time are 1.3 tons per acre for alfalfa, 1.2 tons per acre for alfalfa/bromegrass, 1.0 tons per acre for other tame hay, 0.8 tons per acre for wild hay and 1.8 tons per acre for greenfeed.  Estimated average irrigated hay yields are 2.4 tons per acre for alfalfa, 2.5 tons per acre for alfalfa/bromegrass and 2.0 tons per acre for greenfeed.  Crop damage this past week was attributed to localized flooding, hail, strong winds and lack of moisture.  Diseases such as root rot, ascochyta and other leaf spots are being scouted while insects such as grasshoppers are being sprayed.  Many producers continue to spray fungicides on crops as weather and field conditions permit. Farmers are busy haying, applying fungicides, scouting for disease and insects and getting equipment ready for harvest.

The AgTech Growth Fund is the first program dedicated to accelerating development of game-changing agricultural technologies in Saskatchewan and one of several additional supports for the tech sector announced in Budget 2020-21.  Administered by Innovation Saskatchewan, the fund will drive private investment in transformative farming and help attract international agtech companies to Saskatchewan.  “Saskatchewan farmers feed the world and the AgTech Growth Fund will create new innovations and jobs in our province,” Minister Responsible for Innovation Saskatchewan Tina Beaudry-Mellor said.  “Growing our ag economy is a key part of Saskatchewan's Growth Plan and by providing solutions in agtech, we add value to our rural communities, increase our sustainability and strengthen this province’s global leadership in food production and farming excellence.”    Agtech is the application of emerging digital technologies in solving challenges in the agricultural sector.  The agri-foods industry has the potential to become Canada’s largest economic sector.  With the proper investments in agtech, the Royal Bank of Canada forecasts $11 billion in new goods and services could be added to the national economy by 2030.  “Continued investment in agriculture technology will be a significant driver of growth in the industry,” Agriculture Minister David Marit said.  “Saskatchewan is already an agriculture research hub and investing in farm equipment technology will complement our investments in crop breeding and production to bring us closer to achieving our Growth Plan goals.”  Saskatchewan’s tech sector contributes $4.7 billion per year to the provincial economy.  The AgTech Growth Fund replaces and increases funding previously available for farm-centric technology through the Saskatchewan Advantage Innovation Fund.  Details about the Agtech Growth Fund and application forms are available on the Innovation Saskatchewan website at http://innovationsask.ca/research/agf.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Glen Kirby Innovation Saskatchewan Regina Phone: 306-787-6041 Email: glen.kirby@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-537-6455 "

The watercraft, purchased outside of Saskatchewan, was checked at an inspection station on Highway 16, near the Manitoba border.  When the mussels were discovered, ministry inspectors informed the owner and completed a full decontamination of the boat.  “This is very good news, and shows that Saskatchewan’s efforts to protect our waterbodies from aquatic invasive species are working,” Environment Minister Dustin Duncan said.  “It also highlights the importance of making sure all watercraft purchased outside the province, especially from jurisdictions known to have such species, are inspected before being launched in Saskatchewan waters.”    The ministry now has eight mobile watercraft decontamination units to support its aquatic invasive species (AIS) inspection and decontamination program, set up at fixed points on the Manitoba border, with others strategically placed throughout the province.  The U.S. border remains closed to non-essential travel at this time.  Saskatchewan coordinates watercraft inspection with Manitoba, Alberta and British Columbia to prevent AIS entering western Canada.  The inspection station that intercepted the mussels was opened in 2020, as part of the ministry’s expansion of its watercraft inspection program.  “It can be almost impossible to get rid of these invasive species once they become established, so investments in prevention are critical, potentially saving millions in annual management costs,” Duncan said.  “In addition to roadside boat inspections and decontaminations, our program focuses on public education, including the Clean, Drain, Dry Program for watercraft, and ongoing monitoring of our province’s waterbodies for AIS threats.”  Please remember to remove drain plugs on all watercraft while transporting watercraft in the province - it’s the law.  To find out if your watercraft is high-risk and requires an AIS inspection, call the ministry’s Inquiry Centre at 1-800-567-4224.  AIS are plant, animal and invertebrate species that threaten our waterways and can damage aquatic habitat, fisheries, valuable recreational resources and important power generation, irrigation and municipal water infrastructure.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Val Nicholson Environment Prince Albert Phone: 306-953-2459 Email: val.nicholson@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-981-5645 "

83,2020-07-20,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/july/20/agricultural-water-management,Government Website,Province Announces Agricultural Water Management Demonstrations," Released on July 20, 2020 11 Demonstration Projects Will Set The Stage For Further Consultations  Farmers and ranchers in Saskatchewan are working together to find new and effective ways to manage water on their land that will strengthen their operations and protect communities, infrastructure and the environment.  Today, Minister Responsible for Water Security Agency Greg Ottenbreit announced Water Security Agency (WSA) is investing $1 million to partner with 10 stakeholder organizations on 11 agricultural water management demonstration projects.  This will allow the agricultural and environmental communities to test innovative solutions and inform best practices to help farmers and ranchers manage water on their land and mitigate water quality and quantity impacts downstream.  Each organization brings a different perspective on water management and will help contribute agronomic, environmental, infrastructure and economic expertise.  “Agricultural water management is extremely important to our economy and the environment, but every region of our province is different,” Ottenbreit said.  “We need to listen and learn from, and work with farmers and ranchers on the landscape.  These projects will allow stakeholders, WSA and local leaders to better understand how we can solve complex water management issues.”  “Water management is important to all of rural Saskatchewan as our economy and viability of rural communities depend on it,” Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities President Ray Orb said.  “We are pleased to see this investment as Water Security Agency works with local leaders on options and examples of how projects can be supported by all stakeholders.”  The participating organizations receiving funding include:  Saskatchewan Conservation and Development Association; Glacier FarmMedia Discovery Farm (Langham); Saskatchewan Association of Watersheds; Saskatchewan Irrigation Projects Association; Saskatchewan Wildlife Federation; Saskatchewan Soil Conservation Association; Saskatchewan Stock Growers Association; Saskatchewan Research Council; Prairie Agricultural Machinery Institute; and Saskatchewan Heavy Construction Association.  “We have been working to advance agricultural water management projects for a number of years and it is great to see the government will be working with local leaders to find solutions to many of our members issues,” Saskatchewan Conservation and Development Association Chair Miles Wendell said.  “A lot of these projects take time and are very complex, so it’s good to see Water Security Agency taking this approach to demonstrate what works and what might need a different approach.”  “The majority of our members are from rural Saskatchewan and water management is important to wildlife across the province,” Saskatchewan Wildlife Federation Executive Director Darryl Crabbe said.  “We are excited to partner with the Water Security Agency and other stakeholders to find solutions that work for wildlife and Saskatchewan farmers and ranchers.”  Some of the demonstration projects will test how farmers and ranchers can irrigate with water drained from agricultural fields.  Other projects will strategically retain wetlands to reduce the downstream impacts of flooding on infrastructure, water quality and habitat.  Others will look at applying fertilizer in different ways in order to minimize nutrient runoff.  The Glacier FarmMedia Discovery Farm (Langham), northwest of Saskatoon, will host one of the projects.  It will be the site of a multi-year study that will involve design, regulatory approval, and construction of a drainage system on approximately 40 acres of land.  After construction, a field study will evaluate several management practices meant to reduce nutrient runoff.  “The goal is to design a drainage plan that meets regulatory requirements and optimizes land productivity while preserving the environment,” Applied Research Lead at Discovery Farm Blake Weiseth said.  “This demonstration will help producers reclaim marginally productive low-lying areas while incorporating key nutrient management features associated with wetlands.”  An extension event will be planned during construction for interested farmers and ranchers to observe the process.  Glacier FarmMedia Discovery Farm is an innovative agricultural event and demonstration site, home to Ag in Motion and Field of Excellence, located on 640 acres at Langham, Saskatchewan.

84,2020-07-20,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/july/20/deaf-and-deafblind-services,Government Website,Government Announces Additional Funding For D/Deaf And Deafblind Services," Released on July 20, 2020                  The Government of Saskatchewan has announced an additional funding increase of $350,000 to help address service gaps for the D/deaf and Deafblind populations of Saskatchewan.  This was previously committed in the 2020-21 Budget.  This funding will be provided to Vision Loss Rehabilitation Canada (VLRC) and Saskatchewan Deaf and Hard of Hearing Services (SDHHS) to provide expanded services.  The funding will allow VLRC to leverage their affiliate organization, Deafblind Community Services, to provide a new service in Saskatchewan, while SDHHS will be able to expand their delivery of interpreting American Sign Language (ASL) services for persons dealing with the courts, police, medical, educational and employment sectors.  These supports assist people who are D/deaf or hard of hearing in accessing services to participate in their community.  “It is important that we continue to look at removing barriers in our communities so people can participate to their fullest,” Social Services Minister Paul Merriman said.  “This funding increase will help people who are D/deaf and Deafblind do just that.  I’m looking forward to more of this work as we start to engage with the province on accessibility legislation for Saskatchewan in the coming months.”  Saskatchewan Deaf and Hard of Hearing Services provides ASL interpreting services.  The additional funding will allow the organization to hire one additional ASL interpreter and two sign support professionals and enhance their 24-hour interpreter line to include access to intervener services.  They will receive $253,000.  “This funding represents a significant increase in accessibility in our province,” SDHHS Executive Director Nairn Gillies said.  “It will go a long way to allowing deaf and hard of hearing people to participate fully.”  VLRC is a provincially funded, accredited health care organization staffed by a passionate team of certified professionals.  The organization provides professional, high-quality and sustainable rehabilitation to Canadians with vision loss now and into the future.  The additional funding will allow the organization to establish Deafblind Community Services here in Saskatchewan, including hiring one Deafblind intervenor and providing daily one-to-one intervenor services to four people who are Deafblind.  They will receive $96,500.  “The lack of professional support services for people who are Deafblind in Canada is definitely a human rights concern, especially when a person needs a professional to facilitate communication at a medical or legal appointment,” Deafblind Community Services Executive Director Sherry Grabrowski said.  “Some people who are Deafblind have no outside support from family or friends.  That’s why our services are so important to the people we serve.  This announcement sets a precedent that we hope other provinces will follow.”  This funding supports the Saskatchewan Disability Strategy by expanding supports for people to participate in their communities.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Rikkeal Bohmann Social Services Regina Phone: 306-570-1149 Email: rikkeal.bohmann@gov.sk.ca  Alison Byczok Vision Loss Rehabilitation Canada and Deafblind Community Services  Toronto Phone: 416-272-0464 Email: alison.byczok@cnib.ca   Nairn Gillies Saskatchewan Deaf and Hard of Hearing Services Saskatoon Phone: 306-220-8127 Email: nairn@sdhhs.com               "
85,2020-07-20,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/july/20/investor-alert,Government Website,Investor Alert – Warning About An Increase In Foreign Exchange (Forex) Scams," Released on July 20, 2020 The Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority of Saskatchewan (FCAA) is alerting the public about Foreign Exchange (Forex) scams targeting investors.  Forex investing includes speculating on the change in value of one currency against another.  This activity is legal and regulated in Saskatchewan but only registered dealers are allowed to conduct the trades.  However, its complexity and volatility can be used by fraudsters to mislead unsuspecting investors into believing a scheme is a legitimate and lucrative investment.  Provincial and territorial securities regulators in Canada have seen an increase in Forex-related scams over the past few months.  Specifically, fraudsters have been using social media, online forums and buy and sell websites to target investors with promises of high returns from Forex investing.  “You should always check to see if the person or company offering the investment is registered,” FCAA Director of Enforcement Harvey White said.  “The Canadian Securities Administrators’ National Registration Search (https://www.securities-administrators.ca/nrs/nrsearchprep.aspx) is a free tool that investors can use to check registrations as only registered dealers can sell Forex products.  Additionally, Forex trading is complex, volatile and a high risk investment.  If you don’t fully understand the risks, don’t get involved.”  Here are some red flags that may indicate the investment is fraudulent:  A guarantee of little or no risk, and high investment returns. Dealers are not registered with the FCAA. An unwillingness to discuss the past performance or track record of the specialist traders who will handle their money. An unwillingness to identify specialist traders or traders located in offshore jurisdictions who will handle their money. High-pressure sales techniques to buy a Forex investment, to purchase software or take courses related to Forex trading.  Tips to protect yourself:  Always check the registration of the person or company selling or advising about securities or derivatives.  To check registration visit The Canadian Securities Administrators’ National Registration Search (https://www.securities-administrators.ca/nrs/nrsearchprep.aspx).  Check the disciplinary history for the person or company, to find out if they have broken regulatory rules in the past.  It is easy to do, using the Canadian Securities Administrators’ Cease Trade Orders database (https://cto-iov.csa-acvm.ca/SearchArticles.asp?Instance=101&AttrSet7=0&Attr7=1&Attr7=2&XSL=SearchArticlesAdvanced) and the list of disciplined people and companies (https://www.securities-administrators.ca/disciplinedpersons.aspx).  Know exactly what you are investing in.   Make sure you understand how the investment, product or service works. Get a second opinion and seek professional advice about the investment.  If you have been contacted by someone offering a Forex investing opportunity or any investment that may be fraudulent, contact the FCAA’s Securities Division at 306-787-5936.    For more information about scams and how to spot red flags visit https://fcaa.gov.sk.ca/consumers-investors-pension-plan-members/investors/investment-fraud.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Stephanie Wilkinson Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority Regina Phone: 306-787-5567 Email: stephanie.wilkinson@gov.sk.ca "

COVID-19 Awareness  Since mid-June, there has been an increase in cases in the southwest and west-central parts of Saskatchewan, both on colonies and in the broader community.  Public health investigation is ongoing to determine transmission chains and to identify contacts.  Health officials are working closely with the Hutterian Safety Council, local Hutterian leaders, and local municipal leaders to increase testing and precautionary measures to protect these communities.  With the increase in cases, there have been reports of discrimination towards some Saskatchewan residents.  This is unacceptable. Discrimination has no place in Saskatchewan.  COVID-19 does not discriminate, as we have seen with cases across the province.  This is why everyone must continue to take precautions and follow public health measures.  COVID-19 Testing  COVID-19 testing is now available to anyone who requests it, regardless of whether they have symptoms or not.  A referral for testing can be made by contacting HealthLine 811.

There are a variety of safety protocols that will be in place this year due to COVID-19 when visitors make their way to the new pool, such as:  Decreased capacity at any one time.  To ensure fair access, the facility has implemented a turnover system whereby all pool users will be asked to leave after a set block of time for cleaning and disinfecting.  Users can then choose to leave, or re-enter the line-up to be admitted once again, re-payment will not be required. No swimming lessons or programming, including lane swimming.  With the cancellation of swimming lessons, programming and lane swimming, the pool will be open for longer public swim times to allow for more visitors. Physical distancing rules will be in effect.  Floor indicators will assist visitors where to stand while in line to pay and barriers will protect visitors and pool staff during any necessary contact. Specific entry and exit directional signage protocols will be in effect. Pool staff will provide reminders to visitors throughout the day about the requirement for physical distancing.  Buffalo Pound Provincial Park is located 20 minutes northeast of Moose Jaw and offers a balanced blend of nature and recreational opportunities.  This park offers excellent hiking and biking trails, fishing, canoeing and kayaking.    Visitors to this park can also enjoy migrant waterfowl viewing at Nicolle Flats Interpretive Area and on the Marsh Boardwalk.  Campsites in the park will remain open until the end of September this year and can be reserved online.  With the pool and camping accessible into the fall, Buffalo Pound Provincial Park is a great place for visitors to extend their summer.

A total of 22 packages will engage up to 50 service companies and spread out the work for abandonment activities across the Lloydminster, Kindersley, Swift Current and Estevan areas.  The work includes around 300 well abandonments, 300 flowline abandonments, 75 facility decommissions and 700 other activities related to site reclamation.  The value of this first tranche of work packages is $12 million and encompasses six different operators. “We took the necessary time to develop a strategic program, which has been well-received by the oil and gas sector, and are delivering it in a timely, efficient way,” Energy and Resources Minister Bronwyn Eyre said.  “This first parcel of work projects incorporates every oil region in the province.  Most importantly, it gets the Saskatchewan service sector back to work.”  “We are extremely pleased to see our members getting back to work, and applaud the Saskatchewan government’s approach to administering the ASCP,” Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors President and CEO Mark Scholz said.  “This activity could not come at a better time, and will provide much needed relief for struggling oilfield businesses and families.”    The Government of Saskatchewan also remains committed to involving Indigenous partners within the ASCP.  Numerous Indigenous-owned service companies have been pre-qualified to obtain work within the program, including in the Onion Lake region.  “Over the past few months, I have spoken directly with many Lloydminster contacts, and I will be glad to see them, and other Saskatchewan-based service companies, back in the field,” Lloydminster MLA Colleen Young said.  “The ASCP supports one of our hardest-hit sectors, and our government has diligently engaged with the oil and gas sector to develop a program that gets Saskatchewan companies back to work.”  “The Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers would like to recognize the significant efforts of the Government of Saskatchewan to develop and successfully roll out the first tranche of the Accelerated Site Closure Program,” Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers Vice President of Western Canada Operations Brad Herald said.  “We are confident that this program will help to get Saskatchewan-based oilfield service companies back to work quickly, and also support the efficient and timely closure of inactive upstream oil and natural gas sites.”  The province continues to work through the initial phase of the ASCP to roll out funds in a timely, comprehensive manner.  Phase 1 of the program will allocate up to $100 million in funding to Saskatchewan service companies, with subsequent phases currently under development.  The ASCP was launched on May 22, 2020.  It prioritized Saskatchewan-based service companies and will access up to $400 million, over two years, through the federal COVID-19 Economic Response Plan.  It is being overseen by the Ministry of Energy and Resources and delivered in partnership with the Saskatchewan Research Council.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Ashley Schoff Energy and Resources Regina Phone: 306-787-5582 Email: ashley.schoff2@gov.sk.ca "

The majority of crops this week are in fair to excellent condition.  Rainfall was received throughout the province this week.  Areas near Neilburg received the highest amount of rainfall in the province with 116 mm.  The St. Walburg area received the most rainfall in the province since April 1 with 376 mm.  The moisture was welcome in many areas, but high amounts of rain in certain parts of the west-central and northern regions resulted in localized flooding and standing water.  This prevented producers from entering fields for spraying and haying.  Cropland topsoil moisture is rated as six per cent surplus, 85 per cent adequate, six per cent short and three per cent very short.  Hay and pasture land topsoil moisture is rated as four per cent surplus, 75 per cent adequate, 16 per cent short and five per cent very short.  Rainfall this week delayed some farmers from haying, but hay is being cut and baled as conditions allow.    Livestock producers now have 13 per cent of the hay crop cut and 11 per cent baled or put into silage.  Hay quality is rated as five per cent excellent, 65 per cent good, 25 per cent fair and five per cent poor.  The majority of crop damage this week was caused by flooding, hail, wind, lack of moisture, lodging, gophers and insects.  There have been reports of disease issues in most regions of the province, including root rot and ascochyta blight in pulses.  Some producers have started spraying for fusarium head blight and other diseases as environmental conditions permit.  Farmers are busy haying, spraying fungicides, fixing equipment and scouting for insects and disease.

Returning to the park this year is JT’s Beach Café.  Just steps from the beach, this food and beverage vendor makes a quick trip or a weekend visit to Blackstrap Provincial Park worthwhile.  Visitors can also enjoy the mobile JT’s Ice Cream Van that serves up cold treats throughout the park all summer long.  Park users looking for a safe, but fun activity while in the park can check out the self-use night geo-caching course.  Visitors should bring their own flashlights to use, and follow the directions posted in the park.  Night caching is best done after dusk, when the sun goes down.  Another attraction of interest this season at Blackstrap Provincial Park will be the two drive-in movie nights that will be hosted in the park on Saturday, August 22 and Friday, September 11.  This season, visitors are reminded that at least one campground will be open in each Saskatchewan Provincial Park that offers camping until the end of September, with lots of availability all summer and into the fall.  In Blackstrap Provincial Park, campers can book into the Kevin Misfeldt campground through to the end of September.  With historically beautiful fall weather in Saskatchewan, a fall camping trip is a great way to hang on to those summer vibes.  Note – a valid entry permit is required year-round so visitors are reminded to keep their annual entry permits for their fall camping and for upcoming winter events.  Saskatchewan Parks Week kicks off on Sunday, July 12 this year with Canada’s Parks Day being observed on Saturday, July 18.  To celebrate, Sask Parks Ambassador, Annika Mang and her family will be in Blackstrap Provincial Park experiencing all the park has to offer and sharing via Sask Parks social media channels (@SaskParks on Facebook and Instagram).  Annika is a content creator, storyteller, writer and photographer specializing in family travel adventure.  Annika believes that experiences like camping, hiking, or enjoying a beach day with the family are some of the best ways to connect.  Sask Parks staff will be implementing enhanced cleaning and sanitization procedures and minimizing in-park contact with visitors where possible.  Park visitors are asked to bring their own hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes, maintain physical distance from others, respect the restrictions and rules that are in place and to stay home if not feeling well.  By working together, park staff and visitors can ensure parks remain safe spaces for all.

Services that will resume in this next phase include: - Further enhanced mental health and addictions support, including the opening of social detox and addictions inpatient treatment; - Additional Chronic Diseases Management/Wellness Programs/Stroke Prevention; and - Specialized services for clients with developmental disabilities, Autism and brain injuries.  Since service resumption began on May 19, 544 health services have re-started in all areas of the province.  Regina and southern areas have seen more services resume compared with Saskatoon and the north, given the COVID-19 cases in those areas and the response personnel required to support it.  “Overall, we’ve been pleased with our ability to bring services back online, while still implementing strategies to keep patients and providers safe,” SHA Chief Executive Officer Scott Livingstone said.  “Patients and their families have been very understanding of the additional screening measures and changes to how they had traditionally received service.  Both staff and physicians are happy to be seeing their patients again, as well.”  Surgical volumes have been increased at each ease phase of service resumption, including the most recent phase which included more urgent, emergent and also some elective procedures.  This next phase will further increase surgical volumes to between 75 and 85 per cent of pre-COVID levels.  These numbers vary significantly by site and as a result of staff availability.  Moose Jaw’s Dr. F.H Wigmore Hospital, for example, is achieving beyond 100 per cent of their pre-COVID surgical levels as a result of new surgeons that were recruited to the community.  Together, the SHA and Ministry of Health are working in partnership with physicians and other operational leaders to continue focus on the backlog of surgeries.  Medical Imaging capacity has also increased to 90 per cent of pre-COVID service levels overall, with MRIs at 91 per cent and CT at 93 per cent, for example.  Virtual care appointments continue to be offered where possible, with some face-to-face services being offered, where needed.  Since initiating expanded virtual care options as a result of the pandemic in March, more than 175,000 appointments have been delivered through this option.  “As we expand services, we are still also continuing to keep focused on COVID-19 support as well,’ Livingstone said.  “We’ve entered our ‘new normal,’ meaning while there is still some room to increase some services, we cannot let our guard down on the pandemic, especially as we progress towards the Fall.”  All services are listed on the Saskatchewan Health Authority website, with new services being added each day at www.saskhealthauthority.ca/service-alerts.  Beginning July 14, COVID-19 testing will be available universally to anyone who requests it, regardless of whether they have symptoms or not.  A referral for testing can be made by contacting HealthLine 811.  SHA laboratories are currently processing approximately 600 tests per day, with capacity to perform upwards of 1,800 tests per day.  Patients will be prioritized for testing based on a number of factors.  The time between a testing request and receiving the test itself may vary based upon patient need.

It is recommended that participants contact their local Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure office to provide contact information and limits on where they are salvaging hay to avoid disputes.    All hay bales must be removed by August 8, otherwise they may be removed and disposed.  After that, bales must be removed immediately.  The ministry may also remove and dispose of hay bales in locations deemed unsafe for drivers.  Beginning next week, regular ditch mowing will occur along all four-lane highways through the fall.  A four-metre-wide strip will be mowed adjacent to the other highways with additional mowing as required to ensure visibility and weed control.  A weekly construction update provides Saskatchewan residents with the latest details on projects underway to help plan safe and efficient travel throughout the summer and fall.  Additional travel information about emergency road closures, the status of ferries, barges and other road activities can also be found on the Highway Hotline at www.saskatchewan.ca/Highwayhotline.  Information and concerns about a provincial highway can be made by calling 1-844-SK-HIWAY.

The Tisdale area reported damaged crops and property due to storms last Thursday and isolated areas in the southwest region received heavy hail over the weekend which reportedly damaged crops.  Crop development is progressing in the province as a result of warm weather and recent rainfall.  Fifty-nine per cent of the fall cereals and 24 per cent of spring cereals are in the heading stage.  Thirty-seven per cent of canola and mustard and 48 per cent of pulse crops are in the flowering stage.  Haying has started throughout the province.  Livestock producers now have eight per cent of the hay crop cut and three per cent baled or put into silage.  Hay quality is currently rated as eight per cent excellent, 66 per cent good, 20 per cent fair and six per cent poor.    Pasture conditions are rated as 12 per cent excellent, 49 per cent good, 30 per cent fair, seven per cent poor and two per cent very poor.  More of the pastures in the southern and east-central regions have been rated as fair-good compared to the other regions rated as fair-excellent.  Farmers in the regions that received rainfall over the past few weeks have reported improvements in pasture development.  Moisture conditions continued to improve across the province thanks to recent rainfalls over the past few weeks, especially in the southeast and east-central regions.  Heavy rains this past week resulted in more land, specifically in the northeast and northwest regions, rated as surplus for top soil moisture and showing symptoms of flood damage in fields.  Cropland topsoil moisture is rated as four per cent surplus, 82 per cent adequate, 11 per cent short and three per cent very short.  Hay and pasture land topsoil moisture is rated as two per cent surplus, 71 per cent adequate, 19 per cent short and eight per cent very short.  The majority of crop damage this week was caused by flooding, hail and wind.  There are also reports of damage caused by dry conditions in the southern and east-central regions.  Due to recent moisture and warm weather, farmers are scouting for disease damage and starting to apply fungicides for a wide range of plant diseases.

Auto Fund highlights for 2019-2020 include:  the lowest number of fatalities ever recorded on Saskatchewan roads; $889.3 million in claims; $962.7 million in gross premium written; $151.5 million in discounts to customers through the Safe Driver Recognition (SDR) and Business Recognition programs; $29.3 million net storm claims; harsher penalties for distracted driving legislation took effect.  SGI CANADA sells property and casualty insurance in the competitive markets of Saskatchewan, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario and British Columbia. In 2019-2020, SGI CANADA remained financially stable; a result of continued excellence and profitable growth - growth that allowed the company to achieve strategic goals ahead of schedule.  “SGI CANADA surpassed its target of $1 billion direct premiums written, and did so a year early,” Hargrave said.  “The company also reached and exceeded its target of 40 per cent of premium written outside of Saskatchewan before its target of 2020-21.  This Saskatchewan-based company has a significant presence throughout the country and is maintaining that profitable growth within a market of tough competitors.”  Highlights for SGI CANADA in 2019-2020 include:  $49.9 million net income, with a return on equity of 11.4 per cent pre-tax; $54.3 million dividend to government; $22.7 million in investment earnings; $1 billion in direct premiums written, including $418.9 million (42 per cent) written outside Saskatchewan, achieving SGI CANADA’s goal of 40 per cent one year ahead of target; $32.5 million in storm claims (all provinces); more than 970,000 customers across Canada; introducing a customer data tool that provides quality feedback from claims customers, that allows SGI CANADA to act and evaluate how customers are being served and provide them a better experience; and introducing technology to allow brokers to exchange data with us in real time using their broker management system to quote, submit and issue SGI CANADA policies.

121,2020-07-09,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/july/09/be-bear-aware,Government Website,Be Bear Aware This Summer," Released on July 9, 2020 With the summer season now upon us, the Ministry of Environment is reminding residents to be bear aware.  Saskatchewan has a healthy black bear population, so it is not unusual to see bears in the wild at this time of year as they establish new territory.  They are looking for food and are attracted to new scents.  Bears have been known to wander through communities and campgrounds, so proper food storage, cooking methods and garbage handling are essential for safe camping in bear country.  Bears are ruled by their stomachs and are intelligent animals.  If they cannot find food, they will leave the area.  Bears that have been fed lose their natural fear of humans.  When bears start to associate their food with humans, they become a nuisance and a public safety concern.    The ministry encourages everyone to be bear aware by removing bear attractants in their area.  This will help reduce the number of bears that have to be euthanized or relocated each year.  When you don't take precautions with things that attract bears, such as household waste, you create a safety risk for yourself, your community and the bears.  Here is what you can do:  Store garbage in a secure building or buy a bear-resistant container.  Only put the bin out on the morning of collection. Avoid leaving pet food accessible to wildlife.  Only use bird feeders in the winter when bears are hibernating and natural bird food is limited.

SaskTel’s revenue is composed primarily of wireless network services and equipment revenue (44.9 per cent), maxTV service, internet and data (29.4 per cent), and local access, enhanced services, and long distance (15.2 per cent).  “SaskTel’s strategic priorities place their customers at the centre of everything they do with a goal of making it easier for customers to do business with the company and for employees to serve customers,” Minister Responsible for SaskTel Don Morgan said.  “Throughout the year, SaskTel invested approximately $263 million in capital improvements across the province to continue to prepare its networks for future demand and to deliver a quality user experience for the people of Saskatchewan.”  “As we enter a new decade, we find ourselves on the cusp of monumental change in our industry as digital, web-based, and emerging technologies continue to reshape the way we operate and interact with our customers, vendors and other partners,” SaskTel President and CEO Doug Burnett said.  “We recognize that we must evolve our business to support customers’ shifting expectations and to continue providing exceptional service in a digital world.  Digital transformation continues to be the main driver reshaping customer and employee experiences across our business.”  Financial Highlights  SaskTel’s financial measures are focused on creating shareholder value, generating revenue and earnings, and effectively leveraging its capital investments.  These measures provide important insight into its current financial performance and overall progress enhancing its long-term financial stability.  SaskTel’s Return on Equity (ROE) is below the target of 11.1 per cent, due to the recognition of an impairment loss in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019-20 and its resulting impact on net income.  Excluding the impairment loss that was primarily related to impacts of COVID-19, ROE would have been on target at 11.1 per cent.  SaskTel paid dividends of $107.2 million to Crown Investment Corporation during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020, a decrease of $9.1 million from the previous year.  During the last five fiscal years, SaskTel paid a total of $373.4 million in dividends while maintaining a debt ratio within industry standards.

Core operations remained a focus, as SaskEnergy invested $330 million to expand natural gas storage and delivery capacity for customers throughout Saskatchewan.  While investing in system capacity, safety and reliability, SaskEnergy decreased its commodity rate to reflect the low natural gas price environment, which resulted in the lowest commodity rate in 20 years for its customers.  Combined with its delivery rate, SaskEnergy’s total residential gas utility rate is the third-lowest in Canada.  “SaskEnergy continues to deliver value to its customers and achieve strong results in safety and fiscal management,” Minister Responsible for SaskEnergy Bronwyn Eyre said.  “The corporation has attracted 2,500 new distribution customers, and its overall customer base is expected to reach 400,000 in 2020-21.  SaskEnergy is well-positioned to meet the province’s natural gas requirements, and its continued investment in infrastructure will help foster our province’s economic recovery.”  In 2019, SaskEnergy’s Customer Connect initiative received the first-ever Michael Mulcahy Award for Excellence in Customer Care, Innovation and Service from the Canadian Gas Association (CGA).  In June 2020, the CGA once again recognized SaskEnergy with this award for its Tune-Up Assistance Program, which assists low-income individuals and families with furnace maintenance in order to reduce costly repairs, increase efficiency and help their energy dollars go further.  In addition, the program raises awareness about the importance of carbon monoxide (CO) detection.  “SaskEnergy continues to demonstrate its commitment to its customers and to enhancing the quality of life for Saskatchewan residents,” Eyre said.  “In 2019-20, SaskEnergy also provided more than $1 million in rebates to residential and commercial customers who installed energy efficient natural gas furnaces and heating systems.”  SaskEnergy recorded income before unrealized market value adjustments of $66 million in 2019-20.  Based on the income before unrealized market value adjustments, the corporation declared a dividend of $24 million to the Government of Saskatchewan.  Other 2019-20 operational highlights include:  Completing a new 62-kilometre South Saskatoon transmission gas line project, which more than doubled natural gas capacity to the east side of the city, to meet the increased demand for natural gas in Saskatoon and surrounding areas; Investing $111 million in safety and integrity programs across the province; Distributing 1,000 CO alarms in communities with higher numbers of CO incidents; Reaching a five-year high of 91 per cent for overall residential customer satisfaction; Signing an Indigenous Engagement Charter to strengthen relationships with Indigenous peoples, businesses, and communities; Providing nearly $1 million in rebates to residential and commercial customers who installed energy efficient natural gas furnaces and heating systems; Supporting expanded customer operations in potash and enhanced oil recovery; and Continuing to focus on efficiency gains, which resulted in $3.3 million in cost reductions throughout 2019-20, bringing efficiency savings to more than $55 million since 2009.

Leaving on the government side are Dan D’Autremont (representing Cannington), Nancy Heppner (Martensville-Warman), Greg Brkich (Arm River), Glen Hart (Last Mountain-Touchwood), Herb Cox (The Battlefords), Larry Doke (Cutknife-Turtleford) and Warren Michelson (Moose Jaw North).  Warren McCall (Regina Elphinstone-Centre), David Forbes (Saskatoon Centre), Danielle Chartier (Saskatoon Riversdale) and Cathy Sproule (Saskatoon Nutuna) are the New Democrats stepping down.

Among other initiatives in the budget:  A record $435 million for mental health and addictions supports and services; $20 million investment to reduce surgical wait times; $80 million to build new long-term care facilities in Grenfell and La Ronge and to support renewal projects in 51 long-term care facilities across the province; Record funding for Saskatchewan schools, including $2.6 billion to support Prekindergarten to Grade 12 classrooms, early learning and child care, libraries and literacy; $278 million in no-strings-attached Municipal Revenue Sharing – an 11 per cent increase and the highest amount ever provided under the program; $150 million for the Municipal Economic Enhancement Program for municipal infrastructure projects; and $715 million to improve highway safety and efficiency, including more than 20 new passing lanes to be constructed in 2020.  During the session, Premier Moe said the government will continue to support the goals outlined in the province’s new Growth Plan, released last fall.  The government will proceed with the establishment of three new trade and investment offices in Japan, India and Singapore.  “The COVID-19 pandemic has not changed the basic fundamentals of the Saskatchewan economy,” Moe said.  “Once the crisis passes, the world will continue to grow, and demand for Saskatchewan products will be strong.  We need to be in a position to capitalize on that demand.  The new trade offices will help us diversify our markets and help Saskatchewan exporters make connections with international buyers, which will mean more jobs here at home.”  During the session, the government also announced the creation of a Nuclear Secretariat to coordinate nuclear policy and programs and plan for the deployment of clean energy small modular reactors in Saskatchewan.  The government introduced amendments to legislation to better protect the rights of legal firearm and handgun owners in the province.  And during the session, the Interpersonal Violence Disclosure Protocol (Clare’s Law) Act came into force in Saskatchewan.  “Clare’s Law” authorizes a police protocol to disclose risk information related to someone’s violent or abusive past to intimate partners whose safety may be threatened.  Saskatchewan is the first jurisdiction in Canada to enact Clare’s Law legislation and is encouraging other provinces to follow in its footsteps.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Matthew Glover Executive Council Regina Phone: 306-787-2127 Email: matthew.glover@gov.sk.ca "

Many RM roads connect to the provincial or national highway system and weight-restricted bridges can create gaps and inefficiencies in the transportation network.  Projects will be cost-shared up to $500,000, with about 17 per cent of this amount coming from the federal government, while 33 per cent will come from the provincial government with the remaining share coming from the RMs.  The provincial government has invested $313 million in rural infrastructure since 2007, over and above municipal revenue sharing.  The Government of Saskatchewan has invested more than $9.8 billion in highways infrastructure since 2008, improving more than 15,800 km of Saskatchewan highways.  Another $300 million in highways stimulus funds will be invested over the next two years to stimulate Saskatchewan’s economic recovery.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Steve Shaheen Highways and Infrastructure Regina Phone: 306-933-5641 Email: steve.shaheen@gov.sk.ca "
145,2020-07-02,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/july/02/irrigation-project,Government Website,Saskatchewan Announces $4 Billion Irrigation Project At Lake Diefenbaker," Released on July 2, 2020 Work To Begin Immediately To Stimulate The Economy   Today, Premier Scott Moe announced the first steps of a generational project that will fulfill the vision of Prime Minister John Diefenbaker to ensure the prosperity of Saskatchewan people and irrigate up to 500,000 acres of land from Lake Diefenbaker, more than doubling the irrigable land in Saskatchewan.  The project is beginning with an immediate $22.5 million investment in preliminary engineering and initial construction.  Project construction is expected to occur approximately over the next 10 years in three main phases at a cost estimated at $4 billion.  “The announcement of this generational project will see the vision of Lake Diefenbaker completed over the course of the next decade,” Moe said.  “By doubling the amount of irrigable land in our province, this project will be a massive step in completing the goals our government has set out in our 2030 Growth Plan.”  Phase 1 of the project is estimated to cost $500 million and will include the rehabilitation and expansion of the existing Westside irrigation canal system.  This work will increase the amount of irrigable land by 80,000 acres in the area.  It is considered one of the most shovel ready irrigation projects in the province with 90 per cent of the current canal already in place.  Phases 2 and 3 of the project are estimated to cost up to $3.5 billion.  Phase 2 will see the further expansion and buildout of the Westside Irrigation Project, adding an additional 260,000 acres of irrigable land.  Once fully built and developed, the project will eventually see land made available for irrigation near Macrorie, Milden, Zealandia, and as far north as Delisle and Asquith.  Phase 3 will see the buildout of the Qu’Appelle South Irrigation Project, adding an estimated 120,000 acres of irrigable land.  Starting at Lake Diefenbaker and going south, the project would run near the communities of Tugaske, Eyebrow, down to Marquis and into Buffalo Pound Lake.  It would provide the Moose Jaw-Regina corridor and southern Saskatchewan with a secure source of water for the next century and act as a catalyst for significant industrial expansion in the years to come.  This year, $22.5 million is being invested as part of Phase 1 to immediately begin preliminary engineering and initial construction of the Westside Irrigation Project.  Preliminary soil quality analysis of the Qu’Appelle South Irrigation Project area will also begin this year.  “Saskatchewan has one of the most unique opportunities across the country,” Minister Responsible for the Water Security Agency Greg Ottenbreit said.  “We are well positioned to further develop while providing a secure water supply for generations to come.   I am very confident Legislative Secretary Lyle Stewart will move this project forward to ensure certainty for our economy and a secure water supply for decades to come.”  These irrigation projects are building blocks for regional economic development in Saskatchewan.  Initial estimates show the investment will result in a $40 to $80 billion increase in the provincial Gross Domestic Product over the next 50 years.  The project is estimated to create 2,500 construction jobs a year, over the next ten years.  “I look forward to working with producers, industry and government partners to expand irrigation capacity in Saskatchewan,” Agriculture Minister David Marit said.  “From diversifying crop production and attracting more value-added processing, to benefitting local economies and adding to our long-term food security, increased irrigation opportunities support a profitable and sustainable economy.”  “Irrigation is an important part of the Saskatchewan agriculture industry and the economy,” Legislative Secretary to the Minister Responsible for Water Security Agency Lyle Stewart said.  “It supports the growth of diverse, high-value crops, which increases on-farm profitability, value-added processing opportunities, business attraction and employment.”  “Lake Diefenbaker is a major resource for this province, and it is very encouraging to see the government taking this next step,” Saskatchewan Irrigation Projects Association Chair Aaron Gray said.  “Projects like this put Saskatchewan producers in a very strong position to create a sustainable and secure food supply for Canada.”  Discussions with the federal government are being coordinated by SaskBuilds, in partnership with the Water Security Agency and the Ministry of Agriculture, to leverage all possible federal infrastructure funding opportunities, including through the Canada Infrastructure Bank.  Saskatchewan is seeking federal funding now to support planning work and will be seeking significant longer-term funding to support this multi-year, multi-phase construction project.  The province expects to complete further consultations and discussions with stakeholders and First Nations as the project progresses.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Matthew Glover Executive Council Regina Phone: 306-787-2127 Email: matthew.glover@gov.sk.ca "
146,2020-07-02,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/july/02/ran,Government Website,"Saskatchewan’s Representative Areas Network Grows By 74,000 Acres"," Released on July 2, 2020 Approximately 74,000 acres (30,000 hectares [ha]) of land has been added to Saskatchewan’s Representative Areas Network (RAN), through a stakeholder agreement and transfer of land from another government ministry.  The RAN is a network of ecologically important land and water areas across the province that currently protects more than 15.8 million acres (6.4 million ha).  The Ministry of Environment and the Saskatchewan Wildlife Federation (SWF) have agreed to co-operate on protected areas management with the addition of approximately 70,000 acres (28,000 ha) of SWF-owned land to the RAN.  Just over 4,000 acres (1,700 ha) transferred from the Ministry of Agriculture will also be added to the network.  “Expanding our Representative Areas Network protects more natural and cultural land features for the future,” Environment Minister Dustin Duncan said.  “Co-operation with partner organizations and other ministries allows us to enhance the network’s valuable contributions to ecological integrity, wildlife habitat, and as benchmarks to assess the environmental impacts of human activities.”    In addition:  The Ministry of Agriculture is transferring nearly 80,000 acres (32,000 ha) of Crown land with little to no agricultural potential to the Ministry of Environment. Almost 66,000 acres (27,000 ha) of this land will be added to the Fish and Wildlife Development Fund (FWDF), and managed as wildlife habitat. At the same time, the Ministry of Environment will transfer just over 4,200 acres (1,700 ha) of Crown land in agricultural use to the Ministry of Agriculture.  “These land transfers are part of ongoing efforts by the two ministries to make sure that public lands are appropriately and sustainably managed,” Duncan said.  “As time goes by and situations evolve, some lands are more appropriate for the Ministry of Agriculture, and some more appropriate for Environment.  This change in designation will be enjoyed by all Saskatchewan residents who appreciate wildlife and the outdoors.  The amendment will also contribute to our province’s climate change objectives by enhancing resiliency to extreme weather events.”  “We applaud the Saskatchewan government for supporting this extremely proactive initiative, recognizing the societal and ecological values of these lands,” SWF Executive Director Darrell Crabbe said.  “We are very optimistic that this initial transfer will pave the way for future reallocations.”   The FWDF receives a portion of revenue from trapping, angling and hunting licences, and supports projects to protect and enhance fish and wildlife habitat while ensuring continuing access for hunters and other outdoor enthusiasts.  There are now nearly 300,000 acres (122,000 ha) of FWDF lands.  FWDF lands are overseen by a board, with representatives from the Saskatchewan Wildlife Federation, Nature Conservancy of Canada, Ducks Unlimited Canada and the Ministry of Environment.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Val Nicholson Environment Prince Albert Phone: 306-953-2459 Email: val.nicholson@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-981-5645  Darrell Crabbe Saskatchewan Wildlife Federation Phone: 306-630-8780 Email: dcrabbe@swf.sk.ca "

The mobile app, developed by Bridges Health in Saskatoon, was selected during a province-wide Innovation Challenge in the spring of 2020, where technology entrepreneurs offered solutions to assist Saskatchewan farmers, ranchers and agricultural workers in actively monitoring their mental health.  “Despite progress made, there is still stigma associated with asking for support when it comes to mental health,” Minister Responsible for Innovation Saskatchewan Tina Beaudry-Mellor said.  “Having access to an app in the privacy of one’s own home will enhance the likelihood of people asking for help when they need it the most.”    Calls to the Saskatchewan farm stress line doubled in 2018-2019 compared to the previous year and, in 2020, COVID-19 is placing new pressures on people within the agriculture sector.  The app – called ‘Avail’ – analyzes wellness data supplied by the user and offers supports including articles, videos and online tips, or more immediate help from a personal support network.  “Saskatchewan producers face unique challenges when it comes to dealing with mental health and we are committed to providing resources and strategies to help support them,” Agriculture Minister David Marit said.  “We know there is a need for solutions like this and I’m looking forward to working with Bridges Health to provide a resource custom-built for the agriculture industry.”  Bridges Health is a mental health service organization based in Saskatoon.  As Innovation Challenge winners, the company receives $10,000 in funding and a 16-week collaboration with government to develop the mobile app.  “As a company founded and based in Saskatchewan, the agriculture sector touches both our business and our families,” Bridges Health Vice President Leon Ferguson said.  “We are honored to have this opportunity to work with government and partners to develop and advance this mental health and overall wellness tool.”  Innovation Challenges encourage Saskatchewan-based tech companies to find innovative answers to issues facing the public.  Previous projects introduced tech responses to rural crime, online permissions for hunting and fishing on private land and tracking landfill waste.

The research will be conducted by the Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC) and focus on testing, validating and accelerating adoption rates for a range of technologies.  “In recent years, the oil and gas sector has significantly improved gas conservation rates and reduced methane emissions, so it makes common sense to continue to work together and build on that record,” Energy and Resources Minister Bronwyn Eyre said.  “Field testing is a critical step that will confirm practical technologies that convert currently vented and flared methane into commercialized products.”    “Our investment in this technology is a win-win for the industry and the environment,” Minister Responsible for Innovation Saskatchewan Tina Beaudry-Mellor said.  “And we will continue supporting new technologies to stimulate economic growth while recognizing our provincial responsibility to reduce greenhouse gases.”  The SRC, together with the oil and gas sector, will review proposed innovative technologies to identify those with the best potential to meet methane emission reduction obligations and their applicability to specific conditions in Saskatchewan.  MAP, which is included in the province’s Prairie Resilience climate change strategy and the Saskatchewan Growth Plan, is a comprehensive approach of policies and programs aimed at reducing GHG emissions from methane venting and flaring in the upstream oil and gas sector.  The program is designed to reduce methane emissions from Saskatchewan’s upstream oil and gas industry by 40 to 45 per cent by 2025.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Ashley Schoff Energy and Resources Regina Phone: 306-787-5582 Email: ashley.schoff2@gov.sk.ca "

Total expense was $15.21 billion in 2019-20, which is $216 million or 1.4 per cent greater than budgeted.  The increase over budget was primarily due to greater-than-expected education expense related to non-cash pension expense and health expense due to volume-based pressures.  These increases were partly offset by lower-than-budgeted agricultural insurance claims due to favorable crop conditions.  Total expense in 2019-20 represents an increase of $437 million, or 3.0 per cent, compared to the previous fiscal year.  “Our government will continue to assist Saskatchewan people through the pandemic while continuing to invest to stimulate the provincial economy and create jobs,” Harpauer said.  “Every province in Canada and every jurisdiction in the world has been impacted financially and economically by the global pandemic.  However, Saskatchewan is better positioned than most on the path to economic and financial recovery.”  -30-  For more information, contact:  Jeff Welke Finance Regina Phone: 306-787-6046 Email: jeff.welke@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-536-1185              "

The extension, which was set to end on June 30, 2020, will now be extended up to January 5, 2021.  This means that any young person who “ages out of care” during this time will have greater choice in their planning for transition to independence.  “We want young people to have options available to them when planning for their transition to independence that ensure their safety and well-being during the pandemic,” Social Services Minister Paul Merriman said.  The original extension of supports was announced as part of the Social Services Pandemic Plan on March 31, 2020.  Case workers are contacting impacted youth and their caregivers to let them know about the option to extend supports and services up to January, 2021.  Youth also continue to have the option of transitioning earlier if they wish.  The Child Welfare League of Canada and several youth in care networks, including the Saskatchewan Youth in Care and Custody Network (SYICCN), have continued to call on child welfare leaders across Canada to ensure delays are not lifted at this time.  “We are pleased the Ministry of Social Services is extending the moratorium on youth aging out of care until January 5, 2021,” SYICCN Provincial Outreach Coordinator Richard Rothenburger said.  “We look forward to continued work with the Ministry of Social Services to ensure the health and wellbeing of youth in care during and after this pandemic.”  The total cost to extend services up to January 5, 2021, is anticipated to be around $1.5 million, and will increase the number of young people who will be eligible for extended supports while they plan for their transition to independence from 44 to almost 180.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Judy Orthner Social Services Regina Phone: 306-536-1993 Email: judy.orthner@gov.sk.ca "

The Interpersonal Violence Disclosure Protocol created under the Act sets out a framework and standard process for the disclosure of information.  The information can be disclosed to applicants who believe they may be at risk from an intimate partner (“right to ask”), and to persons identified by police to be at risk (“right to know”).  “We are proud to be the first jurisdiction in Canada to enact Clare’s Law legislation and look forward to other provinces doing the same,” Justice Minister and Attorney General Don Morgan said.  “If this legislation helps protect even just one person, it’s a success.”    The Ministries of Justice and Attorney General, and Corrections and Policing, worked in conjunction with the Provincial Association of Transition Houses (PATHS) and the Saskatchewan Association of Chiefs of Police (SACP) to create and approve the Interpersonal Violence and Disclosure Protocol.  “We applaud the government of Saskatchewan for being the first jurisdiction in Canada to introduce Clare’s Law,” PATHS Executive Director Jo-Anne Dusel said.  “By encouraging law enforcement agencies to share risk information with potential victims and giving an opportunity for those at risk, and, the people who care for them, to ask for information about the past history of violent behavior of a new or potential partner, Clare’s Law takes a proactive approach to preventing intimate partner violence.”  “Reducing and preventing intimate partner violence through collaborative partnerships continues to be a policing priority,” Moose Jaw Police Service Chief Rick Bourassa said.  “This legislation creates an additional framework for police services to participate in this multifaceted approach to enhancing safety for everyone in our communities.”  The Government of Saskatchewan is focused on reducing and preventing domestic violence through ongoing collaboration with provincial partners and other ministries.  In 2020-21, the Ministries of Justice and Attorney General, and Corrections and Policing, will provide more than $21.5 million in funding for prevention and intervention services, including funding domestic violence transition houses, sexual assault centres and family outreach services.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Marieka Andrew Justice Regina Phone: 306-787-5510 Email: marieka.andrew@gov.sk.ca "

In an academic paper, authored by RSM Curator of Invertebrate Zoology, Dr. Cory Sheffield and published in the Journal of Hymenoptera Research, Sheffield makes the scientific case for the insect’s uniqueness as well as the story behind naming it after a true Canadian hero.    “The RSM provides a tremendous scientific and cultural centre of learning for students and visitors of all ages,” Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Gene Makowsky said.  “This fascinating new discovery reflects the high level of scientific research at the museum which, along with world class exhibits, amazing provincial collections, and educational programming, benefit and contribute to the quality of life for the people of our province.”  In the paper, Dr. Sheffield describes how, in his ongoing work re-examining, verifying and cataloguing the hundreds of thousands of specimens in the provincial entomology collection at the RSM, that he came across a unique female bee specimen and set it aside for further examination.  On the second examination, it was clear he was looking at a new species of bee.  “After I had finished my research on the specimen and confirmed that it was indeed a new species, I thought of Colonel Hadfield, someone I have immense respect for, and asked him if he would be agreeable to having it named in his honour,” Dr. Sheffield said.  “Today, it is a privilege to name this new species Andrena hadfieldi after Canadian astronaut Colonel Chris Hadfield for his many achievements as a pilot, astronaut, author, lecturer, and science educator.”    Regular academic publishing contributes to the RSM’s status as an internationally recognized centre for research and teaching.

In November 2019, Minister Harrison went to India on a trade mission and was joined by Stephen J. Harper, CEO and Chairman of Harper and Associates.  In India, they met with senior government ministers and officials, and stressed the importance of increased trade between Saskatchewan and India, and advocated for the elimination of trade barriers.  Agriculture Minister Marit also visited India in February 2020 and gave the keynote address at the Global Pulses Conclave, noting the importance of transparent and predictable trade.  Saskatchewan exports approximately 68 per cent of the products it produces.  Total international merchandise exports in 2019 were valued at approximately $30 billion.  The province’s top exports include agricultural products, potash, oil and uranium.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Robin Speer Trade and Export Development Regina Phone: 306-519-5006 Email: Robin.Speer@gov.sk.ca "

These Made in Canada masks were given American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM International) certification earlier this month.  The Saskatchewan Research Council assisted in providing product quality assurance in an initial testing phase.  The business is currently recruiting about thirty new employees to help produce up to five million masks per month.  “Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, across Canada and around the world, we have seen several examples of critical medical supply chains for things like PPE being disrupted,” Harrison said.  “Building the capacity of our essential manufacturing infrastructure to produce more key supplies at home is good news for our economy and our health care system.”  For more information on accessing PPE in Saskatchewan, businesses can visit www.saskatchewan.ca/covid19-businesses.

There will be no further seasonal sites available in Saskatchewan Provincial Parks, however, there is no maximum stay per site, so campers can enjoy any available campsite for the duration of their choice.  Shower facilities will re-open this weekend and will operate with enhanced cleaning protocols.  Laundry facilities and shared cookhouses in day-use areas will remain closed until further notice.  Camp-Easy sites will be available for reservation starting July 9, 2020 and will open for the season on July 16, 2020.  Enhanced cleaning and disinfecting protocols are being implemented to ensure a safe experience for visitors.  In order to minimize in-park contact, campers are encouraged to continue booking online and if they haven’t already, purchase an annual park entry permit online with their booking.  An automatic check-in process was implemented in June which allows visitors who have a 2020 Annual Park Entry Permit and a reserved campsite to proceed directly to their campsite upon arrival.    Sask Parks staff continue to implement enhanced cleaning and sanitization procedures.  Signage is in place throughout the parks to remind visitors of the safety protocols and restrictions in place.  Campers are asked to bring hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes, maintain physical distance from others, respect the restrictions and rules that are in place and to stay home if not feeling well.  By working together, park staff and visitors can ensure parks remain safe spaces for all.  A reminder beaches and playgrounds are open.

Conservation Officer Cpl. Jamie Chartrand, the ministry’s K9 handler for the past 14 years, noted that the 10-year old Belgium Malinois assisted officers in hundreds of investigations.    He located countless pieces of evidence for the ministry and other law enforcement agencies which led to numerous criminal convictions, and resulted in fines totalling tens of thousands of dollars.  “One of his favorite parts of the job was tracking,” Chartrand said.  “Jaks tracked down numerous criminals during his career.  This is often the most dangerous part of the job.”  Jaks and Cpl. Chartrand have helped educate the public on the wise use of our natural resources at different community events, park presentations and school visits.  Jaks has also shown off his skills in numerous competitions.  During his years with the ministry, Jaks achieved a number of national awards in the Canadian Police Canine Championships in Alberta, including fourth and second place finishes in the prestigious top dog category.    Although Jaks has retired, he is still eager to go to work each day and has been adopted by Officer Chartrand.  In mid-May, the ministry’s K9 unit welcomed a young female German Shepherd service dog named Tai into the fold.  Tai has completed her training and will definitely have some pretty big paws to fill.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Jamie Gibson Environment Regina Phone: 306-519-9290 Email: jamie.gibson@gov.sk.ca "

Dry conditions and cool temperatures have slowed hay and pasture growth, specifically in the southern and east-central regions.  Most of the province received at least a small amount of rainfall this week.  The Gouldtown area in the southwest region received the highest amount of rainfall with 73.5 mm.  Most farmers would welcome more rain, but some that received high amounts of rainfall over the past few weeks have indicated that some fields are saturated and that wet fields have delayed spraying.  Provincially, moisture levels on crop land remain at the same level.  Hay and pasture land moisture levels have reduced slightly, particularly in areas that received less rainfall this week.  Cropland topsoil moisture is rated as two per cent surplus, 69 per cent adequate, 22 per cent short and seven per cent very short.  Hay and pasture land topsoil moisture is rated as two per cent surplus, 55 per cent adequate, 26 per cent short and 17 per cent very short.    Areas that received more rainfall in the past few weeks have reported that crop and pasture development has improved.  Warm temperatures have also helped with crop development.  Farmers in the east-central and southern regions report that lack of rainfall in some areas has reduced hay and pasture growth and will delay the timing or reduce the amount of hay for the first cut.  Crop development is around the normal development stage for this time of year for most crops.  More of the oilseed crops are considered behind normal.  Provincially, 68 per cent of fall cereals, 69 per cent of spring cereals, 60 per cent of oilseed crops and 74 per cent of pulse crops are at their normal stages of development for this time of year.  Dry topsoil moisture conditions have resulted in delayed emergence and development of later and smaller seeded crops.  Flea beetle damage was reported in most regions of the province which has affected canola development for some.  Farmers have been busy spraying, branding and vaccinating cattle, and rolling and hauling grain.  There have been isolated reports of reseeding due to damage from wind, dry conditions, insect pests and hail.

The scholarships, redeemable for $1,000 each, are issued within two years of graduation only once recipients demonstrate they are actively pursuing a career in the skilled trades – either by registering as an apprentice and completing Level 1 technical training or by completing a pre-employment course in a trade designated in Saskatchewan.  “The skilled trades are essential to our province’s economic growth,” Immigration and Career Training Minister Jeremy Harrison said.  “The Government of Saskatchewan recognizes how important it is to build a diverse skilled trades workforce, one that is responsive to industry’s needs.  Congratulations to the scholarship winners.  We wish you all the best as you embark on your career paths.”    Every year, educators who oversee SYA in their schools are invited to nominate at least one graduating student for the SYA Industry Scholarship.  The SATCC also seeks nominations from the Regina District Industry Education Council, the Regina Trades and Skills Centre and the Saskatoon Industry-Education Council.  Tiara Thiessen is one of the 2019-20 SYA Industry Scholarship winners.  She is graduating from Kerrobert Composite School and is interested in pursuing a career as a welder or metal fabricator (fitter).  “I have always been a dreamer,” Thiessen said.  “As I enter the next chapter of my life, I rest assured that I am prepared to follow my dreams.  The SYA program not only granted me the funds to start my career, but the essential knowledge on becoming a journeyperson as well.  I am very thankful that I was introduced to this amazing learning opportunity that is helping me turn my dreams into reality.”  Scholarship recipients must finish the SYA program, which exposes students to opportunities in the skilled trades.  Students complete 12 activities, including interviewing a journeyperson, researching and writing a report on a designated trade and completing the Young Worker Readiness Certificate Course.  Students who complete SYA and register as apprentices in Saskatchewan within five years of graduation receive valuable benefits.  Their apprenticeship registration fee is waived; Level 1 technical training tuition is waived; and they receive 300 trade time hours.    The scholarship program, launched in 2009 and overseen by the SATCC, relies on the continued investment of industry sponsors.  To date, 59 sponsors have invested almost $750,000 in the fund.  The Government of Saskatchewan has also invested through the Saskatchewan Innovation and Opportunities Scholarship, bringing total contributions to nearly $1.28 million.  “The Commission Board of Directors is proud of industry’s significant investment in the SYA Industry Scholarship fund,” SATCC Board Chair Drew Tiefenbach said.  “Their contributions ensure we can continue to encourage students to pursue apprenticeships and careers in the skilled trades.  We appreciate their generosity and support.”  Currently, more than 300 schools and more than 4,000 students are registered in the SYA program.  Participation continues to grow.  Student enrollment in 2019-20 increased by 26 per cent over 2018-19.

Alberta is now the second province to enact these changes, following Saskatchewan as the first province in Canada to make these changes in February of this year.  Amendments were made to the Regulations for The Change of Name Act, 1995 to introduce criminal record checks as part of the change of name application process for anyone 18 years of age or older.  “These changes were absolutely the right thing to do, and we’re glad to see Alberta following suit,” Justice Minister and Attorney General Don Morgan said.  “We urge other provinces to join Saskatchewan and Alberta to enact similar changes that protect children and other vulnerable individuals from sex offenders trying to avoid scrutiny by changing their name.”  While these changes prevent sex offenders from changing their name in Saskatchewan and now Alberta, they don’t prevent someone from moving to another jurisdiction and changing their name, or changing their name in another jurisdiction and moving to Saskatchewan or Alberta.  “Protecting our loved ones requires a joint effort between law enforcement and human services professionals,” Health Minister Jim Reiter said.  “We are hopeful that our colleagues across Canada will join us in this important endeavor.”  Under the Regulation changes implemented in Saskatchewan in February, more than 20 different offences prohibit someone from changing their name in Saskatchewan, including sexual assault and incest.  The designated offences are set out in subsection 490.011(1) of the Criminal Code, and are the same offences that would require registration in the National Sex Offender Registry.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Noel Busse Justice Regina Phone: 306-787-8959 Email: noel.busse@gov.sk.ca "

Last Fall, Premier Moe led a MOU on small modular reactors with the Premiers of Ontario and New Brunswick to cooperate in deploying this new technology across the country.  Broader collaboration with the Government of Saskatchewan will facilitate opportunities within the province for financing, regulation, labour capacity, public engagement and economic growth.  “Clean nuclear energy will provide Saskatchewan the tools to fight climate change,” Duncan said.  “The advancement of small modular reactors in Canada brings economic and environmental benefits with new clean technology that is also safe, reliable and competitively priced power.”  Small modular reactors are nuclear power reactors that can produce electricity in the range of 50 to 300 megawatts, as compared to current nuclear power plants that range between 600 and 1,600 megawatts.  Small modular reactors are low emitting technology that can provide baseload power within an electrical grid.  As utilities across Canada, including provinces and territories, explore pathways in the federal government’s Small Modular Reactor Roadmap, the Government of Saskatchewan will be ready to continue to support the economic and environmental benefits this new clean technology will bring.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Matthew Glover Executive Council Regina Phone: 306-787-2127 Email: matthew.glover@gov.sk.ca "

Government has consulted with Saskatchewan’s municipal police services and the Provincial Association of Transition Houses to provide the necessary training for police to process Clare’s Law applications in accordance with the legislation.  Any information that is released to applicants is subject to a stringent review process to ensure that the disclosure of information does not violate privacy legislation.

Psychoeducational assessments are performed by the SATCC’s registered psychologist to determine whether an apprentice has a disability requiring accommodations during apprenticeship technical training or examinations.  Like with exams, assessments will occur at third-party locations to ensure there is enough room for appropriate physical distancing.  The next steps include resuming face-to-face counter services for clients later in the summer and technical training in the fall.  The SATCC is currently working with its training providers – including its largest provider, Saskatchewan Polytechnic – to determine the delivery approach for each trade.  In many cases, training will be delivered using a hybrid training model, a combination of online and in-person learning.  Apprentices will complete the theoretical portions of their training online and the hands-on, practical components on campus in a shop setting.  “Our top priority is safety for our employees and clients,” SATCC CEO Jeff Ritter said.  “That’s why we’re re-starting services slowly and ensuring we’re closely following the direction of public health officials.”  In the meantime, SATCC offices remain closed to the public.  However, staff members continue to serve clients remotely via telephone at 1-877-363-0536 and email at apprenticeship@gov.sk.ca.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Chelsea Coupal Saskatchewan Apprenticeship and Trade Certification Commission Regina Phone: 306-787-0187 Email: chelsea.coupal@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-537-4692              "

The Government of Saskatchewan has partnered with Bridge2Food on this event to highlight opportunities in Saskatchewan in value-added agriculture, and to help advance economic growth in the province by attracting investment and increasing trade.  Protein Industries Canada is headquartered in Saskatchewan, and was established to position Canada as a leading global source of sustainable, high-quality plant protein and plant-based products, while substantially contributing to Canada’s economic growth and international trade.

194,2020-06-19,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/june/19/2020-resilience-report,Government Website,2020 Resilience Report Demonstrates Improved Readiness For Climate Change," Released on June 19, 2020 The Government of Saskatchewan released its second annual climate resilience report today, with a suite of measures that demonstrate how resilient the province is to a changing climate.  The report covers five key areas: natural systems, physical infrastructure, economic sustainability, community preparedness and human well-being.  The Climate Resilience Measurement Framework, released in November 2018, is a commitment in the province’s Prairie Resilience climate change strategy.  The ﬁrst resilience report was released in April 2019, presenting baselines and targets for 25 important measures.  The 2020 report continues with reporting on status and trends for each measure.  “The Climate Resilience Measurement Framework and subsequent annual reports align well with Saskatchewan's new 10-year Growth Plan,” Environment Minister Dustin Duncan said.  “These key measures demonstrate our focus on maintaining and enhancing a healthy environment that will support Saskatchewan people, communities and industry for years to come.”  Resilience measures are assessed to be either good, fair or poor.  Eighteen measures in this year’s report are classified as good, an increase from 15 in the 2019 report.  Six are classified as fair, and there are once again no measures with a poor status.  Most measures under economic sustainability, community preparedness and human well-being were deemed to be good.  For instance:  In 2019, Saskatchewan continued to increase its fuel management work on Crown land, thinning the forest around urban areas to help reduce the risk of wildﬁre to northern communities. Saskatchewan added approximately 700,000 hectares of protected areas in 2019, increasing its total to 6.4 million hectares.  This covers 10 per cent of the province's total land base and includes representation from each of the province's 11 ecoregions. Since 2019, all forest harvest designs must incorporate natural disturbance patterns (e.g. wind, wildfire, insects etc.), which is critical to maintain resilient and biologically diverse forests. An additional 81 culverts were upgraded or replaced over the past two years to meet the new provincial flood standard.  This helps ensure the province's transportation network is more resilient to extreme weather events.  Six measures in the report are classified as fair, providing opportunities to reinforce the province's resilience to climate change.  This includes planned investments by SaskPower, which will further its renewable energy generation capacity and operational eﬃciency, contributing to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions through 2030.  “We continue to see positive trends in many of the resilience measures,” Duncan said.  “Annual reporting helps us better understand Saskatchewan's incremental resilience to climate change, and identifies where we may need to better prepare the province for a changing climate.”  The province’s 2020 Climate Resilience Measurement Framework report and full Prairie Resilience climate change strategy are available at www.saskatchewan.ca/climate-change.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Mike King Environment Regina Phone: 306-527-5963 Email: mike.king3@gov.sk.ca "

The project will be delivered through the utilization of CareerLabsVR, a virtual reality platform that will provide job seekers with an innovative opportunity to explore, learn and discover career options.  The implementation of this tool allows participants to fully immerse themselves in an in demand career experience before fully investing themselves in upskilling or further training.  Employers will also benefit from the VR technology, partnering with Regina Work Preparation Centre to create recruitment and marketing opportunities that will assist them in preparing for anticipated labour needs in the coming years.    “The Government of Saskatchewan is proud to offer innovative career training techniques that allow job seekers the opportunity to participate in Saskatchewan’s workforce,” Immigration and Career Training Minister Jeremy Harrison said.  “Innovative initiatives are important as the province works toward economic recovery, getting our citizens back to work and supporting our province’s emerging labour market needs post COVID-19.”  A total of 80 participants will actively use the technology, while another potential 80 participants will have exposure to the technology through a presentation and/or observing other participants using it.  Further to the job seekers, 100 career development professionals and service providers will have exposure to the technology through presentation, observation or use of the tool themselves.  “Work Prep is excited to partner with the Government of Saskatchewan on this innovative initiative that will support a strong economy in Saskatchewan by providing interested job seekers with exposure to in demand careers today, and in the future,” Regina Work Preparation Centre Executive Director Ashley Boha said.  “This virtual reality technology will support job seekers by providing tailored information on in demand careers, fully immersing them in, with the ability to see, hear and experience the career without ever leaving the office.”  The Regina Work Preparation Centre is a non-profit, charitable, community-based organization that has served the Regina community for 45 years.  Throughout their history, Work Prep has assisted more than 20,000 individuals in their journey to employment.  Using innovative employment services that align with labour market needs, Work Prep also partners with employers to identify job seekers that match their required qualifications and provides ongoing connection and support for employers and employees to ensure success.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Kristin Kutarna-Gates Immigration and Career Training Regina Phone: 306-787-8360 Email: kristin.kutarnagates@gov.sk.ca "

The guidelines have been developed to support Saskatchewan’s education sector in planning for student and staff safety as the delivery of in-classroom learning resumes this September.  The school year is set to start as early as September 1, based on local school division calendars.  “As we return to normal activities within our daily lives, we want to ensure that our school communities have time to prepare for new health and safety requirements,” Deputy Premier and Education Minister Gordon Wyant said.  “These guidelines reinforce minimizing physical contact while maintaining a school atmosphere that’s as normal and comfortable as possible.”  The Educational Institution Guidelines were developed under the direction of Saskatchewan’s Chief Medical Health Officer, and with the help of the Response Planning Team.   These guidelines will ensure that operators of provincial Prekindergarten to Grade 12 schools can plan for school to resume as previously scheduled this fall. Parents and caregivers have been asked to monitor their children for any signs or symptoms of illness.  COVID-19 infections in children tend to be mild and similar to other viral respiratory infections.  If any symptoms are present, both students and school staff remain home.  Schools have been asked to increase sanitation measures and continue to promote proper hygiene practices.  This includes the availability of hand sanitizer wherever possible, establishing clear protocols for bringing supplementary school materials such as backpacks and school supplies in and out of schools, and planning for minimized contact among students and staff as much as possible.  As this is a highly evolving situation, the guidelines may be updated and adjusted depending on the impact of COVID-19 and the feedback of education partners in our province prior to the beginning of the school year.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Chris Hodges Education Regina Phone: 306-787-1069 Email: chris.hodges@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-533-7506              "

A seal coat is the packing of oil and crushed rock into the pavement.  This forms a protective layer, providing a waterproof, non-skid surface which reduces deterioration and cracking.  Seal coats require about 24 hours to cure, resulting in speed reductions.  These speed reductions allow the seal coat to cure properly, while also saving windshields from damage.  There are a variety of reasons work zones have temporary speed reductions left in place when workers are not present.  Sharp pavement drop-offs, lane closures and loose gravel are examples of hazards that drivers may encounter that warrant a slower posted speed.  A weekly construction update provides Saskatchewan residents with the latest details on projects underway to help plan safe and efficient travel throughout the summer and fall.  Additional travel information about emergency road closures, the status of ferries, barges and other road activities can also be found on the Highway Hotline at www.saskatchewan.ca/Highwayhotline.   Information and concerns about a provincial highway can be made by calling 1-844-SK-HIWAY.  The Government of Saskatchewan has invested more than $9.8 billion in highways infrastructure since 2008, improving more than 15,800 km of Saskatchewan highways.  Another $300 million in highways stimulus funds will be invested over the next two years to support Saskatchewan’s economic recovery.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Steve Shaheen Highways and Infrastructure Regina Phone: 306-933-5641 Email: steve.shaheen@gov.sk.ca    "

The rain received in most areas was welcome, but more is needed in some areas.  While winds delayed spraying for many, producers made progress spraying for weeds and insects when it was calm and as crop stages allowed.    Most regions of the province received rainfall this week.  Many producers, especially in the southern and central regions, would welcome more rain.  However, there were also reports of localized flooding in areas that received a significant amount of rain in a short time.  Areas around Humboldt received the highest amount of rain this week with 71 mm.  Provincially, topsoil moisture conditions remain at approximately the same level as the previous week.  Cropland topsoil moisture is rated as two per cent surplus, 70 per cent adequate, 25 per cent short and three per cent very short.  Hay and pasture land topsoil moisture is rated as two per cent surplus, 58 per cent adequate, 32 per cent short and eight per cent very short.  Provincially, 79 per cent of fall cereals, 70 per cent of spring cereals, 63 per cent of oilseed crops and 80 per cent of pulse crops are at normal development for this time of year.  The majority of crop conditions across the province range from fair to good.  With the recent rains, farmers are hopeful that conditions will improve.  Generally, emergence of earlier-seeded crops is good, but lack of moisture, wind and reduced germination of canola has resulted in spotty emergence in some fields.    The majority of crop damage this week was due to strong winds, cutworms and flea beetles.  Certain parts of the province that did not receive much rain last week reported damage from dry soil conditions.  Cold temperatures throughout the province also resulted in damage from frost and hail in some areas.  Reseeding from dry conditions and insect damage, specifically in canola fields, has been reported and some farmers are seeding green feed.

203,2020-06-17,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/june/17/improving-police-oversight,Government Website,Province Introduces First Steps To Improve Police Oversight," Released on June 17, 2020 Government has introduced The Police Amendment Act, 2020 today as an initial step to improving police oversight in Saskatchewan.  The Act contains numerous enhancements to the Investigation Observer process to make it more transparent and accountable.  Under the current legislation, an Investigation Observer is appointed by the Deputy Minister of Justice in situations where someone has suffered a serious injury or death in the custody of or as a result of the actions of a police officer.  The new legislation transfers responsibility for this process to the Public Complaints Commission (PCC) and requires the chair of the PCC to publish online summaries of the results of Investigation Observer reports.  In support of this, $350,000 has been allocated in the 2020-21 provincial budget to hire more staff to manage the increased workload that is anticipated as a result of the additional responsibilities being granted to the PCC.  “Through this Act we will be making numerous enhancements to improve transparency and accountability in our provincial police oversight processes,” Justice Minister and Attorney General Don Morgan said.  “We will continue work with our partners to evaluate what our next steps will be in our ongoing efforts to improve police oversight in Saskatchewan.”  The legislation also expands the role of Investigation Observers to include investigations of sexual assaults and off-duty incidents involving police officers, requires the appointment of a second Investigation observer of First Nations or Métis ancestry in incidents involving First Nations or Métis individuals, and allows individuals other than current or retired police officers to be appointed as Investigation Observers.  “This expansion to the jurisdiction and responsibility of the Public Complaints Commission represents the most significant changes we have made to independent police oversight in this province since the commission was first established in 2006,” Corrections and Policing Minister Christine Tell said.  “As a government, we will continue to work with our partners in policing and the larger community to ensure that police oversight in Saskatchewan is transparent and accountable to the public.”  The proposed changes will also implement a new process within the PCC to address complaints of workplace harassment made by police officers and civilian staff of police services.  This will establish the PCC as a neutral, third-party that can receive and investigate internal complaints of sexual and workplace harassment.  Saskatchewan is the first jurisdiction in Canada to implement a complaints process that address sexual and workplace harassment within police forces.  Other changes made to police oversight under the legislation include:  implementing a new process within the PCC to address complaints against specific classes of special constables, such as Conservation Officers and Highway Traffic Officers working as part of the provincial Protection and Response Team; requiring police services to ask another police organization to investigate serious injuries, deaths or sexual assaults that occur in police custody or as a result of the actions of a police officer; and updating the Lieutenant Governor in Council’s authority to make regulations respecting special constables.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Noel Busse Justice/Corrections and Policing Regina Phone: 306-787-8959 Email: noel.busse@gov.sk.ca "

Re-Open Saskatchewan Plan  The guidelines for weddings and funerals in the Re-Open Saskatchewan plan apply to services taking place in places of worship, as well as services taking place in locations outside of places of worship.  These services, as well as outdoor graduations, must incorporate the following public health measures:  To safely support larger groupings of individuals – and where seating area allows adequate physical distancing – multiple groups of 30 are permitted up to a maximum of 150 people. Within each group of 30, individuals must be separated by two metres, unless they are part of the same family. Other groups of 30 must be arranged in the same way, and be spaced from other groups by a minimum of five metres. For indoor religious or non-religious ceremonies, weddings or funerals, the total number of people participating in services cannot exceed 30 per cent of seating capacity or 150 people, whichever is less. No food or drink service is allowed at any of the above gatherings – indoors or outdoors.  Physical Distancing  Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Saqib Shahab is reminding Saskatchewan residents that physical distancing measures must be followed to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, even as indoor gathering sizes increase.  Effective Monday, June 22, indoor gatherings of up to 30 are only permitted where space allows for two metres of physical distancing between participants.  “You need to have enough space to have 30 people,” Dr. Shahab said.  “If you don’t have enough space for 30, invite less people.”  In general, it is better to meet less frequently, meet outdoors and meet in as small a group as possible.  Stay home if you are sick.  COVID-19 Testing  Testing for COVID-19 is available to anyone currently working outside the home or anyone returning to work as part of the Re-Open Saskatchewan plan. Testing is also available to:  Those being admitted to acute care for more than 24 hours, including expectant mothers. Immunocompromised individuals and their health care providers.  If you are experiencing symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath, headaches, aches and pains, sore throat, chills, runny nose or a loss of your sense of taste or smell, contact HealthLine 811 or your family physician for advice on whether you should be tested for COVID-19.  You can also take the online self-assessment at www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19.

The TMEI program was launched in October, 2018, to encourage drilling activity in support of exploration for base metals, precious metals and diamonds in a targeted area in the northeastern part of the province.  TMEI is part of the Government of Saskatchewan’s Mineral Development Strategy, which was designed to diversify the province’s mineral sector.  A total of five companies, exploring for gold, zinc, copper and silver, completed drill programs under the TMEI program in 2019-20.  Each received $50,000 in funding, for a total of $250,000.    “The TMEI program has enhanced the competitiveness and diversification of Saskatchewan’s northern mining prospects,” Energy and Resources Minister Bronwyn Eyre said.  “We are pleased that exploration companies are taking advantage of the program and discovering the value of mineral resource opportunities here.”  In addition to the TMEI, the province also recently reinstated a Provincial Sales Tax (PST) exemption for exploratory downhole drilling activity, as well as extended timeframes to raise necessary capital and carry out mineral exploration activities, work programs and community consultations.  “The TMEI offered by the Government of Saskatchewan enabled our company to complete an 11 hole drill program at our Brabant Lake project, where we are exploring for copper and zinc with minor silver, gold and lead,” Murchison Minerals President J.C. Potvin said.  “This incentive program is a perfect case highlighting the economic multiplier effect it has in job creation and enabling industry participants to push the envelope and be more aggressive on field exploration activities when weak financial market conditions make it harder to raise funding.  This shows investors that Saskatchewan supports mining as an industry.”  In 2019, exploration expenditures in the province were $264 million, and the Saskatchewan mining sector generated $7.4 billion in sales.  Over the past decade, more than $2.3 billion has been spent on mineral exploration in Saskatchewan, and $72.3 billion has been generated.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Ashley Schoff Energy and Resources Regina Phone: 306-787-5582 Email: ashley.schoff2@gov.sk.ca "

The remand centre is part of the Ministry of Corrections and Policing’s commitment to keeping the people of the province safe and reducing crime in Saskatchewan communities.  “This expansion represents a significant step forward in our ability to provide a safe environment for remanded individuals,” Corrections and Policing Minister Christine Tell said.  “Combined with our existing remand strategies and programming, it will provide more space to successfully manage the population of offenders and accused in our correctional system.”  A major focus of the expansion will be to ensure that high-risk accused, such as rival gang members, can be securely kept in custody and segregated from each other if necessary to ensure the safety of staff, other offenders and the public.  Design on the expansion will commence this summer, with construction set to begin in 2021.  Government estimates that the expansion will result in over 130 additional full-time positions at the Saskatoon Correctional Centre, as well as approximately 600 temporary full-time jobs over the course of construction.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Noel Busse Corrections and Policing Regina Phone: 306-787-8959 Email: noel.busse@gov.sk.ca "

The amendments were made to The Miscellaneous Municipal Statutes Amendment Act, 2019, which was originally introduced in the fall of 2019.  Other amendments include clarifying municipal responsibilities when posting public notices.  Municipalities will continue to be required to publish the following items within their local or regional newspaper:  Restructuring notices; Local status and boundary changes; Completion of assessment rolls as well as assessment notices; and The last day for assessment appeals.

These projects are part of the Government of Saskatchewan’s $7.5 billion two-year capital to plan to build a strong Saskatchewan and stimulate Saskatchewan’s economic recovery.  Under the two-year capital to plan to build a strong Saskatchewan, $200 million was designated for health infrastructure including major projects and maintenance funding.  “Our government is taking action to meet the need for long-term care services in rural and northern areas,” Rural and Remote Health Minister Warren Kaeding said.  “We kept our promise to build 13 new long-term care facilities across the province, with the final facility now under construction in Meadow Lake.  These new investments reaffirm our commitment to Saskatchewan seniors.”  Funding of $18.7 million was provided in the 2020-21 Budget to advance planning for large capital projects across the health system, and the provincial government has given approval to proceed with advanced planning and design on both new long-term care facilities.  This includes proceeding with replacement of Grenfell Pioneer Home, with a decision on the procurement process expected this summer.  A replacement of La Ronge’s current facility will mean a significant expansion in capacity and service in the region.  These new investments are in addition to the $15.7 million provided in the 2020-21 Budget to continue the construction of a new 72-bed long-term care facility in Meadow Lake.  Of the $7.2 million designated to the 82 priority renewal projects in 51 long-term care facilities across the province, improvements will include: flooring and window replacements, heating and air conditioning upgrades, and water and sewer line replacement.

Nearly $1.4 million will be allocated to establish a new specialized crystal methamphetamine inpatient treatment centre in Estevan to treat individuals from across the province seeking recovery.  The new provincial centre will include the development of innovative protocols in medication use to support crystal meth treatment, wrap around services available in Estevan and post‐inpatient supports throughout the province.  The provincial centre will use a unique partnership model that will bring specialized training to the province.  The centre will include 15 beds for people recovering from crystal meth use and five beds for other addictions treatment needs.  An additional $150,000 is being invested to establish four pre‐treatment beds and six post treatment beds in Estevan.  Treating crystal meth use will be a strong focus, but individuals may receive treatment for addictions to other substances as well.  As the treatment needs are unique to those with issues related to crystal meth, this provincial centre will offer flexibility in lengths of stay beyond the traditional 28-day treatment model.  “This treatment centre is important to the community of Estevan and to all of Saskatchewan,” St. Joseph’s Hospital Executive Director Greg Hoffort said.  “We are excited to work with the Ministry of Health and Saskatchewan Health Authority to develop an innovative site for the effective treatment of crystal methamphetamine addiction and to provide quality care to people in need.”  More than $1.7 million will cover costs associated with 28 new detox beds in Regina, Saskatoon, Moose Jaw, Prince Albert, North Battleford and other potential locations.  More than $800,000 will fund the hiring of dedicated addiction workers to better resource emergency departments in Regina, Saskatoon and Prince Albert.  These addictions counsellors will provide support to patients coming in to emergency with addictions issues, to ensure addictions supports are available in real time that will assist patients to navigate to other supports in a smoother transition.  More than $680,000 will fund medical supports in detox to support patients experiencing the crystal meth detox process, such as hiring registered nurses, licensed practical nurses and paramedics, to increase availability of medication and medical treatment.  A further $400,000 will establish a fourth provincial Rapid Access to Addiction Medicine clinic (RAAM), this one based in North Battleford.  RAAM clinics provide immediate access to addictions treatment by multi-disciplinary teams in order to reduce emergency department visits, shorten wait times and improve outcomes for patients.  More than $630,000 in new harm reduction investments will be included in the 2020-21 Budget.  Of this, $130,000 will support additional caseworkers for AIDS Saskatoon and $500,000 will be directed to other harm reduction efforts across the province.  This funding will support the purchase of more Naloxone kits, needle exchange, safer inhalation supplies, as well as expanded harm reduction services.  Funding of $6.2 million will improve mental health services by dedicating:  $3.0 million to fund ongoing efforts to create new residential support beds for individuals with intensive mental health needs transitioning from a hospital setting back into the community, freeing up hospital space for incoming patients; More than $1.3 million to develop intensive supports for children and youth with complex mental health needs; $1.25 million in one-time funding to support suicide prevention, including improved use and monitoring of suicide protocols, and enhancing research, data and surveillance; $437,000 in one-time funding to pilot the integration of nurses working with RCMP members to support mental health needs in rural areas; and $200,000 to sustain the development of a mental health program for Emergency Medical Services workers in the province.

These investments support the recommendations in Saskatchewan’s Mental Health and Addictions Action Plan, which guides and sets priorities for mental health and addictions.  The $12 million in new funding includes approximately $4.75 million from the Canada-Saskatchewan Bilateral Funding Agreement.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Colleen Book Health Regina Phone: 306-787-4083 Email: media@health.gov.sk.ca "
212,2020-06-15,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/june/15/budget-ted,Government Website,Building A Strong Economy Through Trade And Investment," Released on June 15, 2020                  The 2020-21 Provincial Budget provides funding to increase trade, attract investment and improve competitiveness to recover from the impacts of COVID-19 and build a strong Saskatchewan economy.  The Ministry of Trade and Export Development (TED) Budget includes $4.2 million in new funding to increase international engagement, including support for three new international trade and investment offices.  The three new international offices will be located in Japan, India and Singapore.  The international offices will play a significant role in achieving the goals set out in Saskatchewan’s Growth Plan to increase the value of exports by 50 per cent and grow private capital investment to $16 billion annually by 2030.  The new funding will allow the province to have an office presence and staff on the ground in key international markets.  Officials in these offices will focus on diversifying markets, connecting Saskatchewan businesses with investors and customers and establishing ongoing relationships.  “In 2019, Saskatchewan companies significantly increased exports to markets like Bangladesh, India, the United Arab Emirates, Brazil and the European Union through increased engagement with our trading partners around the world,” Trade and Export Development Minister Jeremy Harrison said.  “Continuing to strengthen our presence internationally will be critical to our economic recovery and to meeting the aggressive trade and investment goals we have set in Saskatchewan’s Growth Plan.”  The TED Budget also includes $1.5 million to advance pipeline projects that will increase market access for Saskatchewan’s energy products.  The Pipeline Projects Assessment Committee will administer the funding. Budget 2020-21 also fulfills the Growth Plan commitment to create a new Saskatchewan Chemical Fertilizer Incentive (SCFI).  This program will encourage investment by providing a 15 per cent tax credit for new investment that will grow the sector.  The provincial government is also extending the Manufacturing and Processing (M&P) Exporter Tax Incentive.  The incentive is available to companies involved in manufacturing, processing or the creative industry and generate a minimum of at least 25 per cent of revenues through exports.  The program provides tax rebates for companies to hire incremental employees or additional head office employees.  The program previously ended on December 31, 2019, and the extension will run to December 31, 2022.  In addition to the M&P Exporter Program and the new SCFI, 2020-21 Budget maintains the incentives that have been critical to Saskatchewan’s successful approach to economic growth, including the Saskatchewan Value-added Agriculture Incentive, the Saskatchewan Commercial Innovation Incentive (Patent Box Program) and the Saskatchewan Technology Startup Incentive.  A strong economy requires building a strong labour force.  That is why, through the Immigration and Career Training (ICT) Budget, the provincial government continues to support programs and services to help employers develop, recruit and retain workers and to help individuals prepare for, obtain and maintain employment.  This includes apprenticeship training, the Canada-Saskatchewan Job Grant, support programs for newcomers, Adult Basic Education, Employability Assistance for Persons with Disabilities and the Provincial Training Allowance.  The ICT Budget also includes $578,000 for Foreign Qualification Recognition (FQR), an increase of $325,000 (129 per cent).  Additional funding was secured through the Government of Canada's Foreign Credential Recognition program and will enable more opportunities for internationally trained professionals to gain Canadian work experience.  The FQR budget will build stronger career pathways for internationally trained professionals in Saskatchewan.  In addition, the Workforce Development budget of $20.8 million, an increase of $1.3 million, will support a variety of programs and services for individuals to address barriers to employment and successfully develop a career in Saskatchewan.  These programs and services include vocational assessments, career counselling, job readiness supports, academic upgrading, basic skills training, job coaching and other individualized employment related supports.  Through these programs, the 2020-21 Budget will help to achieve the goals in Saskatchewan’s Growth Plan to increase the population to 1.4 million people and create 100,000 new jobs by 2030.  It also supports the actions in the Growth Plan to develop Saskatchewan’s labour force and grow the population by keeping more young people in Saskatchewan and increasing immigration to the province.  “We have seen the resilience of Saskatchewan people and businesses throughout the unprecedented challenges over the past few months and the economic indicators, such as exports and job numbers, show that Saskatchewan is in a stronger position than many other jurisdictions to recover from this pandemic,” Harrison said.  “This budget will build on that momentum to build a stronger workforce, a stronger business environment and a stronger Saskatchewan.”  -30-  For more information, contact:  Tyler Lynch Trade and Export Development Regina Phone: 306-787-7967 Email: tyler.lynch2@gov.sk.ca "
213,2020-06-15,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/june/15/budget-innovation-saskatchewan,Government Website,Province Increases Investments In Saskatchewan Technology," Released on June 15, 2020 The Government of Saskatchewan is boosting financial support to the province’s tech sector in the 2020-21 Budget, including $400,000 to the Saskatoon lab working on a vaccine for COVID-19.  Innovation Saskatchewan will provide new funding to the Vaccine and Infectious Diseases Organization (VIDO) toward construction of a vaccine manufacturing facility.  This funding is in addition to the $3.8 million provided in 2019-20 to support the organization’s work in finding a vaccine for COVID-19.  “The Vaccine Manufacturing Facility will be the first of its kind in Canada,” Minister Responsible for Innovation Saskatchewan Tina Beaudry-Mellor says.  “It will accelerate the development and commercialization of new vaccines, consistent with VIDO’s role in National Emergency Response, and underpin Saskatchewan’s role in the global effort to control the coronavirus.”    New investments in the provincial tech sector also include:  $1.0 million for an agricultural technology program to drive investment into local early-stage ag-tech innovations and attract international ag-tech companies to the province; and $125,000 in additional funding for Saskatoon-based tech business incubator Co.Labs, to help expand programming and scale-up support for all technology start-ups (Co-Lead).  The changes will support growing numbers of manufacturers and tech start-ups in Saskatchewan, involved in game-changing technologies in agriculture, healthcare, education, energy, mining and manufacturing.  A study released in May shows Saskatchewan’s tech sector contributes nearly $5 billion each year to the province’s economy.  The goal in the Saskatchewan Growth Plan is to triple the sector by 2030.  “Saskatchewan’s tech sector has seen significant investment in the last three years with more than $114 million of private sector funds deployed in 2019 alone – more than the previous five years combined,” Beaudry-Mellor says.  “Building on those companies’ efforts, we believe we have an opportunity to lead the country in new and innovative technologies in many sectors and specifically in agriculture.”  Program details for the new agricultural technology fund will be released this summer.  The Co.Labs investment builds on current success.  Since launching in 2017, Co.Labs has worked with 100 companies, attracted more than $8.0 million in private equity investments and created more than 170 jobs.  Meantime, VIDO announced promising results in late May and moved another step closer to human clinical trials for a COVID-19 vaccine, with funding support from the Government of Saskatchewan and Government of Canada.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Scott Brown Innovation Saskatchewan Regina Phone: 306-787-0355 Email: scott.brown@gov.sk.ca "

The province’s 2020-21 Budget provides $85.223 million in funding to the SPSA to provide and support public safety services for Saskatchewan people, municipalities and service providers.  Specifically, this investment will allow the SPSA to continue:  Wildfire mitigation work through the federal Disaster Mitigation Adaptation Fund program that will reduce the impact of wildfires in northern communities; Upgrades and maintenance on its aerial fleet; Training municipal fire departments and other first responders; and Supporting municipalities with emergency preparedness planning.  “Our government is committed to building a strong Saskatchewan through strategic investments that protect the people, property and resources of Saskatchewan,” Government Relations Minister Lori Carr said.  “The Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency will continue to support a stronger Saskatchewan through improved service delivery to better support communities in an emergency.”  The funding also includes $9.2 million for the purchase of a CL215T air tanker, which is expected to be delivered in 2023.  The government’s integrated approach to public safety ensures that Saskatchewan can address any emergency that arises, which was highlighted by the role that the agency’s Provincial Emergency Operations Centre played in coordinating the provincial non-health response to COVID-19.  As the agency monitored the situation and disseminated intelligence to other ministries, agencies and Crown corporations, it assisted with provincial business continuity planning, established checkpoints to aid in education and enforcement of health order restrictions, and it established a toll-free information line for Saskatchewan residents.  Established as a Treasury Board Crown, the SPSA began its first year of operation in 2019 by transferring staff, operations and capital for wildfire management from the Ministry of Environment as well as emergency management and fire safety from the Ministry of Government Relations.  To learn more about the Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency please visit https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/government-structure/crown-corporations/saskatchewan-public-safety-agency.   -30-  For more information, contact:  Christopher Clemett Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency Regina Phone: 306-787-5395 Email: christopher.clemett@gov.sk.ca "

The 2020-21 Ministry of Health budget is $5.8 billion, an increase of $255 million or 4.6 per cent from 2019-20, and represents the highest investment ever.   “Our government will continue to make health care a priority for Saskatchewan people during these unprecedented times,” Health Minister Jim Reiter said.  “Our health care system will continue to respond to COVID-19 while at the same time strengthening mental health supports and services, addressing surgical wait times, focusing on women and children’s health, and investing in key capital and equipment.”  Health has committed $118 million specifically related to the COVID-19 response, on hospital equipment, testing equipment, personal protective equipment and operating costs.  “Today’s budget also contains a $200 million health and safety contingency that is available, if necessary, to address any COVID-related costs that can’t be covered within the existing Health budget,” Reiter said.  The Ministry of Health is investing $435 million for mental health and addictions supports and services, the highest budget in history.  This funding includes the establishment of a specialized crystal methamphetamine inpatient treatment centre in Estevan and increased access to mental health and addictions services throughout the province.  This budget provides an additional $20 million to reduce surgical wait times.  Thousands of Saskatchewan patients waiting for day and inpatient surgeries will have their procedure scheduled sooner.  This additional funding will meet growing patient demand and significantly reduce the surgical backlog.  The budget dedicates funding directly to areas that focus on women and children’s health.  Nearly $1.8 million in funding will enhance the provincial gynecologic-oncology programs with additional resources including a sixth specialist position to stabilize the provincial program.  Saskatchewan will also commit $1.0 million directly to Ovarian Cancer Canada (OCC) for priorities such as treatment, research and clinical trials.  Funds will remain in Saskatchewan to support improvements identified by OCC, the Saskatchewan Cancer Agency, the University of Saskatchewan and provincial gynecologic oncologists. More than $600,000 will cover costs to modernize cervical cancer screening by using technology called liquid-based cytology.  More than $600,000 will enhance sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE) services across the province.  More than $400,000 is dedicated to expanding midwifery programs with three additional midwife positions to increase access for expectant mothers with low-risk pregnancies.

Overall, the budget provides $3.7 billion to the Saskatchewan Health Authority – an increase of $140.6 million or 3.9 per cent over last year.  Other funding highlights include:  $15.9 million to continue a multi-year funding commitment for additional physicians and clinical staff at the new Jim Pattison Children’s Hospital in Saskatoon; $7.9 million to fund operations for 36 new, permanent acute care medical beds at Royal University Hospital; $1.4 million for Computer Aided Dispatch Renewal to upgrade existing dispatch technology; $1.2 million to continue advancing organ and tissue donation registry development and establish a donor physician model in Regina; $1.0 million to support the operation of a highly specialized four-bed Epilepsy telemetry unit at Royal University Hospital; $833,000 to support operations for a new 10-bed palliative care hospice in Prince Albert; $827,000 to support improvements to the pediatric hematology program; and $188,000 to staff a second ambulance in the community of Pelican Narrows (Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation) that will serve the northeast corner of Saskatchewan.  The Saskatchewan Cancer Agency will receive a further $18.4 million or 10.3 per cent increase bringing their annual grant to $196.4 million, also the highest ever.  This funding will ensure Saskatchewan patients have access to enhanced cancer care services, including over 20 new oncology drugs.  This year’s Health budget will help build strong communities by investing in key infrastructure for our hospitals and healthcare facilities.  Fifteen million will support the planning, design and procurement activities for the Prince Albert Victoria Hospital project to benefit the growing population and meet health care needs in northern Saskatchewan.  The future Victoria Hospital will feature a multi-storey addition with a new acute care tower and adult mental health space.  Planning and design work will include development of culturally appropriate services and spaces in partnership with local Indigenous organizations and communities.  Plans are ongoing for the Weyburn General Hospital replacement project.  Existing funding of $2.5 million will be directed toward final site selection, land purchase and other planning activities.  A further investment of $15.7 million in capital funding will be provided in addition to last year’s capital commitment for the construction of a new, 72-bed, long-term care facility in Meadow Lake.  As part of the infrastructure stimulus announced on May 6, 2020, an additional $43.7 million will be provided to the health sector to stimulate Saskatchewan’s economic recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The funding for 2020-21 includes $25 million for facility maintenance and $18.7 million for large capital projects that will be announced at a later date.  More than $28 million will fund capital equipment including diagnostic, medical, surgical, and IT equipment for health facilities.  This includes $5.0 million to purchase a replacement linear accelerator to treat cancer patients requiring radiation therapy at the Allan Blair Cancer Centre in Regina.  More than $4.0 million is directed toward diagnostic imaging equipment, including funding toward a $2.0 million computed tomography (CT scanner) to serve Melfort and area patients.  This new investment will increase the province’s capacity and provide faster access for patients in northeast Saskatchewan.

The $363.9 million Agriculture budget includes $71.2 million for strategic programs under the five-year, federal-provincial Canadian Agricultural Partnership (CAP) agreement, and $244.3 million to fully fund business risk management programs, including Crop Insurance, AgriStability, AgriInvest and WLPIP.  The Government of Saskatchewan will also invest $32.9 million in agricultural research through CAP.  The $1.0 million increase in agriculture research will allow the ministry to invest more in supporting research that benefits Saskatchewan’s agriculture industry.  Additionally, the ministry budget continues to support a number of industry organizations, including the Agricultural Health and Safety Network, Agriculture in the Classroom Saskatchewan, Saskatchewan 4-H Council and Farm and Food Care Saskatchewan, among others.

219,2020-06-15,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/june/15/budget-finance,Government Website,"2020-21 Budget Supports People, Jobs And Economic Recovery"," Released on June 15, 2020 The 2020-21 Saskatchewan Budget meets the challenges presented by the global COVID-19 pandemic.  “Saskatchewan is strong, our province’s fiscal foundation remains solid and our economy will recover,” Finance Minster Donna Harpauer said.  “Saskatchewan people are resilient and our province has what the world needs as the global economy recovers from the pandemic.  “Our government is helping support people through the pandemic and investing to stimulate our economy and create jobs.  Every province, every jurisdiction in the world has seen its economy and finances hit hard by the pandemic.  Saskatchewan is not immune, but we are better positioned than most to provide the support people need to get through the pandemic and see our economy recover and jobs return.”  The reduction in provincial revenues and additional costs related to the pandemic have resulted in a $2.4 billion deficit forecast for 2020-21.  “This is a pandemic deficit, not a structural deficit,” Harpauer said.  “Prior to the pandemic, Saskatchewan was on track for balanced budgets last year and this year, and I am confident that as Saskatchewan’s economy recovers, our revenues will also recover and we will get back to balance in the coming years without having to cut programs and services.”  While the 2020-21 deficit is significant, it is much smaller than the deficits expected in many other provinces this fiscal year.  Revenue is forecast to be $13.6 billion, down $1.2 billion, or about eight per cent from last year, a result of the shuttering of domestic and global economies to contain the spread of COVID-19, combined with the oil price collapse.  The 2020-21 Budget includes $16.1 billion in spending, an increase of $1.1 billion, or about seven per cent compared to last year.  This includes record spending on health care, which is vital during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The budget also invests strongly into many needed programs and services.  To help stimulate Saskatchewan’s economic recovery and create jobs, the province’s capital plan in the 2020-21 Budget includes a $3.1 billion investment to build hospitals, schools, highways, municipal and Crown corporation infrastructure.  Over the next two years the province will invest $7.5 billion as part of its capital plan, which includes $2.0 billion announced in May to help further stimulate the economy and create jobs.  “These are projects that will result in much needed economic activity and jobs,” Harpauer said.  “Saskatchewan is fortunate to be in a strong financial position to make these kinds of important capital investments in every part of our province.”  The 2020-21 Budget includes more than $1.0 billion in support to fight the pandemic, for individuals, for businesses and for initiatives to help the economy recover.  Investment in Saskatchewan People  Expenses of $16.1 billion incorporates the $14.2 billion outlined in the estimates for government ministries and agencies released on March 18.  As well, $1.3 billion in expenses from across other government entities is included in the summary budget, for a total of $15.5 billion, at that time.  In the ensuing weeks, more than $700 million has been allocated to address the challenges of the pandemic, and a $200 million health and safety contingency has been established.  This pre-pandemic level of funding includes a record investment of $6.18 billion for the health care sector, up $288 million or 4.9 per cent from the previous year’s budget.  While the health sector is incurring COVID-19 related costs, the significant year-over-year increase is, thus far, allowing the needed flexibility in the system to manage pressures within the existing budget.  Within this record investment, $118 million has been identified by the health sector in spending commitments related to hospital equipment, testing equipment, personal protective equipment and operating costs to address the pandemic.  The 2020-21 budget also includes a record $435 million in mental health and addictions funding, which makes up 7.5 per cent of the total Ministry of Health budget.  There is also $3.36 billion for education in this budget, including the pre-K to Grade 12 and the post-secondary sectors, up $79.4 million or 2.4 per cent from last year.  A $42 million increase in school operating funding includes $20 million to fully fund the ratified teachers’ collective bargaining agreement.  School divisions have been responding to the unique challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic including online learning and planning for the upcoming school year, with the guidance of Saskatchewan’s Chief Medical Health Officer.  This budget includes $1.49 billion for social services and assistance, a $58 million or four per cent increase, over the 2019-20 Budget.  It includes a $30 million increase for child and family services to enhance the range and delivery of services that keep children safe.  It also includes $10.9 million for third party providers that deliver services on behalf of the ministry to some of our province’s most vulnerable people, including at-risk children, youth and families, people with intellectual disabilities and mental health challenges.  In response to the pandemic, $6.4 million has been dedicated to a number of measures to address the province’s most vulnerable people, including one-time payments of $50 to all adults in receipt of income assistance.  Government is also providing $100 monthly respite payments from June through September to about 2,800 individuals caring for people with intellectual disabilities, at a cost of $1.1 million.  There is $171,000 for additional support to emergency shelters, and one-time $300 payments to foster and extended family caregivers.  The 2020-21 Budget provides more than $85 million to the Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency, which supports the province’s people, municipalities and service providers, and is positioned to address any emergency that may arise.  The agency has been fundamental in the province’s response to the pandemic, particularly in the north west region of the province, including La Loche and surrounding communities.  A number of other ministries and agencies have also re-purposed funding within their existing budgets to address pandemic impacts, bringing the total of COVID-19 spending within existing funds to $148 million.  Responding to the COVID-19 Pandemic  In total, the 2020-21 Budget now includes more than $900 million in new support to fight the pandemic. This includes an additional $502 million of new expense forecast after March 18, for COVID-19 related support programs and economic stimulus.  The new expense includes:  $171 million of new capital funding for third parties, including $150 million for the Municipal Economic Enhancement Program for shovel-ready infrastructure projects; $150 million for the Accelerated Site Closure Program for the reclamation of inactive oil and gas wells and facilities; $56 million for the Temporary Wage Supplement supporting those workers who are helping some of our most vulnerable in our province through the pandemic; $50 million for the Saskatchewan Small Business Emergency Payment providing support to small and medium-sized businesses that have had to temporarily close or significantly curtail operations because of the COVID-19 pandemic; $50 million in emergency pandemic support for First Nations and Métis organizations and community-based organizations to help offset an $81 million reduction in gaming grant payments resulting from the closure of casinos; $13 million for Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance, providing forgivable loans to commercial property owners to assist with rent owing by small businesses experiencing hardship during the pandemic; and $12 million of other measures, including support for livestock producers, enhancements to the corrections and justice systems and the Self-Isolation Support Program.  Further, $205 million will be directed to government-owned capital assets such as schools, hospitals and highways, in addition to the original capital plan.  When combined with the $171 million increase in expense for third-party capital, a total of $376 million is provided for the first year of a two-year, $2.0 billion capital stimulus package.  A $200 million health and public safety contingency has been provided to address future pandemic-related expenses, such as a possible resurgence of the virus, later this year.  In addition to measures that are part of expense and capital, our government has committed an estimated $675 million related to deferrals for Saskatchewan people in this challenging time.  PST remittance deferrals, utility payment deferrals, Education Property Tax deferrals and the student loan repayment moratorium are among the measures the Government is taking.  Saskatchewan’s Capital Plan  Our government will invest $3.1 billion into infrastructure in 2020-21.  It’s the first year of an enhanced two-year $7.5 billion capital plan to invest in schools, hospitals, highways, Crown utility projects, municipal infrastructure and other needed projects to stimulate our economy, create jobs and build a strong Saskatchewan.  The plan received a $2.0 billion injection in May to further help our economy recover over the next two years.  The initial capital plan, announced in March, supports more than 17,500 jobs with an economic impact of $1.8 billion on nominal GDP.  The two-year $2.0 billion stimulus is expected to support 10,000 jobs, with a $1.2 billion impact on the province’s nominal GDP.  Saskatchewan has invested close to $34 billion in provincial infrastructure since 2008-09.  More details related to Saskatchewan’s Capital Plan can be found in the budget capital news release and backgrounder.  Increasing Competitiveness to Help Saskatchewan’s Economy Recover  “Strengthening Saskatchewan and helping our economy recover requires being competitive, keeping taxes low for Saskatchewan people and businesses, particularly in these challenging times while seeking new markets, growing trade and exports, as well as adding value to Saskatchewan products that are sold around the world,” Harpauer said.  “This budget contains a number of targeted tax measures, encouraging new activities in areas like pipeline development and fertilizer production.”  The 2020-21 Budget reintroduces full indexation of the Personal Income Tax system, beginning with the 2021 tax year—protecting taxpayers from bracket creep, or automatic increases in tax caused by inflation.  The government has also introduced a PST rebate for new residential home construction of up to 42 per cent of the PST paid on a new house contract up to $350,000, excluding the land, for new homes purchased after March 31, 2020 and before April, 1, 2023.  The new rebate will help the province’s construction industry, homebuilders, and associated trades to create jobs, and it will help Saskatchewan families to afford a newly built home.  The Oil Infrastructure Investment Program, a SaskFirst new growth tax incentive administered by the Ministry of Energy and Resources has been introduced to support new and expanded pipelines, as well as new pipeline terminals, to flow oil to markets.  The 2020-21 Budget also introduces a new Saskatchewan Chemical Fertilizer Incentive, providing a 15 per cent tax credit to encourage new investment that will grow Saskatchewan’s value-added sector.  The budget extends the existing Manufacturing and Processing Exporter Tax Incentive for an additional three years.  The tax credits provided under this incentive for new production and head office hiring helps to support efforts by eligible businesses to expand their production and export capacity.  To ensure growth of our export markets $4.2 million in this budget, through the Ministry of Trade and Export Development, will establish three provincial trade and investment offices in Japan, India and Singapore.  Officials in these offices will focus on diversifying markets, connecting Saskatchewan businesses with investors and customers.  They will encourage direct foreign investment, and give our exporters an advantage with people who understand the business culture, rules and regulations in key markets.  The 2020-21 Budget includes $5.0 million in 2020-21 to identify opportunities for irrigated agriculture in Saskatchewan, and further develop land and water resources.  Continued Investment into Communities  The 2020-21 Budget provides a record $278 million in Municipal Revenue Sharing—up nearly $27 million from last year, or 11 per cent.  In total, this budget invests more than $571 million in direct provincial support to Saskatchewan’s municipalities, an increase of $137 million, or 31.4 per cent, over last year.  This includes revenue sharing, and the $150 million Municipal Economic Enhancement Program, additional infrastructure funding, and a number of grants and initiatives from various government ministries.  Also in this year’s budget, an increase of $14 million will help fund the operations of community-service organizations that provide vital contributions—strengthening families and assisting those who are most vulnerable, particularly important as the province responds to the global pandemic.  “Our net debt-to-GDP is among the lowest in the country,” Harpauer said.  “We have the ability to invest in the priorities of Saskatchewan people.  Our people are strong, our economy is resilient and we have the solid base we need to bring our budget back to balance over time.  We will develop a plan to move forward.  We faced the pandemic, together.  Now we are re-opening our province, together.  And we will rebuild and recover together.”  -30-  For more information, contact:  Jeff Welke Finance Regina Phone: 306-787-6046 Email: jeff.welke@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-536-1185 "

The province’s initial capital plan, announced in March, supports more than 17,500 jobs with an economic impact of $1.8 billion on nominal GDP.  The two-year $2.0 billion stimulus is expected to support 10,000 jobs, with a $1.2 billion impact on the province’s nominal GDP.  Since 2008, $1.9 billion has been invested to build 53 new schools and undertake 26 major renovation projects.  In this year’s budget, seven new school projects and three major renovation projects have been announced to date, as part of nearly $168 million in education capital funding—up more than $72 million, or 75 per cent, compared to last year.  The investment in K-12 capital includes more than $37 million in economic stimulus funding added recently, and projects will be announced for this added investment in the coming weeks.  This year’s announced projects include a new joint-use elementary school in Harbour Landing in Regina, as well as a joint-use consolidation of St. Peter, St. Michael and Imperial elementary schools in Regina.  Other new school projects include St. Frances Elementary School in Saskatoon, the consolidation of Princess Alexandra, King George, and Pleasant Hill elementary schools in Saskatoon, and a new consolidated elementary and high school in Carrot River. The 2020-21 Budget builds hospitals, providing $172 million in health care capital spending—including $15 million this year to support the planning, design and procurement activities for the more than $300 million project for a renewed and expanded Prince Albert Victoria Hospital.  “Plans for the future Victoria Hospital include a multi-storey addition with a new acute care tower, adult mental health space and the development of culturally appropriate spaces in partnership with local First Nations,” Harpauer said.  “Over the past 13 years, close to $1.8 billion in investment has built hospitals—including the Jim Pattison Children’s Hospital, Saskatchewan Hospital North Battleford and the Dr. F.H. Wigmore Hospital in Moose Jaw—and 14 new long-term care facilities across the province.”  Also in this year’s budget, a $15.7 million investment will continue construction of a new, 72-bed, long-term seniors care facility in Meadow Lake.  The 2020-21 Budget provides $4.0 million for diagnostic imaging equipment, including $2.0 million to fulfill government’s commitment for a new CT scanner in Melfort.  Included in this budget for capital investment in health care is an additional $43.7 million, part of the stimulus announcement, for major projects and renewal projects that are being determined.  The 2020-21 Budget invests $715 million in the Highways and Infrastructure budget to improve safety, increase the capacity of Saskatchewan’s highways and provide economic stimulus as communities recover from the economic impact of the global pandemic.  The budget includes $411 million for capital projects, including $54 million added through stimulus funding.  “As part of this budget, more than 1,000 kilometres of provincial highways will be upgraded, including multiple sets of passing lanes and various safety improvements throughout the province in the first year of our government’s 10-year Growth Plan goal to build and upgrade 10,000 kilometres of highways,” Harpauer said. Since 2008-09, more than $9.8 billion has been invested in transportation infrastructure, improving numerous highways, bridges and culverts as well as the construction and completion of the Regina Bypass, the Estevan Bypass, the Yorkton West Truck Route, and interchanges in Martensville and Warman, among others.  This year’s budget provides $316 million for municipal infrastructure.  It includes $166 million in transfers to municipalities, including funding made available through the Gas Tax Fund, Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program, New Building Canada Fund and other programs.  It also includes $150 million, through the economic stimulus funding, for the Municipal Economic Enhancement Program which supports all municipalities with per capita funding for a wide-range of projects, from local roads and bridges to water services to recreation projects, to name a few.  The application process has started and the dollars will help communities remain strong through the pandemic, creating local jobs and encouraging economic development.  Since 2008-09, approximately $2.0 billion has been invested to support municipal infrastructure projects.  The 2020-21 Budget also invests in Crown corporation infrastructure, totalling $1.7 billion over the next year for upgrades to improve services provided by SaskPower, SaskTel and SaskEnergy.  Through the Crown sector, government has invested more than $19 billion in infrastructure since 2008-09 to ensure safe, reliable and high quality services for the people of Saskatchewan.  “Our government’s Growth Plan targets $30 billion of infrastructure spending by 2030 to support our province, help our economy recover as we face challenging times and grow into the future to build a better quality of life for the people of Saskatchewan,” Harpauer said.  “This year’s budget contributes toward this goal with $3.1 billion in capital investment in 2020-21.”  -30-  For more information, contact:  Jeff Welke Finance Regina Phone: 306-787-6046 Email: jeff.welke@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-536-1185              "

Merriman said this year’s budget again focuses on working to make Saskatchewan the best place in Canada for people with disabilities.  It contains:  $10 million increase for the Saskatchewan Assured Income for Disability, or SAID, program to continue to support people with significant and enduring disabilities; and $10.9 million increase to address current and anticipated needs of people with intellectual disabilities, including youth with intellectual disabilities transitioning into adult programs, and to increase access to respite for caregivers.  Social Services is also providing $1.0 million to SaskAbilities for repairs and improvements to Camp Easter Seal, which provides summer camp programs for children, youth and adults with physical and intellectual disabilities.  Another $350,000 in new funding will enhance communication services delivered by the Canadian National Institute for the Blind and Saskatchewan Deaf and Hard of Hearing Services Inc.  The funding will provide support for roles including a DeafBlind Intervenor, American Sign Language Interpreters and Sign Support Professionals.  This investment builds on the Saskatchewan Disability Strategy by improving access to communication supports that people need to live and participate in their communities.  The province is continuing to invest in Child and Family Programs to ensure the safety and well-being of vulnerable children.  Investments include:  an increase of $3.2 million to support children and youth with developmental and complex behavioral needs through private treatment and two new group homes; an increase of $2.5 million for family supports, including outreach and in-home supports; an increase of $1.8 million to the supported family living program that helps keep at-risk families together; an increase of $1.4 million for foster families, who will continue to be eligible for additional monthly payments when they complete specific training; and an additional $356,000 to increase basic maintenance rates for foster care, extended family care and assisted adoption by 1.0 per cent effective July 1, 2020.  The Saskatchewan Income Support (SIS) program was launched in July 2019 for new income assistance clients.  It is designed to help people receiving income assistance overcome challenges, earn more income, become more self-sufficient and start a career.  The SIS budget will increase by $84.6 million to reflect the caseload in this program, as the Saskatchewan Assistance Program (SAP) and Transitional Employment Allowance (TEA) wind down.  Applications are now being accepted for the new Saskatchewan Housing Benefit.  The province will provide $3.4 million as a 50/50 cost-match with the federal government under the National Housing Strategy, resulting in total funding of up to $6.8 million.  The benefit will target eligible individuals or families that require rental support.  Social Services has also responded to the impact of the COVID-19 virus on our province’s most vulnerable citizens with a number of pandemic-specific programs.  The estimated cost of these initiatives is $6.4 million and they will be managed within the ministry’s overall 2020-21 budget of $1.286 billion.  Initiatives include:  $1.1 million toward a supplementary respite payment of $100 per month for four months to support caregivers of people with intellectual disabilities, including families caring for Community Living Service Delivery clients, families currently receiving the Family Respite benefit and Approved Private Service Home proprietors, including Mental Health Approved Home proprietors in response to the reduced respite options available during the COVID-19 lockdown. $2.0 million for a one-time $50 benefit distributed in addition to regular benefits in April for clients receiving SIS, SAID, SAP and TEA to help cover extra COVID-19 related expenses. One-time total additional funding of $171,000 to emergency shelters to help address extra cost pressures for services and supplies related to COVID-19. $1.3 million to provide an additional $300 one-time payment in June to family-based care providers, aligning with the federal government’s announcement of a one-time increase to the Canada Child Benefit. $1.7 million for placement spaces to prepare for new children entering care to minimize the potential spread of the virus. $145,000 for delaying transitions for youth aging out of care.  Child and Family Programs will continue to provide supports to these youth to remain in their current placements, while continuing to receive financial supports and access to all services.  “We recognize the impact that COVID-19 has placed on many Saskatchewan citizens, as well as on organizations that support them,” Merriman said.  “This government has taken a number of positive actions to reduce the financial and lifestyle effects on individuals and families already experiencing difficulties.”  -30-  For more information, contact:  Trish Alcorn Social Services Regina Phone: 306-536-1479 Email: trish.alcorn@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-536-1479 "

As a result, the Northern Inter-Tribal Health Authority and Saskatchewan Health Authority public health officials are advising anyone who attended any of these events (wake on June 10, 2020 and funeral on June 11, 2020) to immediately self-isolate and self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days from the date of attendance.  More information can be found here: https://www.saskhealthauthority.ca/news/releases/Pages/Precautionary-Health-Advisory-%E2%80%93-Clearwater-River-Dene-Nation.aspx   Re-Open Saskatchewan Plan  Yesterday, an updated version of the Re-Open Saskatchewan plan was released.  Below are two points of clarification:  Outdoor sports and activities, such as baseball and soccer, cannot begin training/practicing until the first part of Phase 4. The dates for that part of the phase will be announced early next week.  The Outdoor Sports and Activities Guidelines were included in the updated plan to provide organizations with advance notice to support planning and preparations.  The guidelines have been revised to clarify the timing. The revised Places of Worship Guidelines apply to all worship services, including celebrations of life, weddings and outdoor ceremonies. With respect to weddings, the expanded gatherings only apply to wedding ceremonies and not wedding receptions.No food is to be served in any of the above allowed gatherings.

All other public and private gatherings sizes remain at a maximum of 15 people indoors and 30 people outdoors, while maintaining a two-metre physical separation both indoors and outdoors.  Small, infrequent gatherings are better than large, frequent gatherings. Outdoor gatherings, while observing physical distancing, are better than indoor gatherings. Have guests bring their own food, if possible. If food is served, have it plated by one person to reduce the number of people who touch serving utensils or drink containers. Do not share food or drink. Meeting with the same group is better than meeting a lot of new people.  Everyone should continue to take measures to stop the spread of COVID-19, including:  Practice proper cough and sneezing etiquette (into a tissue or the bend of your elbow); Wash your hands often with soap and water; if soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer; Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth; Stay home if you are sick; and Practice physical distancing.  Do a personal risk assessment before going to any gathering.  Consider whether you or someone close to you has a chronic condition that may mean greater risk.  You should always be aware of who you have been in contact with over the past two weeks.  If you test positive for COVID-19, these are the people who will need to be contacted by public health.

To prepare for Phase 4, this week’s update to the Re-Open Saskatchewan plan includes guidelines for the activities re-opening in the first part of the phase, including:  child and youth day camps; outdoor pools and splash pads; and outdoor sports and activities – individual and group.  The second part of the phase will include indoor pools, indoor rinks, libraries, museums, galleries, movie theatres, casinos and bingo halls.  A target date for the second part of Phase 4 will be announced at a later time.  In addition to the new guidelines for Phase 4, this week’s update to Re-Open Saskatchewan includes changes to incrementally allow for larger gatherings in places of worship and for graduation ceremonies.  Public health officials will monitor the outcomes of these types of gatherings over the next several weeks to determine future re-opening activities.  Updated Guidelines for Places of Worship  The number of people allowed in places of worship is increasing to one-third of the seating capacity of a facility to a maximum of 150 people – whichever is less.  Although the number of people allowed inside places of worship is increasing, public health measures and guidelines in the Re-Open Saskatchewan plan still need to be followed, including the need to maintain physical distancing.  These guidelines apply to all worship services, including celebrations of life, weddings and outdoor ceremonies.  Guidelines for Graduation Celebrations  The Government of Saskatchewan continues to review the public health guidelines in an effort to help graduates and their families celebrate this important milestone in a safe and meaningful way.  Here are a few options for consideration:  Virtual services – are the safest solution and the option that is recommended by public health officials. Drive-in services – may proceed with the necessary public health measures in place.  Guidelines have been developed for staging safe drive-in services. Outdoor services – may proceed if they are held outdoors with a maximum of 30 graduates per class and an overall attendance of 150 people (including graduates, guests and staff members).  Schools with larger classes may need to hold multiple ceremonies.  All graduation services must comply with the public health measures and the guidelines in Re-Open Saskatchewan, including the need to maintain physical distancing.  As restrictions are gradually lifted in the province, additional information will continue to be added to the Re-Open Saskatchewan plan based on direction from public health officials and input from businesses and service providers.  Saskatchewan residents are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the guidelines and follow their recommendations to ensure the province can continue to re-open in a safe manner without a significant increase in the transmission of COVID-19.

These projects include eight new passing lanes west of Fiske to Kindersley as well as a 40 km paving project west of Delisle.  This project is part of the Government of Saskatchewan’s $7.5 billion two-year capital plan to build a strong province and stimulate Saskatchewan’s economic recovery.  “Highway 7 is a key trade route for the province connecting communities such as Kindersley, Rosetown, Delisle and Saskatoon, as well as Calgary and ports on the west coast,” Highways and Infrastructure Minister Greg Ottenbreit said.  “Passing lanes are an effective and affordable way to keep traffic flowing safely as we get our goods to market.”    Road work began on passing lanes in May with a scheduled completion date of October.  In addition to new passing lanes, several intersections will be improved along the highway corridor east of Kindersley.  Four passing lanes opened on Highway 7 west of Rosetown to Fiske last year.  Since 2014, the Government of Saskatchewan has invested more than $120 million in safety improvements on Highway 7 between Saskatoon and Kindersley including twinning, passing lanes, intersection improvements and paving.  Planning continues for another six passing lanes west of Kindersley to the Saskatchewan/Alberta border.  Once complete, the entire Highway 7 corridor will have 26 passing lanes.  Passing lanes can reduce collisions by 25 per cent, since they provide additional opportunities for drivers to pass safely.  Over the past 10 years, traffic volumes along the Highway 7 corridor have increased by as much as 20 per cent.  A weekly construction update provides Saskatchewan residents with the latest details on projects underway to help plan safe and efficient travel throughout the summer and fall.  Additional travel information about emergency road closures, the status of ferries, barges and other road activities can also be found on the Highway Hotline at www.saskatchewan.ca/Highwayhotline.  Information and concerns about a provincial highway can be made by calling 1-844-SK-HIWAY.  The Government of Saskatchewan has invested more than $9.8 billion in highways infrastructure since 2008, improving more than 15,500 km of Saskatchewan highways.  Another $300 million in highways stimulus funds will be invested over the next two years to support Saskatchewan’s economic recovery.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Steve Shaheen Highways and Infrastructure Regina Phone: 306-933-5641 Email: steve.shaheen@gov.sk.ca "

Most regions of the province received at least some rainfall this week, with the northwest and westcentral regions receiving a substantial amount.  The rain was welcome in most areas, but there were reports of localized flooding in areas that received high amounts.  The area around St. Walburg received the highest amount of rain in the province this week with 154 mm, and has received the most precipitation since April 1 (234 mm total).     Due to the rainfall this week, topsoil moisture conditions in Saskatchewan have improved.  Higher amounts of rain in the wes-central region have significantly improved moisture conditions in the area, but there are more fields rated as having surplus moisture in the northern regions.  Cropland topsoil moisture is rated as five per cent surplus, 74 per cent adequate, 20 per cent short and one per cent very short.  Hay and pasture land topsoil moisture is rated as six per cent surplus, 60 per cent adequate, 29 per cent short and five per cent very short.  Dry conditions have delayed emergence of smaller seeded crops such as canola and flax.  Seventeen per cent of fall cereal crops are in the shotblade stage and 22 per cent are heading, while 52 per cent of spring cereals are emerging and 34 per cent are tillering.  Forty-five per cent of canola is emerging and 34 per cent is in the seedling stage.  Twenty-one per cent of flax is in the seedling stage.  Fifty-four per cent of pulse crops are emerging and 42 per cent are in the vegetative stage.  The majority of crop damage this week was due to strong winds, dry soil conditions, insects including flea beetles and cutworms, as well as localized flooding specifically in parts of the westcentral and northwest regions.  Some farmers are reseeding due to flea beetle and cutworm damage.  Farmers have been busy spraying for weed and insect control, hauling grain and moving cattle to pasture.

Since service resumption began on May 19, more than 330 health services have now resumed, including harm reduction services, chronic disease management, therapy and rehabilitation services, well-baby checks, immunization services and home care.  All areas met their targets related to surgical resumptions, including in Regina and Saskatoon which are now performing at 45 to 50 per cent of their pre-COVID-19 surgical capacity.  In Phase Two, surgical capacity will increase over the next few weeks to 65-70 per cent provincially, with the inclusion of urgent, emergent and also some elective procedures.  This will vary significantly by site, as some locations like Yorkton Regional Health Centre are already up to 75 per cent of regular volumes as of June 10. Medical imaging capacity will also continue to increase in Phase Two, targeting 90 per cent of pre-COVID-19 volumes across all services, including MRI and CT scans.  Current service levels reached in Phase One for MRIs and CT scans are up to 83 per cent from approximately 50 per cent at the start of Phase One.  In all service areas, including surgical programs and medical imaging, new required COVID-related precautions around physical distancing, cohorting staff, personal protective equipment usage, and Infection Prevention and Control necessitate gradual service resumption.  “As we safely increase service levels, we are learning to do business in different ways that promote access to services for Saskatchewan residents while still ensuring safety and proper precautions against the spread of COVID-19,” SHA Chief Executive Officer Scott Livingstone said.  “We know that this has meant some adjustments for patients and has resulted in longer waits and extra steps at times.  We continue to express our gratitude to the public for their patience and understanding about the need to take these extra safety measures.”  Virtual care appointments continue to be offered where possible, with some face-to-face services being offered, where needed.  Since initiating expanded virtual care options, as a result of the pandemic in March, 122,000 appointments have been delivered through this option, enabling greater access to care for Saskatchewan residents while helping health care providers fight the spread of COVID-19.  Throughout the month of June, further service resumptions will continue at SHA operated specialty clinics, including such services as sleep disorder testing, cardiac stress testing, eye centre testing and operations, and additional cast clinics, with service levels varying by location and program.  Although June 16 is when many of these services may start, a critical part of SHA’s process is that every service re-introduced must undergo a rigourous process to confirm readiness and safety, including steps to ensure all appropriate COVID-related precautions are in place.  “As we increase the amount of people in our facilities, we need to be extra vigilant and monitor the impact on our health system,” Livingstone said.  “In order to resume services while also continuing to support COVID-19 testing, contact tracing and other strategies to combat the virus, we need to move slowly and cautiously through this process.”  All services are listed on the Saskatchewan Health Authority website, with new services being added each day at www.saskhealthauthority.ca/service-alerts.

In this year’s budget, the Ministry of Social Services will be providing $350,000 to the CNIB’s Deaf Blind Community Services and Saskatchewan Deaf and Hard of Hearing Services to increase American Sign Language interpreter services and Deafblind community intervenor services in the province.  This funding will significantly increase access to communication supports so people who have communication disabilities have more opportunities for inclusion.  “I am pleased to proclaim Deafblind Awareness Week to raise our understanding and awareness of deafblindness within Saskatchewan,” Social Services Minister Paul Merriman said.  “Our government thanks the Saskatchewan chapter of the Canadian Deaf Blind Association for the valuable services and advocacy they provide to those who are deafblind.”  Canadian Deaf Blind Association (CDBA) is a non-profit organization that was formed in 1975 to promote and enhance the well-being of people who are deafblind through service provision, awareness, public education and research.  There are various CDBA chapters across Canada, including one in Saskatchewan that was established in 1985.  “At CDBA Saskatchewan, the focus of our programs is on the individuals we support who experience deafblindness and rely on the talents of our Intervention Team,” CDBA Saskatchewan Chapter Executive Director Dana Heinrichs said.  “The emphasis is on empowering the individuals to be active and engaged in their homes, workplaces and communities.  We continue to strive for the best in providing person-centred supports and the support of the Saskatchewan government, makes achieving this goal possible.”  This proclamation supports the Saskatchewan Disability Strategy by helping to create awareness and understanding of the rights of people with disabilities.  Saskatchewan residents and communities that have done work which aligns with the Disability Strategy are encouraged to share their accomplishments using the hashtag #SKDisability.

246,2020-06-05,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/june/05/job-numbers,Government Website,Saskatchewan Economy On The Rebound," Released on June 5, 2020 Job numbers for May released today show Saskatchewan is in a strong position compared to other provinces.  The unemployment rate in May 2020 was 12.5 per cent (seasonally adjusted), the second lowest among the provinces.  Nationally, the unemployment rate was 13.7 per cent.  “The Saskatchewan workforce is still being seriously affected by the COVID-19 pandemic but there are a number of signs that show Saskatchewan’s economy is both recovering faster, and was less impacted, than other provinces,” Immigration and Career Training Minister Jeremy Harrison said.  “We have the second lowest unemployment rate in Canada and the number of people working rose in May, which is a strong, positive sign in the COVID-19 era.  The Saskatchewan economy is positioned to strongly improve as we move forward with the Re-Open Saskatchewan plan.”  On a month-over-month basis, there were 600 more jobs in May than in April (seasonally adjusted).  Total employment has declined 13 per cent and 87 per cent of those working in February in Saskatchewan were working in May.    Compared to February, the total actual hours worked by those employed in Saskatchewan in May has declined by 9.1 per cent, the second lowest decline in Canada.  The national average decline in that period is 19.3 per cent.   “Looking forward, we are seeing positive economic news in Saskatchewan, including announcements about helium and lithium recently,” Harrison said.  “These new investments will bring jobs and investment to communities across the province and will help lift our economy out of the current challenges facing markets globally.”   Saskatchewan businesses have also fared better than other jurisdictions, with fewer closing here than in other provinces.  This speaks to the strength of Saskatchewan’s economy and a strong re-opening plan aiding in economic recovery.  According to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, Saskatchewan's business barometer index grew by 7.1 points in the second half of May 2020 compared to the first half – the highest growth among provinces compared to a 0.7 point decline in the national index.  In April 2020, Saskatchewan’s urban housing starts had the second highest year-over-year growth among provinces at 87.5 per cent, compared to the national decline of 29.7 per cent (seasonally unadjusted).  -30-  For more information, contact:  Deb Young Immigration and Career Training Regina Phone: 306-531-9530 Email: deb.young@gov.sk.ca "

The indexation formula gives equal weight to changes to the Consumer Price Index and Average Hourly Wage for Saskatchewan.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Kate Crowley Labour Relations and Workplace Safety Regina Phone: 306-787-3370 Email: kate.crowley@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-570-2839              "

In the first four months of 2020, merchandise exports in Saskatchewan increased by 0.7 per cent (seasonally adjusted), compared to the same period in 2019.  By way of comparison Canada saw a decline of 35.3 per cent year-over-year.  Steady export numbers were supported by strong growth in farm and food products, as well as growth both year-over-year and in the first four months of 2020 in the industrial machinery, equipment and parts sector.

Businesses and services that are able to begin operation in this phase of the Government of Saskatchewan’s plan to re-open the provincial economy include:  Places of worship; Restaurants and licensed establishments; Gyms and fitness facilities; Child care facilities; and Personal care services that did not re-open in Phase 2.  Guidelines for these businesses and services are included in this week’s update of Re-Open Saskatchewan.  Although the guidelines are primarily directed toward business operators and service providers, members of the general public are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the guidelines in order to take an active role in their own health and safety, as well as to know what to expect when they visit businesses.  The guidelines are available at www.saskatchewan.ca/re-open.  Increased Access and Availability of Childcare Spaces for Working Parents in Phase 3  Starting June 8, 2020, employees returning to work as part of Phase 3 will now be offered access to school-based childcare facilities, and child care facilities can have a maximum of 15 children per designated space, up from eight.  The increase means 15 children are allowed per facility or, in the case of larger facilities where the area permits, a maximum of 15 children in one defined area.  These areas must be separate for each group and need to be separated by a barrier that can prevent children, toys and other items from crossing over.  Groups of children and the staff members assigned to them must stay together throughout the day and cannot mix with other groups.  Groups must also be within the same space at the same time, including pickups and drop-offs, meal times, playtime and outdoor activities.  Children are restricted to attending a single facility to reduce transmission risks.  All childcare facilities located within special care or personal care homes are subject to all general restrictions and must have private entrances and separate spaces so there are no shared common areas.  There must be no interaction between children and residents of the home.  To date, applications have been received for 1,030 school-based child care centre spaces, out of an available 2,170 spaces, which represents capacity utilization of under 50 per cent..  The specific details of the guidelines can be found on the Government of Saskatchewan website at https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/health-care-administration-and-provider-resources/treatment-procedures-and-guidelines/emerging-public-health-issues/2019-novel-coronavirus/re-open-saskatchewan-plan/guidelines/child-care-facilities-guidelines.   Additions and Changes to the Re-Open Saskatchewan Plan  As restrictions are gradually lifted in the province, additional information will continue to be added to the Re-Open Saskatchewan plan based on direction from public health officials and input from businesses and service providers.  Additions to the plan this week include:  Updates to the guidelines for fitness facilities; Updates to the guidelines for parks and campgrounds; and Updates to the public health orders section.  Consultations will continue with faith leaders in the province to further develop the guidelines for places of worship.  In addition to these updates, changes have been made to the way that Phase 4 will roll out.  A date has not yet been determined for this phase, but it will open in two parts to ensure the appropriate public health measures are in place, while allowing people to participate in seasonal and recreational activities.  Openings will take place in the following manner: Part I (date TBD)  Child and youth day camps Outdoor pools and spray parks  Seasonal/recreational outdoor sports and activities:  Part II (date TBD)  Indoor pools Indoor rinks Libraries Museums Galleries Movie theatres Casinos Bingo halls  In addition, the following are some updates on other work taking place to gradually re-open the province. Graduation Celebrations  With COVID-19 bringing an end to the school year in Saskatchewan, schools and communities continue to look for ways to recognize their graduates.  Innovative ways of celebrating this important milestone are encouraged, but all celebrations must comply with the current public health order and guidelines in the Re-Open Saskatchewan plan.  Parks and Playgrounds  The Government of Saskatchewan recognizes there is a desire for parks and playgrounds to re-open.  Although green spaces continue to remain open, playgrounds are closed.  Public health measures are currently being developed for the safe re-opening of playgrounds.  Further details will be available next week.  Beaches  Beaches in Saskatchewan remain closed; however, guidelines to support the safe re-opening of public beaches are being developed.  Further details will be available next week.

The program is being expanded to include anyone, regardless of income level, who is working at licensed public or private long-term care facilities, which are under public health orders restricting visitations.  In addition, workers at assisted living facilities which also are under public health orders, will now be eligible for the wage supplement if they earned a wage less than $24.00 per hour in the four-week period for which the worker has applied for the supplement.  To be eligible, these workers must also have total earnings of less than $2,500 (gross), including earnings from work outside an eligible essential care facility, in the four-week period for which the worker has applied for the supplement.  Private day cares and approved private service homes will also be eligible for the payments.  “The government, through the Wage Supplement Program, wants to ensure that we are helping as many workers as possible in Saskatchewan’s private and public long-term care, assisted living, and also other private care facilities,” Finance Minister Donna Harpauer said.  “Program benefits and eligibility periods remain the same; however, the benefits will soon be available to more workers who are helping many of Saskatchewan’s most vulnerable citizens get through the COVID-19 emergency.”  For more information about the wage supplement, visit www.saskatchewan.ca/wage-supplement-program.  People with questions about the supplement may also email stwsp@gov.sk.ca or call 1-800-667-6102 or 306-787-6645 in Regina.

These projects are part of the Government of Saskatchewan’s $7.5 billion two-year capital plan to build a strong Saskatchewan and stimulate Saskatchewan’s economic recovery.  “Building bridges and culverts will boost the economy while improving infrastructure that will serve the province for decades to come,” Highways and Infrastructure Minister Greg Ottenbreit said.  “These projects are another way we can build for the future while helping our recovery from the global pandemic.”  This year’s investments keep Saskatchewan on target to meet its Growth Plan goals of rebuilding 200 bridges and replacing 2,000 culverts over the next decade.  A number of bridges are undergoing major repairs:  Highway 11 over the CN Rail line north of Saskatoon at Warman ($1.1 million); Highway 1 over the CP Rail line near Swift Current (contract to be tendered); Highway 1 over the CP Rail line near Maple Creek ($3.8 million); and Highway 376 over the North Saskatchewan River at Maymont ($2.2 million).  Two major bridge rehabilitation projects have already been completed this year:  Highway 3 over the South Saskatchewan River southeast of Prince Albert ($650,000); and Highway 55 over the Saskatchewan River north of Nipawin ($700,000).  The government also plans to replace 18 to 20 short span bridges including a $3 million replacement bridge on Highway 5 over the Assiniboine River near Kamsack.  In addition, the government will replace 130 culverts across the province.  Traffic accommodations will be in place during construction projects but travellers should expect delays and plan ahead.  Bridge work often requires lane closures or reduced lane width.  As a result, drivers can expect to see reduced speed limits, even when workers are not present.  A weekly highway construction update is published on www.saskatchewan.ca to provide the latest details on projects underway to help plan safe and efficient travel.  Check the Highway Hotline for road restriction information before planning your trip at www.saskatchewan.ca/highwayhotline.  Report a highway work zone issue at 1-844-SK-HIWAY.  Since 2008, the province has repaired or replaced more than 300 bridges and more than 1,600 culverts.  During that time, the Government of Saskatchewan has invested more than $9.8 billion in highways infrastructure, improving more than 15,500 kilometres of Saskatchewan highways.  -30-  For more information, contact:  David Horth Highways and Infrastructure Regina Phone: 306-787-4804 Email: david.horth@gov.sk.ca "

Ninety-nine per cent of the crop is seeded in the southwest region.  Seeding is 97 per cent complete in the southeast and west-central regions, 95 per cent in the northwest, 94 per cent in the northeast and 93 per cent in the east-central.  Provincially, 99 per cent of field peas, mustard and chick peas, 98 per cent of durum, lentils and canary seed, 96 per cent of spring wheat, 95 per cent of canola, 94 per cent of flax, 93 per cent of barley and 88 per cent of oats have been seeded.    There was very little precipitation throughout the province this week, especially in the central and southern regions.  Northern regions received small amounts of rain, with the area east of Neilburg receiving the highest amount of precipitation this week at 28 mm.  Minimal precipitation and strong winds have reduced topsoil moisture conditions in the central and southern regions of the province.  Rainfall received two weeks ago has helped with pasture conditions in the western regions, but more will be needed soon.  Cropland topsoil moisture is rated as one per cent surplus, 65 per cent adequate, 30 per cent short and four per cent very short.  Hay and pasture land topsoil moisture is rated as 58 per cent adequate, 32 per cent short and 10 per cent very short.  The majority of crop conditions this week are good.  Smaller seed crops such as canola and mustard are rated as fair to good.  This is mainly due to reduced germination caused by winds and lack of moisture as well as flea beetle pressure.  In general, emergence of early-seeded crops is good and uniform, but more moisture is required to help germination of later-seeded crops and to support crop development.  Most of the crop damage this week was due to strong winds, dry soil conditions, flea beetles and light frosts in some areas of the eastern regions.  Farmers have been busy seeding, spraying herbicides, picking stones and scouting for early season insect pests.

While Saskatchewan’s number of confirmed positive COVID-19 cases is low, it is critically important to understand that as many as 40 per cent of persons who are capable of being infectious with COVID 19 may have no or very mild symptoms.  People attending large public rallies are putting themselves and others at increased risk of infection.  Not knowing who they may have been in contact with will make contact tracing and public health follow up difficult.  As a result, individuals may not have timely warning of potential exposure by public health.  This in turn will put members of extended household contacts at risk.  Several outbreaks, both large and small, have been linked to large gatherings here in Saskatchewan and around the world.  Any gathering with more than 10 people outdoors are in violation of the current Public Health Order.  On June 8, the allowed size limit for outdoor gatherings will be raised to 30.  Regardless of the gathering size, two metres of separation is to be maintained at all times.  Organizers are encouraged to have gatherings done in vehicles.  If groups are wanting to congregate or march on foot, they are advised to keep a distance of two metres or more between each person at all times.  Groups are encouraged to treat marching and protesting as though they are visiting a large urban park where 100s of people may be at any given time across a wide space, but promote safety by maintaining the two metres or more of physical distancing.  Mask use and frequent hand hygiene is encouraged.  Items must not be shared or passed back and forth among participants.  In situations where singing or chanting is happening it is recommended that the physical distancing be expanded beyond the recommended two metres as this behaviour expels the virus at a greater velocity and distance.  Consider using signs or banners instead.  Organizers of any protests or rallies are encouraged to contact local public health offices for guidance.  All groups or individuals contemplating participation in protests or marches should consult information on public health orders and gathering size limitations at www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19.  The risks and public health violations apply to all large gatherings.  While peaceful public protests are a part of our democracy, please be aware of the elevated risk to yourself and your loved ones, particularly those in your extended household who may be more vulnerable.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Health Regina Phone: 306-787-4083 Email: media@health.gov.sk.ca "

Of the 647 reported cases, 34 are considered active.  So far, 602 people have recovered.  There are currently two people in hospital; both are in intensive care in Saskatoon.  Of the 647 cases in the province:  142 cases are travellers; 389 are community contacts (including mass gatherings); 77 have no known exposures; and 39 are under investigation by local public health.  Overall in Saskatchewan:  51 cases are health care workers; however, the source of the infections may not be related to health care in all instances. 257 of the cases are from the Far North, 169 are from the Saskatoon area, 112 from the North, 80 from the Regina area, 17 from the South and 12 from the Central region. 96 cases involve people 19 years of age and under, while the remainder are adults. 230 cases are in the 20-39 age range; 197 are in the 40-59 age range; 106 are in the 60-79 age range; and 18 are in the 80-plus range. 52 per cent of the cases are females and 48 per cent are males. 11 deaths related to COVID-19 have been reported to date.     To date, 49,132 COVID-19 tests have been performed in the province.  As of June 2, 2020, when other provincial and national numbers were last available from the Public Health Agency of Canada, Saskatchewan’s per capita rate was 37,406 people tested per million population.  The national rate was 45,798 people tested per million population.  Updated Visitation and Family Presence for Intensive and Long-Term Care  Beginning immediately, the Saskatchewan Health Authority is expanding its criteria for compassionate reasons related to visitation restrictions.  Full implementation across all facilities will occur over the coming week.  In long-term care, under certain circumstances, two healthy individuals can be designated to come into the facility, one at a time.  One designated family member/support person and an additional family member/support person can be present at the same time in intensive care and critical care if physical distancing can be maintained.  New guidelines have also been created to safely support outdoor visits for long-term care clients with these visits not limited to one person at a time.  Guidelines have also been revised to ensure that it is clear that there can be one family member or support person for inpatient, outpatient, emergency/urgent care patients who have specific challenges resulting in compromised comprehension, decision making or mobility due to disability or onset of a medical condition.  If you are experiencing symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath, headaches, aches and pains, sore throat, chills, runny nose or a loss of your sense of taste or smell, contact HealthLine 811 or your family physician for advice on whether you should be tested for COVID-19.  You can also take the online self-assessment at www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19.  Testing for COVID-19 is also now available to anyone currently working outside the home, or anyone returning to work as part of the Re-Open Saskatchewan plan.   Beginning June 5, testing criteria will be further expanded.

The SHA established a Family Presence Expert Panel with patient and family advisors, along with public health and Infection Prevention and Control experts, to provide guidance on recommendations to support family presence during COVID-19.  Following the work of the expert panel, the new inclusions to compassionate care can be used immediately with full implementation planned for the coming week.  For residents in long-term care, quality of life considerations will now be used in addition to care needs to determine if these needs cannot be met without the support of a designated family member or support person.  In these situations, two family members/support people can be designated with one family/support person present at a time. All critical care and intensive care patients are now included in the compassionate care definition (previously limited to those at high risk for loss of life) and family presence for palliative care has been expanded to facilitate two family members/support people being present at the same time. Guidelines have also been revised to ensure that it is clear that there can be one family member or support person for inpatient, outpatient, emergency/urgent care patients who have specific challenges resulting in compromised comprehension, decision making or mobility due to disability or onset of a medical condition.  This could include mobility, hearing, speech including communication barriers, intellectual or mental health disability, and visual or memory impairment. New guidelines have also been created to safely support outdoor visits with these visits NOT limited to one person at a time.  “Compassionate care means different things to different people, so we worked hard together to review this and come up with adjustments that still ensure we are protected when living or coming into these facilities,” a patient and family advisor on the SHA Family Presence Expert Panel and co-chair, SHA’s provincial patient and family leadership council Heather Thiessen said.  “Like so many others, I need my partner there with me if I require emergency care.  Otherwise, I am in danger of not understanding or being able to communicate what is happening to me to my care providers.  I am so proud of the work our panel is doing, and I look forward working with the SHA to support families in keeping each other physically and mentally safe in this pandemic world we live in.”  Decision tools have been created for care teams to assist with knowing when a patient or long-term care resident can have a family member or support person with them in person.  This includes ensuring clear guidelines for designated family members or support people to follow such as screening, hand hygiene and limited movement within a site.  Individuals will also be asked to review a SHA Family Presence Commitment document, created by the family expert panel.  “When the global pandemic hit Saskatchewan in March, our first priority was to physically protect our patients and residents from contracting COVID-19,” SHA CEO Scott Livingstone said.  “We needed to tightly control who was coming into our facilities given the potential consequences for our long-term care residents and our patients.  That hasn’t changed.  But we have also learned that we need find the right balance between physical safety and mental health and well-being.  We have heard that clearly from our residents, patients and families.  So, together, we are trying to find the right path forward in the weeks and months ahead.”  As an additional level of safety, all outpatients and family members/support persons will be provided with a medical grade mask and asked to wear it while in SHA homes and facilities.

The Final Report raised awareness about the tragedy that has affected multiple generations of Indigenous people including women, girls and those of diverse genders and sexual orientations.  “Our government supports and values the meaningful and important work of the National inquiry,” Justice Minister Don Morgan said.  “The Inquiry provided a crucial voice to missing and murdered indigenous women and girls.  We owe it to past, present and future generations to work together to prevent violence and ensure safer communities.”  Minister Responsible for First Nations, Métis and Northern Affairs Lori Carr announced that this year the $300,000 First Nations and Métis Community Projects grant program will focus on locally-developed projects related to issues raised by the National Inquiry into MMIWG.  Special consideration will be given to applications for initiatives addressing the vulnerabilities within society that lead to risks for inter-personal violence.  This will help advance MMIWG Call for Justice 15.1, which highlights the importance of denouncing violence against Indigenous women, girls and people of diverse genders and sexual orientations.  “This investment is to build upon the efforts of this Inquiry by funding Indigenous-led projects to help make this province we share a better place one step at a time,” Carr said.  Interested organizations should contact fnmr@gov.sk.ca or call 306-798-0183 about their potential projects and for application information.  The Government of Saskatchewan continues to address the tragedy of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls through the following supports and programs.  The Ministry of Justice coordinates policy, legislation, and supports for families of missing persons, including Indigenous women and girls, through the Provincial Partnership Committee on Missing Persons (PPCMP).  The PPCMP is a unique Saskatchewan partnership which includes Indigenous and non-Indigenous community-based organizations; police; search and rescue; and several provincial ministries.  The Saskatchewan Coroners Service is working in collaboration with the Family Information Liaison Unit to assist families with finding the information they seek about their missing and murdered loved ones.  They have hired an Indigenous person to fill the position of Family Liaison Consultant.  The Ministry of Justice provides various service responses to address violence against aboriginal women and girls, including:  Three therapeutic family violence courts located in North Battleford, Regina and Saskatoon. Victim Services provides support to all victims of violent crime, and has two programs that specifically respond to the needs of Aboriginal victims. Three Missing Persons Liaison positions located in Regina, Saskatoon and Prince Albert.  The Missing Person Liaisons provide direct services to families of missing persons, as well as advice and training to all other police-based victim services in the province. There are ten provincially funded transition houses, one of which is co-funded with the federal government.  There are also three additional federally funded residential services.  The province has also made it a priority to increase the representation and enhance the voices of First Nations and Métis people in the justice system.  As such, five judges who have self-declared as Indigenous have been appointed to the Provincial Court of Saskatchewan since January 2018.  Three of them are women.   -30-  For more information, contact:  Marieka Andrew Justice  Regina Phone: 306-519-4608 Email: marieka.andrew@gov.sk.ca  Dan Palmer Government Relations Regina Phone: 306-787-7151 Email: dan.palmer@gov.sk.ca "
261,2020-06-03,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/june/03/lithium-production,Government Website,New Lithium Production Project In Saskatchewan," Released on June 3, 2020 Lithium exploration and development are coming to Saskatchewan, thanks to a new joint lithium project undertaken by Prairie Lithium Corp. (Prairie) and LiEP Energy Ltd. (LiEP).  The two companies started the Prairie-LiEP Critical Mineral (PLCM) Joint Venture, a two-stage pilot project that will produce lithium hydroxide from Saskatchewan oilfield brines.  The first stage is expected to begin this July, based in Regina, and the second stage is planned for the second half of 2021, with field operations in southern Saskatchewan.  “This is another exciting development that promotes economic diversification in Saskatchewan,” Energy and Resources Minister Bronwyn Eyre said.  “Lithium has great potential, due to increasing world-wide demand, which is why supporting extraction technologies and a viable lithium sector are included in Saskatchewan’s Growth Plan.”  “The lithium industry has the potential to be another significant economic driver and help our province through economic recovery,” Trade and Export Development Minister Jeremy Harrison said.  “We are pleased to welcome this new project to our province and look forward to the future opportunities it will bring for our residents.”    The PLCM Joint Venture project has been conditionally approved by the Ministry of Energy and Resources under the Saskatchewan Petroleum Innovation Incentive (SPII).  The project will be eligible to earn transferrable royalty credits worth 25 per cent of eligible capital and operating expenditures.  The SPII program targets a broad range of innovations deployed across all areas of Saskatchewan’s oil and gas industry, including for lithium.  The program is open to pilot projects and commercial scaling projects, providing applicants the opportunity to test their innovations in a pilot setting, then deploy them on a larger commercial scale.  “PLCM Joint Venture is excited to begin stage one of the pilot operation in Saskatchewan this summer,” Prairie and LiEP’s President and CEO Zach Maurer and CEO Haafiz Hasham said.  “The province has been great to work with and is committed to diversifying the economy through innovation.  We believe that Saskatchewan has the potential to be a global player in the production and chemical processing of lithium, and both companies are thrilled to be working toward proving that potential.”  Stage one of the project will produce 1 to 1.75 kilograms (kg) of lithium hydroxide per day.  Stage two will include the construction of one of Canada’s first lithium extraction and refining facilities, which will produce approximately one tonne of lithium hydroxide per day, resulting in 365 tonnes per year.  This will serve as a demonstration plant prior to full commercialization.  The entire process from raw brine to refined lithium product is anticipated to take under six hours, which is a vast improvement on the current industry standard of 18 months.  The global demand for lithium is forecasted to grow by ten per cent, per year, between 2019 and 2024 due to the expanding use of rechargeable lithium ion batteries in electric cars and portable electronic devices.  Lithium is identified as a critical mineral in the Canada-US Joint Action Plan on Critical Minerals Collaboration, as it has important applications in other advanced and clean technologies.  Batteries represent up to 45 per cent of the lithium market, but it is also used to produce glass and ceramics (up to 30 per cent) or greases and lubricants (up to 10 per cent).  Both parties are working with the Government of Saskatchewan and will ensure that necessary environmental processes and other needed permits are completed through to commercialization.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Ashley Schoff Energy and Resources Regina Phone: 306-787-5582 Email: ashley.schoff2@gov.sk.ca "

Formerly known as the Municipal Roads for the Economy Program, the RIRG will continue to assist RMs with the costs of constructing and upgrading municipal roads, bridges and culverts to support growth.  One of the changes is allowing RMs to complete construction projects over two years.    Some rural road projects have been approved already, so work can begin this construction season.  A second intake for additional projects will begin soon.  The Government of Saskatchewan has invested more than $9.8 billion in highways infrastructure since 2008, improving more than 15,500 km of Saskatchewan highways.  Another $300 million in highways stimulus funds will be invested over the next two years to stimulate Saskatchewan’s economic recovery.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Steve Shaheen Highways and Infrastructure Regina Phone: 306-933-5641 Email: steve.shaheen@gov.sk.ca "

All lab tests have limitations.  False positive or false negative results may occur.   The probability of a false positive result occurring increases as the prevalence of a disease in a population decreases.  If a positive test result is in question, the original sample is re-tested, and an additional sample is also taken for testing.  If these are negative, the initial finding is determined to be a false positive.  When no symptoms are present, testing one day doesn’t mean you’re negative for COVID-19.  False negative results may occur early in the course of the infection, for example if someone was tested too soon after being exposed to COVID-19.  Get tested again if symptoms develop.  This is why it is crucial for Saskatchewan residents to continue to take precautions to stop the spread of COVID-19 at all times.

265,2020-06-01,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/june/01/mining-week,Government Website,Saskatchewan Celebrates Mining Week," Released on June 1, 2020 The Government of Saskatchewan, with the Saskatchewan Mining Association, has proclaimed May 31 to June 6, as Mining Week. The week, which includes a virtual launch, activities and presentations, highlights Saskatchewan’s world-class mining sector, its extensive contributions to local communities and the provincial and global economy.  This year’s theme is “Mining: Essential to Local and Global Communities.”  Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and temporary market conditions, Saskatchewan’s mining sector is well-positioned to emerge as a leader in the provincial economic recovery, promoting food security and supplying critical resources, including clean energy, to the world.  In 2019, Saskatchewan produced 12.6Mt K2O of potash, more than any other country and about 30 per cent of the world total.  Saskatchewan is also the world’s second-largest uranium producer, accounting for approximately 13 per cent of global production.      “This week highlights the resilience and success of our mining sector and its growing diversification, including into diamonds, nickel and copper,” Energy and Resources Minister Bronwyn Eyre said.  “In recent years, Saskatchewan has proudly welcomed new mining companies to the province.  We offer some of the most extensive mineral research labs in the world, internationally renowned geoscience and extensive junior exploration opportunities.”  Saskatchewan remains a favourable jurisdiction for investment in mineral exploration and development.  The province offers a stable regulatory environment, competitive royalty structures, and various incentives, including a Provincial Sales Tax exemption for exploratory and downhole drilling activity and the Targeted Mineral Exploration Incentive, which supports exploration for precious and base metals and diamonds.  “The products we mine are essential for providing food and clean energy to global communities, while providing essential jobs for Saskatchewan residents and revenues to governments,” Saskatchewan Mining Association President Pam Schwann said.  Estimated exploration expenditures in the province for 2019 were $281 million, with more than $2.3 billion in expenditures over the past decade.  Saskatchewan’s mining industry generated $7.4 billion in sales in 2019 and more than $72.3 billion since 2010.

267,2020-06-01,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/june/01/accessability-week,Government Website,Government Proclaims AccessAbility Week," Released on June 1, 2020                  The Government of Saskatchewan is joining many provinces across the country in proclaiming May 31-June 6, as National AccessAbility Week.  National AccessAbility Week in Saskatchewan is a time to promote inclusion and accessibility in communities and workplaces.  It is also a time to recognize the efforts of individuals, communities and workplaces that are actively removing barriers to give Saskatchewan people with disabilities an equal chance to participate in their communities.  This year’s national theme is “Because I can.”  “In our government’s new Plan for Growth, we committed to engaging the province to create accessibility legislation for Saskatchewan,” Social Services Minister Paul Merriman said.  “I want to reaffirm our commitment to implementing Saskatchewan’s Disability Strategy by creating accessibility legislation that will remove and prevent accessibility barriers for people with disabilities.”  Since 1964, Spinal Cord Injury Saskatchewan has provided leadership in the development and delivery of programs, services, and resources to Saskatchewan people living with spinal cord injuries and other physical disabilities.  “During these uncertain times of navigating through a pandemic, supporting people living with disabilities remains a priority,” Spinal Cord Injury Saskatchewan Executive Director Launel Scott said.  “The impact of day-to-day challenges experienced by everyone are heightened, and demonstrate the need to move forward in strategies that will enhance access to services across Saskatchewan.  As communities and organizations are not in a position to host physical events during National AccessAbility Week 2020, we will applaud the efforts of many individuals and sectors for the enhancement of accessibility and inclusion through social media opportunities.”  This proclamation supports the Saskatchewan Disability Strategy by helping to create awareness and understanding of the rights of people with disabilities.  Saskatchewan residents and communities that have done work which aligns with the Disability Strategy are encouraged to share their accomplishments using the hashtag #SKDisability.

This project is part of the Government of Saskatchewan’s $7.5 billion two-year capital plan to build a strong Saskatchewan and stimulate Saskatchewan’s economic recovery.  “This project will help jumpstart economic activity in the province by bringing both immediate jobs to our construction industry and long-term benefits to our mining and minerals industry,” Minister Responsible for SRC Jeremy Harrison said.  “Projects like this are just one of the many steps we are taking as a government to build a strong Saskatchewan and aid in our province’s economic recovery.”    “This infrastructure investment will allow SRC to consolidate SRC’s mining and minerals operations into a single fit-for-purpose building so we can continue to provide critical services to support the mining and minerals industry in the province and beyond,” SRC President and CEO Mike Crabtree said.  “It will allow SRC to optimize and expand expertise and capabilities thereby more effectively enabling Saskatchewan’s natural resource industries, including diamond, potash, uranium, gold and base metals, to thrive.”  SRC has been working in step with the mining industry since the 1960s and throughout its history, SRC’s goal has been to create positive value for the province.  Today, SRC provides services to support all aspects of the mining industry from geoscience, exploration, extraction, processing and tailings management, to remediation.  SRC’s work with clients enhances and improves Saskatchewan’s presence in the minerals industry – a key sector creating wealth in the province.  This is done by supporting new mineral discoveries, developing new methods and tools, as well as finding efficiencies, cost reductions, energy reductions and environmental benefits.  SRC is one of Canada’s leading providers of applied research, development and demonstration (RD&D), and technology commercialization.  With 73 years of RD&D experience, SRC provides services and products to its 1,500 clients in 27 countries around the world.

Guidelines for these groups are included in this week’s update of the Government of Saskatchewan’s plan to re-open the provincial economy.  Last week it was announced that the target date for Phase 3 of Re-Open Saskatchewan would be June 8, 2020.  Restaurants and licensed establishments, gyms and fitness facilities, places of worship and child care facilities are among the groups able to re-open in Phase 3.  Personal service businesses that did not open in Phase 2 are also allowed to begin providing services.  A list of these businesses is available in the Re-Open Saskatchewan plan.  The initial guidelines for the re-opening of places of worship were developed in consultation with faith leaders.  Consultation with these leaders will continue in advance of Phase 3 to support resumption of worship services beginning on June 8.  As restrictions on businesses and services are gradually lifted in the province, additional information continues to be added to the Re-Open Saskatchewan plan based on direction from public health officials and input from businesses and service providers.  In addition to the new guidelines for places of worship and child care facilities, other additions to the plan this week include:  Updates to the guidelines for appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) Updates to COVID-19 workplace information Updates to the personal care services guidelines Updates to the restaurants and licensed establishments guidelines  In addition, following are some updates on other work taking place to gradually re-open the province.  Limited Research Activities to Resume at Universities In the near future, limited on-campus research activities will resume at the University of Saskatchewan, University of Regina and Saskatchewan Polytechnic.  These institutions, in collaboration with public health officials, have developed plans and procedures to ensure a safe environment for students and researchers.  These plans include measures to ensure appropriate physical distancing, increased cleaning protocols and limited access to facilities.  Use of Municipal Parks playgrounds, swimming pools and splash pads remain closed, but the use of greenspace is still allowed.  Physical distancing must be maintained and activities must adhere to the public health order and guidelines in the Re-Open Saskatchewan plan.  All businesses that are eligible to re-open must follow the guidelines in the Re-Open Saskatchewan plan and the current public health order.  However, businesses are not required to open at this time and can determine when they are ready to open and operate in a safe manner.

The province will invest $1.5 million in improvements to 15 community airports around the province.  When combined with local matching dollars, this represents a $3 million investment in airport infrastructure.  “Community and regional airports contribute to our economy by supporting vital public services like Saskatchewan’s Air Ambulance, law enforcement and fire suppression,” Highways and Infrastructure Minister Greg Ottenbreit said.  “These projects will be completed this year, providing an immediate boost to communities as we begin to reopen our economy.”  The province boosted the program by 21 per cent when it released its Estimates in March.  In May, an additional $660,000 in stimulus funds were added, resulting in an overall investment of $1.5 million.  That’s a year-over-year increase of 114 per cent.  “The Swift Current Airport is a vital transportation hub that serves the greater Southwest Saskatchewan region,” City of Swift Current Mayor Denis Perrault said.  “The funds granted under the Community Airport Partnership program through the Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure will allow us to make significant improvements to our primary runway and to continue to pursue economic development initiatives that require this infrastructure.”  “The grant of $275,000 is what makes it possible to rehabilitate our failing airport apron,” Melfort Mayor Rick Lang said.  “Our airport is of great significance to the City of Melfort and to our surrounding Rural Municipalities as it enables such important services as aerial application and air ambulance.  We are truly grateful for this provincial partnership with our city.”  CAP supports local airports offset the costs of rehabilitation and infrastructure improvements, with cost-shared grants up to a maximum of $275,000.  For the first time in the program’s history, three airports will receive the maximum grant.  This year’s investment will result in improvements to the following airports:  Esterhazy – $5,883 – runway and apron repairs Humboldt – $12,500 – Relocating power lines Kindersley – $9,000 – crack filling runway and apron, surface repairs to taxiway Leader – $36,172.50 – crack repair and slurry seal Maidstone – $5,926.17 – crack seal runway, taxiway and apron Maple Creek - $43,965 – runway sealing Melfort – $275,000 – full rehabilitation of apron Moosomin – $275,000 – Phase 2 of runway construction North Battleford – $135,000 – final phase of resurfacing main runway Prince Albert – $241,500 – Taxiway F edge lighting, pull-pits, and information sign, Taxiway B installation of storm sewer and catch basins Rockglen – $5,000 – bring airport back into service Swift Current – $275,000 – paint markings, major rehabilitation of asphalt surfaces Unity – $88,450 – runway resurfacing Weyburn – $72,500 – full rehabilitation of main runway Wynyard – $45,000 – repair cracks, slurry seal and paint markings  Most of this year’s additional funds come from the government’s $2 billion stimulus package that will increase investment in infrastructure to $7.5 billion over the next two years.  The Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure will invest $300 million into stimulus projects that include TMS upgrades, passing lanes and improvements to municipal roads and airports.  Since 2007, more than $9 million has been invested in community airports and coupled with 50-50 matching community contributions the program has generated more than $18 million in airport improvements.  A total of 36 different communities have benefited since the program began.

CBSA officers at the port of Regway identified a boat owned by Canadian travellers as high-risk, and notified the ministry.  Because the travellers were required to self-isolate upon their return to the country, the watercraft was sealed, to be inspected at a later date.  During the scheduled inspection last week, conservation officers found invasive mussels inside one of the boat’s storage compartments.  The ministry’s fisheries staff decontaminated the watercraft to ensure that it no longer poses a threat.    “This discovery really highlights the level of co-ordination it takes to ensure that Saskatchewan waters are protected from aquatic invasive species,” Environment Minister Dustin Duncan said.  “Saskatchewan works closely with partners from other jurisdictions, including the CBSA, and it’s always gratifying when our co-operation is able to achieve a positive result like this one.”  The ministry believes it is likely the mussels were picked up by the anchor, and reminds boaters to carefully inspect accessories such as anchors, ropes, buoys and the compartments where they are stored while completing Clean, Drain and Dry protocols on their watercraft.  In Saskatchewan, it is unlawful to transport invasive mussels or other prohibited species, dead or alive.  AIS are plant, animal and invertebrate species that threaten our waterways and can damage aquatic habitat, fisheries, valuable recreational resources and important power generation, irrigation and municipal water infrastructure.  AIS can be impossible to eliminate once established in a waterbody, and can cost millions of dollars annually to manage.  To report aquatic invasive species, call the 24-hour SASKTIP line at 1-800-667-7561.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Jamie Gibson Environment Regina Phone: 306-519-9290 Email: jamie.gibson@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-519-9290 "

Additionally, approximately $150,000 will be used to replace porcelain toilets in the detention area at the Regina Provincial Court House with stainless steel toilets and sinks designed to reduce any potential for self-harm.  Design and construction on these projects will take place over the next two fiscal years.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Noel Busse Corrections and Policing/Justice Regina Phone: 306-787-8959 Email: noel.busse@gov.sk.ca "

Visitors are reminded that until further notice, beaches, swimming pools and playgrounds remain closed, in addition to laundry and shower facilities.  Access to washrooms will be limited so campers will need to plan accordingly.  Signage will be available throughout the parks to remind visitors of safety protocols and restrictions.  In addition, park staff will be implementing enhanced cleaning and sanitization procedures.  Campers are asked to bring their own hand sanitizer and disinfectant products, maintain physical distance from others, respect the restrictions and rules and to stay home if they are not feeling well.    By working together, park staff and visitors can ensure parks remain safe spaces for all.  While park events and interpretive programs are currently on hold, most parks will have Sask Parks Pick-up Activity Kits available to use.  These do-it-yourself packs will help bring the joy of play and nature exploration to families, without the need to gather in large groups.  New activities will be available for pick up daily, with topics ranging from navigation and survival to campfire cooking and history.  In-park posters will provide details on where the activity kits can be picked up.  For those still looking to virtually access the parks, Sask Cyber Parks will continue through the month of June on the Sask Parks Facebook page at www.facebook.com/saskparks.

278,2020-05-28,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/may/28/funding-for-caregivers,Government Website,Government Announces $1.125 Million In Funding For Caregivers," Released on May 28, 2020                  The Government of Saskatchewan has announced additional respite funding for caregivers of people with intellectual disabilities during the pandemic.  This funding provides $100 per month from June to September 2020 to pay for respite or respite activities.  This benefit will help fill the gap that the closure of day programs, as well as the shortage of part-time work and volunteer opportunities, has created.  Many respite options, including summer camps, have been closed during the pandemic to ensure the health and safety of staff and clients.  This funding allows caregivers to access broader respite options that work in a person-centred or family-focused way during the current situation in Saskatchewan.  “Caregivers are doing tremendous work providing care and support to people with intellectual disabilities during this pandemic – often 24 hours a day, seven days a week,” Social Services Minister Paul Merriman said.  “With increased pressures during this time, they need a break to be able to maintain their supports.  This benefit will help with that during the next four months.”  Approximately 2,800 caregivers will be eligible for these pandemic respite payments, including families caring for adult Community Living Service Delivery clients in their homes; families receiving the Family Respite Benefit for children under the age of 18 with an intellectual disability; and Approved Private Service Home (APSH) proprietors, including Mental Health Approved Home proprietors.  “Respite is essential for the health and well-being of parents and caregivers of a child or young adult with special needs,” Hope’s Home Regina CEO Jacqueline Tisher said.  “It gives them the break they need to rejuvenate and continue 24-hour care, especially during these challenging times when there is a decrease in respite options, this support is so important.”  “The respite package would come as a positive impact for the home,” APSH proprietor in Maidstone and caregiver to four individuals with intellectual disabilities Susan Klein said.  “We could go out and spend more time to ourselves, but also enjoy time together as a household and not always have to worry about the little things.”  “For some parents this is a stressful time, so every little bit helps,” father of Kyle Dave Thickett said.  Since the closure of the day program in Meadow Lake, Kyle has spent his time at home.  “Thank you for being aware of what we are doing,” APSH proprietor from Saskatoon Lejam Petros said.  “Regardless of how big or small the money is, it gives us the feeling that we are appreciated for the work that we do.”  The benefit supports the Saskatchewan Disability Strategy recommendation nine, Valuing Families, by helping families get time away from their caregiving role.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Leya Moore Social Services Regina Phone: 306-787-3610 Email: leya.moore@gov.sk.ca "

Crops have started to emerge in many areas of the province.  The southwest is the farthest along, with 92 per cent of the crop seeded in the region.  There is 84 per cent seeded in the southeast, 80 per cent seeded in the west-central, 75 per cent seeded in the northwest, 73 per cent seeded in the northeast and 69 per cent seeded in the east-central.  Many parts of the province received some rainfall this week, with the western regions receiving the most.  The Cando area received the highest amount of rain this week with 100 mm.  While rain delayed seeding for some farmers in the west-central and northwest regions, it was welcome to help support crop and pasture growth.  Windy conditions throughout the province have continued to dry the topsoil, but rain showers helped maintain moisture conditions.    Cropland topsoil moisture is rated as three per cent surplus, 78 per cent adequate, 17 per cent short and two per cent very short. Hay and pasture land topsoil moisture is rated as three per cent surplus, 71 per cent adequate, 23 per cent short and three per cent very short.  Pasture conditions are rated as five per cent excellent, 52 per cent good, 33 per cent fair, nine per cent poor and one per cent very poor.  Earlier seeded crops have started to show good emergence, but cool overnight temperatures have slowed growth in some areas.  Farmers are starting post-emergence weed control in earlier seeded fields that could not be sprayed previously due to the wind.  In general, crops are in line with normal development stages for this time of year.  Windy conditions in some areas have reduced topsoil moisture, resulting in delayed emergence of some oilseeds.  Most of the crop damage this week was due to strong winds, light frosts, limited moisture and flea beetles.  Farmers have been busy seeding, moving livestock to pasture, calving and spraying pre-emergence and post-emergence herbicides.

280,2020-05-28,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/may/28/helium-facility,Government Website,Canada’s Largest Helium Purification Facility To Be Built In Saskatchewan," Released on May 28, 2020 Saskatchewan will soon be home to the largest helium purification operation in Canada.  The new facility will be constructed by North American Helium Inc. (NAH) near Battle Creek, Saskatchewan.  It is expected to be in-service by July, 2021, with construction starting in October, 2020.  “Helium production in Saskatchewan is set to take off,” Energy and Resources Minister Bronwyn Eyre said.  “The building of this purification facility by North American Helium will enable the province to scale helium production and important export capacity.  In Saskatchewan’s Plan for Growth, we committed to developing this industry and have implemented strong policies to support new investment just like this.”  “We are fortunate to be operating in a jurisdiction with a supportive regulatory structure, favorable geology for helium production and a skilled workforce,” North American Helium's Chairman and CEO Nicholas Snyder said.  “The government has shown a commitment to the development of this industry in Saskatchewan, which will contribute new production needed to replace depleting natural-gas-linked helium sources in North America.  Our Battle Creek project demonstrates that reliable long-term production of helium can be created from non-hydrocarbon sources, which means a smaller environmental footprint while still benefiting from the expertise developed in Saskatchewan's oil service industry.”    “This project will bring new jobs and economic growth to the southwest region, a part of Saskatchewan that prides itself on resource development and economic growth,” Cypress Hills MLA and Legislative Secretary for Energy and Resources Doug Steele said.  “The construction of this plant in the Battle Creek area signals the world-class investment climate Saskatchewan offers and we acknowledge North American Helium for their significant work in the region.”  Recent regulatory amendments introduced an expanded Provincial Sales Tax exemption for exploratory and downhole drilling activity, which includes drilling for helium.  Saskatchewan has a stable and highly competitive 4.25 per cent royalty rate for helium.  In addition, the NAH helium project has been conditionally approved by the Ministry of Energy and Resources for the Oil and Gas Processing Investment Incentive, which provides new or expanded helium processing and liquefaction facilities with a 15 per cent transferrable royalty credit based on capital expenditures.  The North American Helium project has also been approved through the environmental assessment process.  Canada has the fifth-largest helium resources in the world, with significant underground reserves in Saskatchewan.  Global demand for helium is increasing, as a global supply shortage has resulted in helium prices rising more than 160 per cent since 2017.  Over the last five years, just under 20 wells have been drilled in Saskatchewan (the vast majority of which were in southwest Saskatchewan), specifically targeting helium. The Saskatchewan Geological Survey continues to analyze around 88,000 oil and gas wells across the southern half of the province to determine how many have a helium occurrence of greater than one per cent, which is a good indicator of viability.  Helium is used in various applications, including medical research and diagnostic testing, digital technologies, semiconductors, fibre optics, nuclear power facilities, rocket systems, welding and balloons.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Ashley Schoff Energy and Resources Regina Phone: 306-787-5582 Email: ashley.schoff2@gov.sk.ca "

As of May 27, 2020, there are three new cases of COVID-19, bringing the provincial total to 637.  Two of the new cases are in the Regina region and one is in the Far North.  Of the 637 reported cases, 68 are considered active. Ten more people have recovered, bringing the provincial total to 559.  There are currently four people in hospital – one is receiving inpatient care (in Regina) and three are in intensive care (all in Saskatoon).  Of the 637 cases in the province:  141 cases are travellers; 363 are community contacts (including mass gatherings); 77 have no known exposures; and 56 are under investigation by local public health.  Overall in Saskatchewan:  50 cases are health care workers; however, the source of the infections may not be related to health care in all instances. 253 of the cases are from the Far North, 167 are from the Saskatoon area, 111 from the North, 78 from the Regina area, 16 from the South and 12 from the Central region. 93 cases involve people 19 years of age and under, while the remainder are adults. 227 cases are in the 20-39 age range; 195 are in the 40-59 age range; 104 are in the 60-79 age range; and 18 are in the 80-plus range. 51 per cent of the cases are females and 49 per cent are males. 10 deaths related to COVID-19 have been reported to date.  To date, 45,118 COVID-19 tests have been performed in the province.  As of May 25, 2020, when other provincial and national numbers were last available from the Public Health Agency of Canada, Saskatchewan’s per capita rate was 34,492 people tested per million population.  The national rate was 39,920 people tested per million population.  Public and Private Gatherings  After weeks of staying home and with the warmer weather upon us, it can be tempting to host a big family gathering.  However, Saskatchewan residents should remember that the public health order limiting both public and private gatherings to no more than 10 people remains in force.  Measures to stop the spread of COVID-19 must continue:  Continue physical distancing of two metres. You can form an extended household group with one or two families or friends.  This group must remain consistent.  Do not visit different families or friends every day. People in the same extended household group without high-risk people can be closer than two metres. The limit on gathering sizes still applies to extended household groups.  You should always be aware of who you have been in contact with over the past two weeks.  If you test positive for COVID-19, these are the people who will need to be contacted by public health.  If you are experiencing symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath, headaches, aches and pains, sore throat, chills, runny nose or a loss of your sense of taste or smell, contact HealthLine 811 or your family physician for advice on whether you should be tested for COVID-19.  You can also take the online self-assessment at www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19.

The province is currently working with the federal government to ensure a seamless transition from the federally-appointed CFO to one that is provincially appointed.  “We believe a provincially-appointed Chief Firearms Officer will be well positioned to represent Saskatchewan’s position on firearms regulation to the federal government,” Corrections and Policing Minister Christine Tell said.  “Our government will always stand beside law-abiding Saskatchewan firearms owners, and we believe a provincially-appointed CFO will assist in that advocacy.”  The CFO is responsible for administering the federal Firearms Act in the province and has jurisdiction over the licensing, transporting and carrying of firearms.  The CFO also licenses instructors to deliver firearms safety courses in the province.  A preferred applicant will have extensive experience in the field of firearm safety as well as experience with firearms laws in Canada.  The applicant should also have a broad understanding of the diverse and unique demographic of Saskatchewan firearms owners.  “While this position does not have the ability to change federal laws or regulations, a provincially-appointed Chief Firearms Officer would best be able to articulate Saskatchewan’s concerns to the federal government on these issues while also respectfully engaging with the Saskatchewan firearms community,” Tell said.  Government plans to post for the position of a provincially-appointed CFO on http://www.careers.gov.sk.ca/ tomorrow with a closing date of June 10.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Noel Busse Corrections and Policing/Justice Regina Phone: 306-787-8959 Email: noel.busse@gov.sk.ca "
284,2020-05-27,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/may/27/nrgene,Government Website,Saskatchewan Welcomes NRGene To Province," Released on May 27, 2020 Leading Genomics Company Expands Operations to Canada with Saskatoon Office  The Government of Saskatchewan is welcoming NRGene, a leading genomics company, to the province.  Headquartered in Israel, the company announced they are expanding their operations to Canada and will be opening an office in Saskatoon.  This investment from NRGene follows a successful trade mission to Israel in 2018, where Trade and Export Development Minister Jeremy Harrison and Deputy Premier Gordon Wyant met with the company to highlight opportunities in Saskatchewan.  The purpose of the trade mission was to showcase Saskatchewan’s business environment and our world class agriculture sector, as well as to encourage Israeli companies to establish a presence in the province.  “This announcement is good news for Saskatchewan and it is a positive sign that the province’s investment climate remains strong, despite the current challenges due to the global COVID-19 pandemic,” Harrison said.  “NRGene will be a great fit for Saskatchewan’s agricultural sciences cluster, bringing good jobs and capacity that will enhance our innovative AgTech, and increasing productivity in the agri-food sector.”    NRGene is a genomics AI company that provides turn-key solutions to support agricultural research and breeding.  Relying on a vast proprietary genomic database and AI-based technologies, NRGene provides some of the largest ag-based companies in the world with the computational tools they require to improve breeding of crop plants and farm animals, thus increasing food production from every acre of agricultural land.  NRGene’s tools have been implemented by leading seed, ag-chemical and ag biotech companies worldwide, as well as by many influential research teams in academia.  The Government of Saskatchewan has been working with NRGene since 2015, when Innovation Saskatchewan first met with NRGene’s team at a workshop, as they have been involved in Saskatchewan’s wheat genome project demonstrating how advanced genomics technology can boost wheat yield.  Since then, NRGene has generated multiple successful collaborations in Saskatchewan with the University of Saskatchewan, the Global Institute for Food Security (GIFS), Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) and additional local commercial companies and academia.  These collaborations cover multiple crops, including bread-wheat, durum wheat, canola, legumes, mustard, flax, cannabis and more.  In January 2020, it was announced that an international consortium, including GIFS researchers at the University of Saskatchewan and NRGene, had successfully completed the assembly of multiple canola reference genomes.  “With the world class agricultural research cluster in Saskatoon, the burgeoning AgTech sector, and such a strong history of primary production, we see in Canada a natural location for NRGene to expand its operations,” NRGene CEO and co-founder Dr. Gil Ronen said.  “We know this firsthand, having recently collaborated on the exciting genomics projects in wheat and canola, so we are pleased to make this important investment in Saskatchewan.”  With this investment in the province, NRGene will recruit skilled geneticists and data scientists to their new office in Saskatoon.  Continued international engagement and dialogue with companies like NRGene will continue to be a priority as the province works toward economic recovery.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Ashley Schoff Trade and Export Development Regina Phone: 306-787-5582 Email: ashley.schoff2@gov.sk.ca  Yana Voldman NRGene Phone: 972-50-900-2844 Email: Yana.voldman@nrgene.com "

The investment, including upgrades to Griffiths Stadium at the University of Saskatchewan, are part of the province’s $7.5 billion two-year capital stimulus package announced May 6.  “An investment in physical infrastructure pays off in two ways,” Advanced Education Minister Tina Beaudry-Mellor said.  “By upgrading bricks and mortar, we safeguard our public institutions for the long term and provide much-needed construction jobs over the short term.  More people working puts more money back into our economy and generates lasting benefits for the community.”    The three projects include:  $3.1 million upgrades to the field and lighting at University of Saskatchewan’s Griffiths Stadium $2.5 million roof replacement at University of Regina’s College of Kinesiology $12 million renovation to several buildings at Saskatchewan Polytechnic’s Moose Jaw Campus  Griffiths Stadium is home to the Saskatchewan Huskies football team, winner of three Vanier Cups and recognized as one of the best programs in Canadian university sports.  The field will be expanded to accommodate soccer and rugby, energy efficient lighting added and stadium turf replaced to ensure a safe playing surface that can meet accreditation.  Improvements will also benefit community groups which account for 40 per cent of the stadium’s usage.  The Moose Jaw project will increase campus usability and safety for students, faculty and staff.  Facilities to be renovated house the Construction, Electrical, Welding, Automotive and Civil Water programs.  Replacing the roof on the Kinesiology Building will prevent further damage to floors in the gymnasia and protect other areas of the building from similar issues.  The facility is vital for degrees in Kinesiology, Gerontology, Sport and Recreational Studies and Health Studies.  Research being done at the school supports stroke victims and people with Multiple Sclerosis.  Construction is expected to begin this year and finish in all projects by the spring of 2022, supporting the province’s Growth Plan commitment to build strong communities by investing $30 billion in infrastructure over the next decade.  “As we re-open Saskatchewan and emerge from the pandemic, it is important to look to the future,” Beaudry-Mellor said.  “These projects increase our post-secondary capabilities and reinforce our commitment to students’ safety and wellbeing in both academic and athletic pursuits.”  -30-  For more information, contact:  Glen Kirby Advanced Education Regina Phone: 306-787-6041 Email: glen.kirby@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-537-6455 "

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought tourism, worldwide, to an abrupt halt, causing severe, long-term effects and an uncertain future.  Saskatchewan’s tourism sector has experienced serious setbacks and faces a lengthy road to recovery.  The timing of Saskatchewan Tourism Week coincides with the gradual re-opening of some of the province’s tourism businesses and resources, including parks and campgrounds.  The week is an opportunity to showcase stories of creativity and resilience, acknowledge support among communities and broaden understanding of the diverse nature and important contributions of Saskatchewan’s tourism sector.    “The Government of Saskatchewan is pleased to proclaim Saskatchewan Tourism Week and acknowledge the people and experiences that make our province an inviting destination,” Minister Responsible for Tourism Saskatchewan Gene Makowsky said.  “As we move through the phases of re-opening the province, I encourage residents to support local tourism businesses while continuing safe social distancing.”  “Each year, Saskatchewan Tourism Week highlights why tourism matters and how our industry contributes significantly to our province’s economy and quality of life,” Tourism Saskatchewan CEO Mary Taylor-Ash said.  “Tourism Saskatchewan is eager to convey these important messages during this challenging time for tourism.  The week will continue to be an occasion that unites our industry and brings attention to the innovative, hardworking and resilient people who make tourism happen.  It is an opportunity to share their stories, and remind everyone of the incredible tourism experiences available right here in Saskatchewan.”  Tourism Saskatchewan will take full advantage of digital marketing to share tourism stories that highlight the creativity of the tourism industry as well as community support during the COVID-19 pandemic.  A series of videos will be posted on Tourism Saskatchewan’s consumer and industry social media channels, beginning on May 25.  Industry operators are invited to post videos and images of their own operations/customers, using the hashtag #SKTourismWeek.  The content will shed light on how tourism operators are navigating current circumstances and adjusting their services.

Each agency is an independent community-based organization with its own independent board of directors.  Many of these agencies deliver residential and day program services and supports to people with intellectual disabilities.  “SARC Members are a large workforce of incredibly hardworking professionals who are committed to serving their community and providing excellent supports for people experiencing disability every day,” SARC Executive Director Amy McNeil said.  “Amidst this pandemic, the critical nature of their work has possibly never been more apparent.  Let’s take some time this week to celebrate our sector and acknowledge the essential work and services provided by those who work in it.”  This proclamation supports the Saskatchewan Disability Strategy by recognizing the value of disability service providers and direct-support workers who provide services for people with disabilities.  Saskatchewan residents and communities that have done work which aligns with the Disability Strategy are encouraged to share their accomplishments using the hashtag #SKDisability.

In 2020-21, the Elizabeth Fry Society of Saskatchewan will receive $85,000 and Oxford House Society of Regina will receive $60,000.  “The Elizabeth Fry Society and Oxford House Society provide critical programming and support to offenders,” Corrections and Policing Minister Christine Tell said.  “Thanks to the work of these organizations, individuals are in a much better position to succeed after completing their sentence, resulting in safer communities.”  The Elizabeth Fry Society helps adult female offenders access safe and affordable housing, mental health and addictions programming, pre-employment and education opportunities, and family re-unification support.  Collectively, these services help reduce the risk of re-offending.  “We thank the Ministry of Corrections and Policing for seeing the value in the services we provide to provincially incarcerated women in Saskatchewan,” Elizabeth Fry Society Executive Director Sandra Stack said.  “This renewal enables us to build upon the momentum this program has gained, and most importantly, it allows us to continue to assist women as they transition back into the community and address any barriers to reintegration they may be facing.”  Through this funding, Oxford House Society of Regina provides housing and support for ministry clients who have recently completed an addictions program and have limited options to continue their recovery in a stable environment.  Individuals are provided with drug- and alcohol-free housing, participate in addictions recovery, and engage in employment and educational opportunities.  “This funding agreement provides the basis of stability for Corrections, Oxford House and our community by providing safe, affordable housing and support so individuals have the opportunity to resume a healthy, productive lifestyle,” Oxford House Society of Regina Executive Director Blair Pope said.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Marieka Andrew Corrections and Policing Regina Phone: 306-519-4608 Email: marieka.andrew@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-519-4608              "

AIS can be impossible to eliminate once established in a waterbody, and can cost millions of dollars annually to manage.  Examples of AIS include the flowering rush, Prussian carp, zebra mussels and the spiny waterflea. Saskatchewan’s AIS program focuses on ongoing public education, promoting the Clean, Drain, Dry Program for watercraft, roadside boat inspections, decontaminations and regular monitoring of Saskatchewan’s busy waterbodies.  Prevention of zebra and quagga mussels remains a top priority for the province.  Efforts have been successful to date, with no invasive mussels found in Saskatchewan waterbodies.  Saskatchewan has eight mobile watercraft decontamination units to support its AIS inspection and decontamination program.  Two units will be set up at fixed points along the Manitoba border, three along the U.S. border, and the rest placed strategically throughout the province.    “Provincial regulations remain in place to protect our lakes and rivers, including requiring watercraft to have their boat plugs removed during transport to comply with the province’s Clean, Drain, Dry Program,” Duncan said.  “New for this year is a regulatory change that prohibits the collection of crayfish from any Saskatchewan waterbody, as well as prohibitions related to their use as bait for angling.”  Saskatchewan continues to partner with the federal Canada Border Services Agency and Department of Fisheries and Oceans, as well as provincial organizations and provincial governments in British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba and the Yukon to co-ordinate prevention efforts across Western Canada.  Partnerships also continue with the provincial AIS Task Force and the Invasive Species Centre for public education and monitoring, with a focus on the prevention, introduction and spread of AIS in Saskatchewan.

Guidance on Non-Medical Cloth Masks for the General Public  While the primary driver of COVID-19 transmission is by people who are symptomatic, there is evidence that some COVID-19 infected people who never develop symptoms or are not yet sick are able to transmit the virus.  The Public Health Agency of Canada now recommends wearing a non-medical cloth mask in community settings (even if you have no symptoms) where physical distancing is not possible or is unpredictable, such as on public transit or in grocery stores.  Avoid touching the mask – if you must adjust it, wash your hands afterward. Masks must not be shared with others. Put on and take off the mask with clean hands using the ear loops or ties, being careful not to touch your face. Non-medical masks or cloth face coverings should be washed after each use. Do not use face coverings on children under the age of two.  A homemade mask does not replace public health measures that are proven to be effective.  The best way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is to continue to:  stay home as much as possible; practise physical distancing; frequently wash your hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water; and cover your cough or sneezes with tissues or your sleeve.  Further information on masks can be found on the Public Health Agency of Canada website at https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/about-non-medical-masks-face-coverings.html.   If you are experiencing symptoms of fever, cough or shortness of breath, contact HealthLine 811 or your family physician for advice on whether you should be tested for COVID-19.  You can also take the online self-assessment at www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19.

299,2020-05-22,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/may/22/well-abandonment,Government Website,Government Launches New Inactive Well Program," Released on May 22, 2020 The Government of Saskatchewan is launching the Accelerated Site Closure Program (ASCP) for the abandonment and reclamation of inactive oil and gas wells and facilities to get Saskatchewan people back to work.  ASCP will access up to $400 million, over two years, subject to the conclusion of an agreement with Canada, through the federal COVID-19 Economic Response Plan.  It will be overseen by the Ministry of Energy and Resources and delivered in partnership with the Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC), which has technical expertise to provide engineering and oversight work.  The program will prioritize Saskatchewan-based service companies and support some 2,100 full-time equivalent jobs.  Up to 8,000 inactive wells and facilities will be abandoned and reclaimed over the life of the program.  “We have worked hard to develop a common sense, administratively simple program that creates much-needed jobs in the struggling oil and gas sector,” Energy and Resources Minister Bronwyn Eyre said.  “The ASCP will accelerate the retirement of wells and facilities, which have reached the end of their life cycle, and complete a substantial amount of environmentally important work in a short period of time.  For that, we would like to acknowledge the support of the federal government.”    The ASCP will be rolled out in several phases, with the funding component of the program administered by the SRC.  Phase 1 will allocate up to $100 million in funding to Saskatchewan service companies contracted to do abandonment and reclamation work.  “Working with Minister Eyre and the Government of Saskatchewan, we are creating needed jobs, cleaning up our environment, and supporting the hardworking people in our oil and gas sector,” Canada’s Minister of Natural Resources Seamus O’Regan said.  Under the ASCP, eligible licensees (operators) will use the Integrated Resource Information System (IRIS) to nominate inactive wells and facilities into the program.  Each licensee will be assigned a portion of planned expenditures, based on their share of total provincial liabilities for inactive wells and facilities.  Based on these nominations, the SRC will procure services from eligible service companies.  All contracting for services will take place exclusively between eligible licensees and service companies.  The SRC will provide direct funding, including an initial advance, to service companies for abandonment and reclamation work.  “We’d like to thank the Saskatchewan government for working to implement the ASCP in a timely manner,” Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors President and CEO Mark Scholz said.  “We are excited by the prospect of long-term jobs for Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors members who have been struggling to keep their employees working and their businesses viable.”  “Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers appreciates the Government of Saskatchewan’s efforts to design an Accelerated Site Closure Program that will help get Saskatchewan people back to work by focusing efforts on closure of inactive oil and natural gas sites,” Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers Vice-President, Western Canada Operations Brad Herald said.  “The initial phase of the program recognizes principles important to the sector including the efficient management of liability closure, while offering fair access to funds.  We continue to support Saskatchewan’s pragmatic approach to the program design while achieving government’s objectives.”  “Petroleum Services Association of Canada (PSAC) welcomes today’s announcement that will support urgently needed jobs for the oilfield services sector that PSAC represents during this unprecedented downturn,” PSAC Interim President and CEO Elizabeth Aquin said.  “We are pleased that this funding aligns with PSAC’s advocacy for a mechanism to close inactive wells and that the Government of Saskatchewan has supported this win-win solution that creates jobs while also providing environmental benefits.  This program will also help to retain and expand key skills and expertise for Canada’s responsible resource development and stewardship of the land.”  For further information about ASCP, companies can contact the Ministry of Energy and Resources Service Desk at 1-855-219-9373, or ER.servicedesk@gov.sk.ca, visit www.saskatchewan.ca/Business/Agriculture-Natural-Resources-and-Industry/Oil-and-Gas/Accelerated-Site-Closure-Program or https://src.nu/wells.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Kristin Kutarna-Gates Energy and Resources Regina Phone: 306-787-8360 Email: kristin.kutarnagates@gov.sk.ca "

Phase 2 of the plan began this week.  In Phase 3, restaurants and licensed establishments will be able to open at 50 per cent capacity.  Gyms and fitness facilities will also be able to open for business, as will childcare facilities and places of worship – subject to guidelines that are being developed.  Personal service businesses that did not open in Phase 2 are also allowed to begin providing services.  This includes:  Estheticians; Tattoo artists; Make-up applicators; Electrologists; Manicurists; Pedicurists; Sun tanning parlours; Facilities in which body piercing, bone grafting or scarification services are provided; and Other personal service facilities.  As restrictions on businesses and services are gradually lifted in the province, additional information continues to be added to the Re-Open Saskatchewan plan based on direction from public health officials and input from businesses and service providers.  Changes to the plan this week focus on Phase 3 and include information on restaurants and licensed establishments, gyms and fitness facilities and places of worship.  The size of indoor public and private gatherings will increase to 15 people in Phase 3, while the size of outdoor gatherings will increase to 30.  Guidelines are currently being developed for restaurants and licensed establishments, and gyms and fitness facilities.  They will be included in the updated plan, which will be available at www.saskatchewan.ca/re-open on Friday.  Guidelines for the safe re-opening of places of worship will be developed in consultation with faith leaders.  Further information will be added to these guidelines and others will be developed as the Re-Open Saskatchewan plan continues to be updated to allow business operators and service providers to prepare to re-open.  All businesses that are eligible to re-open must follow the guidelines in the Re-Open Saskatchewan plan and the current public health order.  However, businesses are not required to open at this time and can determine when they are ready to open and operate in a safe manner.  SARCAN is also preparing to resume its recycling operations in the near future.  Beginning June 8, commercial and bulk customers will be able to bring in their recycling by appointment only.  SARCAN will open to the general public on June 15.

Construction is underway on a total of $93 million worth of work on Highway 39.  Work between Hitchcock and Weyburn includes five sets of passing lanes, about 35 km of paving, culvert replacements, a new Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) and various safety improvements.  Construction is also underway on Highway 39 between McTaggart to Milestone, which includes four sets of passing lanes and about 25 km of paving and crews have also begun work on 32 km of Highway 39 from Corinne to Rouleau.  Work is underway on the $18.8 million first phase of a multi-year project on Highway 5, which includes about 10 km of widening and sight-line improvements through the hills and valleys east of the old Highway 27 to Blucher Road.  Crews will be making their best efforts to accommodate traffic during the construction period.  There are no viable detour options around the work zones, so drivers can expect delay times approaching 30 minutes.  It is best to use an alternate route such as Highways 41, 27 or Highway 16 and 2.  These routes are currently signed as an alternate route.  Drivers are reminded to be patient, expect long delays, watch for workers and obey signs when driving through the work zone.  A weekly construction update on www.saskatchewan.ca provides Saskatchewan residents with the latest details on projects underway to help plan safe and efficient travel throughout the summer and fall.  Additional travel information about emergency road closures, the status of ferries, barges and other road activities can also be found on the Highway Hotline at www.saskatchewan.ca/Highwayhotline.  Information and concerns about a provincial highway can be made by calling 1-844-SK-HIWAY.  The Government of Saskatchewan has invested more than $9.8 billion in highways infrastructure since 2008, improving more than 15,500 km of Saskatchewan highways.  Another $300 million in highways stimulus funds will be invested over the next two years to stimulate Saskatchewan’s economic recovery.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Steve Shaheen Highways and Infrastructure Regina Phone: 306-933-5641 Email: steve.shaheen@gov.sk.ca "

Seventy-four per cent of the crop is seeded in the southwest region.  There is 59 per cent seeded in the west-central, 57 per cent seeded in the southeast, 38 per cent seeded in the northwest, 32 per cent seeded in the east-central and 26 per cent seeded in the northeast.  Eighty-two per cent of field peas, 78 per cent of lentils, 71 per cent of durum, 69 per cent of chickpeas, 51 per cent of spring wheat, 42 per cent of barley and 38 per cent of canola have been seeded to date.    There was very little to no precipitation throughout all regions of the province this week.  The Mayfair region received the highest amount of rainfall at 15 mm.  Dry conditions allowed seeding to progress steadily for most producers.  For producers with 2019 crop left to harvest, the lack of precipitation allowed them to get into fields that were previously too wet to combine.  Limited precipitation and windy conditions throughout the province have slightly reduced topsoil moisture conditions.  Cropland topsoil moisture rated as two per cent surplus, 75 per cent adequate, 20 per cent short and three per cent very short.  Hay and pasture land topsoil moisture is rated as one per cent surplus, 67 per cent adequate, 26 per cent short and six per cent very short.  Farmers have been busy seeding, spraying when it wasn’t windy, harrowing, combining the remaining 2019 crop, branding cattle and moving livestock out to pasture.

Exports that showed the highest increase in the first quarter included crude oil, canola seed, pulses, canola oil and meal, agricultural machinery, oats and soya beans.  On a month-over-month basis, Saskatchewan exports increased 30.5 per cent between March 2020 and April 2020, the highest rate of growth amongst provinces.  “While many Saskatchewan people and businesses are focused on dealing with the current pandemic, it is important to recognize that some sectors of our economy are having periods of growth, which are positive signs we are weathering the unprecedented COVID-19 storm,” Harrison said.  “Challenges are still ahead, but as we work together on each key phase of the Re-Open Saskatchewan plan, we will see further positive signs of economic recovery both here at home and with our international exports going abroad.”  -30-  For more information, contact:  Ashley Schoff Trade and Export Development Regina Phone: 306-787-5582 Email: ashley.schoff2@gov.sk.ca "

Exposure is most likely to occur when cleaning up enclosed buildings (such as grain bins, sheds, barns, garages, trailers, cottages, and homes) or farm equipment and vehicles after winter.    “Humans can be exposed to hantavirus when inhaling contaminated air caused by the droppings, urine and saliva of infected rodents,” Saskatchewan’s Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Saqib Shahab said.  “Hantavirus can cause illness in humans including a lung related illness known as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which can be fatal.”  Symptoms typically start within one to six weeks of exposure and include tiredness, fever, muscle aches, cough, headaches, dizziness, nausea and vomiting.  Some people develop severe symptoms, including difficulty breathing, that can be life threatening.  Seek medical attention immediately if you have a cough, fever, and shortness of breath.  To avoid exposure to hantavirus, be aware of mouse droppings and nesting materials and take the following precautions when cleaning infested areas: • Ventilate the building by opening doors and windows for at least 30 minutes before cleaning;  Use wet mopping methods and wear rubber or plastic gloves; Wear goggles and a well-fitting N-100, R-100 or P-100 (formerly HEPA) type filter mask when cleaning areas contaminated by droppings in a confined space; Dampen areas contaminated with rodent droppings with bleach disinfectant (one part bleach to nine parts water), let sit for 10 minutes, and remove droppings with a damp mop or cloth; Avoid using dry cleaning methods such as dusting, sweeping, vacuuming or air-hosing; Steam clean, shampoo or spray upholstered furniture with a detergent, disinfectant or a mixture of bleach and water; and Wash clothes and bedding with detergent in hot water.   Also, take steps to reduce rodent infestations:  Block openings that might allow rodents to enter a building; Store human and animal food, water and garbage in containers with tightly fitted lids; and Move woodpiles or other potential hiding places for mice away from your home.  As of May 13, 2020, there have been 35 people with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome reported in Saskatchewan since 1994, 11 of whom died.

309,2020-05-19,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/may/19/sha-phase-1,Government Website,SHA Cautiously Moves Forward As Some Health Services Resume," Released on May 19, 2020                  Today, the Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) has begun to resume some health services in varying parts of the province as a cautious first step toward re-opening the health system.  “It’s a delicate balance we begin today toward a ‘new normal’ while still responding to the realities of a global pandemic,” SHA CEO Scott Livingstone said.  “Teams have and will continue to balance service resumption plans with the necessary health system capacity required for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients; including the need for ongoing expanded testing capacity, long term contact tracing demands and maintaining the ability for the foreseeable future to surge to meet the requirements when localized outbreaks happen.”  May 19 marks the first day of phase one, with a focus on resuming a few everyday services such as outpatient physiotherapy appointments, kidney health services, some laboratory services, home care (e.g. bathing services) and expanded immunizations.  As part of taking an approach that is tailored to health system readiness in various areas of the province, it should be noted that not all services listed in phase one will begin immediately on May 19.  The services listed in phase one of the plan are those that may start beginning May 19, subject to an approval process that ensures service resumption is undertaken in a considered, thoughtful and safe manner.  Some areas of the province will be ready to resume services, while others are not yet ready.  In many cases, the public can expect that their health care experience will be different than prior to the pandemic because of additional measures in place to protect patients and staff.  These include adaptation of waiting room practices to promote physical distancing, additional emphasis on virtual care, wherever possible, and additional screening at health care facilities.  The SHA is asking for patience, as these practices are necessary for safety reasons but may cause delays and inconveniences for patients seeking care as services resume.  Phase one will also include an expansion of surgeries beyond “three week urgent and emergent cases” to now include “six week urgent cases”.  A pause on non-urgent and elective surgeries two months ago was necessary to minimize risk to those not needing emergent care, while ensuring hospitals had capacity for a surge in COVID patients.  While that need has not changed, the SHA also recognizes the importance of cautiously increasing surgeries for the physical and mental well-being of those on waiting lists.  “A patient’s priority on the surgery list will be determined based on a clinical assessment by their physicians, in consultation with the patient,” SHA’s Physician Executive of Integrated Health Urban Dr. Rashaad Hansia said.  “It’s not based only on the type of surgery needed.  Given the complexity of the work involved to resume surgical services in as safe a manner as possible, we won’t see a significant increase right away.  What we are seeing is surgeons working with their patients to assess their needs and determine who qualifies for the six week urgent category, then scheduling those for today and in the weeks ahead.”  The priority of surgeries resumed is being done in collaboration with surgeons, and based on their assessments of patients and recommendations.  The availability of surgical bookings for each provider is being balanced across all the surgical specialties, and considers the availability of appropriate post-surgical care such as nursing and therapies.  Medical Imaging departments are also cautiously increasing CT, MRI and other diagnostic testing to enable non-urgent and elective exams.  However, surgery bookings and the other every day health services resuming today, and in the days ahead, will not be resumed based on a one size fits all approach.  Service resumption will vary based on a multitude of factors, including considerations around localized outbreak status, capacity, requirements around adhering to public health orders and other factors used to ensure safety and readiness.

310,2020-05-19,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/may/19/prescription-drug-limits-lifted,Government Website,Province Lifts Limit On Filling Of Prescriptions," Released on May 19, 2020                  Effective May 20, the Saskatchewan government is lifting the supply limits on prescription drugs that were introduced to guard against drug shortages.  Saskatchewan residents who have prescriptions for long-term medications will be able to fill prescriptions as they did prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, except in limited situations where a specific drug remains in short supply.  The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak resulted in significant shortages for certain drugs and uncertainty regarding the overall Canadian drug supply.  To manage drugs in short supply and prevent further shortages, Saskatchewan took decisive action to manage the drug supply to ensure that all patients, especially those most vulnerable, would have continued access to necessary medications.  On March 18, Saskatchewan, along with many other provinces and territories, limited prescription fills to one month to ensure the continued supply and to prevent the stockpiling of prescription medications with some exceptions for drugs on a specified maintenance list.  “As we navigate the unknowns presented by COVID-19, ensuring the availability of medications for all Saskatchewan residents is a priority,” Health Minister Jim Reiter said.  “Today, the drug supply is in a more stable position due to the actions of pharmacists, patients and other stakeholders in response to the prescription limits.  We sincerely thank them for their support and understanding.”  “We continue to support the Ministry of Health’s careful management through this challenge to ensure Saskatchewan residents get the medications they need,” Pharmacy Association of Saskatchewan CEO Dawn Martin said.  “Front-line pharmacists work hard every day for their patients, and will continue to do so through this difficult and unpredictable time.”  The supply limits did not affect most Saskatchewan residents, as 87 per cent of Saskatchewan prescriptions are filled for a 34-day supply of medication.  “As the pharmacy regulatory body, we are supportive of the decision to remove the restrictions that were put in place to support the drug supply chain during the early days of COVID-19,” Saskatchewan College of Pharmacy Professionals Registrar Jeana Wendel said.  “As a result of these measures, the drug supply chain has stabilized; however, it remains critical for pharmacists to ensure they are being stewards of the drug supply to ensure all Saskatchewan residents can continue to receive the medications they need.”  Though the majority of the Canadian drug supply is more stable, some drugs (e.g. salbutamol inhalers) and drug classes (e.g. sedatives and antibiotics) are in short supply.  For these medications, pharmacists will use their judgement and dispense appropriate quantities.  The drug supply is being actively monitored, at federal and provincial levels, as the pandemic evolves.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Colleen Book Health Regina Phone: 306-787-4083 Email: media@health.gov.sk.ca "

Practise Preventative Measures as Retail Re-Opens  As the Re-Open Saskatchewan plan moves into Phase 2 today, retail operations can now open for business.  That doesn’t mean that everyone should go out simply for the sake of shopping again.  Instead, go on days when there is less crowding and there are items you need.  Please remember that we’re not returning to business as usual, but we’re moving forward in our new normal.  Keep these in mind:  To keep everyone safe, respect the rules of the businesses you visit; Go outside instead of loitering in stores or malls; Do not gather in groups; Now is not the time to browse – only shop for what you need; If you purchase food at malls or stores, it must be taken home to eat.  Seating areas remain closed and eating is not allowed in other areas; and All elements of the public health order remain in effect.  If you are experiencing symptoms of fever, cough or shortness of breath, contact HealthLine 811 or your family physician for advice on whether you should be tested for COVID-19.  You can also take the online self-assessment at www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19.   General public inquiries may be directed to COVID19@health.gov.sk.ca.

312,2020-05-19,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/may/19/women-entrepreneurs,Government Website,Saskatchewan Celebrates Women Entrepreneurs," Released on May 19, 2020 As part of Women Entrepreneurs Week May 17-23, the Government of Saskatchewan is recognizing the province’s 33,300 female business owners for their contributions to the economy and labour market.  One in every eight women employed in Saskatchewan runs her own business, which puts female entrepreneurship in the province above the national average and fourth highest among provinces.  “Saskatchewan women have built familiar brands and created markets across North America,” Minister Responsible for the Status of Women Tina Beaudry-Mellor said.  “As we emerge from COVID-19 restrictions, I encourage residents as they look to support local businesses to also look for ways to support women led businesses who make significant contributions to the Saskatchewan economy.”    Throughout Women Entrepreneurs Week, the Status of Women Office will profile Saskatchewan businesswomen and their creativity, innovation and resiliency.  The office also congratulates the membership-driven Women Entrepreneurs of Saskatchewan for 25 years of supporting and building community with business advice, financing, training and mentoring.  “Women Entrepreneurs Week is a time to recognize the many Saskatchewan females who have worked hard to start their own businesses, while creating jobs and opportunities for others,” Trade and Export Development Minister Jeremy Harrison says.  “Their resiliency during this unprecedented time truly shows as these businesses continue to play a role in contributing to the province’s economy and enhancing the quality of life for all.”  To support local businesses and their employees during COVID-19, the Government of Saskatchewan announced the $1 million “Together We Stand” initiative on May 1.  Funding will be used by Chambers of Commerce across the province to encourage residents to shop local.  The province also implemented the $50 million Saskatchewan Small Business Emergency Payment on April 9, to provide grants to eligible small and medium-sized enterprises that temporarily closed or substantially curtailed their operations as a result of public health orders related to COVID-19.  This program has been extended for the month of May.  Details on business supports can be found on the Government of Saskatchewan website or by contacting the province’s Business Response Team at 1-844-800-8688.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Glen Kirby Status of Women Office Regina Phone: 306-787-6041 Email: glen.kirby@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-537-6455  Ashley Schoff Trade and Export Development Regina Phone: 306-787-5582 Email: ashley.schoff2@gov.sk.ca "

In nature, young animals and birds are purposely placed into seclusion by their mothers to protect them from predators.  In the majority of cases, these young animals are not abandoned or deserted, and the mother is nearby watching.  The chances for survival decrease when these young animals come into contact with humans.  Wildlife can also carry and transmit infectious diseases to people, such as rabies or West Nile Virus.    Only wildlife rehabilitators are licensed to care for orphaned and injured animals.  They are trained to make sure animals are given appropriate care and nutrition to help improve their chances of survival when they are released back into the wild.  A young animal should only be picked up if the parent is found dead nearby, or in an unnatural situation such as a young songbird found on a doorstep.  In that case, the young bird could be moved to the closest suitable habitat.  To determine if a deer fawn is orphaned, please consider these signs:  Has it been lying in the same position for more than 10 hours? Is it vocal? Is it covered in insects? Is it wet? Being covered by the morning dew may indicate it has been there for a prolonged period.  If there are obvious signs of injury, or evidence that it has been orphaned, please contact your local conservation officer before moving the fawn.  The conservation officer will determine the best course of action for the animal.  People are also reminded to steer clear of adult wildlife, such as deer or moose that sometimes wander into urban areas.  Large crowds will stress the animals, which could lead to a potentially dangerous situation.  Remember – give wildlife their space.  -30-  For more information, contact:  For public inquires, contact: Environment Regina Phone: 1-800-567-4224 Email: centre.inquiry@gov.sk.ca  Jamie Gibson Environment Regina Phone: 306-519-9290 Email: jamie.gibson@gov.sk.ca "

Immunocompromised asymptomatic individuals, including cancer patients in advance of undergoing immunosuppressive procedures such as chemotherapy.  All health staff working with immunocompromised patients. Mobile (worksite) testing in high volume work settings (factories, industrial settings, etc.)  This is in addition to current testing requirements for:  All residents identified by public health as a contact of someone known or suspected of having COVID-19. Individuals identified by public health at a high risk due to active spread of COVID-19 in their workplace or community. All residents upon admission and re-admission to long-term and personal care homes. All residents and staff in long-term and personal care homes upon notification of a COVID-19 positive resident or staff member.  The Saskatchewan Health Authority will establish the process to start testing this expanded list.  Details on accessing testing will be provided the week of May 18.  In addition to expanded testing, the Saskatchewan Health Authority will increase active case finding in populations that are homeless or live in other vulnerable settings, and work will continue on increased active case finding with First Nations and Métis communities.  Public Health will continue to identify and test individuals who are at high risk of infection due to spread of COVID-19 in their household, community or workplace.  If widespread transmission occurs in a community, a community-wide testing initiative would be implemented.  The Roy Romanow Provincial Laboratory currently has the capacity to complete 1,500 tests daily, as required.  All residents experiencing even mild COVID-19 symptoms are encouraged to contact 811 about being tested.  If you are experiencing symptoms of fever, cough or shortness of breath, contact HealthLine 811 or your family physician for advice on whether you should be tested for COVID-19.  You can also take the online self-assessment at www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19.  Victoria Day Long Weekend  There are many ways to mark the official opening of Saskatchewan’s summer season, while following public health orders.  Plan activities with families or individuals in your extended household group.  Visit greenspaces in and around your community.  Boat launches may now be open and with camping season set to start in June, you can start planning for a safe summer season.  Whatever your May long weekend plans, remember that public health orders remain in place to prevent transmission of COVID-19, even as case numbers remain low in the southern half of the province.  Continue to practice preventative measures:  Wash your hands frequently. Practice physical distancing of two metres. Limit contacts outside your home to the same one or two families or friends in your extended household group. Gatherings of 10 or more people are not permitted, even if physical distancing is used.  Playgrounds and outdoor equipment should continue to be avoided.  Residents with cabins in the southern half of the province may visit their properties, but should stay on their own property and limit visits to local stores to only essential trips.  With non-essential travel restricted in the Northern Saskatchewan Administration District at this time, residents with cabins in the north cannot visit their properties until those travel restrictions are lifted.

Some unlicensed lenders or brokers are promoting “advance-fee loans” online or by email to consumers and requiring fees be paid upfront before they release the funds.  Lenders or brokers may use the terms “administration fee” or “credit protection” to make the charge seem more credible.  When the consumer pays the fee, the loan is never transferred and the website often disappears.  Other unlicensed online lenders may issue loans but not provide accurate cost of credit information or may take aggressive collection practices.  In Saskatchewan, the FCAA regulates many licensed entities that offer or arrange loans: payday lenders, loan brokers, credit unions, loan corporations and financing corporations.  If a consumer is going to obtain a loan, they should ensure the lender or broker is authorized to operate in Saskatchewan.  To check whether a lender or broker is licensed, consumers should visit FCAA411 at https://fcaa.gov.sk.ca/fcaa411.   Here are some red flags that indicate a consumer might be dealing with an unlicensed lender or broker:  The lender or broker is not licensed with the FCAA; They pressure you to act immediately; The offer is “too good to be true.”  If a consumer has a question about whether a lender or broker is allowed to operate in Saskatchewan, they can contact the Consumer Credit Division at 306-787-6700 or fid@gov.sk.ca.  If a consumer has a question about banks, they should contact the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, as they regulate all banks in Canada.

322,2020-05-14,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/may/14/supporting-livestock-producers,Government Website,Government Of Saskatchewan Supporting Livestock Producers During COVID-19," Released on May 14, 2020                  Today, Agriculture Minister David Marit is announcing $10 million in additional funding to help livestock producers manage the impacts of COVID-19 related market disruptions.  The support includes $5 million for Saskatchewan’s share of the costs associated with participation in the national AgriRecovery set-aside program and $5 million to partially offset higher premium costs under the Western Livestock Price Insurance Program (WLPIP).  With today’s announcement, the Saskatchewan government will fund the 40 per cent provincial contribution to the AgriRecovery set-aside program.  Saskatchewan livestock producers will now be able to access a total of $12.5 million under the set-aside program.  On May 5, the federal government announced their 60 per cent contribution to the AgriRecovery program.  “Our livestock sector is facing tremendous challenges, with producers facing higher costs to feed animals that cannot move along the supply chain as they normally would,” Marit said.  “Participation in the AgriRecovery set-aside program will compensate producers for the cost of temporarily holding cattle back from market until supply more evenly matches demand and processing capacity.”  At this time of the year, approximately 3,500 head of market-ready steers and heifers would typically be shipped from Saskatchewan to processing facilities in Alberta every week.  Recently, less than 400 head of fed cattle from Saskatchewan have been processed weekly in Alberta plants.  Saskatchewan will work closely with industry, the federal government and other western provinces to finalize the details of the set-aside program.  The Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation will deliver the program to Saskatchewan producers.  “COVID-19 has had multiple effects on Canada’s cattle producers,” Saskatchewan Cattlemen’s Association Chair Arnold Balicki said.  “Industry put forth a number of recommendations to governments to address our complex industry’s challenges.  It is great to see Saskatchewan stepping up on set aside and price insurance.  These will help with the backlog and make it more affordable for producers to participate in price insurance, injecting some certainty into the coming months.”  “It is vital that we work together to address the impact of the serious challenges presented by COVID-19,” Saskatchewan Cattle Feeders Association President Chad Ross said.  “We welcome the measures announced today and look forward to continuing to work closely with government and other industry partners to support producers.”  The impacts of COVID-19 have been felt across the entire livestock sector.  To address this, Saskatchewan is also taking action to temporarily reduce the cost of purchasing livestock price insurance through the WLPIP.  WLPIP is an important risk management tool for Saskatchewan livestock producers.  WLPIP premiums have increased significantly since the end of February, due to the uncertainty of COVID-19.  The provincial government will provide 40 per cent of the increased premium costs, dating back to February 25, 2020.  “Today’s funding to offset increased livestock price insurance premium costs will help ensure our risk management programs meet the needs of Saskatchewan producers,” Marit said.  “The Government of Saskatchewan is taking steps to ensure livestock producers have the support they require during this unprecedented period.”  Additionally, the deadline for obtaining calf price insurance though the WLPIP is being extended from May 28, 2020 to June 18, 2020.  “We welcome the response of the Government of Saskatchewan to help address the challenges beef producers are facing,” Saskatchewan Stock Growers Association President  Bill Huber said.  “Western Livestock Price Insurance is a valuable tool to help producers manage risk, particularly as we navigate market volatility due to COVID-19.  Today’s announcement will help make premiums more affordable and allow additional time to enroll in the program.”  These premium adjustments will be in place until September 1, 2020, at which time the provincial government will review and reassess.  The province continues to encourage the federal government to support the sector by contributing the remaining 60 per cent of the increase in premium costs.  Producers can contact their local SCIC office for more information.  Staff are also available to assist producers over the phone at 1-888-935-0000 or through email at customer.service@scic.ca, Monday to Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Tessa Krofchek Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation Melville Phone: 639-398-2268 Email: tessa.krofchek@scic.ca "

Seeding progress in the province is at 18 per cent, up seven per cent from last week.  This is below the five-year average (2015-2019) of 25 per cent.  The southwest region is leading the province, with 39 per cent of the crop seeded.  There is 23 per cent seeded in the southeast, 14 per cent seeded in the west-central, eight per cent seeded in the northwest, seven per cent seeded in the east-central and three per cent seeded in the northeast.    Precipitation in the form of rain and snow this week delayed field work in some regions, but many of the farmers in these regions are already getting back into the field as conditions improve.  The Prince Albert area received the highest amount of precipitation at 28 mm.  Parts of the northern and eastern regions of the province received snow this week, whereas the southwest region received only small amounts of precipitation.  Moisture conditions did not change much between this week and the previous week.  Cropland topsoil moisture is rated as five per cent surplus, 84 per cent adequate and 11 per cent short.  Hay and pasture land topsoil moisture is rated as three per cent surplus, 75 per cent adequate, 20 per cent short and two per cent very short.  Farmers have been able to make progress harvesting the 2019 crop in most regions.  Cold temperatures throughout the province have prevented many farmers from spraying herbicides this week.  Farmers are busy harrowing, applying fertilizers, combining the remainder of the 2019 crop, and seeding or preparing to start.

Highlights include:  Upgrades to 325 km of thin-membrane surface highways; 24 to 26 new sets of highway passing lanes; Rehabilitation of at least 100 RM roads when combined with our existing municipal roads program; and Improvements to community airports.  “Provincial road builders generate more than $5 billion in provincial GDP out of an economy of $73 billion or roughly seven per cent of the total provincial economy,” Saskatchewan Heavy Construction Association President Shantel Lipp said.  “We employ close to 30,000 workers, making our industry one of the largest employers in the province.  We welcome any move toward maintaining and eventually growing these job numbers to get our economy on track.”  These stimulus investments are on top of $358 million in capital projects already committed in this year’s Estimates including:  Nine sets of passing lanes and resurfacing and widening on Highways 6 and 39 between Regina and the Canada-US Border; Four sets of passing lanes and resurfacing on Highway 7 between Delisle and Kindersley, plus planning for three additional sets of passing lanes between Kindersley and the Saskatchewan-Alberta border; Two sets of passing lanes, resurfacing, and widening of Highway 5 plus planning for a short section of twinning between Saskatoon and the junction of Highway 2; Three sets of passing lanes on Highway 10 between Melville and Yorkton; and Three sets of passing lanes on Highway 9 between Yorkton and Canora.  This year’s fiscal plan also includes improvements to more than 1,000 km of provincial highways this year, which is the first year of the 10-year Growth Plan to build and upgrade 10,000 km of highways.  The Government of Saskatchewan has invested more than $9.8 billion in highways infrastructure since 2008, improving more than 15,500 km of Saskatchewan highways.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Steve Shaheen Highways and Infrastructure Regina Phone: 306-933-5641 Email: steve.shaheen@gov.sk.ca "

All of the new cases are in the Far North (La Loche area).  One case that was previously reported in the Regina region has been reassigned to the North.  Of the 577 reported cases, 186 are considered active.  Eleven more people have recovered, bringing the provincial total to 385.  There are currently 10 people in hospital – seven are receiving inpatient care (four in the North and three in Saskatoon) and three are in intensive care (all in Saskatoon).

Provincial State of Emergency Extended, COVID-19 Still Present in Saskatchewan  The Provincial State of Emergency has been extended for a period of two weeks.  Even as active case numbers are low or zero in some regions of the province, residents are reminded that COVID-19 is still present and all public health orders remain in effect.  Having few or no active cases demonstrates that personal protective measures are effective and continue to be the best defence against COVID-19.  This is particularly important as businesses and services continue to cautiously re-open and the majority of infected individuals will experience very mild or no symptoms.  Gatherings of more than 10 people are not permitted and physical distancing must still be practiced.  It is highly recommended that you limit contacts outside the household to the same two or three friends or households.  Wash your hands frequently and contact HealthLine 811 for an assessment to determine if you should be tested – even if you’re experiencing mild symptoms.  If you are experiencing symptoms of fever, cough or shortness of breath, contact HealthLine 811 or your family physician for advice on whether you should be tested for COVID-19.  You can also take the online self-assessment at www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19.

To strengthen the province’s network of services, funding has been committed in 2020-21 to develop a sexual assault examination training program for nurses and care providers in rural, remote and northern communities.  The funding will also support the future expansion of coverage at Regina hospital emergency rooms, where nurses with sexual assault examination training will be available round-the-clock.  “Keeping citizens safe and free from violence is very important for government,” Minister responsible for the Status of Women Office Tina Beaudry-Mellor says.  “We are working to end the patterns which contribute to sexual assault and violence and look forward to the day when all people are free from the threat of psychological and physical harm.”  Sexual violence education for Saskatchewan justice system professionals is also being developed, along with a province-wide awareness campaign to challenge and change attitudes about sexual violence.  These initiatives will augment existing government support for sexual violence programming and awareness, such as the Philadelphia Model partnership with the Regina Police Service, Sexual Assault Services of Saskatchewan (SASS), and the Regina Sexual Assault Centre launched in 2019.  “There is no place in Saskatchewan for sexual violence and abuse,” Justice Minister and Attorney General Don Morgan says.  “This week is an opportunity to renew our commitment to stand up against violence, support survivors and promote healthy and respectful relationships.”  The Government of Saskatchewan will distribute $1.6 million this year to agencies delivering direct support to victims of sexual violence, an increase of nearly 35 per cent from three years ago.  “Sexual Assault Awareness Week highlights an important issue that affects our province greatly,” SASS Executive Director Kerrie Isaac said.  “Our member agencies work every day to help survivors get the help they need, and SASS works to increase awareness and action on sexual violence.  Our work with government has led to positive change, and we look forward to continuing to collaborate as we all work to make Saskatchewan a safer place for everyone.”  The government further acknowledges the courage shown by survivors, support from their families and friends and tireless efforts by service providers to help all impacted by sexual violence.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Glen Kirby Status of Women Office Regina Phone: 306-787-6041 Email: glen.kirby@gov.sk.ca  Marieka Andrew Justice Regina Phone: 306-519-4608 Email: marieka.andrew@gov.sk.ca "

Eligible applicants receive a payment of 15 per cent of their sales revenue from April 2019 or February 2020, up to $5,000, to help businesses with expenses including fixed costs such as rent.  To date, the SSBEP has processed more than 4,700 applications and provided more than $15 million in support to Saskatchewan businesses.  For more information and the SSBEP application, businesses can visit www.saskatchewan.ca/covid19-businesses.   -30-  For more information, contact:  Kristin Kutarna-Gates Trade and Export Development Regina Phone: 306-787-8360 Email: kristin.kutarnagates@gov.sk.ca "

Twelve of the new cases are in the Far North, all in the La Loche area, while the remaining one is in the North region.   Of the 544 reported cases, 203 are considered active.  Six more people have recovered, bringing the provincial total to 335.  There are currently 19 people in hospital – 15 are receiving inpatient care (six in the North and nine in Saskatoon) and four are in intensive care (three in Saskatoon and one in the North).  Of the 544 cases in the province:  138 cases are travellers; 260 are community contacts (mass gatherings included); 56 have no known exposures; and 90 are under investigation by local public health.  Overall in Saskatchewan:  44 cases are health care workers; however, the source of the infections may not be related to health care in all instances. 179 of the cases are from the Far North, 163 are from the Saskatoon area, 100 from the North, 76 from the Regina area, 15 from the South and 11 from the Central region. 72 cases involve people 19 years of age and under, while the remainder are adults. 192 cases are in the 20-39 age range; 171 are in the 40-59 age range; 93 are in the 60-79 age range; and 16 are in the 80-plus range. 50 per cent of the cases are females and 50 per cent are males. Six deaths related to COVID-19 have been reported to date.  To date, 35,176 COVID-19 tests have been performed in the province.  As of May 6, 2020, when other provincial and national numbers were available from the Public Health Agency of Canada, Saskatchewan’s per capita rate was 27,184 people tested per million population, which exceeds the national rate of 26,665 people tested per million population.   Public Notification of Outbreaks   The declaration of a COVID-19 outbreak is used by Public Health to mobilize and coordinate a response to the infection.  It is not necessarily an indicator of risk to the public.  The Public Health definition of an outbreak varies by setting.  For example, in long-term care and personal care homes, an outbreak is declared when one person (a resident or health care worker) tests positive for COVID-19. The Government of Saskatchewan is committed to ensuring there is public notification of COVID-19 outbreaks, as permitted under The Public Health Act, 1994.  We will be publicly posting outbreaks within:  Saskatchewan Health Authority facilities including hospitals, long-term care homes and integrated facilities, as well as assisted living facilities with a long-term care unit if the cases are associated with the long-term care unit; personal care homes and homeless shelters as these include vulnerable populations; and all correctional facilities in Saskatchewan Public advisories will always be issued when there is a risk to the public.  The posting of outbreaks in a workplace, industrial or commercial space will be done on a case-by-case basis, when deemed appropriate and necessary.  This approach balances protecting the public and ensuring the privacy of individuals and businesses.  Public notification will also occur in the absence of an outbreak being declared when there is a risk of transmission to the public.   Phase 1 of Re-Open Saskatchewan is Well Underway  The Government of Saskatchewan’s plan to slowly and responsibly lift restrictions on businesses and services as a result of COVID-19 began on May 4.  Restrictions in the province are gradually being lifted in five phases.  As Phase 1 of the plan moves into its second week, further information has been added to the Re-Open Saskatchewan Plan.  The changes include:  Updates to the guidelines for appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) – page 17 Updates to the guidelines for drive-in or remote worship services – page 24 Guidelines for drive-in theatres – page 25 Guidelines for public markets and farmers markets – page 32 Updates to the guidelines for clothing and retail operations for thrift stores and businesses that sell second-hand goods – page 36 Updates to the golf course guidelines – page 42-43 Updates to the guidelines about passengers in boats – page 46  With its focus on the gradual lifting of business restrictions, Saskatchewan residents are reminded the plan does not change the need to comply with the current public health order and take the necessary precautionary measures, including:  Limiting public and private gatherings – inside and outside – to no more than 10 people. Maintaining physical distancing by keeping two metres away from others. Avoiding unnecessary travel. Exercising caution when forming an extended household group and being aware of who you have been in contact with over the past two weeks.  If you test positive for COVID-19, these are the people who will need to be contacted by public health. Stay home if you’re sick or symptomatic.  Mother’s Day  The impact of COVID-19 visitor restrictions at long-term care homes, hospitals and personal care homes has limited the ability of families and loved ones to connect during this stressful time.  The Government of Saskatchewan recognizes that people may want to send gifts, particularly in light of Mother’s Day this weekend.  The Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) has determined that flowers from a florist and dry paper gifts are not an infection risk.  Going forward, purchased floral arrangements and dry paper gifts, such as cards, letters, books, photos and artwork, will be allowed.  Floral arrangements will still not be permitted in some acute care settings, such as intensive care units, due to possible allergies.  Facilities are expected to follow existing processes to receive deliveries in a manner that reduces the risk of potential transmission by minimizing traffic in and out of facilities and practicing appropriate hand hygiene before and after handling delivered gifts.  If you are experiencing even mild symptoms of fever, cough or shortness of breath, contact HealthLine 811 or your family physician for advice on whether you should be tested for COVID-19.  You can also take the online self-assessment at www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19.

335,2020-05-08,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/may/08/saskatchewan-releases-suicide-prevention-plan,Government Website,Saskatchewan Releases Suicide Prevention Plan," Released on May 8, 2020                  A new suicide prevention plan will coordinate activities to promote life and reduce risk factors related to suicide in Saskatchewan.  Rural and Remote Health Minister Warren Kaeding released Pillars for Life: The Saskatchewan Suicide Prevention Plan today, a collaborative approach to suicide prevention.  “Mental health continues to be a high priority for our government, our health system and our communities,” Kaeding said.  “This plan will guide activities specific to suicide prevention based on Saskatchewan’s context.  It was informed by careful consideration of approaches across the country and international best practice.”  Actions outlined in the plan include expanded use and monitoring of suicide protocols, and enhancement of research, data and surveillance for local suicide prevention.  Saskatchewan is one of six provinces that has implemented the Mental Health Commission of Canada’s Roots of Hope program. Roots of Hope has been established in three Saskatchewan communities: La Ronge, Meadow Lake and Buffalo Narrows.  “As psychiatrists, we have of course been very concerned by the high suicide rate in Saskatchewan,” Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Interim Head, Provincial Department of Psychiatry at the University of Saskatchewan Dr. Malin Clark said.  “A comprehensive plan that includes not only delivery of enhanced mental health services but also addresses social factors that contribute to hopelessness and increased suicide risk is necessary as we move forward in efforts to change this statistic.”  The plan complements broader activities recommended in Saskatchewan’s Mental Health and Addictions Action Plan.  It includes public awareness efforts aimed at northern indigenous youth, a population with a suicide rate significantly higher than the general youth population.  “We want to make sure people know help is available for those who may be thinking about suicide,” Kaeding said.  “The Saskatchewan Health Authority and many community partners are contributing to this work.  We all recognize the need to do more.”  HealthLine 811 continues to offer free, confidential, mental health advice, education and support for all residents of the province.  Pillars for Life: The Saskatchewan Suicide Prevention Plan is posted at https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/health-care-administration-and-provider-resources/saskatchewan-health-initiatives, along with information about resources available on suicide prevention and mental health.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Colleen Book Health Regina Phone: 306-787-4083 Email: media@health.gov.sk.ca "

Victory in Europe Day on May 8, is particularly important to Canadians as it largely marked the end to fighting for Canadian Forces after nearly six years of war.  “On May 8, 1945, the Allies accepted Germany’s surrender and after six long years of fighting, the Second World War came to an end in Europe,” Mirasty said.  “As the years pass, it becomes increasingly important that we remember the Canadians who served.  We owe them our deep gratitude.  Please take a moment today to remember them, and to honour their legacy of peace.”    “Saskatchewan’s contribution throughout the Second World War was tremendous,” Moe said.  “We recognize the tens of thousands of men and women from this province who contributed to Allied success both at home and abroad, most importantly the more than 5,000 Saskatchewan residents who paid the ultimate sacrifice in the pursuit of peace.”  While remaining physically distant, the Lieutenant Governor and Mrs. Mirasty and Premier Moe gathered at the Saskatchewan War Memorial to remember the service and sacrifice of the sailors, soldiers and air personnel during the war.  A moment of silence was observed while a trumpeter played the “Last Post” and “Rouse.”  Following this, the Lieutenant Governor and Premier Moe each laid a wreath at the war memorial.  The Saskatchewan War Memorial lists the names of all of Saskatchewan’s fallen.  The online version, managed by the Saskatchewan War Memorial Committee, features more than 11,000 war and peacekeeping casualties and their stories.

Saskatchewan Education’s Response Planning Team encourages everyone in Saskatchewan’s education community to continue with these learning opportunities until the end of the school year, as in-class learning will not take place until at least September.  “When the COVID-19 pandemic hit Saskatchewan, it impacted everyone in the education sector,” Deputy Premier and Education Minister Gordon Wyant said.  “We needed to move quickly and decisively in order to protect our students, staff and families, and within a matter of weeks, a supplemental learning framework was created to provide students with learning opportunities from their home.  I am very pleased with the success we have seen using this new way of delivering education to our students and I commend teachers, staff and parents for adapting quickly and enthusiastically.”  Education’s Response Planning Team is working with education sector partners to begin work on what in-class learning may look like this fall, although the timelines will depend on the safety of everyone in Saskatchewan schools including students, teachers and school staff.  For those students graduating this year, school divisions are working with graduates and staff to consider virtual graduation ceremonies and possible postponements as well, as public health orders remain which prevent more than 10 people from gathering together.  “We know that graduation ceremonies and celebrations are important to so many families, and we extend a warm congratulations to all of Saskatchewan’s Grade 12 students and we wish them the very best in their futures,” Wyant said.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Chris Hodges Education Regina Phone: 306-787-1069 Email: chris.hodges@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-533-7506              "

Fifteen of the new cases are in the Far North with 12 of those being in the La Loche area, while the remaining four are in the North region.  Of the 531 reported cases, 196 are considered active.  Seventeen more people have recovered, bringing the provincial total to 329.  There are currently 12 people in hospital – eight are receiving inpatient care (two in the North and six in Saskatoon) and four are in intensive care (three in Saskatoon and one in the North).  Of the 531 cases in the province:  139 cases are travellers; 231 are community contacts (mass gatherings included); 53 have no known exposures; and 108 are under investigation by local public health.

Six deaths related to COVID-19 have been reported to date.  To date, 34,361 COVID-19 tests have been performed in the province.  As of May 5, 2020, when other provincial and national numbers were available from the Public Health Agency of Canada, Saskatchewan’s per capita rate was 26,605 people tested per million population, which exceeds the national rate of 25,821 people tested per million population.  Lloydminster Re-Open May 11  With the outbreak in the Lloydminster Hospital stable, Lloydminster may proceed with plans to open services and businesses as described in Phase One of the Re-Open Saskatchewan plan starting Monday, May 11.  Services and businesses will be required to follow the phased approach and safety procedures required under the Re-Open Saskatchewan plan.  All residents must continue to follow necessary personal protective measures to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, including maintaining physical distancing, participating in no gatherings more than 10 people, washing hands frequently, etc.  Opening is at the discretion of the workplace, based on their risk assessment and ability to operate safely, protecting staff and customers.  Proceeding with Phase Two will be determined by public health officials and local leadership.  Additional Guidance on Extended Households  Saskatchewan residents must continue to take measures to stop the spread of COVID-19.  This includes limiting gatherings to no more than 10 people – inside and outside – within an extended household group only.  With extreme caution and under the following conditions, one or two close families may form an extended household group:  Your families or friends must remain consistent.  Do not visit different families or friends every day. If you are going to create an extended household group, consider if any member of the group has chronic health conditions that would put them at greater risk, or if they are in close contact with someone who could be vulnerable.  Avoid forming an extended household with vulnerable people. Families and friends within an extended household contact group can be closer than two metres if they are not high-risk. Physical distancing of two metres should still be practiced around people with chronic health conditions and caution should be used in gatherings to limit touching common items, such as utensils. You should always be aware of who you have been in contact with over the past two weeks.  These are the people who would need to be contacted by public health if you were to test positive for COVID-19.  Preventative Measures for Seniors and Individuals with Chronic Conditions  It is important to note that the Re-Open Saskatchewan plan is not a personal preventative information document.  It is a guide for businesses.  We want to stress that older people or those with chronic conditions are at elevated risk for a more severe form of the disease and that risk continues even with the relaxing of certain guidelines.  Therefore, those who are more vulnerable may still want to be cautious in engaging in activities where physical distancing cannot be reliably maintained and masking is not in effect.  For example, shopping for non-essential supplies.  All Saskatchewan residents must continue to practice everyday preventive actions in the new normal, including:  Practice proper cough and sneezing etiquette (into a tissue or the bend of your elbow); Wash your hands often with soap and water; if soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer; Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands; Clean and disinfect your home regularly; Maintain safe food practices; Avoid close contact with people who are sick; Stay home if sick; Call ahead if needing to access health services for your health condition; Avoid unnecessary travel; and Avoid large crowds and practice physical distancing (do not shake hands, hug or kiss except within your extended household).  If you are experiencing even mild symptoms of fever, cough or shortness of breath, contact HealthLine 811 or your family physician for advice on whether you should be tested for COVID-19.  You can also take the online self-assessment at www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19.

More than $300 million for highway projects for thin membrane surface upgrades, passing lanes including $46 million dedicated for upgrades to municipal roads and airports. Approximately $181 million for renewal projects to reduce deferred maintenance on provincial and third-party assets and reduce operating costs through energy efficiency.  This includes new allocations of $100 million for health and $25.9 million for education, with the remainder addressing priority projects in various other ministries and agencies. $150 million in a per capita payment through a new Municipal Economic Enhancement Program to support infrastructure projects in communities across the province.  $2.7 Billion of Capital Funding Announced March 18, 2020  Announced on March 18, in the Government’s 2020-21 Estimates, the $2.7 billion of previously committed capital funding includes the announcement of a number of important infrastructure projects across Saskatchewan, including $980.7 million of executive government spending and $1.75 billion of Crown sector spending.   Specific projects included:  $130.4 million in education capital funding for seven new school projects and three major renovation projects.  Projects include a new joint-use elementary school in Harbour Landing in Regina, as well as a joint-use consolidation of St. Peter, St. Michael and Imperial elementary schools in Regina.   Other new school projects include St. Frances Elementary School in Saskatoon, the consolidation of Princess Alexandra, King George and Pleasant Hill elementary schools in Saskatoon, and a new consolidated elementary and high school in Carrot River. $142 million in health care capital spending—including $15 million to support the planning, design and procurement activities for the more than $300 million project for a renewed and expanded Prince Albert Victoria Hospital; a $15.7 million investment to continue construction of a new, 72-bed, long-term seniors care facility in Meadow Lake; and $4.0 million for diagnostic imaging equipment, including $2.0 million to fulfil government’s commitment for a new CT scanner in Melfort. $377.5 million for transportation infrastructure, including – $357.6 million for more than 1,000 kilometres of improvements to the highway system, including 24 sets of passing lanes and various safety improvements throughout the province; the second year of the five-year $65 million Enhanced Intersection Safety Program; and$19.9 million for strategic municipal infrastructure such as the Rural Integrated Roads for Growth; urban connectors; and community airports. 165.7 million for municipal infrastructure, comprised of transfers to municipalities including the Gas Tax Fund ($62.6 million), Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program ($56 million), New Building Canada Fund ($45 million), transit assistance for people with disabilities ($0.8 million), Communities in Transition Funding ($0.7 million), and Clean Water and Waste Water Fund ($0.6 million).  Capital Injection To Have Major Impact On Municipalities, Construction Sector and Job Creation Over the next two years, more than $320 million will be provided for municipal infrastructure through the $150 million Municipal Economic Enhancement Program, the $130 million Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program, and the $46 million targeted funding through the Ministry of Highways for municipal roads and airports.  This is without considering Municipal Revenue Sharing and other various municipal transfers highlighted in the 2020-21 estimates.  “Municipalities are the engines of economic growth in Saskatchewan,” Saskatchewan Urban Municipalities Association President Gordon Barnhart said.  “We’ve been advocating for years for the development of a provincial infrastructure program, and we’re extremely pleased to see our provincial government implement one to help our economy recover in these challenging times.”  “The Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities (SARM) is very pleased that the province has made the Infrastructure Stimulus announcement today,” SARM President Ray Orb said.  “Investing in municipal infrastructure projects will help rural municipalities in rural Saskatchewan and will certainly help the provincial economy to recover.”  Construction, including maintenance and repair, has been designated an Allowable Business Service by the Government of Saskatchewan.  To ensure the safety of workers and communities, work sites will be required to follow all physical distancing measures and restrictions that remain in place through the five phases of the province’s Re-Open Saskatchewan plan.  “Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic the provincial economy was already facing headwinds through depressed resource prices, anti-pipeline policies and rail blockades,” Saskatchewan Heavy Construction Association President Shantel Lipp said.  “The announcement today will mean a big boost in the arm not only to the construction industry but to the province as a whole.”  Based on Statistics Canada data, projects funded through the investment announced today are expected to support approximately 10,000 jobs depending on the type, size and duration of each project.     This increased investment in infrastructure funding supports the province’s Growth Plan commitment to build strong communities by investing $30 billion in infrastructure over the next decade.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Media Services Executive Council Regina Phone:  306-787-6281 "

This process will start to reverse some of the service changes and reductions that had been initiated at earlier phases of the SHA’s COVID-19 Readiness Plan.  “Recent data does indicate that the province is in a better position now to move forward on reintroducing services in a gradual and thoughtful way because of the interventions that have been taken to slow the spread of COVID-19,” SHA CEO Scott Livingstone said.  “As we do so, it is critical to remember that we will be constantly evaluating this process to ensure the safety of our patients, residents and our health care workers, remaining flexible in our approach to adapt to new developments and localized outbreaks.”  The SHA’s Service Resumption Plan is four phases and serves as a framework; implementation will vary across the province based on factors like outbreaks, capacity, availability of health care workers and availability of key supplies.  Only the first phase has a specific date.  All future phases will be based on assessing these and other factors constantly to ensure it is safe to move forward.  Phase 1: Resumption of some everyday health services and expansion of surgeries and diagnostic imaging - Phase 1 will start May 19, 2020.  Highlights from this phase include:  Surgical services: phased expansion of surgeries from emergency and three week urgent cases to those booked as six week urgent cases, resulting in a 10 to 25 per cent increase in surgical services.      Ex. Cataracts, hysterectomy, cochlear, thoracic   Diagnostic imaging: Increased outpatient volumes, including:      MRI: increase from 50 per cent of normal capacity to 75 per cent of normal capacity CT: increase from 55 per cent of normal capacity to 75 per cent of normal capacity Primary Care Clinics: expand availability, continue to use virtual care where possible, and prioritize in person visits for those living with chronic diseases   All routine immunizations Public Health Inspections: increase inspections of long-term care homes, personal care homes and group homes. Mental health and addictions: re-open mental health short stay units, allow the option of in-person appointments as needed, allow more therapeutic/day programming for groups under 10 people and resume regular hours for harm reduction programs. Also includes gradual re-introduction of services in other key areas like home care, kidney health, rehabilitation and therapy programs.  Interdisciplinary teams, including physicians, will continue assessing all waiting patients to ensure surgeries and diagnostics are performed in a timely manner. Established online programs and virtual care will continue to be used in the delivery of service across the province, wherever possible.  There will be renewed opportunity for in-person appointments when necessary.  Patient flow through facilities will be designed to achieve physical distancing and staggered appointments will assist with limiting the number of patients in a facility at any one time. Phase 2: Specialty Clinics (dates to be determined) The plan notes that SHA-operated specialty clinics will continue with virtual care at specialty clinics, where possible. Other highlights from this phase include service delivery in the following specialty areas:   Electrophysiology, cath lab, cardiac stress testing, outpatient heart monitoring Respiratory:      Level three sleep disorders testing Respiratory outpatient clinic Tuberculosis clinic and treatments   Eye centre testing Dermatology clinics Cast clinics Increased fetal testing at high risk antenatal clinics  Phase 3: Further Expansion of Everyday Health Services (dates to be determined)  Highlights from this phase include prioritizing resumption of service delivery in the following areas:  Chronic Disease Management/Wellness Programs/Stroke Prevention Opioid Agonist Therapy Specialized services for clients with developmental disabilities, Autism and brain injuries Continued re-introduction of mental health and addictions services, including opening of social detox and addictions inpatient treatment  Phase 4: Full Resumption of Services (dates to be determined)  Final actions required for full resumption of services, including:  Addition of long-waiting elective surgeries and previously postponed surgeries; and Re-open hip/knee outpatient clinic.  “Our service resumption plans are very much dependent on the health system’s ability to respond, in partnership with the public,” SHA Chief Medical Officer Dr. Susan Shaw said.  “I recognize the feeling of wanting to get back to normal; however it’s essential that we proceed thoughtfully, and continue to maintain those everyday practices that have been so successful to date, including physical distancing, handwashing and staying home wherever possible.”  All patients immediately impacted will receive phone calls with updates specific to their situation, including new surgical or procedure dates, as appropriate.  There is no need to contact your provider for this information.

Early Childhood Educators who work in these programs provide children with positive early learning and developmentally appropriate experiences.  To recognize their passion and dedication as well as the importance of learning in the early years, the Government of Saskatchewan has proclaimed May 2020 as Early Childhood Education Month and May 13 as Early Childhood Educator Appreciation Day.  Educators are working hard to ensure our youngest residents of Saskatchewan are receiving quality education and are going to extraordinary lengths to keep them healthy and safe during this global health pandemic.  “In these unprecedented times, we all can recognize how important child care support is for many families who want to pursue career and education opportunities or work to provide for their families,” Deputy Premier and Education Minister Gordon Wyant said.  “On behalf of the Government of Saskatchewan, I want to thank Early Childhood Educators for continuing to make a tremendous difference in the lives of families and ensuring children are safe and well cared for.”  As part of the 2020-21 Budget Estimates, the Government of Saskatchewan has allocated funding of $73.5 million for licensed child care, including an increase of $1.7 million for existing licensed child care centres for operating costs.  Much of the work that is being done everyday by the early childhood education sector has also supported the initiatives of the Canada-Saskatchewan Early Learning and Child Care Agreement.    To ensure continuity of programs and services, the existing agreement will be extended to 2021 and will continue to focus on providing initiatives in accessibility, inclusivity, quality and Francophone minority language.  The Ministry of Education commends the efforts of all community partners who help to support the early learning sector in Saskatchewan.  “It is important to take the time to properly thank those who dedicate their lives to the care and education of our young children,” Saskatchewan Early Childhood Association Executive Director Georgia Siourounis said.  “Early childhood educators work hard to provide safe and loving environments where they can have a positive influence on a child’s life.”  To supplement the efforts of our early childhood educators, Play. Learn. Grow. Together! was developed as a public education program which provides parents and guardians of newborns to Kindergarten-aged children with easy to use tips and information to help enhance family learning at home.  The webpage and family-friendly videos can be found at www.saskatchewan.ca/residents/education-and-learning/prek-12-education-early-learning-and-schools/early-years-learning.  This is a useful online learning resource to help families with at-home learning opportunities for their children during the pandemic.  Please take the time this month, and particularly on May 13, to acknowledge and thank the early childhood educators working diligently to support our youngest citizens.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Chris Hodges Education Regina Phone: 306-787-1069 Email: chris.hodges@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-533-7506 "

Emergency Preparedness Week is also the perfect time to download the SaskAlert App, which allows users to choose to receive emergency public alerts for the entire province, a particular municipality or a First Nation community.  The app can target residents in a geographic area if urgent information is specific to one region or municipality within the province.  The app is available for download on Android and Apple devices at http://emergencyalert.saskatchewan.ca/.  Information about preparing for an emergency can be found at www.saskatchewan.ca/spsa.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Christopher Clemett Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency Regina Phone: 306-787-5395 Email: christopher.clemett@gov.sk.ca "

While seeing bears or other large predators can be very exciting, remember that these are wild animals and they can be dangerous.  In Saskatchewan, urban areas have been built along natural wildlife corridors such as rivers, forests and valleys.  Wildlife traveling these traditional passageways can sometimes come into conflict with people and property.  Leaving garbage and pet food outdoors may attract bears, other predators and animals such as skunks.  These creatures are looking for easy food, so it is recommended that you store garbage and pet food in a secure building or a bear-resistant container.  Remember to always take the necessary safety precautions when outdoors, particularly in areas where there is a higher risk of encountering predators, such as in the forest or within parks.  While hiking or walking, keep your pet on a leash.  An unleashed dog may aggravate a bear.  It is recommended that you carry bear spray and learn how to use it properly.  If you encounter a bear or other predator, keep your distance and do not try to scare the animal away or handle the situation yourself.  Leave the area if you can.  Most often, the animals will move on without any intervention.  In most cases, black bears will threaten but not attack.  If attacked – defend yourself – DO NOT PLAY DEAD.  Anyone who finds themselves in a potentially dangerous situation with a large predator should contact their local Ministry of Environment office or call Saskatchewan’s 24-hour Turn in Poachers and Polluters (TIPP) line at-1-800-667-7561.  SaskTel subscribers can also reach the TIPP line by dialing #5555 on their cell phones.

Information on Critical Travel in the North  The Ministry of Health recommends proper road travel etiquette for critical travel in the North to help stop the spread of COVID-19.  The only people who should be travelling to the North are people returning to their primary residence, and people going to La Ronge or Stoney Rapids.  No one should be stopping in between communities or travelling between them.  The following measures should also be observed:  Limit outings to one person per household, or limit the occupants in a vehicle only to members of the same household. Carpooling or ride sharing should be discontinued wherever possible.  If carpooling must occur, physical distancing should be maintained as much as possible.  This may include having people sit in the back. Everyone in the vehicle must wash their hands frequently and practice good respiratory etiquette (cover sneezes and coughs with a tissue or your arm).  Consider wearing a cloth or surgical mask when unable to maintain two metre distance from non-family members. Stay home.  Do not travel or share a vehicle if you are ill or have symptoms of COVID-19. People may travel to the closest community of their primary home to buy essential goods and services that are not available in their home community. Follow physical distancing directions provided by the grocery store.  Keep a distance of two metres from other customers, even in the checkout line. Do not go shopping if you are sick or symptomatic.  Make use of community or delivery services where possible.  Communities without grocery stores are encouraged to create bulk purchasing plans with its members in order to limit travel.  Communities should also work with their regional partners to facilitate efficient critical travel to and from hubs for items such as groceries and medication.  Shoppers should contact stores prior to visiting in case there are customer limits.

The funding will be provided to the Regina and District Chamber of Commerce to work in partnership with other regional chambers to expand its successful “Together We Stand” campaign across the province.  “Encouraging Saskatchewan residents to buy local is a great initiative of the business community that we are pleased to support during this unprecedented difficult economic time,” Trade and Export Development Minister Jeremy Harrison said.  “This consumer campaign to support local businesses, led by the Regina Chamber and to be shared across our province, will help connect consumers directly with Saskatchewan businesses during the ongoing pandemic, throughout our economic recovery initiatives, and for the long-term.”  The “Together We Stand” campaign helps bridge the gap between consumers and businesses in the province, keeping the economy moving now and ensuring the Saskatchewan business community is ready to move forward with recovery efforts in the critical weeks ahead.  “There are a number of ways residents can support local businesses here, and that’s true for people supporting their local businesses right across Saskatchewan,” Regina and District Chamber of Commerce CEO John Hopkins said.  “We thank the government for their strong support and continuing partnership with our business community on this “Together We Stand” campaign and other key projects to keep Saskatchewan working.”  Many Saskatchewan businesses remain fully or partially open; however, they are reporting a significant decline in sales, which this province-wide campaign will work to help remedy.  While they may be closed to the public, many businesses remain open through other options such as delivery, pickup, online e-commerce services or other methods.  This campaign will help increase awareness of these alternative options to safely buy local during the global COVID-19 crisis.  “In communities right across Saskatchewan, local businesses have been there to sponsor local sports teams, community events, fundraising efforts and other initiatives,” Harrison said.  “Now is the time for us as a government and residents, if they are able, to be there to return that support.”  The campaign will encourage consumers to support local businesses, including through online and phone sales, and curbside pickup and delivery options.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Ashley Schoff Trade and Export Development Regina Phone: 306-787-5582 Email: ashley.schoff2@gov.sk.ca  John Hopkins, Chief Executive Officer Regina and District Chamber of Commerce Regina Phone: 306-533-6464 Email: jhopkins@reginachamber.com "

To limit travel between provinces, camping in provincial parks will only be open to Saskatchewan residents starting June 1, until further notice.  Prior to making a reservation, it is important to note recreational facilities, including swimming pools, beaches, picnic areas and playgrounds will be closed, and with limited access to washrooms and no access to shower and laundry facilities, campers will need to plan accordingly.  Firewood and water will be safely provided to campers.  Details are being finalized and will be communicated before the camping season gets underway.  Please note, information is subject to change as phases of the Re-Open Saskatchewan plan move forward.  Reservations are currently closed for group camping, Camp-Easy, double sites and swimming lessons until further notice.  For campers interested in a seasonal site, the fees will be pro-rated starting June 1, 2020.  While there are significantly less seasonal sites available this year, Sask Parks has removed the maximum stay limitation on regular sites, allowing campers to book into a nightly site for a longer period of time.  Group reservations until June 30, 2020, will be automatically cancelled and campers will be fully refunded.  Group reservations between July and September 30, 2020, will not be cancelled at this time.  Sask Parks will continue to assess the COVID-19 situation and provide an update closer to June 30, 2020.  Currently, non-essential travel to northern Saskatchewan, specifically within the Northern Saskatchewan Administration District (NSAD) is prohibited.  Campers should be aware if a reservation is made and this travel restriction is still in effect, they may not be able to travel to the park.  Sask Parks recommends holding off on making reservations in provincial parks that fall within the NSAD, which includes Lac La Ronge and Narrow Hills, until the travel restriction has been removed.  Reservations for campsites will open at 7 a.m. on the scheduled days below, with the queue opening at 6:40 a.m.  Staggered launch dates and the queuing system will be implemented again in 2020 to help manage the volume the site experiences.  The schedule is as follows:  Monday, May 4: Seasonal campsites across provincial parks Wednesday, May 6: Pike Lake, The Battlefords, Narrow Hills, Blackstrap Thursday, May 7: Bronson Forest, Meadow Lake, Makwa Lake, Lac La Ronge Friday, May 8: Saskatchewan Landing, Douglas, Danielson Monday, May 11: Buffalo Pound, Rowan’s Ravine, Echo Valley, Crooked Lake Tuesday, May 12: Cypress Hills Wednesday, May 13: Duck Mountain, Good Spirit Lake, Greenwater Lake Thursday, May 14: Candle Lake, Great Blue Heron, Moose Mountain  Seasonal and nightly campsites can be reserved through the online system at https://saskparks.goingtocamp.com/ or through the call centre at 1-855-737-7275.  Customers are encouraged to purchase their annual park entry permits online when making their campsite reservation to limit in-person contact.

Recognizing the vital work they are doing, this supplement will apply to an estimated 35,000 lower income, essential workers at senior-care, group homes, childcare facilities, and emergency and transition shelters.  “Workers at these facilities have been helping many of Saskatchewan’s most vulnerable citizens get through the COVID-19 emergency,” Finance Minister Donna Harpauer said.  “This new wage supplement reflects how greatly we appreciate their ongoing efforts and dedication under challenging circumstances.”  The new wage supplement consists of a flat $400 per month benefit for up to 16 weeks (March 15 to July 4) for each eligible worker.  The application process for the supplement will be outlined in the coming days.  Workers will be eligible for the new supplement if they earn less than $2,500 per month and are employed at:  senior-care facilities, including private care homes and home care; licenced childcare facilities; group homes run by community-based organizations; and emergency shelters and transition shelters.  Essential workers such as caregivers, cooks and cleaners, both full-time and part-time, at these facilities are eligible.  “Often family members help support their loved ones in facilities, but visitation restrictions have made that impossible, putting even more emphasis on the essential roles of these workers,” Harpauer said.  The new wage supplement will be cost-shared with the federal government at an estimated total cost of about $56 million.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Jeff Welke Finance Regina Phone: 306-787-6046 Email: jeff.welke@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-536-1185 "

The announcement includes further travel restrictions for the Northern Saskatchewan Administrative District (NSAD).  Also included was immediate funding of $370,000 targeted to combating COVID-19 in the province’s Far North region, and the addition of seasonal businesses to the Saskatchewan Small Business Emergency Payment, including northern outfitters.  “Our government recognizes the unique challenges that northern communities are facing in fighting the spread of COVID-19,” Premier Scott Moe said.  “We are providing direct supports to northern communities and businesses to ensure the necessary resources are available, while imposing further restrictions to ensure the necessary steps are being taken to reduce the spread and flatten the curve in the north.”  Travel Restrictions Tightened Across Northern Saskatchewan  After further consultation with Northern leaders by Government Relations Minister Lori Carr, the province is announcing tighter travel restrictions for the province’s north to help stop the spread of COVID-19.  An updated public health order has been issued by Saskatchewan's Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Saqib Shahab to impose further restrictions, including:  Restricting all non-critical travel (including those with primary residences) into and out of the NSAD, as well as restricting all non-critical travel between northern communities. Northern residents are ordered to remain in their local communities and to practice appropriate social distancing.  Exceptions will be made only for critical items like collecting groceries and medical appointments. Travel related to the delivery of essential services will continue to be permitted.   For a complete list of approved travel visit https://publications.saskatchewan.ca/#/products/104577.  The NSAD is a large geographic area covering almost half of the province but containing less than 4.0 per cent of the provincial population.  Given the uniqueness of the north, case-by-case exemptions to the Order were evaluated upon the request of a community.  To date, the municipalities of La Ronge and Stony Rapids have been granted exemptions.  This means that travel to and from La Ronge and Stony Rapids from outside the NSAD is allowed, but individuals are not permitted to stop in any other community.  $370,000 Targeted to Communities Combating COVID-19 in Northern Saskatchewan  The Government of Saskatchewan is providing immediate funding of $370,000 targeted to combating COVID-19 in province’s Far North region.  Of the investment, $350,000 will be provided through the Ministry of Government Relations directly to New North, the province’s northern communities association.  Funding will help establish, staff and maintain community checkpoints as part of a recent public health order to address COVID-19 in the province’s far north.  The Northern Village of La Loche will receive $20,000 directly.  These funds will be used to support local public safety, food security and educational initiatives organized by the community to encourage physical distancing and self-isolation of residents.  Supports for Outfitters and Businesses Operating in Provincial Parks   The Government of Saskatchewan also announced new supports for northern outfitters and businesses operating in provincial parks.  Amendments to the Saskatchewan Small Business Emergency Payment (SSBEP) program will ensure these small businesses are eligible for grants up to $5,000.  Announced on April 9, the SSBEP is a $50 million program providing financial support as a one-time grant to small and medium-sized businesses that have had to temporarily close or significantly curtail operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The grants are paid based on 15 per cent of a business’ monthly sales revenue, to a maximum of $5,000.  This is in addition to measures taken by the Ministry of Environment to waive lease fees for outfitters for the 2020 season and providing flexible licensing arrangements for those suspending outfitting activities.  A modified application will be available in the coming days and can be accessed by visiting www.saskatchewan.ca/covid19-businesses.

Overall in Saskatchewan:  38 of the cases are health care workers; however, the source of the infections may not be related to health care in all instances. 151 of the cases are from the Saskatoon area, 75 from the Regina area, 74 from the north, 57 from the far north, 15 from the south, and 11 from the central region. 34 cases involve people 19 years of age and under, while the remainder are adults. 140 cases are in the 20-39 age range; 129 are in the 40-59 age range; 69 are in the 60-79 age range; and 11 are in the 80-plus range. 50 per cent of the cases are males and 50 per cent are females. Six deaths related to COVID-19 have been reported to date.  To date, 29,106 COVID-19 tests have been performed in the province.  As of April 27, 2020, when other provincial and national numbers were available from the Public Health Agency of Canada, Saskatchewan’s per capita rate was 22,917 people tested per million population, which exceeds the national rate of 19,709 people tested per million population.  Cluster Identified in Lloydminster  The new COVID-19 cases in Lloydminster have been linked to a cluster based in Lloydminster Hospital.  Thirteen cases have been identified, including five health care workers and eight patients, and transmission has occurred in the hospital setting.  As of April 29, 2020, the patients are being co-horted in separate units in Lloydminster Hospital.  COVID-19 patients will still be admitted to Lloydminster Hospital.  Non-COVID-19 patients requiring admission may be diverted to another hospital.  Key emergency department, emergency surgical and obstetrical services remain available at Lloydminster Hospital.  That is subject to change based on the ongoing risk assessment by public health.  All health care workers who have been identified as close contacts with a confirmed case are being tested as the contact investigation continues.  Mass Gatherings Not Allowed – Even with Physical Distancing  A couple of mass-gathering events were recently held in Saskatchewan where organizers mistakenly believed that gatherings were allowed as long as attendees maintained two metres of separation.  However, these types of group events are not allowed – whether or not people practise physical distancing.  Any gatherings that exceed 10 people are in violation of the current public health order.  Saskatchewan residents must continue to take measures to stop the spread of COVID-19.  This includes limiting gatherings to no more than 10 people – inside and outside – within an extended household group only and maintaining a minimum distance of two metres between people.  With extreme caution and under the following conditions, one or two close families may form an extended household group:  Your families or friends must remain consistent.  Do not visit different families or friends every day. If you are going to create an extended household group, consider if any member of the group has chronic health conditions that would put them at greater risk, or if they are in close contact with someone who could be vulnerable. Gatherings must follow the public health order and be no more than 10 people. Stay home if you are sick. Maintain physical distancing by keeping two-metres apart.  You should always be aware of who you have been in contact with over the past two weeks.  These are the people who would need to be contacted by public health if you were to test positive for COVID-19.  If you are experiencing fever, cough or shortness of breath, contact HealthLine 811 or your family physician for advice on whether you should be tested for COVID-19.  You can also take the online self-assessment at www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19.

363,2020-04-28,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/april/28/updated-pandemic-modelling,Government Website,New Pandemic Modelling Shows Improved Outlook for Saskatchewan," Released on April 28, 2020 Today, the Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) released new data showing that Saskatchewan is in a significantly better position to manage COVID-19 as a result of the interventions taken to date to slow the spread of the virus.  New Saskatchewan specific information shows Saskatchewan's Basic Reproductive Number for the virus as 3.12.  This means the average number of people a single COVID-19 positive person in Saskatchewan would infect, had no interventions been undertaken and everyone was susceptible.  With the introduction of public health measures in March and April 2020, the Effective Reproductive Number in Saskatchewan is 0.7 as of April 25.  This is the average number of people one person with the virus is likely to infect at the current time, after the effects of the interventions have been factored in.  This changes daily as behaviours and interventions change.  “This new data brings with it cautious optimism,” Saskatchewan Health Authority CEO Scott Livingstone said.  “Thanks to the Saskatchewan people's efforts and our own robust actions on testing, contact tracing and other public health measures, we are flattening the curve and helping ensure our health system can manage the surge in demand that may come from COVID-19.”  The SHA is using the new Saskatchewan-specific Basic Reproductive Number to adjust its planning scenarios, maintaining its commitment to plan for the worst, while aiming for the best.  The Effective Reproductive Number will be used to guide decisions specifically about public health measures.  This will help the province to make real-time adjustments to relax or tighten public restrictions, as needed, to help prevent a resurgence of COVID-19, while also balancing the need for a very gradual return to normalcy.  The SHA will release the Effective Reproductive Number weekly to help inform the public on the effect of current interventions or relaxed restrictions in Saskatchewan.  Analysis going back to early March indicates that the value of this number has been under one since early April.  The SHA also released updated information on the adjustments it is making to its COVID-19 Readiness Plan as a result of this new data.  Highlights from the offensive portion of the SHA's COVID-19 Health System Readiness plan include:  Maximizing testing capacity, accessibility and speed, including ongoing expansion of rapid testing capability across the province and outreach to populations less likely to seek testing; Surging contact tracing to stay ahead of demand, including a plan to meet any scenario up to 618 news cases per day in Saskatchewan; Helping prevent spread by restricting staff to work in a single facility; Contingency planning to use hotels to cohort COVID-19 positive patients who require intermediate care; Continuing to expand virtual care options to provide continuity of service while maintaining physical distancing, wherever possible.  The SHA's defensive strategy portion of the plan focuses on the readiness of our acute care services to meet any potential surge in demand from COVID-19.  Highlights from the adjustments made to this part of the plan include:  New planning scenario assumptions now estimate needing 1,000 fewer hospital beds, 400 fewer ICU beds and 400 fewer ventilators than previously announced on April 8, 2020; Continued preparation for field hospitals in Saskatoon and Regina to enable the SHA to scale up, if needed.  The SHA and Ministry of Health are also developing a plan to resume, in a staged approach, community services, elective surgeries and diagnostics that were impacted by earlier service slowdowns.  This will be released in the near future.  The elements of this plan will be activated in phases, with each phase triggered by surveillance data on transmission of the virus in the community.  Identification of which services will resume will consider factors such as highest priority patient needs, risk of transmission of the virus, impact on COVID-19 surge capacity, impact on inventory of personal protective equipment and other factors.  “Going forward there will be ups and downs in our fight against COVID-19,” Saskatchewan Health Authority Chief Medical Officer Dr. Susan Shaw said.  “That is why it is so critical that we be guided by the data and be willing to adapt as we learn more about COVID-19 and how the virus is behaving in the Saskatchewan context.  While we support the province's plan for gradually re-opening the province, it is a critical time to remind Saskatchewan residents that this will be a phased process where we still need our citizens to be vigilant and practice the same precautions that have proven effective to date.”  Saskatchewan residents can continue to help by taking specific action, including:  Practicing good hygiene, washing hands regularly and physical distancing (two metres apart wherever possible); Stay home, whenever and wherever possible; Abide by provincial and local travel, self-isolation, event and gathering restrictions; Avoid visiting our hospitals and long-term care facilities, unless there are compassionate reasons for doing so.

April 28 was first declared as the National Day of Mourning by the Canadian Labour Congress in 1984.  The day is now observed across Canada as a way to pay tribute to individuals killed, injured or stricken with illness in the workplace.  “The best way for us to honour those that have lost their life while on the job, is to do our part in building safer, healthier workplaces,” Labour Relations and Workplace Safety Minister Don Morgan said.  “Every worker has the right to return home safely at the end of the work day.”  “Workplace fatalities and serious injuries have an impact on the lives of families, friends and colleagues and our hearts go out to all those left behind by these tragedies,” Saskatchewan Workers' Compensation Board Chairperson Gord Dobrowolsky said.  “Today we take time to mourn and remember those that have lost their lives, and we renew our commitment to working together to keep everyone safe on the job.”  In 2019, 36 workplace fatalities occurred in Saskatchewan.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Kate Crowley Labour Relations and Workplace Safety Regina Phone: 306-787-3370 Email: kate.crowley@gov.sk.ca "

Given recent mild winters, increased hunting opportunities for elk, pronghorn, mule deer and white-tailed deer will be available.  Changes remain in place to the big game draw pool system, which expanded the draw from four to six priority pools in 2018.  The majority of applicants who qualified for the Legacy pool in 2019 were successfully drawn and the number of hunters moving from the Super A pool to Legacy pool remains low.  The chances of being drawn are very good for those applicants eligible for the Legacy pool.  Apply early and use the online residency verification tool to avoid complications.  Draws for several of the species receive a high number of applications compared to the number of licences available.  For these species, the odds of being drawn will be low, even for applications in the top priority pool.  The application process remains largely unchanged.  However, with no front-counter service at ministry field offices due to COVID-19, applications must be completed online.  Information regarding the application, priority pools, wildlife management zone (WMZ) quotas and detailed application instructions are available at www.saskatchewanlicences.active.com.   The big game draw is administered through the Saskatchewan Hunting, Angling and Trapping Licence (HAL) system.  Clients can submit, review and update their applications, check pool status history and purchase a draw licence through their HAL accounts.  Draw results will be available through HAL accounts in mid-June, with the exception of pronghorn, which will be available in mid-July.  Applicants are responsible for checking their own draw results.  Successful applicants will be able to purchase licences through their HAL accounts beginning August 1, 2020.  For information on your HAL account or assistance with completing an application, please call 1-888-773-8450.  If you have questions about your pool status or hunting in Saskatchewan, call the Ministry of Environment’s Inquiry Line at 1-800-567-4224.  Further information about the big game draw is available at www.saskatchewan.ca/hunting.  -30-  For more information, contact:  For public inquires, contact: Environment Regina Phone: 1-800-567-4224 Email: centre.inquiry@gov.sk.ca  Jamie Gibson Environment Regina Phone: 306-519-9290 Email: jamie.gibson@gov.sk.ca "

The Ministry of Health has received questions surrounding the time and process of reporting COVID-19 fatalities.  It is important to record and report COVID-19 cases and death in a uniform way, to ensure all jurisdictions have a consistent approach to reporting and that the evolving science can draw from this information.  COVID-19 fatalities must be confirmed by the medical health officer to ensure that the case meets the criteria in order to be documented in the epidemiological reporting tools, before they can be publicly reported by the ministry.  As of April 27, 2020, Saskatchewan has 12 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the provincial total to 365.  Eleven of the 12 new cases today are in the Far North and one is in the North region.  Seventy-two of the 365 cases are considered active.  Recoveries remain at 288 people.

This action is being taken in addition to a number of other actions the government has taken to address the outbreak in La Loche and protect northern residents.  Premier Scott Moe said there are unique challenges when an outbreak occurs in a remote northern community.  “Our government has already taken significant action to respond to the situation in La Loche and we are taking further action today,” Moe said.  “I have spoken with La Loche Mayor Robert St. Pierre and several other people in the community and we will continue to work closely with northern leaders to protect the north.”  Checkpoints have been established by northern leadership along all highways leading into northern Saskatchewan.  Today’s order provides the full legal authority to enforce travel restrictions into the north.  Staffing of the checkpoints will continue to be directed by northern leadership   The provincial government has offered fire suppression staff to support the checkpoints and to provide any other support required.  Moe said the requirement to self-isolate may also be a challenge for some residents.  “Social housing units are already being provided for individuals who need to self-isolate,” Moe said.  “I have directed that the school in La Loche also be made available for this purpose and that the Public Safety Agency provide mobile housing units – work-camp trailers – for individuals who need to self-isolate.”  Actions taken to date include:  An outbreak was declared at La Loche Health Centre LTC, which immediately initiated strengthened protections and protocols around infection control like limiting resident movement, additional precautions around use of PPE and enhanced daily cleaning schedules; A new portable GeneXpert testing unit has been provided for use in La Loche, which will result in significantly expanded testing capacity and shorter turnaround time; The Saskatchewan Health Authority has provided additional personal protective equipment (PPE) to the La Loche Health Centre and the province is actively working with the federal government to obtain additional PPE; On April 18, regional medical health officers advised against all non-essential travel between northwest Saskatchewan and northern Alberta; Regular COVID updates and information are being provided on radio across the North in four languages - English, Cree, Dene and Michif; Two Emergency Services Officers from the Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency have been deployed to the community; and The Public Safety Agency is providing assistance with emergency planning including training local emergency officers.  “As I noted yesterday, even though Saskatchewan has successfully reduced the spread of COVID-19, unfortunately we can expect to experience isolated outbreaks,” Moe said.  “Our health system and our government is prepared to take immediate action to respond to these outbreaks and that’s what we are doing today in the north.”  Public inquiries regarding the restriction of all non-critical travel into and out of Northern Saskatchewan Administration District (NSAD) can be directed to the Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency toll-free line at 1-855-559-5502.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Media Services Executive Council Regina Phone: 306-787-6281 "

Continued Measures to Stop the Spread of COVID-19  With the announcement of the Re-Open Saskatchewan plan, there have been some questions about the restrictions in place to stop the spread of COVID-19.  Saskatchewan residents should be aware that the public health order limiting gatherings to no more than 10 people remains in place.  However, with extreme caution and under the following conditions, one or two close families may form an extended household group:  The families or friends must remain consistent.  Do not visit different families or friends every day. If you are going to create an extended household group, consider if any member of the group has any chronic health conditions that would put them at greater risk, or if they are in close contact with someone who could be vulnerable. Gatherings must still follow the public health order and be no more than 10 people. Stay home if you are ill.  Maintain physical distancing where possible.   -30-  For more information, contact:  Health Regina Phone: 306-787-4083 Email: media@health.gov.sk.ca "

Re-Open Saskatchewan will consist of five phases, the first of which includes re-opening parks and campgrounds.    On May 4, 2020, campers can begin reserving campsites through the online reservation system.  As well, parks will open to vehicle traffic for Saskatchewan residents to allow activities such as angling, hiking and biking.  Park users will be required to follow physical distancing rules and are encouraged to be mindful while on docks, trails and in the parks.  The safety of park staff and visitors remains a top priority.  At first, campgrounds will be open to 50 per cent capacity, meaning only every other campsite will be available for booking.  To limit travel between provinces, camping in provincial parks will only be open to Saskatchewan residents starting June 1, until further notice.  Reservations for campsites will open at 7 a.m. on the scheduled days below, with the queue opening at 6:40 a.m.  Staggered launch dates and the queuing system will be implemented again in 2020 to help manage the volume the site experiences.  Campers must reserve online or through the call centre.  The schedule is as follows:  Monday, May 4: Seasonal campsites across provincial parks* Wednesday, May 6: Pike Lake, The Battlefords, Narrow Hills, Blackstrap Thursday, May 7: Bronson Forest, Meadow Lake, Makwa Lake, Lac La Ronge Friday, May 8: Saskatchewan Landing, Douglas, Danielson Monday, May 11: Buffalo Pound, Rowan’s Ravine, Echo Valley, Crooked Lake Tuesday, May 12: Cypress Hills Wednesday, May 13: Duck Mountain, Good Spirit Lake, Greenwater Lake Thursday, May 14: Candle Lake, Great Blue Heron, Moose Mountain  Seasonal and nightly campsites can be reserved through the online system at https://saskparks.goingtocamp.com or through the call centre at 1-855-737-7275.  *Seasonal campsite fees have been pro-rated to reflect the June 1 opening.

Interim benefits can provide producers with a portion of their final AgriStability benefit early, to help support losses and cover costs.  With this increase, Saskatchewan producers can apply for an interim benefit to receive 75 per cent of their estimated final 2020 benefit before completing their program year.  Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation (SCIC) is also waiving the six months farming and one production cycle criteria for participants applying for 2020 interim benefits.  “I want to reassure all farmers and food business owners that our Government recognizes their vital contribution to our communities and is committed to helping them cope with this exceptional situation,” said Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food Marie-Claude Bibeau.  “These increased advance payments will enable Saskatchewan farmers and ranchers get the additional cash flow they need to continue their operations during these difficult times.”  “In these uncertain times, the AgriStability interim payment can help producers with cash flow needs,” Saskatchewan Agriculture Minister David Marit said.  “If a producer qualifies for an interim benefit, this is a great way to get additional funds for their operation before filing their final application.”  Interim benefits are calculated based on the farm’s estimated program year margin, relative to its estimated reference margin.  The estimated program year margin must show a decline of 30 per cent or more compared to the estimated reference margin.  If a producer receives an interim benefit payment, they must still file all final program year forms and meet program requirements by the assigned deadlines.  The Governments of Canada and Saskatchewan understand the challenges facing producers during the unprecedented times created by the COVID-19 pandemic.  We continue to evaluate our entire suite of business risk management programs to ensure they are meeting the needs of Saskatchewan’s agriculture industry.  To enrol in the AgriStability Program or to apply for an interim benefit, producers can contact their local SCIC office or call the AgriStability Call Centre toll-free at 1-866-270-8450.  The deadline to enrol in AgriStability for the 2020 program year was extended to July 3, 2020.  SCIC AgriStability staff are available to assist producers over the phone at 1-866-270-8450 or through email at agristability@scic.ca, Monday to Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.   -30-  For more information, contact:  Micaela Madson Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation Melville Phone: 639-398-2274 Email: micaela.madson@scic.ca "

375,2020-04-23,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/april/23/reopen-saskatchewan-plan,Government Website,Province Announces Re-Open Saskatchewan Plan," Released on April 23, 2020 Today, Premier Scott Moe and Saskatchewan's Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Saqib Shahab announced the Re-Open Saskatchewan plan.  Re-Open Saskatchewan is a plan built on a methodical and phased approach to slowly lifting restrictions so that more businesses can open and more employees can go back to work.  The plan introduces five phases to methodically, gradually and cautiously re-open businesses and services across Saskatchewan, beginning May 4, 2020.  The plan also details physical distancing measures and restrictions that will remain in place throughout the five phases and provides a number of factors to inform decisions regarding the lifting of long-term restrictions.  “Over the next several weeks, restrictions will be gradually lifted by adding more types of businesses to the allowable businesses list, meaning that they can re-open if they so choose,” Moe said.  “All businesses and public venues will be required to continue following physical distancing and cleaning and disinfection practices to protect both employees and customers.  Members of the public will be expected to follow physical distancing rules and to stay home if they are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms.”  Five Phases of the Re-Open Saskatchewan Plan  The Re-Open Saskatchewan plan consists of five phases.  The timing and order of the businesses and workplaces included in each phase is subject to change throughout the process based on a continuous assessment of transmission patterns and other factors.  Phase One – Beginning May 4, 2020  The first phase of the plan includes the re-opening of medical services restricted under the current public health order, and the resumption of low-risk outdoor recreational activities, including fishing and boat launches, golf courses and a fixed date for parks and campgrounds.  The size restrictions of public and private gatherings will remain at a maximum of 10 people. On May 4, public access to medical services will be reinstated, including access to dentistry, optometry, physical therapy, opticians, podiatry, occupational therapy and chiropractic treatment.  When it is not possible to physically distance, providers will be required to take precautionary measures as outlined by the Chief Medical Health Officer. Low-risk outdoor recreational activities will be allowable with precautionary measures, including fishing and boat launches (May 4), golfing with physical distancing guidelines (May 15) and a fixed date (June 1) and clear guidelines for the operation of parks and campgrounds.  Phase Two – May 19, 2020  The second phase of the plan includes the May 19 re-opening of retail businesses and select personal services that were previously not deemed allowable. The size restrictions of public and private gatherings will remain at a maximum of 10 people. A full list of retail businesses and select personal services that will be deemed allowable in phase two is included in the Re-Open Saskatchewan plan, along with guidance, protocols, and physical distancing measures that allowable businesses and services are required to observe.  Phase Three – Date To Be Determined  The third phase will be implemented following an evaluation of transmission patterns of COVID-19, and does not have a pre-determined date.  The third phase will include the re-opening of remaining personal services, along with the re-opening of restaurant-type facilities, gyms and fitness facilities, licensed establishments and childcare facilities.  Capacity limits will remain in some facilities, such as limits to 50 per cent of regular capacity for restaurants and licensed establishments. All businesses and customers will be expected to maintain physical distancing practices, guidelines and recommendations. Other than in allowable businesses, the size of public and private gatherings will increase to a maximum of 15 people.  Phase Four – Date To Be Determined   The fourth phase will be implemented following an evaluation of transmission patterns of COVID-19, and does not have a pre-determined date.  The fourth phase will include the re-opening of indoor and outdoor recreation and entertainment facilities. All businesses and customers will be expected to maintain physical distancing practices, guidelines and recommendations. Other than in allowable businesses, the size of public and private gatherings will increase to a maximum of 30 people.  Phase Five – Date To Be Determined   The fifth phase will be implemented following an evaluation of transmission patterns of COVID-19 and the preceding four phases, and will include the consideration of lifting long-term restrictions.  Monitoring Transmission of COVID-19 and Phase Advancement Criteria  As restrictions are gradually lifted, the Government of Saskatchewan and Dr. Saqib Shahab, Chief Medical Health Officer, will carefully monitor the daily number of reported cases and other important indicators.  These factors will inform decisions regarding the pace at which the restrictions can be lifted or put back in place if required. Transmission is controlled; Health system capacities are in place to test, isolate and treat every case and trace every contact; Outbreak risks are minimized in special settings like health facilities and nursing homes; Preventive measures are in place in workplaces, schools and other essential places; Importation risks can be managed; Communities are fully educated, engaged and empowered to adjust to the new norm.  The plan will also provide clear guidance to the public so they can continue to follow current public health orders and prepare accordingly for lifting of restrictions.  Long-Term Restrictions on High Risk Areas Remain In Place  A number of long-term measures and restrictions that are related to the highest risk areas will remain in place for the foreseeable future.  These long-term restrictions include:  Maintaining the current Provincial State of Emergency; Recommendations against non-essential international and interprovincial travel; Mandatory 14-day self-isolation following international travel, exposure to COVID-19, or a positive COVID-19 test; Visitor restrictions limited to compassionate reasons at long-term care homes, hospitals, personal care homes and group homes; The suspension of classes in all primary and secondary educational institutions, both public and private; and Large public gatherings remain prohibited.  Recommendations throughout all Phases  The following recommendations should remain in place through all five phases: Protective measures for vulnerable populations; Individuals should continue working from home if they can do so effectively; Physical distancing must be maintained, wherever possible; People must stay at home when they are sick; Vulnerable individuals, such as seniors and those with underlying health conditions, should continue to exercise caution and minimize high-risk exposures, such as public outings; Personal hygiene will continue to be a key prevention measure; Enhanced cleaning and disinfection should take place in workplaces, public spaces and recreational facilities; Although the public health order regarding the size of gatherings does not apply to businesses and workplaces, they are expected to follow the recommended public health measures, including: physical distancing for staff and clients; regular cleaning and disinfection; frequent handwashing and sanitizing; use of PPE where available and appropriate; and keeping staff who demonstrate or report COVID-19 symptoms out of the workplace; and Long-term care and personal care homes must ensure that each staff member works in only one facility.  Service Delivery Within the Saskatchewan Health Authority  Re-Open Saskatchewan does not include service delivery plans for the Saskatchewan Health Authority.  Resumption of elective surgeries, diagnostics and other non-essential procedures currently suspended as part of the COVID-19 system response will be considered separately, with updates on that plan coming in the near future.  COVID-19 Information for Saskatchewan Residents  Residents of Saskatchewan should remain diligent in maintaining physical distancing and practicing good hygiene.  For information regarding the latest COVID-19 updates and to read the full Re-Open Saskatchewan plan, visit www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19.   Businesses seeking further information can contact the Business Response Team by calling 1-844-800-8688, emailing supportforbusiness@gov.sk.ca or by visiting www.saskatchewan.ca/covid19-businesses.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Media Services Executive Council Regina Phone: 306-787-6281 "

Tonight, I want to talk to you about where we’ve been, where we are, and where we are going.  As we fight the spread of COVID-19. I want to begin tonight by saying thank you. Thank you for following all of the guidelines and restrictions that have been put in place to contain the spread of COVID-19. The last few weeks have been difficult for everyone. This is not how things are supposed to be.    People are meant to be together.   It’s against our very nature to stay apart. But by doing so, we protected ourselves, our families, our neighbours and our province. By doing so, we protected our health care workers and we ensured our health system was not overwhelmed. Tonight I can tell you - without any doubt, it is working. Saskatchewan has reduced the spread of COVID-19. We have flattened the curve. And that’s thanks to you.   Each and every one of you. Over the past few weeks, we all had to quickly learn a strange new way to live. And we did. We learned to stay physically away from one another, while at the same time staying connected and supporting one another through this difficult time. We figured out ways to work from home if we could. Employees at grocery stores and pharmacies and other businesses that stayed open came up with new ways of doing things to protect themselves and their customers, while still providing an essential service to Saskatchewan people. We learned about “physical distancing” and “self-isolation” and “flattening the curve.” We learned how to pull together by staying apart. And we did all these things as if lives depended on it. Because they do. We have seen what happened in other parts of the world where the virus spread quickly, and the health system became overwhelmed. Thankfully, that has not happened here, and that’s because of you. So thank you. Thank you to everyone working in our health care system. Doctors, nurses, technologists and pharmacists.  Cooks, cleaners and maintenance workers.  Students, volunteers and retirees who have returned to the workforce. Thanks to all the people providing the other essential services that we need. I’m thinking about the folks working in grocery stores and in our food distribution system. The workers delivering food and parcels to our homes, the truckers who keep our supplies moving. The utility workers who ensure we have power, heat and clean water. The farmers and ranchers. And our first responders: the police, firefighters, EMTs and paramedics.   Thanks to the parents whose kids have been at home these past few weeks instead of at school. And thanks to the teachers for finding ways to ensure our kids can still be students. Thank you as well to everyone who isn’t working right now. Everyone who is doing the right thing by staying home to reduce the spread. Thank you to the businesses that have been required to close temporarily or severely cut back your operations. And to all the employees of those businesses who are now staying home because you have lost your job, I know this is an extremely difficult time for you and your families. But tonight, because of the tremendous effort of Saskatchewan people and the success we have had in reducing the spread, I think we can begin to provide a bit of optimism. And a roadmap for businesses and services to gradually reopen, and allow for more people to return to work. Again, the only reason we can begin to have this conversation tonight is because together, we have reduced the spread and flattened the curve. By any objective measure, what we are doing in Saskatchewan is working. What YOU are doing is working. As of today, Saskatchewan has had 326 cases of COVID-19. Four people have unfortunately passed, and we mourn with their families and friends. But 261 people have now recovered from the virus. And today, there are just 61 active cases in Saskatchewan, and just five people in hospital. To put those numbers in context, on a per capita basis, the number of COVID-19 cases in Saskatchewan is about 70 per cent below the Canadian average, and the number of serious outcomes - hospitalizations and deaths - is more than 90 per cent below the national average. At the same time, the COVID-19 testing rate in Saskatchewan is more than 40 per cent higher than the national average. We’re doing well. So, can we continue to reduce the spread and keep those case numbers low... While at the same time gradually allowing more businesses to reopen and more Saskatchewan people to return to work? I believe we can, but only if we proceed with caution.  Great caution. Our government takes this decision extremely seriously. We know there are risks on both sides. If we move too quickly, we risk increasing the spread of COVID-19. If we move too slowly, we risk permanent damage to the livelihoods of thousands of Saskatchewan people. Businesses that never reopen, and jobs that never come back. So we have to find the right path. Tomorrow, we will unveil a plan to gradually and methodically re-open businesses and public services that have been closed because of the pandemic. It is a plan developed in close consultation with Saskatchewan’s Chief Medical Health Officer Doctor Shahab. It is a plan that will be carried out in five phases, and as we proceed with each phase, we will carefully monitor COVID-19 case numbers and adjust the plan as required. As businesses are allowed to reopen and employees return to work, they will have to follow stringent physical distancing and cleaning procedures, just like the grocery stores and other businesses that are open and operating safely today. As we cautiously proceed through this re-opening process, some of the other restrictions will remain in place for the foreseeable future. We know that, in Saskatchewan and elsewhere, the largest and most dangerous outbreaks have been related to travel, to large gatherings, and to seniors care homes. So all of those restrictions will remain in place. We also know that aggressive testing and contact tracing are key to controlling the spread of COVID-19. Canada has one of the highest testing rates in the world, and Saskatchewan has one of the highest testing rates in Canada. That will continue.    In fact, we are looking at ways to increase testing and contact tracing in the days ahead. Ongoing restrictions in high risk areas, and aggressive testing and contact tracing. This is how we will continue to keep our case numbers low and manageable as we proceed with caution through the re-opening process. Tomorrow, Dr. Shahab and I will outline which businesses and services will be included in each phase of the Re-Open Saskatchewan plan, and some dates in May when the first couple of phases will begin. Again, let me be clear - this will be a gradual, methodical, and cautious process. It’s not like flipping on a light switch. If anything, it’s more like a dimmer switch that’s been turned down… over the next several weeks, we will gradually be turning up the light once again on Saskatchewan’s economy. It’s been said that adversity doesn’t build character; it reveals it. I believe that. Here are some examples that reveal everything you need to know about Saskatchewan’s character. Alex Pelletier of Regina decided to make 200 brown bag lunches in his apartment at Easter.  He figured with the pandemic, there were some people going hungry.  So Alex hit the streets and gave those 200 lunches to people in need. In Prince Albert, 79-year-old Eleanor Land decided to fire up her four bread makers.  Eleanor’s been baking 50 to 60 loaves of bread a week for the Community Cares Kitchen.  The kitchen has been providing meals for families impacted by Covid 19. In Moose Jaw, Chris Merkel decided to post this on Facebook: “I will be offering my help to anyone in the city for running errands.  “I will gladly go get your groceries or anything you need.  I’m a single person with no kids in my 30’s.  “I feel that I should be putting myself in harm’s way before anyone else.” Three stories out of thousands. It’s true. Adversity does reveal character. And in this crisis, your character has been revealed as resilient, determined, courageous, and compassionate. Caring and strong.   That’s Saskatchewan. And I’ve never been so proud to call this province home.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Media Services Executive Council Regina Phone: 306-787-6281             "

Producers around the province are also being reminded to practice safe burning, obey all fire bans and fireproof their property.  Anyone planning to burn should consult the local RM Office to verify that no municipal fire ban is in place and call the Control Burn line at 1-866-404-4911.  “As the provincial agency responsible for fire safety and wildland fire management, the Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency has taken extra measures to ensure we can protect the people, property and resources of Saskatchewan,” Pritchard said.  Extra precautions being taken include increased COVID-19 mitigation actions, adjusting training to reduce the risk to staff, and increasing fire prevention awareness across the province.

To assist with cash flow and financial stability, participants in the AgriStability Program can apply for an interim benefit.  Through an interim benefit, producers receive a portion of their AgriStability benefit early to help support losses and cover costs before completing their fiscal year.  Enrolling in the AgriStability Program is easy.  Saskatchewan producers can provide all the necessary information over the phone through a brief conversation.  Producers can also complete the short contact form to begin the application process and request a call back from AgriStability staff.  The contact form is available at www.scic.ca/agristability/how-to-apply.  SCIC AgriStability staff are available to assist producers over the phone at 1-866-270-8450 or through email at agristability@scic.ca, Monday to Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.  Access the Agriculture and Agri-Food News Bulletin at https://www.canada.ca/en/agriculture-agri-food/news/2020/04/info-bulletin---agristability-2020-enrollment-deadline-extended.html.   -30-  For more information, contact:  Tessa Krofchek Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation Melville Phone: 639-398-2268 Email: tessa.krofchek@scic.ca "

The Wills (Public Emergencies) Regulations, which came into force on April 16, permit the signing of a will to be witnessed remotely as long as one of two witnesses is a lawyer.  “With the current public health emergency, it is impractical and potentially risky for the required people to be in the same room during the signing of a will, particularly for those who may be more vulnerable to the virus,” Justice Minister and Attorney General Don Morgan said.  “These Regulations will ensure that wills can be signed remotely, reducing the risk of exposure to COVID-19.”  Under normal circumstances, a will must be in writing and signed by the person making the will or by someone acting on their behalf.  The signing of the will must also be witnessed by two people (one of whom is usually the person’s lawyer), who also sign the will.  These regulations allow an individual to sign their will, send the signed copy back to their lawyer, and acknowledge their signature remotely via video before their lawyer and a second witness.  The Regulations do not allow for the creation of an electronic will or the use of electronic signatures.  Wills must be in writing and signed by the person making the will and both witnesses in ink.  These changes follow other recently implemented emergency regulations that permit the remote witnessing and commissioning by lawyers of other legal documents, such as powers of attorney and land titles documents.

Shippers are reminded to check in to ensure they understand what restrictions are in place on provincial roads at https://www.saskatchewan.ca/business/transportation-and-road-construction/information-for-truckers-and-commercial-trucking-companies/regulations-and-road-restrictions/increased-weights-and-road-restrictions.  Official spring restriction orders are issued every Tuesday and Friday by 12:30 p.m. (CST) during the ban period.

The potential revenue decline in 2020-21 ranges from $1.3 billion to $3.3 billion, depending on the duration of pandemic-related economic restrictions.  “We are less than three weeks into the new fiscal year and right now we just don’t know how long restrictions will remain in place in Saskatchewan, in Canada and around the world,” Finance Minister Donna Harpauer said.  “That’s why it is still incredibly difficult to forecast with any certainty.  We believe however it is important that we release these different scenarios, to let Saskatchewan people know just how much of an impact the pandemic is having on our economy and revenues.”  The potential revenue declines are based on three economic scenarios.  Each scenario includes assumptions on a number of economic factors, including the duration of current economic restrictions, how soon resource prices may recover and anticipated consumer behaviour once restrictions are lifted.  Real GDP scenarios for 2020 are all negative and range from a decline of 4.1 per cent under the most optimistic scenario to a decline of 14.9 per cent in the most pessimistic scenario.  At this time, the Government is managing spending within the amounts allocated in the budget estimates released on March 18, 2020.  “Our government has committed to provide all financial resources necessary to address the COVID-19 pandemic, and this will likely result in spending increases beyond the amounts allocated in the 2020-21 Estimates,” Harpauer said.  Harpauer pointed to strong management of the province’s finances as providing a solid fiscal foundation from which to manage the pressure from the current pandemic crisis and ultimate recovery.  Saskatchewan was on track for a surplus in 2019-20 and 2020-21 prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and oil price collapse.  Saskatchewan has maintained the second highest credit rating in the country, continues to have among the lowest net-debts as a percentage of GDP and continues to maintain a solid cash position.  “The 2020-21 deficit is not a structural deficit,” Harpauer said.  “It is a pandemic deficit.  Saskatchewan will manage through this, because we have the strength, the foundation and the people to do it.”  -30-  For more information, contact:  Jeff Welke Finance Regina Phone: 306-787-6046 Email: jeff.welke@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-536-1185              "

Extending mineral rights, scheduled to expire in 2020, by one year.  This includes rights granted under the terms of an oil and gas lease, exploration license or permit.  The extension will provide oil and gas disposition holders with the time necessary to properly evaluate their properties once the current situation stabilizes. Reducing the industry portion of the Oil and Gas Administrative Levy by 50 per cent this fiscal year and delaying the invoicing of the remaining balance until October 1, 2020.  This will provide the sector with relief of $11.4 million to address immediate liquidity challenges. (It is important to note that unlike other sectors, the oil and gas sector pays for 90 per cent of its own regulatory costs).  Methane Equivalency  The Government of Saskatchewan has also reached a draft agreement with the Government of Canada on the regulation of methane reductions in the upstream oil and gas industry.  The federal government will now begin the process of confirming the terms of the agreement through the federal review process.  This agreement is the result of several months of engagement between the two levels of government and fulfills the request of industry to be regulated by the province.  “We are very pleased that the federal government has agreed with the strength of our Methane Action Plan, and that we have regained provincial jurisdiction over our regulations,” Eyre said.  “We will now work with our operators in a common sense way to reduce emissions from venting and flaring by 4.5 million tonnes per year by 2025.”  “We acknowledge and are encouraged by the Government of Saskatchewan’s efforts to introduce these relief measures to the oil and natural gas industry as we deal with the unprecedented challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the global economic crisis,” CAPP Vice-President of Western Canada Operations Brad Herald said.  “CAPP is also pleased the province and the Government of Canada have reached a draft methane equivalency agreement. Provinces are the best-placed regulator for their natural resource industries.”  Memorandum of Agreement Signed  The Government of Saskatchewan has taken additional steps to reduce red tape and duplicated regulations for Saskatchewan service rigs operators.  The province recently signed, with the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors (CAODC), a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) that harmonizes regulations with Alberta to support local service rig companies and their employees.  “The new transportation MOA reduces red tape for service rigs while ensuring the highest level of public safety in Saskatchewan,” CAODC President and CEO Mark Scholz said.  “We thank the Saskatchewan Government for their leadership and helping get our people back to work.”  -30-  For more information, contact:  Ashley Schoff Energy and Resources Regina Phone: 306-787-5582 Email: ashley.schoff2@gov.sk.ca "

Starting April 15, staff, physicians, learners, trainees, vendors and contractors will be screened daily as they enter any SHA facility or program area to ensure they do not have any influenza like illness.  As an added level of protection all staff and physicians who work in patient/client/resident care areas or travel through those areas will be wearing a mask at all times.  These measures are being put in place to protect everyone from exposure to, and spread of COVID-19.  “Safety is our top priority,” Saskatchewan Health Authority CEO Scott Livingstone said.  “That is why we continue to escalate our efforts to protect our patients and health care providers.  Requiring these daily screening practices and adapting our approach to masking will help us stop the spread of COVID-19 and help protect our workforce to ensure our health care services are there when needed.”  The implementation of screening measures will be phased in throughout the SHA facilities including long-term care facilities and programs, including long-term care facilities, hospitals, primary care sites, as well as affiliates working toward a standard of daily screening and temperature checks twice daily consistent with self-monitoring and the most recent health Canada guidelines.  The SHA appreciates the understanding of the public as these additional measures to ensure the safety of our patients and health care workers are implemented in the coming days.  The SHA continues to remind the public that the key variable for saving lives and protecting health care workers is public compliance with isolation measures, physical distancing, effective hand washing and staying home whenever and wherever possible.  Saskatchewan residents can continue to help by taking specific action, including:  Practicing good hygiene, washing hands regularly and practicing physical distancing (two metres apart wherever possible); Taking care of family, friends and neighbours who may be affected by mandatory self-isolation orders; Abide by provincial and local travel, self-isolation, event and gathering restrictions; Use medical supplies effectively and efficiently so that they are there when needed; and Avoid visiting our hospitals and long-term care facilities, unless there are compassionate reasons for doing so.

Consumers that observe price gouging either in advertisements or before, during, or after a transaction are encouraged to do one or more of the following:  Call FCAA’s consumer protection tip hotline at 1-877-880-5550 to provide information. File a tip through FCAA’s website at https://fcaa.gov.sk.ca/consumers-investors-pension-plan-members/consumers/consumers-of-goods-and-services/combatting-grossly-excessive-prices.  File a formal complaint using the FCAA complaint portal at https://fcaa.saskatchewan.ca/apex/f?p=200:RUN:0::::PRUN_PROC_ID:12589&cs=17E037060D51B5ACC686E7CC6BF0E21D6  If possible, register a complaint with the supplier.  Consumers can also register an on-line complaint with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) at https://www.bbb.org/consumer-complaints/.   Consumers should keep all receipts, contracts and advertisements that help demonstrate that price gouging is occurring or has occurred during the period of crisis or emergency.      For more information about price gouging visit https://fcaa.gov.sk.ca/consumers-investors-pension-plan-members/consumers/consumers-of-goods-and-services/combatting-grossly-excessive-prices.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Stephanie Wilkinson Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority  Regina Phone: 306-787-5567 Email: stephanie.wilkinson@gov.sk.ca "
399,2020-04-13,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/april/13/investor-alert,Government Website,Investor Alert - Aggressive Stock Promotion Exploits Fears Of Coronavirus Recession," Released on April 13, 2020                  The Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority (FCAA) is warning the public to exercise extreme caution about aggressive promotion of Crestview Exploration Inc., a B.C. gold mining company.  A mailing sent this week from a “stock analyst and geologist” to residents of B.C., Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan makes exaggerated claims about Crestview, predicting that its stock price “will soar as the recession hits.”  The letter comes in an envelope, without a return address, that says in bold red letters, “CORONAVIRUS AFFECTING MARKETS: READ NOW.”  “The short-term upside potential for investors buying shares of Crestview Exploration today is around 500% while long-term shareholders (12+ months) could see gains exceeding 2,400%,” the letter says.  Crestview, listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, issued a statement April 8 stating that it was not responsible for the promotion, and said the letter contained “unfounded forward-looking statements.”  The company urged investors and potential investors to verify any statements, and the source of such statements, contained in buy recommendations.  The FCAA reminds investors to exercise caution when considering aggressive promotions as a basis for investment decisions, as these promotions may make false claims of large profits and baseless stock price projections.  Most aggressive stock promotions in recent years have been done through unsolicited email or social media, but promotions delivered through the mail carry the same risks.  The FCAA encourages anyone who is considering buying or selling an investment to do research or talk to their registered investment advisor to ensure it is an appropriate decision.

403,2020-04-09,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/april/09/small-business-support,Government Website,Emergency Support Program For Saskatchewan Small Businesses," Released on April 9, 2020 Saskatchewan small businesses will receive additional provincial support to help deal with current COVID-19 challenges through the new Saskatchewan Small Business Emergency Payment (SSBEP).  The $50 million program will provide financial support to small and medium-sized businesses that have had to temporarily close or significantly curtail operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  “We have heard from our business community and understand the unprecedented challenges that they are facing,” Premier Scott Moe said.  “Our government is providing critical support for businesses that have had to fully or partially close their doors to protect public health and reduce the spread of COVID-19.  This is a significant first step in our economic recovery efforts and we are committed to continuing to work with businesses through this uncertain time.”  The SSBEP provides a one-time grant for small and medium-sized enterprises directly affected by government public health orders related to COVID-19.  Grants will be paid based on 15 per cent of a business’ monthly sales revenue, to a maximum of $5,000.  To give maximum flexibility to businesses, the grant is not dedicated to specific cost pressures.  Through the consultation process, many businesses made it clear they are facing acute cash flow pressures in the immediate term due to fixed overhead costs, such as rent and lease payments.  The SSBEP will help businesses address these immediate pressures.  To be eligible for the SSBEP, a business must:  have been fully operational on February 29, 2020; have ceased or curtailed operations as a result of the COVID-19 public health order; have less than 500 employees; and commit to reopen business operations following the cancellation of the COVID-19 public health order.  The development of SSBEP is the result of extensive consultations with the business community since COVID-19 restrictions began.  The program was designed to be simple and provide businesses with timely access to funding.  The Government of Saskatchewan will be requesting that the federal government exempt the SSBEP from business income for tax purposes.  The SSBEP supplements previously announced supports for businesses, including waiving penalties and interest charges for three months for late PST returns, zero-interest bill deferral for up to six months for all Crown utilities, and waiving Workers Compensation Board premium penalties until June 30, 2020.  “COVID-19 is having a significant impact on business and our economy,” Regina and District Chamber of Commerce CEO John Hopkins said.  “We applaud the Government of Saskatchewan for introducing the Saskatchewan Small Business Emergency Payment and for hearing our concerns about the lack of business cash flow because of COVID-19.  Many businesses are facing critical decisions about the future and the need for cash flow now to help with expenses like rents or leases.  The reality that the payment will be expedited is also vital at this time of need and we commend the government for its understanding of the plight of business.”  “CFIB is pleased the Government of Saskatchewan has heard the concerns of the business community and appreciates this support, which will help to address immediate cash flow issues businesses are dealing with,” CFIB Vice-President Western Canada and Agri-business Marilyn Braun-Pollon said.  “The flexibility and timeliness of this funding will help businesses allocate the dollars as needed during this difficult time.”  “Our members are experiencing significant cash flow issues as the result of this pandemic and we appreciate the provincial government stepping up with this new program,” North Saskatoon Business Association Executive Director Keith Moen said.  “This funding will provide some much needed support for businesses to help with these challenges.”  Further details and applications will be available on April 13.  For more information, businesses can visit www.saskatchewan.ca/covid19-businesses.   -30-  For more information, contact:  Media Services Executive Council Regina Phone: 306-787-6281 "

The Ministry of Advanced Education announced today it will help students with limited financial resources and supports whose studies and employment have been disrupted.  The amount of emergency funding will depend on each students’ circumstances.  “Our government is committed to helping students achieve their educational goals,” Advanced Education Minister Tina Beaudry-Mellor said.  “This is especially true during this unprecedented time, as some students are faced with limited supports.  These resources will help quickly address some of their more pressing needs.”  This financial adjustment for publicly-funded post-secondary institutions will support both domestic and international students in need through one-time emergency bursaries.  The Ministry of Advanced Education will also work with publicly-funded institutions that do not have existing emergency financial aid programs for students to put emergency bursaries in place.  “We recognize the need for urgent supports to help vulnerable students, including those from northern, remote and indigenous communities, as well as international students unable to return home,” Beaudry-Mellor said.  “It is critical that we work with our institutions to help students who have nowhere else to turn.”  Emergency bursaries for students will be available from April 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020.  Eligibility requirements and application details will be available to students through their post-secondary educational institution within the next week to ten days, after details are finalized.  Adjustments may be made to the program once details of any federal assistance are announced.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Scott Brown Advanced Education Regina Phone: 306-787-0355 Email: scott.brown@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-527-6903              "

408,2020-04-08,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/april/08/health-system-readiness,Government Website,SHA Releases Next Phase Of COVID-19 Response Plan," Released on April 8, 2020 Continued efforts on the part of the public are needed to ensure our health system can respond to the impact of COVID-19 in Saskatchewan.  Modeling data released today by the Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) indicates that the key variable for saving lives and protecting health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic is public compliance with prescribed isolation measures, physical distancing, effective hand washing and staying home, whenever and wherever possible.  It also indicates that current interventions are making a difference.  “Our job as a health care system is to provide care for those in need and to be ready for any scenario,” SHA CEO Scott Livingstone said.  “While we understand Canadian data is starting to show some hopeful signs about flattening the curve on COVID-19, it is critical to remember not to be complacent.  We need to continue to escalate our response to ensure we are prepared for the worst case scenarios and we need the public to help us avoid those scenarios.”  The SHA has increased access to testing through the creation of 38 testing sites around the province and tripled the staff available for contact tracing efforts to detect and prevent community transmission.  As public health measures and capacity for community care services continue to increase, the acute care system has also been planning to add capacity.  Up to 57 per cent more acute care capacity will be phased in as needed over the next several weeks, in anticipation of increased hospitalization rates.  None of the major changes in this plan are immediate.  Communities will continue to be updated as changes to services and service locations occur in their areas through various communications channels as well as through Saskatchewan’s central access point for information at www.saskatchewan.ca/covid19.   The following are highlights of the measures the SHA is taking in its next phase of pandemic response to ensure safety by segmenting patient populations between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patient populations:  Creating dedicated spaces within many of its facilities to cohort COVID-19 patients; Designating certain hospitals COVID-19 hospitals.  These changes are not immediate.  The SHA has proactively identified 20 out of its 65 hospitals that would be designated COVID-19 hospitals, if required to meet the clinical needs of the patient population in their areas of the province; Adding acute care capacity through the creation of field hospitals in Saskatoon and Regina, with more locations being considered as part of later, contingency planning.  These measures are in addition to those SHA has already initiated to meet the demands of COVID-19.  A slowdown of non-essential services to increase bed availability has already created acute care capacity across the system for handling a surge in COVID-19 related cases at future stages of the pandemic.  As of April 5, 43 per cent of Saskatchewan’s acute care beds were available for use, largely as a result of the slow down and preparation for the surge.  “We wanted to be transparent with the plan going forward so the public is aware of the escalated measures we will put into place if needed, but it is critical to remember that many of the changes proposed in this plan will be implemented only in response to anticipated surges in patient demand that start to exceed our capacity,” Livingstone said.  “Changes like conversion to COVID-19 dedicated hospitals will only occur where it is absolutely required to ensure safety and maintain access for patients who need our care.”  Saskatchewan residents can continue to help by taking specific action, including:  Practising good hygiene, washing hands regularly and practicing physical distancing (two metres apart wherever possible); Taking care of family, friends and neighbours who may be affected by mandatory self-isolation orders; Abide by provincial and local travel, self-isolation, event and gathering restrictions; Use medical supplies effectively and efficiently so that they are there when needed; and Avoid visiting our hospitals and long-term care facilities unless there are compassionate reasons for doing so.  “No health system in the world can manage this challenge without the sustained help of the general public,” SHA Chief Medical Officer Dr. Susan Shaw said.  “To save lives, Saskatchewan residents need to do their best to stay healthy and strong and abide by the restrictions and guidelines for the general public around COVID-19.  Demand will exceed our capacity as a health system if we are not diligent about these measures.”  -30-  For more information, contact:  Saskatchewan Health Authority Saskatoon Phone: 1-833-766-4392 Email: Media@saskhealthauthority.ca "

Beat the pre-holiday rush and purchase your Easter dinner groceries ahead of time.  Remember, only one person from a household should go shopping.  Make a list so you can quickly purchase your goods.

There continues to be a risk of local transmission in these essential workplaces and all employers and employees are reminded to practice prevention methods at all times – on the job site, in the breakroom or when working outdoors.  • Actively monitor for symptoms.  At the first sign of cough, immediately self-isolate for 14 days. • Practice physical distancing in the workplace, including those workplaces that are outdoors.  Maintain a two-metre separation between individuals. • Wash your hands often. • Cough/sneeze into your elbow or tissue and wash your hands immediately.  Workplaces must ensure their occupational health and safety guidelines are up to date and being enforced to prevent the transmission of respiratory illnesses.  Further information is available online at www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID-19 under the Information for Businesses and Workers section.  Be Efficient When Shopping  While many grocery stores and retailers have taken steps to reduce crowding, you also need to do your part.  If possible, only one person from a household should go shopping for essentials – no more than once per week.  Make a list ahead of time so you can shop in an efficient manner instead of browsing.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Health Regina Phone: 306-787-4083 Email: media@health.gov.sk.ca "

Twelve more people have recovered from COVID-19 in Saskatchewan, bringing the provincial total to 48.  Of the 220 cases in the province:  102 cases are travellers. 52 are community contacts (mass gatherings included). 10 have no known exposures. 56 are under investigation by local public health. Due to an administrative adjustment, four confirmed positives have been added to the provincial total that were tested in out-of-province laboratories over the past couple of weeks.  Including these positive tests is a routine part of surveillance case counting processes.  Overall in Saskatchewan:  One hundred and eleven of the cases are from the Saskatoon area, 45 from the Regina area, 42 from the north, 10 from the south, nine from the central region and three from the far north. Six cases involve people 19 years of age and under, while the remainder are adults. One hundred cases are in the 20-44 age range; 79 are in the 45-64 age range; and 35 are in the 65-plus range. 55 per cent of the cases are males and 45 per cent are females.

Assisted Living Worker Tests Positive for COVID-19  An employee at an Eden Care assisted living facility in Regina has tested positive for COVID-19.  There are no indications it has spread to other employees or residents.  The facility is closed to admissions, discharges and transfers, and residents who have been in close contact with the employee will be isolated and monitored twice daily for 14 days.  The facility, with support from the Saskatchewan Health Authority, is taking action, including visitor restrictions, to reduce the risk of the virus spreading.   Staff Assessments at Long-Term Care Facilities  Effective today, all employees working at long-term care facilities in Saskatchewan will have their temperatures checked and will be monitored for COVID-19 symptoms prior to beginning their shifts.  Regulatory Measures in Place to License Additional Professionals  Retired employees now have an easier and quicker way to help provide urgent patient care.  The Ministry of Health has been working with professional health bodies to put measures in place to provide temporary licenses for retired, non-practising and student members.  The Government of Saskatchewan is covering the fees for these professionals, which can cost several hundred dollars per member per year depending on the regulatory body.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Health Regina Phone: 306-787-4083 Email: media@health.gov.sk.ca "

The full report can be found at https://www.wsask.ca/Lakes-and-Rivers/Provincial-Forecast/.  There are currently no areas within the province where WSA is expecting above normal flows or flooding situations.  Additional precipitation and/or a rapid melt could however result in higher runoff.     Well above seasonal temperatures during March, combined with lower snowpack and moisture levels, resulted in spring runoff either beginning or being close to complete in much of southern Saskatchewan.  This includes all areas south of a line extending eastward from Macklin to Saskatoon and Saskatoon to Yorkton.  Near normal to above normal precipitation was observed through central areas of the province in March.  This has increased the runoff potential through these areas, increasing it from below normal to near normal.  An area encompassing west central Saskatchewan covering Meadow Lake, Lloydminster and Spiritwood is classified to have a normal runoff as is the extreme northwestern area of the province surrounding Uranium City.  The remainder of the province is expected to have a below normal runoff.  WSA has begun its normal spring operations of monitoring water basins and operating its dam systems to bring lake levels under its controls up to their normal operating levels.  For further information on runoff levels, water basins and a provincial runoff map, please see the full report.  WSA will continue to monitor conditions and will provide further communications if warranted.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Patrick Boyle Water Security Agency Moose Jaw Phone: 306-631-6997 Email: Patrick.Boyle@wsask.ca "

Small Group Gatherings  Under the current public health order, all private and public gatherings – inside and outside – are limited to a maximum of 10 people.  As a general rule, however, you should not have anyone visit your home at this time who does not live at your residence.  Instead, connect with friends and family safely via video, phone or social media as much as possible to maintain your social connections and mental health.  If it’s essential to have a small gathering of no more than 10 people, everyone at the gathering must be able to maintain the required two-metre distance between them.  Handing things back and forth is a common route of transmission in social settings.  Even when doing outdoor activities like riding a bike or going for a walk, do not hand items back and forth between people not from the same household.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Health Regina Phone: 306-787-4083 Email: media@health.gov.sk.ca "

HealthLine 811  The Government of Saskatchewan has acted on concerns regarding technical difficulties resulting from the high volume of calls received by HealthLine 811.  On March 17, the HealthLine 811 system was replaced resulting in an immediate improvement in service.  Originally capable of handling 32 concurrent callers, the 811 system replacement expanded capacity to handle over 900 concurrent callers, with an option for further expansion as needed, and added a convenient callback feature providing an unlimited number of callbacks.  More than 250 additional staff have been trained to receive calls on the expanded system, which has received almost 50,000 calls since the system replacement.  Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency Toll Free Line  The Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency’s (SPSA) toll free line, 1-855-559-5502, is now being offered 24 hours, 7 days a week.  The SPSA toll free line was established in order to answer non-health specific questions about the COVID-19 pandemic.  To ensure compliance with public health orders that are mandatory under the state of emergency, the SPSA toll free line is able to receive and coordinate alleged violations of the mandatory public health orders.  Non-compliance concerns can also be submitted online.  The form can be found under the Public Health Orders section at www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19.  SPSA operators will work with public health officials and policing agencies to follow up on compliance concerns to ensure compliance with public health orders.  Any non-health related questions regarding COVID-19, including concerns regarding compliance with public health orders, can be directed to the toll free line at 1-855-559-5502.  COVID-19 Health System Information  The www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19 website is an online source for all COVID-19 information in Saskatchewan.  Since being launched, the website has had more than 4 million visits.  The Saskatchewan Health Authority’s Self-Assessment Tool has been used more than 350,000 times in March.  This online resource, hosted at www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19, helps people determine whether they need a referral for COVID-19 testing.  The COVID-19 public inquiry email at COVID19@health.gov.sk.ca has responded to more than 4,200 email inquiries since it began operating on March 15.  Members of the public with email inquiries can expect a response within 24 hours from the dedicated response team.  To make residents aware of actions they can take to help mitigate the effects of the pandemic, a COVID-19 public health advertising campaign has been running online and in print throughout March, and will continue to run in April.  Public health advertising promotes messages of healthy infection control practices, and help educate people about practices such as social distancing and self-isolation.  Further advertising will occur in the coming weeks.  Business Response Team  The Business Response Team, led by the Ministry of Trade and Export Development, has worked with businesses to identify program supports available to them both provincially and federally, and to answer questions regarding allowable businesses.  Since its creation, the Business Response Team has assisted 1,613 clients over the phone and 690 clients via email for a total of 2,303.  Businesses can contact the Business Response Team by calling 1-844-800-8688, emailing supportforbusiness@gov.sk.ca or by visiting www.saskatchewan.ca/covid19-businesses.   Single Point of Contact for Donations and Supplies   Government has encouraged individuals, businesses, manufacturers and organizations that are offering to donate or manufacture supplies to contact procurement@gov.sk.ca.   Since its inception, more than 800 emails have been received from individuals, businesses, manufacturers and organizations offering supplies, solutions and innovations.  Staff are working to verify and contact all those who have submitted.  Through the generosity and resources of Saskatchewan individuals, businesses and manufacturers, 57 donations of personal protective equipment (PPE) including N95 masks and other equipment and an additional 85 purchase opportunities have been identified.  Government is also pursuing a number of opportunities to repurpose production, technologies and accommodations for health and safety needs that have been identified through the single point of contact.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Media Services Executive Council Regina Phone: 306-787-6281              "

The Government of Saskatchewan and health sector partners are working together to ensure that services are available, particularly to vulnerable populations and that they comply with public health requirements limiting close contact.  “Living through this uncertain and distressing time has caused some level of worry for us all,” Premier Scott Moe said.  “Just as people should be caring for their physical health during this pandemic, it’s important to pay attention to our mental health too.  Whether you’re coping with the loneliness of self-isolation, concerned about the health of your loved ones or worried about what the future may hold, there are mental health supports available to help you through this difficult time.”  All Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) mental health inpatient units for adults, children and youth remain open for admissions as needed.  Community mental health sites remain open, offering most services by phone.  However, they have maintained capacity to assist clients and patients in person if necessary.  Group-based services have been discontinued, but clients and patients are being contacted by phone.  The SHA continues efforts to reallocate resources to areas of critical need, such as mental health.  Regular intake phone lines are operating, including HealthLine 811 which has mental health services available providing 24/7 assistance or referral.  Family Service Saskatchewan, in partnership with the SHA, supports 23 mental health walk-in clinics that are now offering services by phone in communities across the province, in light of the need for social distancing.  Other mental health resources available to Saskatchewan residents include:  The Farm Stress Line (https://www.saskatchewan.ca/business/agriculture-natural-resources-and-industry/agribusiness-farmers-and-ranchers/programs-and-services/farm-stress-line) provides support for farmers and ranchers and is available 24 hours per day, seven days per week.  To get help, call 1-800-667-4442. Kids Help Phone (https://kidshelpphone.ca/) offers professional counselling, information and referrals by phone, text or online chat.  It's confidential, free and available 24/7. Mobile Crisis (http://www.mobilecrisis.ca/mobile-crisis-helpline/) centres are located across Saskatchewan and operate 24/7. Employee and Family Assistance Programs can assist with mental health supports and counselling for qualifying employees and their dependents.  Ministries across government are providing mental health resources and supports.  For example:  The Ministry of Education continues to offer Mental Health Capacity Building support for staff and students in five schools during school closures, through online and social media platforms. Ministry of Social Services staff are supporting clients, service providers and Approved Private Service Homes.  All CBO agencies continue to offer counselling by phone or virtual technology. Indigenous Services Canada Mental Health Therapists are available by phone or Telehealth to residents of First Nations communities.  Volunteers  People are encourage to provide assistance within their communities to friends, neighbours or family who may need assistance with things like picking up groceries or other needed supplies.  Premier Moe encouraged people to remember the difference between physical distancing and social distancing.  “To stay healthy mentally, we all need to connect with our friends and family – but safely, by phone or online as much as possible,” Moe said.  “That’s the best way we can protect ourselves and each other.”  To learn more about mental health supports and COVID-19 in general, visit www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19.

422,2020-03-31,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/march/31/social-services-pandemic-response,Government Website,Province Announces Social Services Pandemic Response," Released on March 31, 2020 Today, the Government of Saskatchewan announced the Ministry of Social Services Pandemic Response.  The response will support vulnerable Saskatchewan citizens and the organizations that serve them by leveraging existing resources within the system, adapting policies and allocating new resources.  “Our government is committed to providing supports to vulnerable citizens in Saskatchewan through this time of uncertainty,” Social Services Minister Paul Merriman said.  “The Social Services Pandemic Response provides additional funding to emergency shelters across the province while leveraging existing resources, including vacant social housing units, to ensure each client has the support they require.”  The Social Services Pandemic Response includes measures to provide additional funding to emergency shelters, modifies service delivery models to accommodate capacity pressures due to physical distancing and the need for clients to self-isolate.  The response also includes measures to ease the burden on existing clients as they work with the Ministry of Social Services.  Pandemic Emergency Shelter Support  Government is announcing one-time additional funding of $171,000 targeted at meeting extra cost pressure emergency shelters are experiencing as they continue to serve those in need during the COVID-19 pandemic.  This brings funding for emergency shelters to a total of $3.93 million.  Organizations receiving the increase are: Lloydminster Men’s Shelter; YWCA Regina - My Aunt’s Place; YWCA Prince Albert; YWCA Saskatoon; Lighthouse Saskatoon; Lighthouse North Battleford; Salvation Army Saskatoon; Salvation Army Regina; Soul’s Harbour Regina and Soul’s Harbour Moose Jaw.  These organizations currently provide more than 300 beds for individuals who need emergency shelter and supports.  Modified Service Delivery Model  The Emergency Shelter Response also includes a modified delivery model adapting the Cold Weather Strategy to respond to pressures created by COVID-19.  When emergency shelters are unable to meet the needs of an individual or family because of capacity pressures, Social Services will support those in need with funds for emergency hotel stays and will work to transition clients to permanent housing.  If a client is required by Public Health to self-isolate due to COVID-19 symptoms or exposure, that person will be transitioned to a safe accommodation such as a hotel or an individual housing unit.  There are approximately 1,700 vacant Saskatchewan Housing Corporation units located in 29 larger communities that will be leveraged to ensure those impacted by COVID-19 are able to access housing or an individualized space to self isolate.  An additional 1,200 units are available in smaller communities across Saskatchewan.  Social Services will continue to work with Saskatchewan’s network of emergency shelter providers to ensure those who are homeless and lack the means to pay for their basic needs are served.  After hours, referrals for emergency hotel stays are also made on behalf of the ministry by Mobile Crisis Services and the Salvation Army.  Individuals who have, or are suspected of having, COVID-19 and lack money to meet their basic needs should apply for any Federal Benefits they would be eligible for.  Those needing immediate emergency help, such as food or shelter, can contact the local service centre, their worker or the Client Service Centre at 1-866-221-5200.  Support for Children, Youth and Families  Social Services is acting on the request from the Saskatchewan Youth in Care and Custody Network to delay transitions to independence for young people.  This mean that any youth that “ages out of care” during the COVID-19 pandemic will not be transitioned out of their current housing.  Case workers are contacting impacted youth and their caregivers to ensure that supports and services continue.  To help families receiving the Child Care Subsidy (CCS), any families who were receiving part-time benefits because their children were attending school will receive full-time benefits, retroactive to March 1, 2020.  The CCS helps parents with low to moderate incomes with the costs of licensed child care.  New Saskatchewan Housing Benefit  The Saskatchewan Housing Corporation will begin accepting applications for the new Saskatchewan Housing Benefit (SHB) on April 1, 2020.  The SHB is a federal-provincial program delivered through the National Housing Strategy.  It aligns with the strategy’s principles of people, communities, and partnerships.  It also aligns with the province’s focus on helping people in greatest housing need.  SHB is a monthly benefit available to eligible households, including seniors, families, couples and singles.  It will be available to Saskatchewan renters who:  rent from a community housing provider, such as a non-profit housing provider or co-operative; pay more than 50 per cent of household income on rent and utilities; have incomes and assets below the program limits; and are not receiving another government benefit to help with their housing/shelter costs.  Clients will receive a benefit based on their household composition:  Eligible households that require one bedroom, such as single individuals or couples, will receive $150 per month. Households that require two bedrooms will receive $200 per month. Households that require three or more bedrooms will receive $250 per month.  Application forms and additional information will be available on the Saskatchewan Housing Corporation website or by calling toll-free 1-844-787-4177.  Other actions under the Social Services Pandemic Response include the following actions that are being taken to ease the burden on existing clients during the COVID-19 pandemic:  Child and Family Programs (CFP)  Frontline child protection workers will have access to Personal Protective Equipment, safe work guidelines and training to protect themselves and the children and families they work with.  Whenever possible, child and family services and supports will be provided using alternate methods that avoid direct contact.  Staff who may need to enter homes to carry out their mandated work related to child safety have been provided with a series of screening questions to determine potential risk. Income Assistance (IA)  All IA clients continue to receive their benefits.  Effective March 19, 2020, the ministry lessened reporting requirements across all of its programs.  If a client is late reporting, IA will still process their payment.  Social Services Physical Distancing and Eased Reporting Measures  Social Services offices remain open.  The first hour of the day is reserved for more vulnerable individuals, including those with a disability or health problem such as a compromised immune system.  To minimize in-person contact for the safety and well-being of clients and staff, clients are asked not come into the offices unless it is an emergency and they are unable to call their worker, or they are asked to come in.  People who would like to apply for assistance can do so online at www.saskatchewan.ca/income-support or call the Client Service Centre at 1-866-221-5200.  More staff have been shifted to the Call Centre to help serve those in need.  To ease the administrative burden on third party service providers and community-based organizations, Social Services will temporarily suspend financial reporting requirements.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Trish Alcorn Social Services Regina Phone: 306-787-0916 Email: trish.alcorn@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-536-1479 "

Need to Remain Vigilant  Today’s number of new cases may be the lowest in a week, but it’s important not to get complacent with precautions for COVID-19.  It’s as important as ever to stay home whenever possible, and to avoid close contact (a minimum of two metres) with others to prevent spreading the virus.  People who have been diagnosed with COVID-19, travellers returning from international destinations, including the United States, and those who have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 are required to self isolate under the current public health order.  There are reports of people across the province disregarding these directives, which will only increase the amount of time it takes to flatten the curve.  Do your part to help protect yourself, your neighbours and your community.  How to Protect Yourself and Others   Practice proper cough and sneezing etiquette (into the bend of your elbow); Wash your hands often with soap and water; If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer; Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands; Maintain safe food practices; Avoid close contact with people who are sick; Avoid unnecessary travel – inside and outside your community; Gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited and you must practice social distancing; and If you experience any symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough or breathing issues) use the self-assessment tool at www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19 to determine if you should contact HealthLine 811.

Government Redeploying Staff to Focus on Priorities  The Government of Saskatchewan is taking steps to identify key skill sets in all ministries in an effort to deploy additional staff to critical function areas.  Supplemental resources are required to handle contact tracing needs, staff call centres and public inquiries.  The province will continue to allocate as many resources as possible to address the COVID-19 challenge.  The Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) already has up to 150 people involved in contact tracing.  Over the coming days, 50 additional staff from across government will be moved into this key role.  The need for additional resources will be assessed as the situation evolves.  Multiple Testing Sites Open Across the Province  As of March 30, there are more than 40 communities in Saskatchewan where COVID-19 testing is available.  Testing locations will continue to be expanded as demand warrants.  The current list of communities where testing is available can be found on www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19 under Testing Information.  Testing is by referrals only.

""Canada is fortunate to have such dedicated, hard-working farmers who put high quality food on our tables daily,” said Bibeau.  ""By offering Saskatchewan producers this extension, we are giving them the flexibility they need to get their job done in challenging times like these.”  “It is critical for our government to continue to support Saskatchewan agriculture,” Marit said.  “We understand the challenges producers faced over the last year including evolving situations like the COVID-19 pandemic that continue to add to these uncertainties.”  Producers interested in Crop Insurance coverage for the 2020 year now have an additional two weeks to finalize their contracts.  Extending the Crop Insurance deadline gives producers more time to prepare and make decisions regarding all aspects of their business, including risk management.  Despite new guidelines concerning service delivery, Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation (SCIC) continues to support Saskatchewan producers as we approach the 2020 growing season.  Knowledgeable staff are available to assist producers by phone at 1-888-935-0000 or email at customer.service@scic.ca.  Current customers can also use SCIC’s online application, CropConnect, available at www.scic.ca/cropconnect, to enter insurance selections, add or delete crops, change program options and choose coverage levels.  Crop Insurance is a Business Risk Management program supported through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership, a five-year, $3 billion commitment by Canada’s federal, provincial and territorial governments that supports Canada’s agri-food and agri-products sectors.  Under Crop Insurance, premiums for most programs are shared 40 per cent by participating producers, 36 per cent by the Government of Canada and 24 per cent by the Government of Saskatchewan.  Administrative expenses are fully funded by governments, 60 per cent by Canada and 40 per cent by Saskatchewan.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Denise Dobko Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation Melville Phone: (639) 398-2259 Email: denise.dobko@scic.ca  Media Relations Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Ottawa Phone: 613-773-7972              "

The exemption applies to the transportation of goods and supplies to meet immediate needs related to COVID-19:  medical supplies and equipment related to testing, diagnosis and treatment; supplies and equipment necessary for community safety and sanitation, such as masks, gloves, hand sanitizer, soap and disinfectants; food, paper products and other groceries for emergency restocking of distribution centres or stores; raw materials, such as paper, plastic or alcohol, required for the manufacture of medical supplies, sanitation items and safe distribution of groceries; fuel; equipment, supplies and people to establish and manage temporary housing, quarantine and isolation facilities; people designated by Federal, Provincial/Territorial or local authorities for medical, isolation, or quarantine purposes; and people needed to provide other medical or emergency services.  Under the exemption period, it is still recommended carriers track their driver’s operation.  Drivers are encouraged to monitor their own ability and level of alertness to prevent driving while impaired by fatigue.  Once a driver determines their ability to operate safely has been reduced, they must take the appropriate measures to get adequate rest.  It is recommended drivers take a break of 24 hours after 14 continuous days of work.  At the conclusion of the emergency period and prior to returning to normal operations, the driver is required to take eight consecutive hours off duty before driving.  As truck drivers are essential to the movement of goods they are exempt from the 14-day isolation period after returning to Saskatchewan.  However, drivers are asked to:  practice proactive hygiene including handwashing; adhere to social distancing (maintain a distance of two metres from others); closely self-monitor; and self-isolate should they exhibit any symptoms.  -30-  For more information, contact:  David Horth Highways and Infrastructure Regina Phone: 306-787-4804 Email: david.horth@gov.sk.ca "

The ads state that traders can keep a large percentage of the profits, and they don’t need experience or a licence; however, the firms demand payment of fees from would-be traders.  In Saskatchewan anyone in the business of trading securities must be registered with FCAA, unless an exemption applies.  The FCAA expects that similar scams will continue to increase during the COVID-19 crisis.  Anyone who has information about these schemes is urged to contact the FCAA Securities Division at 306-787-5936.  The FCAA is also warning investors about companies claiming to have products or services that will prevent, detect or cure COVID-19.  At this time, there is no vaccine or natural health product that is authorized to treat or protect against COVID-19.  Be cautious of any claims that a company has a solution to help stop the pandemic.  Reliable information about COVID-19 is available from the World Health Organization and the Government of Canada.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Stephanie Wilkinson Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority Regina Phone: 306-787-5576 Email: stephanie.wilkinson@gov.sk.ca "

To date, 18 additional cases have been linked to this event.  Each person is self-isolating at home.  The outcome of this event demonstrates the importance of physical distancing at this time.  Everyone who attended this event – or any large gathering over the past several weeks – should be self-monitoring or self-isolating if directed by local public health authorities.  If you are experiencing any symptoms (fever, cough, sneezing, breathing issues, etc.), please use the online self-assessment tool at www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19 and call 811.  Virtual Assessments Having an Impact  More than 25,000 telephone assessments were conducted by Saskatchewan physicians in the first 10 days the option was made available to the public.  The new practice – introduced March 13 – allows physicians to safely provide advice from a remote location, supports government’s direction for physical distancing and augments the province’s 811 HealthLine service and online assessment tool.  Testing and Contact Tracing Plan  With now more than 8,000 COVID-19 tests conducted by the Roy Romanow Provincial Laboratory (RRPL), Saskatchewan ranks number three in the country for travel and non travel-related testing.  RRPL will continue to be the province’s source for reliable testing information.  In addition to ongoing testing, the Ministry of Health will deploy additional staff to the Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) to assist with contact tracing.  This initiative is aimed at critical identification to better ensure cases are detected and followed up on in a timely manner, and to help prevent further transmission of COVID-19.

At this time, we can confirm that two staff at Saskatoon Correctional Centre have been identified as having COVID-19 through testing.  These staff have been directed by public health authorities to self-isolate at home, and Corrections is working with public health authorities to determine who these individuals might have come into contact with within the correctional facility and what measures need to be taken as a result.  Staff who believe they are exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 are asked to contact a health care provider and to notify their supervisor of their concerns.  We are working with health authorities to ensure corrections workers, like other essential service providers, receive priority testing for COVID-19.  Corrections will work with public health authorities to determine next steps if it is confirmed that a staff member has COVID-19.  Currently, no offenders in provincial correctional facilities have been confirmed as having COVID-19.  There is currently one unit at the Saskatoon Correctional Centre on quarantine as a precautionary measure for what is believed to be a non-COVID-19 illness.  The ministry is exploring how to more effectively manage the sentenced offender population in our provincial correctional facilities in light of the COVID-19 outbreak, and is using existing infrastructure and program space within correctional facilities to create additional separation between offenders and staff.  Nurses watch for symptoms of illness in the offender population and if symptoms are identified, they ensure prompt assessment, testing, documenting and reporting of offenders suspected or confirmed to have a communicable disease.  When there is a suspected illness among the offender population in a custody facility, the facility director ensures that disease specific precautions are put in place, including the use of medical cells or other isolated areas.  Personal protective equipment is being provided to corrections staff and offenders based on criteria established by the World Health Organization and public health authorities.  Other measures being taken include:  restricting the movement and placement of offenders within the facility; suspending or limiting programming to smaller groups of offenders to ensure adequate social distancing; increased communication to staff and offenders about proper hygiene and contagious disease precautions; enhancing cleaning protocols in all facilities for common areas and equipment; and thorough and regular handwashing with soap and water by facility staff.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Noel Busse Corrections and Policing Regina Phone: 306-787-8959 Email: noel.busse@gov.sk.ca "

Starting today, the Office of Residential Tenancies (ORT) will not be accepting applications for eviction related to missed or late rent, or for other non-urgent claims.  Previous eviction orders for non-urgent matters (i.e. – not related to health and safety concerns) will not be enforced, and previously scheduled hearings for non-urgent matters have been cancelled as of today.  The ORT will only be conducting eviction hearings for urgent situations where there is a potential risk to health or safety resulting from violence or damage to property.  Hearings may also take place for situations where a tenant has been locked out by their landlord or where a landlord has been accused of not providing essential services such as power and water.  “Under the circumstances, we want to ensure that tenants facing hardship as a result of COVID-19 can remain in their homes and follow all orders and recommendations from the Chief Medical Health Officer,” Justice Minister and Attorney General Don Morgan said.  “An essential part of flattening the curve is staying home and self-isolating.  We want to provide piece of mind that those taking the necessary precautions as a result of this unprecedented situation will still have a roof over their head.”  Tenants who are unable to pay their rent during the state of emergency will be expected to pay their rent in full once the state of emergency is over.  This action is being taken in recognition of the fact that our province is currently in an unprecedented state of emergency that may result in unforeseen financial hardship or health consequences for tenants.  Government is specifically concerned that evicted tenants will be unable to self-isolate or physically distance themselves from others, potentially increasing the risk of transmitting or contracting COVID-19.  The ORT continues to encourage landlords and tenants to communicate with each other about their individual situations so that they can come to mutually agreeable solutions in this challenging time.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Noel Busse Justice and Attorney General Regina Phone: 306-787-8959 Email: noel.busse@gov.sk.ca "

The lab is one of the most advanced infectious disease research facilities in the world and has been evaluating COVID-19 vaccine models for several weeks.  “Saskatchewan is leading the global effort to find a vaccine and we are providing our researchers with additional support to continue and to share their life-saving work with Canadians and people around the world,” Minister Responsible for Innovation Saskatchewan Tina Beaudry-Mellor said.  VIDO-InterVac scientists were the first in Canada to isolate the virus that causes COVID-19, in collaboration with the Public Health Agency of Canada and a research facility in Toronto.  They expect to know in mid-April whether their vaccine works in an animal model.  Clinical testing can start once VIDO-InterVac provides enough preliminary data for Health Canada to determine the candidate vaccine is safe in humans.  “The Government of Canada is committed to protecting the health and safety of Canadians,” said Navdeep Bains, Federal Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry.  “We are all in this together: Canada is benefiting from the impressive and innovative power of our researchers at Saskatoon’s VIDO-InterVac in our national approach to fight COVID-19.   Together, we are rapidly scaling-up our capacity in research and in manufacturing to combat this pandemic.”  Since the outbreak of the coronavirus in January, the Government of Saskatchewan has provided researchers in Saskatoon with a total of $4.2 million.  VIDO-InterVac also received $1 million through the federal rapid research funding initiative for COVID-19 research projects, in addition to the $23 million in federal funding announced on March 23 for the centre’s manufacturing facility to produce COVID-19 vaccines for clinical trials, and overall operational costs.  “This funding helps fast track vaccine development for emerging infections including COVID-19,” VIDO-InterVac Director and Chief Executive Officer Dr. Volker Gerdts said.  “We very much appreciate the Government of Saskatchewan and the Federal Government’s continued support of our research and development efforts in these challenging times.”  -30-  For more information, contact:  Glen Kirby Innovation Saskatchewan Regina Phone: 306-787-6041 Email: glen.kirby@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-537-6455  Véronique Simard Office of the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry Phone: 343-291-1710 Email: veronique.simard2@canada.ca   Media Relations Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada Phone: 343-291-1777 Email: ic.mediarelations-mediasrelations.ic@canada.ca "

SHA leadership is activating plans to create additional capacity through:  Creation of dedicated spaces to cohort COVID-19 patients within facilities. Creation of COVID-19 designated hospitals in Saskatoon and Regina and other areas of the province, where required. Creation of additional community based acute care capacity where required (e.g. field hospitals in school gyms, community centres, rinks, etc.).  “This plan will ensure we are prepared,” Livingstone said.  “But it won’t be enough; it has been proven over and over with this virus that no health system in the world can address this challenge alone without the sustained help of the general public.”  Actions that people and communities must take to address this challenge include:  Practicing good hygiene, washing hands regularly and practicing social distancing (two meters apart wherever possible); Abide by provincial and local travel, self-isolation, event and gathering restrictions; Use medical supplies effectively and efficiently so that they are there when needed; Avoid visiting our hospitals and long-term care facilities unless there are compassionate reasons for doing so.   A provincial Emergency Operations Centre has been established, as well as Integrated Health Incident Command Centres (IHICCs) for each of the SHA service areas (Saskatoon, Regina, Rural and North).  It is these local IHICC’s that will be accountable for finalizing and deploying the continuity of services and surge capacity plans on a local level.  Changes to services and service locations are already occurring and will be ongoing as we adapt to the increased capacity it will take for the health system to effectively manage the weeks and months ahead.  Communities will be updated as changes occur in their areas.  “We strongly urge every resident in Saskatchewan to abide by the restrictions, guidelines and orders enacted by the Government of Saskatchewan, and help our province slow the rate of transmission of this virus,” SHA Chief Medical Officer Dr. Susan Shaw said.  “The success of preventive measures will have a direct impact on health system demand for hospital care.  The actions of the public will help save lives and ensure our health system is there for when you need it, regardless of the circumstance.”  -30-  For more information, contact:  Lisa Thomson Saskatchewan Health Authority  Saskatoon Phone: 306-766-5332  Email: lisa.thomson@saskhealthauthority.ca Cell: 306-539-4617 "

On Friday, the City of Regina issued an emergency order that contained restrictions differing from those that have been imposed by the Government of Saskatchewan and the Chief Medical Health Officer of Saskatchewan.  Government Relations Minister Lori Carr has spoken to Regina Mayor Michael Fougere and clarified that it is the provincial orders that take precedence.  “I fully understand that Mayor Fougere and Regina City Council intended to set guidelines for residents of Regina to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” Carr said.  “However, during this time of great uncertainty, it is of the utmost importance that we provide certainty to Saskatchewan residents and make every effort to minimize confusion.  I have communicated to Regina Mayor Michael Fougere that the provincial emergency orders have been made based on the advice of Saskatchewan’s Chief Medical Health Officer.”  Carr has also spoken with the Saskatchewan Urban Municipalities Association (SUMA) and the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities (SARM) to ensure all municipalities are aware that provincial restrictions and standards apply to all municipalities and consistent standards are required.  If a municipality implements an order which provides contrary standards, the province will take measures to ensure that the provincial emergency measure takes precedence.  Minister Carr, SUMA and SARM have also established a formal communications mechanism to ensure all Saskatchewan municipalities remain updated with the latest restrictions and standards.  The following previously announced are effective throughout Saskatchewan:  Public gatherings of more than 25 people in one room are prohibited except where two metre distancing between people can be maintained; workplace and meeting settings where people are distributed into multiple rooms or buildings; and retail locations (ie. grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations).

Moe said he was particularly concerned that some individuals returning from international travel were not following the 14 day self-isolation policy.  “I know that the vast majority of Saskatchewan people are taking their personal responsibility seriously and following this order,” Moe said.  “But a few are not.  This is not a suggestion.  It is not a guideline.  It is the law and it must be followed.”  In consultation with the Minister of Health, the following measures are effective immediately:  Public gatherings of more than 25 people in one room are prohibited except where two metre distancing between people can be maintained; workplace and meeting settings where people are distributed into multiple rooms or buildings; and retail locations (ie. grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations).

Mandatory Self-Isolation   Effective immediately, all persons that have travelled internationally shall go into mandatory self-isolation for 14 days from date of arrival back into Canada. Health Care workers who have traveled internationally, truckers, rail, airline or other working crews are exempt from this advisory only if they are required to work to maintain essential services, provide emergency health care services and maintain supply chain, and are supervised by Infection, Prevention Control Officers and/or Occupational Health and Safety in the workplace. All persons who have been identified by a Medical Health Officer as a close contact of a person or persons with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shall go into mandatory self-isolation for 14 days from the date of last having been exposed to COVID-19. All persons who have become symptomatic while on mandatory self-isolation shall call HealthLine 811 and follow HealthLine’s directives.

448,2020-03-20,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/march/20/covid-19-financial-support,Government Website,Premier Announces Financial Support Plan For Saskatchewan Employers And Employees," Released on March 20, 2020 Today, Premier Scott Moe announced a significant financial support plan for Saskatchewan employers and employees hit by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.  “During this time of great uncertainty, it is of the utmost importance that Saskatchewan people know their government is here to provide support,” Moe said.  “This plan supports businesses and employees. Most importantly, it supports the opportunity to come back to work when we emerge from the COVID-19 crisis.”  The financial support plan outlines a number of mechanisms for reducing costs for businesses and individuals, providing support to self-employed individuals not covered by new federal support measures, and establishes a Business Response Team designated to support Saskatchewan businesses during this time of uncertainty.  Self-Isolation Support Program  Administered by the Ministry of Finance, the Self-Isolation Support Program will provide $450 per week, for a maximum of two weeks or $900.  The Self-Isolation Support Program is targeted at Saskatchewan residents forced to self-isolate that are not covered by recent federally announced employment insurance programs and other supports.  The program is designed to ensure that all Saskatchewan residents are covered by either a federal or provincial program to ensure no one is faced with choosing to work instead of protecting their family and community from COVID-19 by self-isolating.  The program is anticipated to cost a total of $10 million and will mostly benefit self-employed residents of Saskatchewan that meet the following eligibility criteria:  They have contracted COVID-19 or are showing symptoms; They have been in contact with an individual infected with COVID-19; They have recently returned from international travel and have been required to self-isolate;  AND  If they are not eligible for compensation including sick leave, vacation leave from their employer If they do not have private insurance covering such disruptions If they are not covered by other programs such as federal employment insurance that has been updated.  Three Month PST Remittance Deferral and Audit Suspension  Effective immediately, Saskatchewan businesses who are unable to remit their PST due to cashflow concerns will have relief from penalty and interest charges.  Over the course of three-months; government estimates a potential deferral of up to $750 million in PST collections.  Businesses that are unable to file their provincial tax return(s) by the due date may submit a request for relief from penalty and interest charges on the return(s) affected.  At this time, audit program and compliance activities have been suspended to allow businesses time to focus on the health and safety of their customers and staff, reduce impacts to their business operations, and minimize the spread of the virus through reduced audit travel.  Crown Utility Interest Deferral Programs  Earlier this week, government announced a crown utility interest deferral program waving interest on late bill payments for up to six months.  Effective immediately, the crown utility interest deferral program is available to all crown utility customers.  Student Loan Repayment Moratorium  Effective immediately, a six-month student loan repayment moratorium has been put in place, mirroring a similar federal provision.  This provides individuals with student loans immediate relief, and comes at a $4 million cost to the provincial government.  Changes to Employment Standard Regulations  In addition to changes made to changes to The Saskatchewan Employment Act that introduced a new unpaid public health emergency leave and removed the 13-week employment requirement to access sick leave and the requirement for a doctor’s note to access sick leave, The Employment Standard Regulations have been amended to:  Ensure that during a public emergency, businesses will not have to provide notice or pay in lieu of notice when they lay-off staff if it is for a period of 12 weeks or less in a 16-week period. And if an employer lays off employees periodically for a total of more than 12 weeks in a 16-week period, the employees are considered to be terminated and are entitled to pay instead of notice as outlined in the Act.  This will be calculated from the date on which the employee was laid off.  These amendments create a balance for employers and employees where the difficult decision may be made to lay-off employees due to public health emergencies.  In this circumstance, employees would have immediate access to new federal employment insurance programs, while keeping employers financially stable to ensure employees have a job to return to.  Business Response Team to be Established  To provide support to Saskatchewan businesses seeking to navigate the uncertain conditions caused by COVID-19, the Government of Saskatchewan will be establishing a single window information webpage for businesses to access information and receive timely updates on provincial support initiatives.  This will be complemented by the establishment of a Business Response Team, led by the Ministry of Trade and Export Development, which will work with businesses to identify program supports relevant to particular businesses. Once the Business Response Team has been established, contact information will be communicated to the public, and to local chambers of commerce for dissemination to chamber membership.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Media Services Executive Council Regina Phone: 306-787-6281 "

The child care centres in schools have been closed to existing clients as of March 20.  Parents in those centres are receiving communication directly from their child care providers about this change.  “We thank the child care providers in schools for working with us during this extraordinary time to provide this essential service for our health care and other pandemic response service employees,” Deputy Premier and Education Minister Gordon Wyant said.  “We know the impact this change has on families but during these times we are looking for everyone to contribute to the support for the broad community response to the COVID-19 virus.”  Priority for these spaces will be given to staff in health care and other pandemic response workers for infant, toddler, preschool or school age children, that require care as those individuals continue to provide support in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The list of eligible people for the emergency and pandemic response child care spaces includes:  Employees directly related to providing essential services in health care including employees working in hospitals, long-term care facilities, community and primary health, home care, personal care homes, labs, pharmacies, COVID-19 assessment and testing sites, scheduling departments, and payroll departments including nurses, physicians and physician clinic staff, emergency medical services staff, and other staff essential to the operations of these facilities/departments. Employees working directly in child protection, income assistance, and community living connected to the Ministry of Social Services Employees working directly in residential services connected to the Ministry of Social Services Child care centre employees of licensed child care facilities Employees directly related to providing essential services in SaskPower, SaskEnergy, SaskTel, water and wastewater management Employees directly related to providing essential services for police and fire.  Note: This is subject to change.  Employers are being notified today to provide information to those workers related to the pandemic.  An application and information about the process for those who are delivering services related to the pandemic response is available on www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19.   Child care centres not located in schools are able to continue to operate as normal, and government funding will continue to be provided.  Any changes regarding closures will be based on the advice of the Chief Medical Health Officer of Saskatchewan.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Rose Semchuk Education Regina Phone: 306-787-5609 Email: rosann.semchuk@gov.sk.ca "
450,2020-03-19,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/march/19/covid-19-update-march-19,Government Website,Case Surveillance Information at Saskatchewan.ca/COVID19 ," Released on March 19, 2020 As of March 19, 2020, Saskatchewan has four new, presumptive positive cases for COVID-19. The provincial total for cases is now 20: 12 are presumptive positive and eight are now confirmed, following verification from the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg. Surveillance information on COVID-19 cases and testing is available at www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19. Public health officials are completing contact investigations on all cases now. Three of the four presumptive positive cases are related to travel and one is a close contact of a previously reported case.  Nineteen of the twenty cases are well enough to self-isolate at home at present; one presumptive positive case is in hospital for medical reasons not related to COVID-19. On March 18, the Government of Saskatchewan implemented a number of measures to support social distancing and prevent the transmission of COVID-19. These include:  Prohibiting public gatherings larger than 50 people are prohibited; Closing all gyms, fitness centres, casinos and bingo halls; and Limiting all restaurants, bars and event venues seating to 50 per cent of capacity or up to a maximum of fifty people, whichever is lesser and must be able to ensure social distance of one to two metres between customers. Retail spaces including grocery stores, pharmacies and gas stations are exempt from this policy but must have processes to maintain a one to two metre separation between customers.  The Government of Saskatchewan has introduced amendments to The Saskatchewan Employment Act to remove the provision requiring a doctor’s note or certificate in order to access leave. Requesting written verification from physicians or HealthLine 811 is unnecessary and prevents these resources from being properly utilized at this time. All workplaces and organizations should be implementing their business continuity plans or assessing the risk of exposure and transmission for their staff and clients and make operational decisions accordingly. Self-Isolation Self-isolation is required for 14 days after returning from travel outside Canada; for individuals who have been in close contact with a person with COVID-19; and for individuals who are diagnosed with COVID-19 and well enough to stay at home. Self-isolation means staying home and avoiding situations where there is a potential to spread respiratory illness to others: work, school, sporting events, social, cultural and religious gatherings and public places such as restaurants and malls. Avoid public transportation. If a member of your household is self-isolating, they should make every effort to stay apart from the other members of that household. This includes separate sleeping areas and bathrooms, if possible. Maintain social distancing (one to two metres) with members of your household. Do not share utensils, bedding, electronic devices, etc. and clean high-touch-shared surfaces frequently. If you are sharing living space with someone who is self-isolating, you are required to self-monitor. This means actively monitoring for symptoms including taking your temperature twice daily. Be prepared to self-isolate immediately yourself if you develop a fever or cough. Should I be tested?

451,2020-03-18,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/march/18/budget-2020,Government Website,2020-21 Estimates Provide Key Investments," Released on March 18, 2020                  Finance Minister Donna Harpauer today tabled the 2020-21 Estimates, the government’s spending plans for the coming year.  The 2020-21 Estimates represent $14.15 billion of government expense through ministries and agencies, an increase of 3.1 per cent from 2019-20, which include important investments and spending increases in health care, education, social services and infrastructure.  The government is taking the unusual step of tabling the spending estimates without revenue forecasts for the coming year because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  “This is an unprecedented and challenging time in our province, our country and the world,” Harpauer said.  “We are all feeling the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and our government’s first priority is the safety and health of Saskatchewan people.  That is precisely why we need to proceed with these expenditures now, providing stability and much needed new spending at the start of the fiscal year.  It is particularly important our health care funding flows and our infrastructure investment is in place to help our economy.  “We have a very strong cash position of $1.3 billion, so we are well positioned to manage through this challenging time, and are able to provide additional resources to address the health and economic challenges of COVID-19 as required.”  Capital investment of $2.7 billion by Crown corporations and Executive Government will serve as an important economic stimulus during this challenging time.  The Ministry of Health’s expense is $5.77 billion, a record investment and an increase of more than $211 million, or 3.8 per cent, from one year ago.  The government will provide the Saskatchewan Health Authority with a $3.74 billion grant this year, an increase of $140.6 million, or 3.9 per cent over last year.  This funds the doctors, nurses and other health care professionals who today are on the front lines in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic, while meeting the health needs of Saskatchewan residents.  Health funding includes $434.5 million for mental health and addictions supports and services, including a targeted increase of $12 million compared to last year, with nearly $5.8 million to support addictions initiatives and a further $6.2 million to fund enhanced mental health services.  This spending will establish specialized crystal meth inpatient treatment services in Estevan, increase access to mental health and addictions treatment beds and supports and provide for intensive supports for children and youth.  The 2020-21 Estimates also provide an additional $20 million to address surgical wait times and pay for about 3,700 additional surgeries, helping thousands of Saskatchewan patients receive their procedures sooner.  The Saskatchewan Cancer Agency receives a further $18.4 million this year, up more than 10 per cent compared to last year, bringing their annual grant to a record $196.4 million.  The 2020-21 Estimates include nearly $8.0 million in new funding for 36 acute care beds at Royal University Hospital in Saskatoon and $2.3 million for 100 new community-based long-term care beds in Regina and Emerald Park.  The Ministry of Education’s 2020-21 expense is $2.57 billion, an increase of $86 million, or 3.5 per cent from 2019-20.  Saskatchewan’s 27 school divisions will receive $1.94 billion in operating funding for the 2020-21 school year—a $42 million increase over last year to address enrolment growth, inflation and collective bargaining.  The Ministry of Social Services’ expense is $1.29 billion in 2020-21, up $50.6 million or 4.1 per cent from 2019-20.  Increased funding of $10.9 million to third-party service providers includes a $6.8 million increase for those who work with people with intellectual disabilities.  Service providers supporting at-risk children, youth and families receive a $2.5 million increase.  The 2020-21 Estimates continues investments in programs and initiatives to ensure Saskatchewan is the best place in Canada to live for people with disabilities.  This includes $613 million, an increase of $27.4 million, from ministries across government for enhanced programming and support for people with disabilities.  This year’s Estimates also provide an increase of $2.5 million for family supports and an increase of more than $2.1 million for new group homes in Regina and Saskatoon for youth with complex needs.  Also part of this year’s expenses, $3.4 million is provided to launch the new Saskatchewan Housing Benefit.  The benefit will help make housing more affordable for individuals or families who require rental support.  There is $739 million, an increase of $11.2 million in these Estimates, for the Ministry of Advanced Education for post-secondary institutions and to strengthen supports for students and graduates, including maintaining the Graduate Retention Program—the most aggressive youth retention program in Canada.  The 2020-21 Estimates also include significant support for research and innovation, including a $400,000 increase in funding to the Vaccine and Infectious Diseases Organization (VIDO) to support construction of a new vaccine manufacturing facility.  A VIDO research team is currently working with colleagues across Canada to develop and fast-track the testing of a coronavirus vaccine.  The 2020-21 Estimates provide a record $278 million in Municipal Revenue Sharing through the Ministry of Government Relations.  Revenue sharing is up nearly $27 million from last year, or 11 per cent, and up almost 119 per cent since 2007-08.  This year’s Estimates include more than $213 million in targeted investment to help meet the priorities of Indigenous communities, businesses and organizations—up $6.1 million, or nearly 3.0 per cent, from last year.  The 2020-21 Estimates include more than $85 million for the Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency, which supports the province’s people, municipalities and service providers, and is positioned to address any emergency that may arise.  There is a $1.7 million increase in expense for the Gang Violence Reduction Strategy to help address gun and gang activity in the province.  Also, an increase of $14 million will help fund the operations of community-service organizations that provide vital contributions—strengthening families and assisting those who are most vulnerable.  To help build a stronger province, our government will provide a PST rebate for new home construction, of up to 42 per cent of the PST paid on a new house contract up to $350,000, excluding the land, for new homes purchased after March 31, 2020, and before April 1, 2023.  This not only helps the construction industry, Saskatchewan’s homebuilders and associated trades that are important job creators, it helps families afford a newly built home.  Also, our government will introduce the Oil Infrastructure Investment Program, a SaskFirst new growth tax incentive administered by the Ministry of Energy and Resources to support new and expanded pipelines, as well as new pipeline terminals, to flow oil to markets.  The government is also committed to investing in capital.  In 2020-21 seven new school projects and three major renovation projects are part of $130.4 million in education capital funding—up nearly $35 million, or more than 36 per cent, compared to last year.  This year’s projects include a new joint-use elementary school in Harbour Landing in Regina, as well as a joint-use consolidation of St. Peter, St. Michael and Imperial elementary schools in Regina.  Other new school projects include St. Frances Elementary School in Saskatoon, the consolidation of Princess Alexandra, King George and Pleasant Hill elementary schools in Saskatoon, and a new consolidated elementary and high school in Carrot River.  In 2020-21 nearly $142 million in health care capital spending includes $15 million this year to support the planning, design and procurement activities for the more than $300 million project for a renewed and expanded Prince Albert Victoria Hospital.  Also a $15.7 million investment will continue construction of a new, 72-bed, long-term seniors care facility in Meadow Lake.  There is also $4.0 million for diagnostic imaging equipment, including $2.0 million to fulfil government’s commitment for a new CT scanner in Melfort.  The 2020-21 Estimates include nearly $648 million to improve safety and increase the capacity of Saskatchewan’s highways.  More than 1,000 kilometres of provincial highways will be upgraded in 2020-21.  This year’s Estimates include municipal infrastructure—providing nearly $166 million for various municipal projects.  There are also plans by the Crown corporations in 2020-21 to invest a total of $1.7 billion over the next year, for upgrades to improve services provided by SaskPower, SaskTel and SaskEnergy.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Jeff Welke Finance Regina Phone: 306-787-6046 Email: jeff.welke@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-536-1185              "

The government, in consultation with the Chief Medical Health Officer, also made a number of new orders to reduce the risk to Saskatchewan people, prevent transmission and ensure that acute care services are preserved for residents most at risk for severe illness. The following measures are effective immediately:  Public gatherings larger than 50 people are prohibited. All restaurants, bars and event venues must limit their seating to 50 per cent of capacity or up to a maximum of fifty people, whichever is lesser.  All must be able to ensure social distance of one to two metres between customers.  Retail spaces including grocery stores, pharmacies and gas stations are exempted from this policy but must have processes to maintain a one to two metre separation. All gyms, fitness centres, casinos and bingo halls are ordered to close until further notice. Residents are advised to limit any non-essential travel outside of Saskatchewan, with the exception of people who live in border communities and are commuting for work. Any licensed restaurants and taverns in Saskatchewan will be permitted to sell alcohol as an offsale according to SLGA regulations indefinitely. All crown utilities will implement bill-deferral programs allowing a zero-interest bill deferral for up to six months for Saskatchewan residents whose ability to make bill payments may be impacted by the COVID-19 restrictions. All Government of Saskatchewan ministries, agencies and Crown corporations will implement a phased-in work from home policy effective Monday, March 23, applicable to employees deemed non-essential.  This means that any employees able to work from home should do so immediately, while providing managers a period to plan for work-force continuity.  The Saskatchewan Health Authority (SHA) will be discontinuing all non-urgent/elective surgeries, procedures and diagnostics as of March 23.  This action will allow the SHA the ability to redeploy nurses and other staff and ensure medical supplies and personal protective equipment are available when needed and reduce risk of further exposure to our care providers and patients.

Travel Guidance:  The Public Health Agency of Canada is recommending residents postpone or cancel all non-essential travel outside of Canada.  All travellers are being asked to self-isolate for 14 days after returning to Canada as a precaution.  What is the difference between self-isolate and self-monitor?  Self-isolation is a precautionary approach to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 by people that have been in an area of high disease spread or in close contact with a person with COVID-19.  Stay home.  Do not attend work, school, daycare, university, social, sporting or cultural events or religious gatherings.  You may not have any symptoms or may have mild symptoms that can be managed at home.  If symptoms develop or worsen, call HealthLine 811 for assessment and direction.  Self-monitoring means watching closely for symptoms in yourself or your dependents including taking your temperature twice daily.  You do not have restrictions on attending work or school but should avoid crowded public spaces and at-risk populations (those with weakened immune systems or individuals 65 years of age and older).  If self-monitoring, have a plan on how to quickly self-isolate if you develop fever, cough or difficulty breathing.  At the first sign of symptoms, you should self-isolate.

The amendments to the Act would come into force retroactive to March 6, 2020. “We also want to thank the members of the Opposition for their assistance in moving this act forward in a timely way so that employees have the peace of mind needed during public health emergencies,” Morgan said.

Harpauer will table the 2020-21 Budget estimates, which are the government spending plans for the upcoming year for all areas of government, including health, education, social services, public protection and capital spending.  “The budget estimates will contain spending increases in most areas, including a significant increase in health funding,” Harpauer said.  “It includes a significant lift to the Saskatchewan Health Authority, which funds the doctors, nurses and other health professionals who are on the front line of the fight against COVID-19.  “It is absolutely vital that we move ahead with those spending increases now as we confront the COVID-19 pandemic.”  Harpauer said she will not be tabling revenue forecasts tomorrow.  “The events of the past few weeks have resulted in our revenue forecasts no longer being accurate,” Harpauer said.  “Given the rapidly changing situation, accurate revenue forecasts are not possible right now.  “However, we need to move forward with the government’s spending plan for the upcoming year, so we are taking the unusual step of tabling spending estimates without the revenue forecasts.  Once the situation has become more stable, we will release a financial update including revenue forecasts.”  If the estimates are not passed and the Assembly stops sitting, the government will still be able to fund government operations using special warrants based on the spending plans outlined in the budget estimates.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Jim Billington Executive Council Regina Phone: 306-787-0425 Email: jim.billington@gov.sk.ca "

As concerns regarding the spread of the COVID-19 virus elevate, the RSM joins other public facilities in taking this action to help encourage people to stay home and avoid public places where the virus could potentially spread.  Ideally, the museum will reopen once public health authorities determine it is safe to do so.

For the period of March 16 to March 19, pre K-12 classes will wind down.  This means that parents who are able to keep children home should do so immediately, with no absence or grade impacts.  Parents with limited childcare options have a window to plan for class suspensions.  On Sunday, March 15, the Chief Medical Health Officer indicated that school closures would be based on a number of factors including:  Evidence of sustained transmission within the community; Rapid increase of local cases; and Transmission without a known link to travel or confirmed cases.  There continues to be no evidence that any of the above three criteria have been met.  Children remaining in schools between March 16 and March 19 face a low risk of exposure to COVID-19.  A preventative approach of proactive school closures beginning March 20 means reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission.  Every student will receive a final grade based on their current grade, and students will progress to their next grade level next year.  Every student who is eligible to graduate from Grade 12 this year will graduate.  The Ministry of Education and School Divisions will work with Saskatchewan Post-Secondary Institutions to adapt entry requirements for programs commencing in the next academic year.  Teachers and staff can work from home or in schools as scheduled during the class cancellations.  For the rest of the scheduled school year, the Ministry of Education will work with School Divisions and Saskatchewan Teachers to implement a supplemental curriculum program through distance and alternative learning methods.  While this supplemental curriculum will have no impact on final grades, it will ensure that students seeking to continue learning will have the resources necessary to do so.  These measures apply to daycares that are co-located with schools, but do not apply to licensed daycare facilities outside of schools.  Further measures regarding licensed daycare facilities are being considered and will be implemented at a later date.  Officials are currently examining options to provide childcare services for individuals that are providing essential services during the COVID-19 response.

The Chief Medical Health Officer of Saskatchewan has made the following order pursuant to Section 45 of The Public Health Act effective Monday, March 16:  The Chief Medical Health Officer orders that no public gathering of over 250 people in any one room take place.  This does not include settings where people are distributed into multiple rooms or buildings, such as schools, universities or workplaces. The Chief Medical Health Officer orders that no events of over 50 people with speakers or attendees who have travelled internationally in the last 14 days take place. Retail locations and Faith based organizations are exempt, however, they should have measures (such as crowd size monitoring) that support safe social distancing and should seek guidance from the local medical health officer if necessary. Effective immediately, people who have travelled outside the province in the previous 14 days or have acute respiratory or flu-like symptoms should avoid visiting long term care homes and hospitals.  Additionally, the Government of Saskatchewan as an employer is imposing a number of policies regarding government employee travel, as well as self-monitoring and self-isolation procedures:  Effective immediately, international travel (including the U.S.) for government employees on government business has been prohibited. Any out-of-province travel for government employees on government business within Canada will be restricted and is subject to approval by the Deputy Minister to the Premier. Any government employees who are currently travelling internationally (including to the U.S.), or plan to travel internationally for personal reasons will be required to self-isolate for 14 days after returning to Canada as a precaution.  If they have or develop acute respiratory or flu-like symptoms, they should contact Healthline 811. All government employees who are experiencing symptoms of an acute respiratory or flu-like illness will be required to stay at home.  While these measures are being implemented as a policy for Government of Saskatchewan ministries, crowns, and agencies, the Chief Medical Health Officer strongly recommends that all employers and individuals across the province adopt these measures to limit the spread of COVID-19 in Saskatchewan, protect residents from exposure to the virus and reduce the impact of COVID-19 on the health system.  In keeping with these new policies, budget day events on Wednesday, March 18, will proceed without the participation of invited guests.  Members of the Legislative Assembly, media, and a limited number of staff will gather for these events while practicing social distancing.  Further, all tours and public events at the Legislative Building are suspended and general public access to the Legislative Building will also be suspended.  Concerns regarding Healthline 811 have been heard, and following an action plan ordered by the Minister of Health, the capacity of Healthline 811 has been more than doubled effective 9 a.m. this morning, with additional capacity being added going forward.  The Ministry of Health and the Saskatchewan Health Authority continue to work together to expand testing capacity for COVID-19, including the introduction of COVID-19 assessment sites over the coming days.  “While these are significant steps that will help limit transmission of COVID-19, most important is the responsibility we all have to ensure we reduce the risk to ourselves, our families and our communities,” Moe said.  “The best way we can do this is by practicing social distancing, washing our hands often, avoiding close personal contact like handshakes or hugs, and self isolating if we feel any symptoms of illness.”  COVID-19 Information  We understand that residents of Saskatchewan may have questions regarding COVID-19 in Saskatchewan.

The resident is in their 60s with travel from Oregon state in the U.S.  The test was conducted in Saskatoon on March 10 and the individual has been well enough to self-isolate at home.  Public health officials have begun their contact investigation to follow up on anyone who may be at risk of developing COVID-19 because of contact with this individual.  If you do not receive a call from public health, you are not at risk of transmission of COVID-19 from this individual.  The Roy Romanow Provincial Laboratory reported the positive lab sample March 13, 2020, and has forwarded it to the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg for confirmation.  “All travelers – including those to the U.S. -- need to monitor their health for 14 days upon return to Canada and be prepared to stay home if you have a fever or cough,” Saskatchewan Ministry of Health Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Saqib Shahab said.  According to current research on COVID-19, eighty per cent of individuals who contract COVID-19 will experience only mild symptoms.  They will be able to self-isolate and recover at home.  Monitoring for symptoms and staying home when you are sick is important to prevent transmission and ensure acute care resources are reserved for those at highest risk of severe illness.  Travel Guidance  The Public Health Agency of Canada is recommending residents postpone or cancel all non-essential travel outside of Canada.  All travellers should self-monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough or difficulty breathing) for 14 days after returning to Canada and avoid places where you cannot easily separate yourself from others if you become ill.  If you have even mild symptoms, stay home.  Healthline 811  Healthline 811 can assist you in assessing your risk and advise on whether you should seek testing:  If you have travelled in the past 14 days and have developed a fever, cough or difficulty breathing. If you have been asked to self-isolate by healthcare providers and your symptoms become worse.  Protect Yourself from Respiratory Illness  Wash your hands frequently – for at least 20 seconds; Do not touch surfaces and then your mouth, eyes or nose; Use tissues when you cough or sneeze and dispose of them immediately; use your elbow if a tissue not available; Practice social distancing by not shaking hands, hugging, etc. Stay home if you become ill and prevent the spread of the illness; and Clean “high touch” surfaces more often with disinfectant cleansers (ie. doorknobs, faucets, toys, remote controls, table and countertops).

The new virtual services, which will be supported through a new payment code for physicians, will enable patients to connect with physicians by telephone effective immediately.  The Ministry of Health is also working to provide patients with the ability to connect with doctors by secure video, which may be available as early as next week with physician offices that offer that option.  “Keeping Saskatchewan residents healthy and containing community transmission of this coronavirus is a priority for our government,” Health Minister Jim Reiter said.  “Provision of virtual care by telephone or video is just one strategy we are using to ensure residents have options for accessing health care.”  “The SMA is pleased with this development because it provides patients with remote access to physicians,” SMA President Dr. Allan Woo said.  “This kind of access also provides a safer work environment for doctors and their staff during this pandemic.  We need a healthy physician workforce to tackle the challenges presented by the outbreak of COVID-19.”  The risk to Saskatchewan residents still remains low, but all residents can help prevent the spread of COVID-19:  Wash your hands frequently; Sneeze or cough into a tissue or your sleeve; Practice social distancing; and Stay home if you are sick.  The government is reminding patients that if they suspect they are ill as a result of a COVID-19 infection, they should first call HealthLine 811.

In a paper published in the scientific journal, Nature (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2068-4), a team of palaeontologists which includes the Royal Saskatchewan Museum’s (RSM) Ryan McKellar, reveal a new species of primitive toothed bird which further helps to understand the evolutionary connection between birds and dinosaurs.  “We were able to describe this as a new species based on an exceptionally well-preserved skull in amber, which retained small details like the bony rings that support the eyes, soft tissue of the tongue, and an extensive set of blade-shaped teeth,” McKellar said.  “Together, these features shed light on its ecological position during the Cretaceous period (99 million years ago) and its evolutionary relationships.”  “From uncovering and reassembling the world’s largest Tyrannosaurus, on display in the CN T.rex Gallery, to studying and describing what is perhaps the smallest dinosaur ever identified, the work of scientists at the RSM is as fascinating as it is wide-ranging,” Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Gene Makowsky said.  “At the RSM, there is always the potential of a new discovery on the horizon to amaze us!”    The raw material came from amber mines in Myanmar, which have become important sources of scientific material and this specimen was purchased at an amber market in China by researchers there.  McKellar studied images of the find at the RSM and contributed his special expertise with amber to the scientific paper.  Images of the amber, and an enlarged 3D print of the skull, can be viewed in the RSM lobby.  Regular academic publishing contributes to the RSM’s status as an internationally recognized centre for research and teaching.  To learn more about palaeontological research and other exciting work at the RSM, visit https://royalsaskmuseum.ca/rsm/research.     The article can be found online at www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-54400-x.   For more information about the RSM, programming, or to learn how you can support the RSM’s world class research and programming, visit https://royalsaskmuseum.ca/, Facebook (@Royal.Saskatchewan.Museum), Twitter (@royalsaskmuseum) or Instagram (@RoyalSaskMuseum).

Experiencing symptoms, the individual was tested March 9 in Saskatoon and has been well enough to self-isolate at home.  Public health officials are in regular contact with this individual.  “The province’s first case is linked to travel from a country where local transmission of COVID-19 has been reported,” Dr. Shahab said.   “This supports the expanded testing criteria of symptomatic travelers to better prepare Saskatchewan’s response to the COVID-19 event.  All travelers need to monitor their symptoms for two weeks upon return home.”  Public health’s contact investigation is underway and will connect with this individual’s close contacts.  If you do not receive a call from public health, you are not at risk of transmission of COVID-19 from this individual.  The Roy Romanow Provincial Laboratory reported the positive lab sample March 12, 2020, and has forwarded it to the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg for confirmation.  “While the risk of acquiring COVID-19 in Saskatchewan continues to be low, increased testing will assist us in detecting cases as early as possible and delaying the spread of the illness as long as possible,” Shahab said.  “But it is critical that residents take precautions to protect themselves against respiratory illness.  Wash your hands frequently, practice good cough and sneeze hygiene and stay home if you are sick.”  “The Ministry of Health and the Saskatchewan Health Authority have dedicated planning teams in place,” Saskatchewan Health Minister Jim Reiter said.  “Our government is committed to providing the resources our public health system requires to mitigate and respond to COVID-19.”  Protect Yourself from Respiratory Illness:   Wash your hands frequently – for at least 20 seconds; Do not touch surfaces and then your mouth, eyes or nose; Use tissues when you cough or sneeze and dispose of them immediately, use your elbow if a tissue not available; Practice social distancing by not shaking hands, hugging, etc.; Stay home if you become ill and prevent the spread of the illness.  Travel Guidance: All travellers should self-monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough or difficulty breathing) for 14 days after returning to Canada and avoid places where you cannot easily separate yourself from others if you become ill.  If you have even mild symptoms, stay home and call HealthLine 811 for advice. Contact HealthLine 811 within 24 hours of arriving in Canada for direction.

The offer of a $1,500 one-time payment for teachers in the first year and a 2.0 per cent salary increase in each of the next three years will mean teachers are making 105 per cent of the Western Canadian average.  This is in addition to the 1.0 per cent salary increase that teachers received on August 31, 2019, the last day of the previous contract.  In addition to this offer, the government has committed funds that will be applied to composition challenges that have been identified by Saskatchewan teachers.  A Class Size and Composition Committee, which was formed last fall, has met several times to develop a framework for class size and composition.  The Saskatchewan Teachers’ Federation (STF) was invited to participate however, chose not to.  “I encourage teachers to participate in this important committee as they work daily with students and understand the composition issue very clearly,” Deputy Premier and Education Minister Gordon Wyant said.  “I urge the Saskatchewan Teachers' Federation to select teacher representatives to join this committee, which I am prepared to reformat for this important discussion.”  This offer balances the government’s appreciation and respect of teachers with the responsible fiscal management that taxpayers expect and other unions have accepted.  During the last collective bargaining process, the Saskatchewan Teachers' Federation requested arbitration.  During the most recent bargaining talks, the Saskatchewan Teachers' Federation requested conciliation.  Neither the arbitrator nor the conciliator indicated that class size and composition should be included within the teachers’ collective bargaining agreement.  There is opportunity for the parties to address these issues at the local level which is more appropriate given the vast differences in the needs of individual schools.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Chris Hodges Education Regina Phone: 306-787-1069 Email: chris.hodges@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-533-7506              "

The province saw a total of 2,030 well abandonments completed between April 1, 2019, and February 29, 2020.  This represents an increase of more than 40 per cent compared to 2018-19 and 240 per cent compared to 2016-17.  An abandoned well is one that is no longer supporting a company’s oil and gas development and has been decommissioned to a safe and environmentally-sound condition.  This includes plugging the downhole producing zones, cutting off the well casing below the surface and sealing it with a welded cap.  “Saskatchewan’s oil and gas sector is one of the most environmentally responsible in the world,” Energy and Resources Minister Bronwyn Eyre said.  “This increase in well abandonments demonstrates the commitment by industry and government to manage the entire life-cycle of provincial wells and ensure the safe retirement of unused infrastructure to protect our environment, landowners and the public.”    In July 2019, the Government of Saskatchewan implemented changes to Directive PNG015: Well Abandonment Requirements, which resulted in a more streamlined process and contains clear standards for oil and gas companies to responsibly abandon oil and gas wells.  The revised directive is a result of extensive consultation with industry, which pays for well decommissioning.  In all cases, the regulatory arm of the Ministry of Energy and Resources oversees and carries out technical reviews, as part of the decommissioning process, to ensure sites are abandoned and reclaimed to an environmentally-sound standard.  “These changes have allowed companies to conduct well abandonments in a more efficient and timely manner, which has resulted in this significant increase,” Eyre said.  “Timely abandonment strengthens the long-term financial health of oil operators and supports future investment in the oil and gas sector.”  “We appreciate the provincial government’s efforts to enhance the efficiency of the closure process, thereby accelerating the reclamation of inactive oil and natural gas sites in Saskatchewan,” Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) Vice-President of Western Canada Operations Brad Herald said.  “CAPP is committed to continuing collaboration with the Government of Saskatchewan to develop a long-term strategy to manage closure and liability issues in the upstream oil and natural gas industry.”  “Canadian Natural is focused on proactively managing our liabilities with continued increases in our abandonment activity in Saskatchewan,” Canadian Natural Resources Limited Senior Vice President of Development Operations Bill Peterson said.  “We are strongly committed to working together with the Government of Saskatchewan to effectively and efficiently abandon wells, reclaim land, and reduce liability while continuing to invest in the responsible development of Saskatchewan’s resources.”  -30-  For more information, contact:  Ashley Schoff Energy and Resources Regina Phone: 306-787-4765 Email: Ashley.schoff2@gov.sk.ca "

488,2020-03-05,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/march/05/spring-weight-restrictions,Government Website,Spring Weight Restrictions On Secondary Highways ," Released on March 5, 2020                  As the weather warms and the daylight-hours increase, truckers and shippers are being reminded to begin reducing truck loads on some provincial highways.  During this time of year, secondary highways revert back to regulation weights, which will prevent damage to these roads.  “Weight restrictions are put in place at various times of the year on provincial highways as a measure to prevent damage to the surface or road bed,” Highways and Infrastructure Minister Greg Ottenbreit said.  “As the weather warms up, some roads in the province can become vulnerable to soft spots and surface cracks as the frost comes out of the roadbed.”  During the cold, dark, winter months of December, January and February, the road bed freezes and becomes stronger which supports heavier truck loads.  Due to mild temperatures in the forecast, winter weights are being removed.  Effective Monday, March 9 at 12:01 a.m., existing winter weights are removed across southern Saskatchewan and revert back to normal regulation weight.  Typically, winter weights are removed province-wide on March 15 weather permitting.  Spring Road Bans  Spring road restrictions are used by the province and rural municipalities to mitigate damage to infrastructure.  Typically, these road restrictions start in March in southwest Saskatchewan and remain over a two to three-week period.  “Preserving Saskatchewan’s road network is vital for transporting goods to market,” Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities President Ray Orb said.  “By reducing weights during the spring, we can reduce maintenance costs and ensure our roadways remain intact.”  The road bans reduce allowable weights on RM roads and secondary weight provincial highways by 10 to 15 per cent and typically last about six weeks.  Nine Month Primary Weights  Originally, the nine-month primary highways are designed and constructed to carry only lower secondary weight loads.  Weights are reverted back to the design loads (secondary weight) during spring to reduce damage from the spring-thaw.  As a large province with considerable difference in climate in the north and the south, there are different dates for when the primary weights are in effect.  In the north of the province, the annual weight increase on the nine-month primary highways are from July 1 to March 31 of the following year.  In the south of the province, the annual weight increase on the nine-month primary highways will occur earlier, from June 15 to March 15 of the following year.  This change will help to sustain road conditions in the south, where spring thaw occurs earlier.  To check which highways are impacted by weight restrictions, please visit truck weight classifications and restrictions at www.saskatchewan.ca/trucking.  Spring road bans will be posted as necessary under the ""New Spring Order"" link.

The risk of COVID-19 to Saskatchewan residents remains low.  As of March 5, there are no laboratory confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the province.  “With COVID-19 transmission occurring in many countries, Saskatchewan will be expanding testing criteria and increasing surveillance,” Saskatchewan Health’s Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Saqib Shahab said.  “Testing is important to ensure the healthcare system has the best possible information to ensure our facilities and staff are prepared for any cases that present in the province.  The most recent science indicates that 80 per cent of individuals who contract COVID-19 will experience only mild symptoms and will recover in their homes.  Protecting yourself from transmission and planning to stay home if you become sick will allow the healthcare system to focus on the most severe cases.”  Protect Yourself from Respiratory Illness: • Wash your hands frequently; • Do not touch surfaces and then your mouth, eyes or nose; • Use tissues when you cough or sneeze and dispose of them immediately; use your elbow if a tissue not available; • Stay home if you become ill and prevent the spread of the illness  Health System Preparedness  The Ministry of Health has a pandemic preparedness plan developed to address influenza.  Since COVID-19 is a respiratory illness, this plan will be adapted to respond to COVID-19.  This planning includes: • Updated guidance to care providers on the case definition and testing procedures; • Enhanced testing capability with Roy Romanow Provincial Laboratory (RRPL); • Reviewing acute care capacity and contingency planning; and • Ensuring necessary supplies of personal protective equipment.  It is best practice for workplaces to have business continuity plans to support staff and work functions through an event like pandemic influenza.  It is recommended that workplaces ensure these plans are current and ready, in the event that cases increase in the province.  Travel Guidance  The active travel health notices and travel advice are available at Health Canada - Latest Travel Health Advice page.  Travelers from Hubei and Iran are being asked to contact public health officials upon return to Canada and self-isolate for 14 days after leaving those jurisdictions.  All travelers returning from countries where COVID-19 is circulating should actively monitor for symptoms of cough and fever.  If you develop symptoms, stay home and call HealthLine 811 for assessment and advice.  Visit www.saskatchewan.ca/coronavirus for updated information on COVID-19, including the questions and answers for the public and care providers and testing surveillance.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Colleen Book Health Regina Phone: 306-787-4083 Email: media@health.gov.sk.ca "

Most of the province is facing a below normal spring runoff for 2020 as low winter snowfall levels are impacting conditions across Saskatchewan.  A band in southwestern Saskatchewan stretching from Moose Jaw through to Lucky Lake and Leader is facing the driest conditions with a well below normal runoff projected.  Some agricultural water supply issues could develop within drier areas during 2020 if lack of moisture persists through spring.    March and April can be the some of the wettest months, so the outlook may improve.  Only the far northwest and extreme southeast and southwest corners of the province are projected to have near or above normal runoffs, with small portions of the province expected to have a higher than normal runoff.  However, in these areas where above normal runoff is expected, flood flows are unlikely based on current conditions and normal conditions going forward.  Snowmelt runoff is influenced by fall soil moisture, storage conditions, winter precipitation accumulations and weather during the spring melt.  While much of the southern half of province entered the winter with good to excess moisture conditions, below average snowfall has decreased the runoff potential.  Water supplies from the province’s major reservoirs are expected to be adequate in 2020.  Desirable summer operating levels are also expected at most recreational lakes within the province in 2020.  The Qu’Appelle Valley is the exception with Last Mountain, Pasqua, Echo, and Crooked lakes likely to be lower than desirable.  The WSA will issue another forecast in early April if runoff is not yet underway.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Patrick Boyle Water Security Agency Moose Jaw Phone: 306-631-6997 Email: Patrick.Boyle@wsask.ca "

Public information sessions will be held in Saskatoon and Regina, on March 17 and 19 respectively, as well as online on March 24.  Further information on times and locations will be posted on Innovation Saskatchewan’s website.  “Innovation Challenges find inventive answers to public issues,” Beaudry-Mellor said.  “We have successfully collaborated with our province’s tech sector to combat rural crime, grant permissions for hunting and fishing on private land and track the waste that ends up in our province’s landfills.”  Find previous Innovation Challenge winners and program information at https://innovationsask.ca/initiatives/innovation-challenge/previous-innovation-challenges.   -30-  For more information, contact:  Glen Kirby Innovation Saskatchewan Regina Phone: 306-787-6041 Email: glen.kirby@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-537-6455              "

English for Employment programming assists those with a low English proficiency in developing their language skills, with a focus on supporting their capacity to find and maintain employment in Saskatchewan.  For these unemployed or underemployed newcomers, advancing their language skills is essential to securing good long-term employment, comparable with their training and experience.  “Whether it’s finding employment, pursuing education, obtaining medical care, accessing housing, or just getting around and interacting with others in their daily lives, the language barrier is the number one challenge facing newcomers,” Harrison said.  “These workers have valuable knowledge and skills to contribute and we want to ensure they have the tools to help them succeed at work and life here in Saskatchewan.”  From becoming familiar with workplace culture and workers’ safety, to resume writing and interview preparation, English for Employment programming allows workers to prepare for participation in Saskatchewan’s labour market while enhancing their language skills.  “Mastering English in relation to the workplace is a critical step in the process of finding meaningful employment and to enhance workplace communication skills,” Saskatoon Open Door Society’s Employment Services Unit (ESU) Manager Ashraf Mirmontahai said.

Shelters in areas north of Highway 16 must be removed by March 31.  Every year, ice fishing shelters are abandoned on the ice, which can pose a danger to boaters, water-skiers and others enjoying our lakes.  Pieces of abandoned shelters can also wash up on shore, causing environmental hazards.    If shelters are not removed, owners may be prosecuted and the structure and contents may be moved off the ice and confiscated.  Structures must be moved to a location where they can be loaded and transported to the owner’s residence or property.  Litter must also be removed when ice shelters are taken off the ice.  Anyone travelling on the ice should take extreme caution.  Slush indicates that ice is eroding from above and below at an advanced rate.  Changing temperatures can cause thermal cracks and pressure ridges, which are indicators of unsafe conditions.    Ice fishing shelters must have the owner’s complete name, address and phone number on the outside in legible letters that are at least 2.5 cm high.  Information about fishing in the province can be found in the Saskatchewan Anglers’ Guide and online at www.saskatchewan.ca/fishing.   If you suspect wildlife, fisheries, forestry or environmental violations, please call your local Ministry of Environment office, Saskatchewan’s toll-free Turn in Poachers and Polluters (TIPP) line at 1-800-667-7561 or #5555 for SaskTel cellular subscribers.  Violations can also be reported online at www.saskatchewan.ca/tipp.   You may be eligible for cash rewards from the SaskTip Reward Program.  Callers can remain anonymous.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Jamie Gibson Environment Regina Phone: 306-798-3900 Email: jamie.gibson@gov.sk.ca  For public inquiries Environment Phone: 1-800-567-4224 Email: centre.inquiry@gov.sk.ca "

However, the decline in exports to China was partially offset by the growth in other emerging markets like Bangladesh (118 per cent increase), the EU (59 per cent), the UAE (40 per cent), India (23 per cent) and Brazil (13 per cent).  Saskatchewan’s top export products included crude oil, potash, wheat, pulse crops, canola oil, barley, oats, agricultural machinery, and refined petroleum.  The Government of Saskatchewan maintained an aggressive trade mission agenda in over the past year.  This included Premier and Ministerial trade missions to the U.S., Japan, South Korea, India, Mexico, Singapore, Bangladesh, the Philippines, and the EU.  Growing the province’s trade and exports is a key component of Saskatchewan’s Growth Plan.  The Plan includes goals to increase the value of exports by 50 per cent, grow the number of international markets to which Saskatchewan exports more than $1 billion annually, grow agri-food exports to $20 billion and increase the value of manufacturing exports by 50 per cent.  The plan includes several initiatives to help achieve these goals.  These include opening new international trade and investment offices in Japan, Singapore and India, undertaking SaskFirst new growth tax incentives, maintaining a competitive tax environment and expanding Saskatchewan’s export infrastructure.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Deb Young Trade and Export Development Regina Phone: 306-787-4765 Email: deb.young@gov.sk.ca "

This award does not recognize individuals, and service clubs cannot self-nominate.  The nomination deadline for the award is April 15, 2020.  Groups selected to receive the Premier’s Service Club Award will be presented their awards at an event in their home community in 2020.

This is a multi-year project that will be completed in three phases.  Improvements to segment two, a 30 km section of Highway 5 from Blucher Road to Highway 2, passing lanes, widening of the shoulders, resurfacing, grade-line improvements, access consolidation, intersection realignment on the St. Denis access intersection treatments, and culvert replacements.  Construction is scheduled to begin in the spring of 2021, with completion set for the fall of 2022.  The third and final segment will include twinning of Highway 5 from the existing section east of Saskatoon past Highway 316 to the Old 27 road.  Construction is scheduled to begin in the spring of 2023.  The entire project is scheduled to be complete by 2025.  Currently, traffic volumes range from 2,500 to 4,000 vehicles per day, but that number is expected to increase substantially on the west end of the corridor, which is why twinning is necessary.  The ministry hosted information sessions last summer to provide an overview and gather feedback for the design of phase one.  Additional consultations will be held for phases two and three.  The Government of Saskatchewan has invested more than $9 billion in transportation infrastructure since 2008.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Doug Wakabayashi Highways and Infrastructure Regina Phone: 306-787-6815 Email: doug.wakabayashi@gov.sk.ca "

The program is aimed at workers aged 55-64 who are currently unemployed and are legally entitled to work in Canada, but lack the skills needed to successfully secure employment.  “The TIOW program will increase the employability of older workers in Saskatchewan,” Immigration and Career Training Minister Jeremy Harrison said.  “These workers have decades of valuable experience and we want to ensure they have the skills needed to remain active and productive participants of Saskatchewan’s labour market for as long as they choose to do so.”  This is just one part of a larger effort by the province to increase the diversity and inclusiveness of its labour force.  Projects will be launched in Saskatoon, Prince Albert, Regina and Lloydminster.  It is anticipated that at least 186 participants will take part in the program this year.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Deb Young Immigration and Career Training Regina Phone: 306-787-4765 Email: deb.young@gov.sk.ca "

501,2020-03-02,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/march/02/ministerial-transparency,Government Website,Government Increases Ministerial Transparency," Released on March 2, 2020                  Today, the Government of Saskatchewan announced that in-province ministerial travel and expense reports will be publicly disclosed on a quarterly basis beginning in the fiscal year 2020-21.  The current bi-annual public disclosure of out-of-province ministerial travel and expenses, a measure introduced by the current government to increase transparency, will now also be posted on a quarterly basis.  “Our government values the hard earned tax dollars of Saskatchewan people,” Premier Scott Moe said.  “While we have previously taken steps to decrease travel costs and increase transparency, we feel it is necessary to continue these efforts to ensure the public knows how tax dollars are being spent by government ministers as they travel across the province.”  The increased transparency measures accompany a number of steps the government has taken to reduce ministerial travel expenses.  These measures include a 53 per cent reduction in travel costs in 2018-2019 compared to the last year of the former government in 2006-2007, and the shutdown of Executive Air, the former government-owned air service, for an annual savings of $1 million.  Along with the implementation of new public disclosure of in-province ministerial travel and expense reports in the new fiscal year, monthly expense reports for in-province travel and expenses incurred by the Premier in the 2019-20 fiscal year to date were also released.  The quarterly proactive disclosure of in-province ministerial travel and expense reports will include monthly reports consisting of the following information: • An itemized account of in-province charter and commercial flights; • An itemized account of meals expensed by a Minister, including breakfast, lunch, coffee, or dinner meetings; • Total accommodation expenses; • Total ground travel expenses; and • Total meal per diems.

That is why we are analyzing the feasibility of a new parkade at Regina General Hospital.”  The results of the market sounding will be known in the spring, after which a decision will be made about further exploring the parkade option and issuing a Request for Proposals for the design and construction.  A decision on how to proceed will be made by summer.  In the meantime, the SHA continues to use a variety of measures to alleviate parking issues at the hospital, including “Park and Ride” and “Safe Walk” programs for staff and visitors.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Colleen Book Health Regina Phone: 306-787-4083 Email: media@health.gov.sk.ca  Lisa Thomson  Saskatchewan Health Authority Regina Phone: 306-766-5332 Email: lisa.thomson@saskhealthauthority.ca              "

The 2020 Grey Cup Festival is anticipated to have a similar return.    Sponsorship of the event comes from Tourism Saskatchewan’s Event Hosting Program, which assists the province in hosting national and international events and initiating special tourism projects.  The 2020 Grey Cup Festival is one of several major events Saskatchewan is proud to host in 2020-2021.  These include the Scotties Tournament of Hearts, recently held in Moose Jaw; the JUNO Awards in Saskatoon later this month; and the 2021 Canadian Curling Trials Roar of the Rings, also in Saskatoon.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Elizabeth Braitenbach Tourism Saskatchewan Regina Phone: 306-787-5530 Email: elizabeth.braitenbach@tourismsask.com "

516,2020-02-25,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/february/25/crop-insurance-program,Government Website,Governments Of Canada And Saskatchewan Announce Enhancements To The 2020 Crop Insurance Program ," Released on February 25, 2020                  Today, Federal Agriculture and Agri-Food Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau and Saskatchewan Agriculture Minister David Marit announced enhancements to the 2020 Crop Insurance Program.  This year, Saskatchewan producers will continue to access high coverage while seeing a decrease in premiums.  The Crop Insurance Program continues to adapt to the changing agricultural landscape in the province.  “Our hardworking farmers have faced difficult weather throughout 2019 and we are committed to help them manage these risks,” Bibeau said.  “Through the Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Program, we are helping give Saskatchewan farmers the tools needed to deal with unpredictable weather, so they can continue producing high quality food for the world, while supporting our communities and livelihoods.”  “We are dedicated to maintaining a strong, growing agricultural economy,” Marit said.  “That is why we invest in business risk management programs to provide producers with protection against the unexpected.  In these times of market uncertainty and adverse weather conditions, support through a comprehensive suite of programs is important for Saskatchewan producers.”  The success of Saskatchewan’s crop production allows the Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation (SCIC) to keep premiums low and average coverage strong for producers.  On average, Crop Insurance coverage holds steady at $224 per acre, only slightly decreasing from $230 per acre in 2019.  Premiums will see a decrease to an average of $7.40 per acre, down from $8.61 in 2019.  For 2020, the insurable region for soybeans is expanding to the entire province.  Coverage is based on a soybean producer’s individual insured history instead of the regional average.  Their experience discount or surcharge will be applied to premiums for soybean crops.  Irrigation coverage is also now available.  “We are pleased with this year’s improvements and the ongoing commitment toward Saskatchewan agriculture,” Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities Division 2 Director Norm Nordgulen said.  “As we continue to see diversification throughout the industry, this year’s changes to soybean coverage, along with last year’s forage and weather-based enhancements, speaks to the relevancy of SCIC’s programs.”  “It’s very encouraging to see the enhancement to the program,” Saskatchewan Irrigation Projects Association Chairman Aaron Gray said.  “With the interest we have seen in expanding the industry in the province and the provinces growth plan including expanding irrigation by 85,000 acres in the next 10 years, changes like this help an industry to grow to its potential in Saskatchewan.  Including Soybeans in the Enhanced Irrigation Program will be of benefit to irrigators.  Saskatchewan irrigators can now make their decision on crop rotation based on their operations and not be penalized.  Soybeans fit very nicely in an irrigators rotation.  We look forward to working with SCIC on releasing the information to our industry.”  For those customers looking to return to the Crop Insurance Program, SCIC is making an administrative change.  Producers now have up to seven years to rejoin the program to continue with their previous premium discount/surcharge and yields.  Working with the Saskatchewan Vegetable Growers’ Association, SCIC is enhancing the Vegetable Acreage Loss Insurance Program.  Insured value of vegetable crops are updated to better reflect the production costs.  To allow for a longer growing season before harvest begins, SCIC is extending the fall cut-off dates.  For 2020, asparagus is added as an eligible crop.  For 2020, SCIC has a new approach to the Organic Option to ensure it remains relevant to Saskatchewan producers.  Premiums and coverage are updated using information from organic customers.  Previously, the Organic Option was based on a combination of conventional and organic crop experience.  With this change, organic insured prices are higher and premium rates are lower.  Average coverage is also lower; realigning to current organic risk.  The impact of this change will depend upon each producer’s production experience.  Organic customers are encouraged to contact their local SCIC office to review the impacts to their individual coverage.  “We have been working with SCIC to ensure the program meets the needs of organic producers,” SaskOrganics President Will Oddie said.  “This is an important insurance program for our organic growers and it is now more relevant with SCIC using historical organic information.”  Producers faced a variety of challenges throughout the 2019 growing season.  Dry conditions challenged summer growing and wet conditions, coupled with early snowfall, delayed harvest.  With approximately 1.3 million insured acres left out over winter, compensation for producers is estimated to reach $350 million in claims.  Crops left out over winter are covered under SCIC’s Wildlife Damage Compensation Program.  This program is available to all Saskatchewan producers; Crop Insurance participation is not required.  If producers notice any wildlife damage, they should contact SCIC as soon as possible.  Producers with unharvested acres must contact SCIC prior to harvest, feeding or grazing any damaged crop so it can be assessed.  Federal, provincial, and territorial (FPT) Ministers of Agriculture met in December 2019 and committed to making targeted improvements to the AgriStability program.  Ministers also asked officials to review the treatment of private insurance for the 2020 program year.  Ministers asked officials to change the treatment of private insurance for the 2020 program year.  Private insurance revenue will be excluded when calculating a producer’s program year margin.  This increases the potential for an AgriStability benefit as private insurance revenue is not factored into the producer's allowable income.  Premiums for private insurance will remain included as allowable expenses.  Minister Marit reminded livestock producers, under the Western Livestock Price Insurance Program, calf price insurance policies are now available for purchase.  Producers can choose from a range of coverage options every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.  While Feeder and Feed price insurance policies are available year-round, the deadline to purchase a calf price insurance policy is May 28, 2020.  SCIC encourages producers to review their business risk management plans annually.  SCIC has 21 local customer service offices across the province with knowledgeable staff available to discuss the insurance options best suited for each farming operation.  March 31, 2020, is the deadline to select insured crops and coverage levels or make additional changes to their Crop Insurance contract.  Producers need to also apply, reinstate or cancel by this date.  For more information about the 2020 insurance options, call 1-888-935-0000 or visit www.scic.ca.  Crop Insurance is a Business Risk Management program supported through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership.  Under Crop Insurance, premiums for most programs are shared 40 per cent by participating producers, 36 per cent by the Government of Canada and 24 per cent by the Government of Saskatchewan.  Administrative expenses are fully funded by governments, 60 per cent by Canada and 40 per cent by Saskatchewan.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Tessa Krofchek Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation Melville Phone: 639-398-2268 Email: tessa.krofchek@scic.ca  Media Relations Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Ottawa Phone: 613-773-7972              "

In particular, the campaign focuses on the Respect Resource Line, where expert staff provide information, bilingual support, resources and referrals by phone, text or email.  This confidential and anonymous resource is intended to assist coaches, athletes and parents in determining the most appropriate course of action.    “Sport enriches lives, teaches valuable life skills, and builds close-knit communities,” Sask Sport Volunteer Board Chair Kenric Exner said.  “To ensure sport is a positive experience for all, Sask Sport, our members and our many partners have been leaders in preventing and dealing with negative situations when they do occur.  We thank the Government of Saskatchewan for working with us on this campaign to keep sport healthy, safe and fun for everyone.”  The Government of Saskatchewan and Sask Sport acknowledge the ongoing partnership with Respect Group Co-Founder Sheldon Kennedy whose efforts have been foundational to this initiative.  “I applaud Saskatchewan for their leadership in child protection,” Kennedy said.  “Giving people an outlet to seek advice on scary issues is the key to prevention and early intervention.”  Sask Sport provides additional resources, such as the Respect in Sport online training program for coaches and activity leaders to ensure more coaches are trained in current safe sport best practices.

The deaths remain under investigation by the Saskatchewan Coroners Service and Regina Police.  However, preliminary toxicology indicates lethal levels of fentanyl and methamphetamine.  “We know that this can be a fatal combination and that anyone who uses streets drugs is at risk of an overdose,” Chief Coroner Clive Weighill said.  The Regina Police Service says it is aware of 67 instances of non-fatal drug overdoses in Regina since January 1, 2020, in addition to the two deaths currently under investigation.  Saskatchewan residents who are at risk of an opioid overdose or those who might witness an opioid overdose, such as friends and family of people who use opioids, are eligible for a free Take Home Naloxone kit and training on how to use it.  People can find a Take Home Naloxone program near them by visiting www.saskatchewan.ca/opioids or calling HealthLine 811.  Naloxone reverses the effects of an opioid overdose temporarily, restoring breathing in a few minutes.  It’s important to note that Naloxone treatment itself does not replace the need to seek immediate medical attention.  Call 911 immediately if you suspect an overdose.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Noel Busse Justice Regina Phone: 306-787-8959 Email: noel.busse@gov.sk.ca  Jennifer Graham Justice Regina Phone: 306-787-8621 Email: jennifer.graham@gov.sk.ca "

A proposal introduced in 2019 – which generated considerable public response – would have seen annual Crown land lease fees increase to $1,500 over four years.  However, today’s decision means that lessees will see no movement in their yearly fees before 2025.  “After listening to the concerns of cabin owners on Crown land about the proposed increase, the Government of Saskatchewan is responding with a fair and respectful approach to fees for remote recreation leases,” Duncan said.  “We will review the fee structure in five years to ensure that the people of Saskatchewan are getting fair value for these properties.”  Provincial lease fee rates were initially revised because they had not been reviewed since 2004, and did not reflect fair market values.  The government charges rates that provide a fair return to the province for the private use of public lands and resources.  There are 937 remote recreational cabins and 15 remote residential sites on Crown resource land, primarily located in the north.  Prior to the changes, the average recreational cabin site paid $287 per year.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Jamie Gibson Environment Regina Phone: 306-798-3900 Email: jamie.gibson@gov.sk.ca  For public inquiries  Environment Phone: 1-800-567-4224 Email: centre.inquiry@gov.sk.ca "
520,2020-02-20,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/february/20/ais-strategy,Government Website,Saskatchewan Releases New Aquatic Invasive Species Strategy," Released on February 20, 2020 Today, Environment Minister Dustin Duncan introduced the Government of Saskatchewan’s new Aquatic Invasive Species Strategy during an address to the Saskatchewan Wildlife Federation’s (SWF) annual convention in Weyburn.  The new framework is designed to help the province prevent, address and manage aquatic invasive species (AIS) threats.  The ministry and the SWF are partners on the province’s AIS Task Force – which focuses on additional education and monitoring activities – along with other government agencies, conservation groups, non-government organizations and universities.  “This strategy emphasizes the need for collaboration and co-ordination with provincial and federal government agencies, non-government organizations and neighbouring jurisdictions to prevent the introduction and spread of high-risk aquatic invasive species,” Duncan said.    AIS, such as zebra and quagga mussels, threaten lakes and rivers in Western Canada.  They can severely affect aquatic habitat, fisheries, valuable recreational resources and important infrastructure for irrigation, power generation and municipal water supplies.  In recent years, the ministry has significantly increased its AIS prevention efforts, with a primary focus on education and awareness.  “We recently announced that no invasive mussels had been detected in Saskatchewan waters in 2019,” Duncan said.  “That is a positive step, and it speaks to the approach we’ve been taking in Saskatchewan.  But we know more work needs to be done, and that diligence on this front needs to be unrelenting for us to remain free from this threat.”  Saskatchewan also partners with the Canada Border Services Agency and other provincial and territorial governments to co-ordinate prevention efforts across Western Canada.  The province’s new AIS Strategy, as well as further information about AIS and fishing, is available online at https://www.saskatchewan.ca/residents/environment-public-health-and-safety/wildlife-issues/invasive-species/aquatic-invasive-species-prevention-program.   -30-  For more information, contact:  Jamie Gibson Environment Regina Phone: 306-798-3900 Email: jamie.gibson@gov.sk.ca  For public inquiries  Environment Phone: 1-800-567-4224 Email: centre.inquiry@gov.sk.ca "

The Saskatchewan Health Authority has awarded a contract to Mayfair Diagnostics to deliver publicly-funded, community-based MRI services in Saskatoon and to continue providing MRI services in Regina.  “Improving access to advanced medical imaging to Saskatchewan residents, including MRI, is a priority for our government,” Health Minister Jim Reiter said.  “Expanding community-based MRI services to Saskatoon will benefit thousands of additional patients in central and northern Saskatchewan each year and help meet the growing demand for MRI exams across the province.”    Mayfair Diagnostics will provide a minimum of 4,500 exams per year in Saskatoon.  Services are expected to begin in Saskatoon in August 2020.  “Being able to expand our partnership with the Ministry of Health and the Saskatchewan Health Authority to provide community-based MRI services within Saskatoon is a great opportunity,” Mayfair Diagnostics Executive Chair Dr. Shamir Patel said.  “We are pleased to continue serving Regina patients with the extension of the contract there, and look forward to working with the Saskatoon health care community to support new neighbours and colleagues in Saskatoon.”  “The Saskatchewan Health Authority has worked closely with the Ministry of Health on the expansion of the community-based MRI program with the shared goal of improving access to diagnostic services for Saskatchewan patients,” Saskatchewan Health Authority Physician Executive Provincial Programs Dr. Paul Babyn said.  “Community-based MRI services have been provided in Regina since 2014 by third party providers, and we are pleased to see these services expanded to Saskatoon.”  Saskatchewan has seen a growing number of patients referred for MRI in recent years, from approximately 39,000 patients in 2016 to 46,000 patients in 2019.  To help address increasing demand and wait times, the province has invested in adding capacity and expanded hours of operation for MRI services in Regina and Saskatoon.  In 2019-20, the Saskatchewan Health Authority budgeted approximately $141.4 million for medical imaging services, a 68 per cent increase since 2007.  The 2019-20 budget also includes $2.4 million for medical imaging equipment replacement.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Colleen Book Health Regina Phone: 306-787-4083 Email: media@health.gov.sk.ca  Amber Nason Mayfair Diagnostics  Calgary Phone: 403-385-0256   Amanda Purcell Saskatchewan Health Authority Saskatoon Phone: 306-655-3476 Email: amanda.purcell@saskhealthauthority.ca "

For a full list of inquiry report recommendations, as well as future expectations for the village, please review the attached background information.  The Government of Saskatchewan initially ordered an inspection into the Northern Village of Pinehouse in December 2018, after citations from the Provincial Privacy Commissioner for failing to properly respond to freedom of information requests.  The inspection was expanded into a formal inquiry after an interim report was submitted to government in the spring of 2019.  At that time, the provincial government appointed a temporary “supervisor” to the village to provide advice and guidance to the local council and called for a special audit to be carried out.  The official inquiry ended in late November 2019.  The final report has been under review by officials in both the ministries of Government Relations and Justice since it was received on December 23, 2019.  Throughout this process, the Government of Saskatchewan has remained committed to releasing both reports publicly.

Amendments have been made to the regulations for The Change of Name Act, 1995, that introduce criminal record checks as part of the change of name application process for anyone 18 years of age and older.  “These changes are about helping to protect the most vulnerable in our society,” Justice Minister and Attorney General Don Morgan said.  “We don’t believe sexual offenders should be able to change their name to avoid public disclosure and scrutiny.”  More than 20 different offences would prohibit the person from getting a name change.  Most of the offences are offences against children.  However, some of these offences, such as sexual assault and incest, can be committed against children and adults.  The offences are the ones that require registration in the National Sex Offender Registry.  The designated offences are set out in subsection 490.011(1) of the Criminal Code.  The change of name requirements are posted on eHealth Saskatchewan’s website.  If there is no criminal record showing on the criminal record check, the change of name may be processed.  If any of the criminal record checks show a criminal record or is inconclusive, then that person will need to be fingerprinted and provide the Registrar of Vital Statistics with a further criminal record check that shows the offences.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Jennifer Graham Justice Regina Phone: 306-787-8621 Email: jennifer.graham@gov.sk.ca "

The relocatable classrooms will allow divisions to address growing student enrolment in their schools, without undergoing significant renovations or requiring a new school to be built.  Relocatable classrooms can be ordered and installed much quicker than a regular build, and can be moved to another school with higher enrolment needs if they are not needed anymore.  “The Relocatable Classroom program provides divisions with opportunities to expand school capacity in order to address enrolment concerns,” Deputy Premier and Education Minister Gordon Wyant said.  “Adding these relocatables to our schools will provide both students and teachers with high-quality classroom spaces in which to learn.”  Over the past six years, 12 communities have received relocatable classrooms through the program.  This includes more than 100 relocatables that were purchased new and 29 relocatables that were moved from another school that no longer had a need for them.  In addition to this funding, the Ministry of Education’s 2019-20 budget previously included $4.5 million for the Relocatable Classroom program.  The government is also providing an additional $5 million to support the Preventative Maintenance and Renewal program.  These funds will help school divisions address infrastructure needs in their schools.  This funding announcement increases the Government’s overall commitment to capital infrastructure for education in 2019-20 to $106.6 million – up from $76.4 million in 2018-19.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Dale Hunter Education Regina Phone: 306-787-9501 Email: dale.hunter@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-529-9207              "

While travelling in Dhaka, Marit highlighted Saskatchewan as a reliable and quality supplier of food and feed ingredients.  Marit met with key wheat importers and millers, as Bangladesh is a large and growing wheat market for Saskatchewan.  Marit also met with senior Bangladeshi government ministers and officials to discuss emerging market opportunities for our agricultural products.  Marit was also able to attend the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signing by the Global Institute for Food Security (GIFS) at the University of Saskatchewan with research partners from Bangladesh’s Ministry of Agriculture.  This MOU solidified a research and training development partnership between GIFS and officials in Bangladesh.  Marit concluded his tour in Mumbai, India, by taking part in the fifth biannual Pulses Conclave in Lonavala.  With more than 500 delegates in attendance from all major pulse-producing countries in the world, the conference provided a forum to meet with key pulse importers and discuss opportunities and barriers in the pulse export market.  As part of the Growth Plan, the Government of Saskatchewan committed to opening a new international trade and investment office in India.  Marit’s mission focused on strengthening trade relationships and finding new market opportunities for Saskatchewan agriculture products.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Charlotte McGraw Agriculture Regina Phone: 306-787-4031 Email: charlotte.mcgraw@gov.sk.ca  Cell: 306-526-7833 "

During the mission, Premier Moe conducted a number of bilateral meetings with officials, including:  • The governors of Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, Maryland and South Carolina; • House representatives from North Dakota and Ohio; • Administration officials including the Undersecretary of Energy, the Assistant Director of Nuclear Energy in the President’s Science and Technology Division and the Department of Commerce’s Western Hemisphere Division; and • Mexican governors Francisco Domínguez Servién and Carlos Mendoza Davis, chair and incoming chair of the Mexican National Governors’ Conference, the Mexican counterpart organization to COF.  Premier Moe also addressed governors and NGA delegates at an NGA plenary session focused on infrastructure innovation and spoke at an event hosted by the Wilson Center’s Canada Institute on the next decade of U.S.-Canada relations from the premiers’ perspective.  “With the American ratification of the USMCA, Canada’s premiers took a leadership position in ensuring that decision makers in the United States know that we are committed to the swift ratification of this vital trade deal in Canada,” Moe said.  “I’m returning home with a simple message for all Canadian parliamentarians: get this deal ratified immediately.”  In 2018, Saskatchewan exported $16.9 billion worth of goods to the United States, representing 55 per cent of Saskatchewan’s total exports.  In addition, Saskatchewan imported $9.9 billion worth of goods from the United States.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Jim Billington Executive Council Regina Phone: 306-787-0425 Email: jim.billington@gov.sk.ca "
533,2020-02-11,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/february/11/ai-used-to-track-waste,Government Website,Artificial Intelligence Used To Track Saskatchewan Waste," Released on February 11, 2020 Following a province-wide competition, Innovation Saskatchewan today unveiled new technologies to track how much solid waste is generated in the province and where it all goes.  The solutions will be beneficial to the government’s efforts announced in January to reduce solid waste dumped into landfills by 30 per cent by 2030.  “Our tech community has developed a tracking and reporting mechanism using artificial intelligence which can reduce the expense of landfill operations and lead to long-term environmental efficiencies,” Innovation Minister Tina Beaudry-Mellor said.  Innovation Saskatchewan first identified the two technologies in 2019 through an Innovation Challenge, which encourages provincial technology companies to find inventive solutions to public issues:  • Prairie Robotics integrated artificial intelligence and cameras to capture waste data in real time and automatically generate reports from across the province. • Researchers at the University of Regina created a system, optimized for Saskatchewan’s extreme weather, to weigh moving vehicles.    Each winner received $10,000 in funding and a 16-week residency to develop their innovation in collaboration with government, before demonstrating the solutions in Regina.  “Artificial intelligence eliminates human errors and bias,” Prairie Robotics Sam Dietrich said.  “Our system means better tracking of waste across urban and rural Saskatchewan, which can lead to better management.”  The provincial government’s Solid Waste Management Strategy released in January found that every Saskatchewan resident produces an average of 842 kilograms of trash per year – the second highest per capita among Canadian provinces.  “The technologies brought forward through our Innovation Challenges are answering challenges we face in Saskatchewan and providing solutions that can be used around the world,” Environment Minister Dustin Duncan said.

(SSRM), produced 112,137 ounces.  In 2019, production from the Seabee operation increased 17 per cent compared to the previous year, which marks the fourth consecutive year the Seabee operation has set a new record for gold production in the province.  “Saskatchewan has a diverse mining sector, which is responsible for a significant amount of growth and investment in our province’s economy,” Energy and Resources Minister Bronwyn Eyre said. “Congratulations to SSR Mining Inc. on its record year of production.  Our government will continue to support targeted mineral exploration development and sound policy to drive our economy and ensure that Saskatchewan remains one of the best, most competitive mining jurisdictions in the world.”  The Seabee gold operation is located in Northern Saskatchewan, about 125 kilometres northeast of La Ronge.  Production occurs at the Santoy underground mine, while ore processing occurs at the Seabee mill facility nearby.    “The Seabee gold operation continues to be a tremendous success thanks to our employees, supportive communities and the provincial government,” SSR Mining Chief Executive Officer Paul Benson said.  “The quality partnership with all of our stakeholders continues to show that Saskatchewan is one of the premier locations in the world to operate.”  Saskatchewan’s diverse geology and mineral deposits, along with a stable government regulatory environment and targeted mineral exploration incentives, have created an attractive location for local and international mining companies.  In 2018, the Fraser Institute ranked Saskatchewan’s mining sector third in the world and first in Canada for mining investment attractiveness, out of 83 global jurisdictions.  The Investment Attractiveness Index takes into account both geologic potential for minerals, as well as government mining policies.  Saskatchewan also ranked second globally, tied with British Columbia, out of 99 jurisdictions in the Mining Journal’s 2019 World Risk Report.  Saskatchewan’s Growth Plan includes an objective to increase new mineral exploration over the next ten years.  A commitment to reinstate Provincial Sales Tax exemptions for exploratory downhole drilling activity in the mining sector will encourage new mining exploration and investment in to the province.  The government will also continue to support the Targeted Mineral Exploration Incentive, introduced in October 2018, which is designed to encourage and increase exploration for gold, base metals and diamonds in select regions of the province.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Deb Young Energy and Resources Regina Phone: 306-787-4765 Email: deb.young@gov.sk.ca "

In 2019, the ministry checked more than 3,100 watercraft for signs of aquatic invasive species (AIS), identifying 1,147 as high-risk and requiring further inspection.  In all, 217 watercraft were decontaminated and no AIS were found.  Anyone transporting watercraft in Saskatchewan must remove the boat plug, stop at watercraft inspection stations and submit to inspection, or risk a $500 fine.  It is also illegal to bring prohibited aquatic invasive species into Saskatchewan.  The ministry works co-operatively with the province’s AIS Task Force, which includes other government agencies, conservation and other non-government organizations and universities on additional education and monitoring activities.  Saskatchewan also partners with Canada Border Services Agency and other provincial and territorial governments to co-ordinate prevention efforts across western Canada.  AIS, such as zebra and quagga mussels, threaten lakes and rivers in western Canada.  They can severely affect aquatic habitat, fisheries, valuable recreational resources and important infrastructure for irrigation, power generation and municipal water supplies.  Invasive mussels are now found in Ontario, Manitoba, Quebec and in 34 states, including Minnesota, Montana and North Dakota.

In 2014, Ministry of Environment conservation officers received information that an individual was buying and selling large numbers of wild elk, moose and deer antlers without the proper permits in place.  Officers proceeded to follow up on the tip and inspected a yard site near Gronlid, located 27 km northeast of Melfort.  They had a discussion with the owner about the legality of buying and selling sets of wild antlers at that time.  During the course of the investigation, the individual willingly purchased antlers from undercover conservation officers on numerous occasions.  In Saskatchewan, A Sale of Wildlife Permit is required to sell most animal parts.  However, big game antlers that have been separated from the skull can be sold without a permit, but only if the animal was taken with a valid hunting licence and the tag accompanies the antlers.  Shed antlers can be sold without a permit.    In November 2018, officers executed a search warrant and located 314 antlers, plus 19 complete sets of antlers and horns from wild elk, moose, white-tailed and mule deer, as well as five African species.  Several firearms were seized during the search due to unsafe storage, including two loaded firearms. Randall Wehrkamp, aged 64, pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of wildlife, possession of wildlife for the purpose of trafficking, trafficking in wildlife, improper record keeping and firearms-related charges.  Wehrkamp received a total of $36,500 in fines, which have been paid in full, and a five-year hunting suspension.    In addition, the court ordered that Wehrkamp must not sell, transfer or move antlers without providing notice to a conservation officer for the next five years to ensure compliance with the Wildlife Act and Regulations.  Two firearms and all the seized antlers and horns were forfeited to the Crown.  Wehrkamp was also placed on 12 months’ probation.  The probation conditions include a $200 charitable donation to Ducks Unlimited Canada, submitting to a search of any residence and out-buildings by conservation officers without warrant, and submitting to an inspection of his residence to ensure adequate storage for firearms by March 20, 2020.    He is also prohibited from possessing any firearm, cross-bow, ammunition or explosive substance for a period of one year.

Create a public “step-by-step” guide and reference tool, outlining the review process for major developments in the park. Provide regular and consistent updates to the public on ongoing development projects. Post board meeting highlights to the PCC website. Assessing best practice examples of sub-lease/tenant agreement approvals to ensure conformity with the Master Plan. A full review of legislation and regulations that pertain to the PCC.   The majority of these initiatives are expected to be completed in the coming year, with many already in place. “The Provincial Capital Commission is committed to ensuring an open and transparent relationship with the residents of our province, one that is built on dialogue and communication with the public,” CEO of the Provincial Capital Commission Monique Goffinet Miller said. “I am confident these steps will help ensure that Wascana Centre continues to be a first-class destination within our province and the centerpiece of our provincial capital.”  Canadian National Institute for the Blind – Project Update The project had been previously suspended in the spring of 2019 to accommodate the Provincial Auditor and her review. In December 2019, the Provincial Auditor outlined several recommendations as part of a regular annual audit process, calling on the PCC to improve aspects of its internal processes, transparency and public consultation practices. After careful consideration and review of the Provincial Auditor’s recommendations, the PCC Board has decided to allow the continuation of the Canadian National Institute for the Blind project within Wascana Centre. It will continue on in the 38-stage process for new developments in Wascana Centre, where they were before the project was put on hold.  This continuation is dependent on the following conditions:  The proponent shows how all land-use would be compliant to the five pillars of the Wascana Centre Master Plan. The proponent is also asked to conduct additional public communications and engagement to discuss the benefits of the project and engage regarding the land-use of the complete building rather than just the CNIB portion of the building.  The PCC as the regulator has asked the proponent to meet these expectations and we look forward to hearing from the Canadian National Institute for the Blind and Architectural Advisory Committee regarding this project.  The proponent is currently at step 23 of the 38-step checklist for all new developments in Wascana Centre. This checklist is publicly available on the PCC website. -30- For more information, contact:     Jonathan Tremblay             Provincial Capital Commission             Regina             Phone: 306-787-6156             Email: jonathan.tremblay@gov.sk.ca       PCC-Report-to-the-Minister Proponent-Development-Checklist "

Although well below normal snowfall accumulations have occurred to date over the southern portion of the province, near normal snowmelt runoff is expected over these areas because of an extremely wet fall.  Throughout the fall, most of southern Saskatchewan received precipitation well above normal, with the wettest areas being around Swift Current and the Souris River Basin. While wet conditions at freeze-up increase the runoff potential during the spring melt, it does not guarantee that a flood will occur. In central and northern Saskatchewan, below normal spring runoff is expected across most areas because of near normal moisture at freeze-up, combined with below normal winter precipitation. Only some northern areas, particularly around Cluff Lake, have received near normal winter precipitation to date. Last summer saw near to above normal rainfall, which alleviated the dry conditions experienced throughout most of the grain belt last spring. The only areas where drier than normal conditions still existed at freeze-up were around Kindersley, between Saskatoon and Prince Albert, and a small area northeast of Yorkton extending to the Manitoba border. While conditions over much of the south were wetter than normal last fall, conditions were not as wet as the falls of 2010 and 2016.  Precipitation amounts are predicted to be near normal across the province for February, March, and April. However, the spring runoff outlook could change as there is potentially another 8-10 weeks of winter remaining. The first spring runoff forecast will be issued early in March. -30- For more information, contact:     Patrick Boyle             Water Security Agency             Moose Jaw             Phone: 306-694-8914             Email: Patrick.Boyle@wsask.ca             Cell: 306-631-6997      "

Financial Literacy 20 and 30 was piloted by 20 teachers in 12 school divisions and two First Nation education authorities. “Our Government wants to ensure Saskatchewan’s students are provided with relevant and practical curricula that will prepare them for their futures,” Deputy Premier and Education Minister Gordon Wyant said. “Developing additional opportunities for all Saskatchewan students to learn and improve upon their financial literacy empowers them to manage their money effectively, and will be of significant benefit to students throughout their lives.”  The Financial Literacy 20 and 30 electives can be used to fulfill the Practical and Applied Arts/Arts Education requirement for high school graduation. Teachers in grades 7 to 9 are able to introduce financial literacy to their students by using content from this curriculum in middle level Practical and Applied Arts courses. Financial Literacy 20 and 30 addresses financial topics and decisions that students may already be facing while highlighting others they are likely to face within the first few years of leaving high school. It also touches upon more complex topics such as home ownership, debt management and planning for the future, which are part of a lifelong financial journey. The areas of focus for Financial Literacy 20, 30 are:  earning – receiving money and/or resources as recognition for paid or unpaid work; saving – purposefully setting aside resources for future use and/or enjoyment spending – consciously using resources to enhance the well-being of self and others; borrowing – taking something on loan, with a promise of returning it, or its equivalent, often at a higher value, by a specific time; sharing – giving of one’s skills, abilities, time or resources to enhance the well-being of community and self; investing – engaging in reflective decision-making for future benefit; and, protecting – recognizing, appreciating and maintaining the value and worth of oneself, community resources and the environment.   ""Saskatchewan’s school boards recognize the importance of financial literacy and our members passed a resolution in support of developing elective personal finance classes for high school students,” President of the Saskatchewan School Boards Association Dr. Shawn Davidson said. “In our recent engagements with more than 10,000 people as part of the developing a shared vision for the future of education in Saskatchewan, we heard a clear desire from students, families and communities for increased opportunities to learn life skills such as budgeting and money management. We welcome the availability of these classes across the province.” Boards of education will determine what schools will offer these classes within their division, supporting the local needs of their students.  -30- For more information, contact:     Chris Hodges              Education             Regina             Phone: 306-787-1069             Email: chris.hodges@gov.sk.ca             Cell: 306-533-7506         2020-49 - Financial Literacy Now Available - News Release - French  "

Experience the beauty of Saskatchewan lakes this winter during the province’s annual winter free fishing weekend, from February 15-17.  “Fishing is a tremendously popular activity in Saskatchewan, with more than 250,000 anglers annually,” Environment Minister Dustin Duncan said. “Free fishing weekend is a perfect opportunity to get outside with family and friends to enjoy our province’s natural resources.”  Saskatchewan residents and visitors may fish any waterbody that has an open sport fishing season without buying a fishing licence. All other regulations remain in effect, including possession limits and reduced limits on some lakes and rivers. Free fishing weekend does not apply in national parks, and anyone planning to take fish out of the province must buy a licence. The Ministry of Environment reminds anglers to always put safety first when going out on the ice. Use caution and common sense, including testing ice thickness before travelling on it. A minimum of 10 cm of good ice is required for walking and 30 cm for light vehicle travel.

The mission aims to expand and strengthen trade, research and investment ties with some of the province’s long-standing partners. The mission will also increase understanding of the South Asian and Middle Eastern markets’ agri-food needs.  “The United Arab Emirates and Bangladesh are both priority markets and represent over $500 million in combined agri-food exports in 2018. While we have encountered some recent trade barriers in India, it is traditionally a major export destination for our pulses,” Minister of Agriculture David Marit said. “Saskatchewan remains a reliable supplier of safe, high-quality agri-food products. It is important we continue to look into new opportunities and ensure we have markets open to our products.”  Saskatchewan currently exports 43 per cent of the world’s lentils, 32 per cent of the world’s dry peas and 24 per cent of the global supply of canola seed. In 2018, Saskatchewan was the United Arab Emirates’ largest supplier of canola seed and accounted for 35 per cent of the country’s imports. Saskatchewan is Bangladesh’s top supplier of canola seed and second largest supplier of wheat, lentils, and dry peas. Over the last five years, Saskatchewan agri-food exports to India have averaged over $855 million. India is the world’s second-most populous country and Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. Both markets continue to be leading consumers of plant-based proteins, such as pulses. Marit will begin his trip in Dubai, then travel to Dhaka and finally Mumbai and Lonavala for the fifth biennial Pulses Conclave. While attending the Conclave, Marit will deliver a keynote speech regarding Saskatchewan’s pulse production and further opportunities for improved trade relations between Canada and India.  The mission delegation will also include representation from the Saskatchewan Trade and Export Partnership and the Global Institute for Food Security at the University of Saskatchewan to highlight research ties between Canada and Bangladesh.  -30- For more information, contact:     Charlotte McGraw             Agriculture             Regina             Phone: 306-787-4031             Email: charlotte.mcgraw@gov.sk.ca       "

The COF delegation includes New Brunswick Premier Blaine Higgs, Québec Premier François Legault, Ontario Premier Doug Ford, and Alberta Premier Jason Kenney. “The NGA meeting presents a significant opportunity for premiers to strengthen relationships with our sub-national counterparts in the United States,” said Moe. “Advocating for an even stronger trade relationship between Canada and the U.S. and further integrating the nature of our North American supply chains is key to increasing our economic competitiveness.”  The 2020 NGA Winter Meeting focuses on the topic of Domestic and International Innovations for Modernizing America’s Infrastructure, an initiative of NGA Chair and Governor of Maryland Larry Hogan. Premier Moe and the COF delegation will engage with U.S. Governors and NGA delegates in a plenary session focused on infrastructure where Premiers will highlight best practices in Canada’s approach to infrastructure innovation. The COF mission to the American capital comes on the heels of the American ratification of the USMCA, a significant free-trade deal that is vital for the health of Saskatchewan’s trade and export reliant economy.  “Saskatchewan exports 55 per cent of our total exports to the United States,” Moe said. “With the American ratification of the USMCA, Saskatchewan will be thanking leaders and decision makers in the United States Administration, Senate, and Congress for the bi-partisan effort to ratify this important deal. It is crucial that we continue to gain momentum in building our relationship with our most important trading partner while we continue to push Canadian parliamentarians for the swift ratification of this deal in Canada.” While in Washington, Premier Moe will hold meetings with a number of members of the U.S. Administration and Congress along with attending a number of bilateral meetings with U.S. Governors representing states of strategic importance to Saskatchewan. The Premier will join Alberta Premier Kenney in a discussion at the Wilson Centre’s Canada Institute titled The Premiers’ Perspective: A Canada-U.S. Relations Outlook for the New Decade. In 2018, Saskatchewan exported $16.9 billion worth of goods to the United States, representing 55% of Saskatchewan’s total exports. In addition, Saskatchewan imported $9.9 billion worth of goods from the United States.  -30- For more information, contact:     Jim Billington             Executive Council             Regina             Phone: 3067870425             Email: jim.billington@gov.sk.ca      "

Following a Request for Proposals (RFP) in early 2019 and a rigorous evaluation process, the SHA selected Emmanuel Villa Personal Care Home in Emerald Park and Brightwater Senior Living in Regina as the successful partners to open 100 new community long-term care spaces.  They will be offered to residents of Regina Pioneer Village whose needs can be met in the facilities, as well as to those currently approved for a long-term care bed in the Regina area.   “Opening these 100 new community beds is an innovative way to meet the immediate need for long-term care beds in Regina area,” Executive Director of the Community Care Branch of the Ministry of Health Brad Havervold said. “This community partnership will help ensure people continue to receive the level of care they need while staying close to home.” The new long-term care beds will improve long-term care capacity in the Regina area and help address infrastructure challenges at Regina Pioneer Village.  This continues the phased moves that began last spring when some residents of Regina Pioneer Village relocated to Wascana Rehabilitation Centre.   There will be processes in place for residents to express their interest in these new spaces and be assessed to determine if their care needs can be met in this innovative environment.   “Each personal care home has an agreement with the SHA that clearly defines quality of care expectations for the home,” Director of Continuing Care at the SHA Lorri Carlson said.  “Our primary concern is addressing the long-term care capacity issues in Regina, while maintaining a high standard of care for residents.  We have employees dedicated to ensuring homes follow the agreement and to address any concerns or questions that may arise during the life of the project.”   “Having an opportunity to help address the need for more long-term care spaces and be a part of this innovative partnership with the health authority is extremely important to us,” Chief Executive Officer of Emmanuel Villa Personal Care Home Adebunmi Onasanya said.  “Just as important is giving local residents another choice for safe, high quality care that’s close to their home, their family and loved ones.”   The community beds will be in place for a minimum of two years with potential for extension, while planning continues for the future of Regina Pioneer Village.   -30-   For more information, contact:       Colleen Book              Ministry of Health             Regina             Phone: 306-787-4083              Email: Colleen.book@health.gov.sk.ca   Lisa Thomson              Saskatchewan Health Authority             Regina             Phone: 306-539-4617             Email: lisa.thomson@saskhealthauthority.ca      "

PPAC is a cabinet committee formed to review and assess the viability of pipeline projects in Saskatchewan and possible government involvement in investing, stimulating, or generally advancing these projects. “Our government recognizes the necessity of further developing pipeline infrastructure to help our energy products reach key global markets,” said Premier Moe. “I am pleased to announce this cabinet committee to assess the viability of pipeline project proposals in Saskatchewan and the opportunity for our government to invest or support future pipeline projects.” The decision to establish the PPAC stems from a number of proposals from businesses, indigenous groups, and communities that are looking at pipeline projects to advance access for Saskatchewan’s energy products to market. This includes projects expanding access south through the United States, and projects that would create access through the port of Churchill.  The PPAC will be comprised of the following cabinet ministers:  Minister of Finance Donna Harpauer Minister of Trade and Export Development Jeremy Harrison Minister of Energy and Resources Bronwyn Eyre Minister of Environment Dustin Duncan  Encouraging pipeline expansion and development within the province to enable the shipment of Saskatchewan oil through the U.S. and encouraging Indigenous equity participation in Saskatchewan pipeline projects were both goals set in Saskatchewan’s Growth Plan 2020-2030.  -30- For more information, contact:     Jim Billington             Executive Council             Regina             Phone: 306-787-0425             Email: jim.billington@gov.sk.ca      "

The Premier also addressed the ongoing labour dispute between Unifor 594 and Federated Co-op Limited (FCL), offering the conditional appointment of a special mediator if Unifor 594 ceases illegal activities immediately. Overall funding under the municipal revenue sharing program will increase to a record of $278 million next fiscal year – a total increase of $27 million in 2020-21. The amount represents a nearly 11 per cent increase in 2020-21 from the current fiscal year, and is almost a 119 per cent increase from the 2007-08 fiscal year.  “This massive investment will position municipalities across Saskatchewan for the new decade of growth and to continue making key investments in their communities,” said Premier Moe. “Municipal revenue sharing has provided municipalities a stable and predictable source of provincial revenue, and I am proud to continue our commitment to supporting key local priorities that help lay the foundation for a growing Saskatchewan.”  During his address to SUMA delegates, the Premier also announced that the Government of Saskatchewan would appoint a special mediator in the ongoing labour dispute between Unifor 594 and FCL, on the condition that Unifor 594 agrees to cease all illegal activities, including removing the unlawful barricades immediately. “As Premier I will act on options available under the labour laws of our province, starting with the conditional  appointment of a special mediator,” said Moe. “I will appoint a special mediator today – a tool available to me under the labour laws of Saskatchewan – if and only if Unifor 594 follows the law. It is my strong belief that a negotiated settlement is in the best interests of both parties, and by removing the barricades and accepting the assistance of a special mediator in the negotiations, I believe both parties will be well served.” The Premier also stated that if Unifor did not accept this offer, that it is his expectation that the Regina Police Service uphold the law, enforce the court order, and remove the barricades at the Co-op Refinery. This will ensure that important fuel is supplied to communities across Saskatchewan that use diesel to heat homes in the winter, for school buses to transport kids, for emergency vehicles such as ambulances and fire trucks, and for industries that drive our economy such as agriculture and mining. Municipal Revenue Sharing Background: The Government of Saskatchewan’s municipal revenue sharing program is based on three quarters of one point of the provincial sales tax (PST) revenue collected from the fiscal year two years prior to the current year. As introduced last year, $1.5 million from the total municipal revenue sharing program will also be invested in the Targeted Sector Support Initiative for municipalities. The initiative is co-managed with municipal partners to support innovative ideas from municipalities that advance priority areas, such as good governance, regional planning, and inter-community collaboration. With this announcement, Saskatchewan municipalities have overall been allocated more than $3.1 billion in provincial funding through the revenue sharing program from 2007-08 to 2020-21. More details will be available when the provincial budget is released.  -30- For more information, contact:     Jim Billington             Executive Council             Regina             Phone: 306-787-0425             Email: jim.billington@gov.sk.ca      "

This year’s theme is “50 years of French Immersion, 50 years of the Official Languages Act.”  Over the last 10 years, enrolment in French Immersion programming around the province has risen by 30 per cent, with more than 16,500 students enrolled in French Immersion programs for the 2019-20 school year. “It is wonderful to see so many students learning French from an early age,” Deputy Premier and Minister of Education Gordon Wyant said. “French Immersion is one of the many opportunities students have to learn a second language, enhance their communication skills and gain the benefits that come with being bilingual.” There are now 77 schools offering French Immersion programming in the province. In the 2019-20 school year, Saskatoon’s École Silverspring School began offering French Immersion to accommodate increasing enrolment in the city. French Immersion programming has also expanded in schools around the province, including the addition of Grade 2 at École Traditions Elementary in Warman, Grade 6 at École Lumsden Elementary, Grade 8 at École Dundonald School in Saskatoon, Grade 10 at Greenall High School in Balgonie, and Grade 12 added at Carpenter High School in Meadow Lake. “With the French Immersion program taking root in Saskatchewan more than 50 years ago now, the steady enrolment growth we are seeing reflects the high value an increasing number of parents are placing on official bilingualism and is another terrific example of how we all connect as Canadians,” President of Canadian Parents for French – Saskatchewan Janet Loseth said. “CPF-SK is proud to organize this annual proclamation and last year more than 5,800 students participated in celebrating French-Second-Language Education Week around the province. We acknowledge all our partners who are creating lifelong opportunities for our youth during this week and throughout the year.” French Immersion allows students the opportunity to learn French as a second language, with French used for a large part of the school day and as the language of instruction for most courses. Students who are in French Immersion become proficient in English while also developing a strong foundation in French. School boards make requests to the ministry annually to designate schools and grades offering French Immersion programming based on their local needs.  Additional funding is provided to school divisions to support the purchase of resources for Immersion programming. An additional $3.4 million is being provided for French Immersion programs around the province in 2019-20. The Ministry of Education also supports French Immersion programming through the development of curricula and resources. Recently developed resources, including Treaty resource kits, are available in both French and English. Saskatchewan schools offering French second language programs also benefit from funding from the Canada-Saskatchewan Agreement on Minority-Language Education and Second-Language Instruction. In 2018-19, about $6.3 million in federal-provincial funding was allocated to various organizations and school divisions to support French second language instruction in Saskatchewan’s K-12 schools. French Immersion is one of three main options available to learn French in Saskatchewan’s Kindergarten to Grade 12 education system. Another 31,000 students around the province are enrolled in a Core French second-language program, where French is taught as an individual class, and the Conseil des écoles fransaskoises offers French first-language education to more than 1,900 students around the province.

561,2020-01-30,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/january/30/scammers,Government Website,Protect Yourself: Don't Be Scammed Twice," Released on January 30, 2020 The Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority of Saskatchewan (FCAA) is alerting the public that some individuals who have already been impacted by a scam may be targeted again.   The “recovery pitch” scam and the “victim list” scam may be happening in the province.    The “recovery pitch” scam involves a consumer or investor that has previously lost money in a fraudulent situation.  Scammers will target these individuals with the claim that they will be able to recover all or some of the funds lost in the previous scheme.  Sometimes the caller is the person who scammed the individual in the first place.  The scam artist may claim to be a member of law enforcement or other type of authority to gain credibility.    The “victim list” scam involves a list that is shared or sold among various underground scam artists.  When a consumer or investor has been scammed and shares money or even personal information with a scam artist, the person’s name is added to a “victim list”.  These scammers will contact the individuals on the list with various pitches in the hopes they will fall victim again.    “Be wary of anyone claiming they will be able to recover your money that was lost on a previous investment or scam,” Deputy Director of Enforcement with FCAA Harvey White said.  “Whether someone contacts you directly, or you happen across a recovery website on your own, anyone proposing to get back your money from a previous scam, should be treated with caution.  Typically, it is all but impossible to recover money lost on an investment scam.  While it may be tempting to work with these folks, who tend to promise large settlements in exchange for small fees, we urge you to be cautious of such claims.  If something sounds too good to be true, it often is.”  Here are some red flags to watch out for:  Being contacted out of the blue.  Promises that sound too good to be true. Being pressured to act quickly.   Unusual payment methods.   Tips to protect yourself:  Do not talk to people calling out of the blue claiming they can get your money back.   If someone calls, emails or texts asking for your banking information, do not give it to them.    Take time to think things through, regardless of what promises they make to try to entice you.  Always be cautious and seek advice from a professional advisor.  Never agree to anything you do not understand.    Be suspicious if you are asked to pay with gift cards, bitcoin or other digital currency.    If you have been contacted by someone offering to recover lost money, contact the Securities Division at 306-787-5936.     For more information about scams and how to spot red flags visit: https://fcaa.gov.sk.ca/consumers-investors-pension-plan-members/investors/investment-fraud.    -30-  For more information, contact:  Shannon McMillan Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority Regina Phone: 306-798-4160 Email: shannon.mcmillan@gov.sk.ca "

This proclamation recognizes that there’s no place for racism in Saskatchewan.  The date marks the tremendous loss that took place on January 29, 2017 when six Canadian Muslim men lost their lives and many were gravely injured in a shooting at a mosque in Quebec City.  “Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our country,” Justice Minister and Attorney General Don Morgan said. “We must all stand together against all forms of hatred and intolerance, and work together to promote inclusion and acceptance.”  The proclamation was requested by Regina and Saskatoon based chapters of the Islamic Association of Saskatchewan and is supported by additional faith-based groups.   “January 29 will forever be marked by the odious shooting at a Quebec City Mosque,” the Islamic Association of Saskatchewan said.  “By proclaiming this day as a provincial Day of Action Against Hate and Intolerance, the Government of Saskatchewan has taken a principled stand in solidarity with those who suffer and against those who would seek to divide our nation with hate and intolerance and has reaffirmed our province's motto: ‘Multis e gentibus vires, from many peoples, strength’.”  “I am proud to support the Day of Action Against Hate and Intolerance on behalf of the Saskatoon Jewish community,” Rabbi Claudio Jodorkovsky said.  “The religious institutions in Saskatoon are like a family, we are all connected.  Our community will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with all faiths and cultures to challenge intolerance.”  “Our spiritual commitment and energy must compel us all to build trust, respect, and relationship in a world that can fall too easy to fearful and hateful responses of disrespect and violence,” Bishop Mark Hagemoen said. “Let us choose wisely not only the higher path, but the lasting one.”    “The members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama’at Saskatoon are very grateful to the Government of Saskatchewan for recognition and reassurance that hate has no place in our society,” Mubarik Syed with the Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama’at said.  “Islam is a religion of peace, love, and harmony.  This is why the Ahmadiyya Muslim Jama'at believes and practices the motto 'Love for all, hatred for none'.”   -30-  For more information, contact:  Jennifer Graham Justice Regina Phone: 306-787-8621 Email: jennifer.graham@gov.sk.ca "

566,2020-01-27,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/january/27/road-fatalities,Government Website,Saskatchewan Posts Lowest Number Of Road Fatalities In Recorded History," Released on January 27, 2020 Drivers Encouraged To Help Bring That Number Even Lower In 2020  Fewer people were killed on Saskatchewan roads in 2019 than in any single year since records started being kept in the 1950s.  SGI’s preliminary statistics indicate 71* people were killed in collisions in 2019.  Over the preceding 10 years (2009-2018) Saskatchewan averaged nearly 140 road fatalities per year.  Previously, the record low was 73, which occurred in 1951 when there was about a quarter the number of registered vehicles on the roads as there is today.  “This number makes it clear that many Saskatchewan people have decided that it is no longer acceptable for this province to hold a different record, and one that we held not that many years ago, where we had the highest number of road fatalities in Canada,” Minister Responsible for SGI Joe Hargrave said.  “I want to thank all Saskatchewan residents who are working to make our roads safer, and I’d like to particularly acknowledge the work by law enforcement, media, and families affected by distracted or impaired driving.  “However, collisions are preventable and even one traffic death is too many.  We can’t celebrate when people are still being killed and injured on our roads.”  As SGI reported in August (https://www.sgi.sk.ca/news?title=progress-report--fewer-road-injuries-and-fatalities-in-2018-compared-to-10-year-average) of last year when releasing preliminary 2018 numbers, fatalities and injuries caused by traffic collisions continue to decrease in Saskatchewan, particularly those caused by impaired driving, distracted driving, speeding and improper seatbelt use.  More enforcement, targeted legislation and powerful awareness efforts contribute to this, but it ultimately comes down to drivers making good decisions.  “When people make the decision to drive safely, it literally saves lives,” SGI President and CEO Andrew Cartmell said.  “If you are one of the drivers who still chooses to take risks like texting while you’re driving, driving when you’re impaired or driving at unsafe speeds, you are now in the minority.  We ask you change your habits and become part of making this the province with the safest roads in Canada.”  The Government of Saskatchewan, SGI and law enforcement ask everyone to keep one thing in mind throughout 2020, and beyond: Take care out there. *The 2019 number is considered preliminary, based on data available from police forces in Saskatchewan, and may be adjusted.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Tyler McMurchy Saskatchewan Government Insurance Regina Phone: 306-751-1837 Email: tmcmurchy@sgi.sk.ca Cell: 306-535-6207              "

569,2020-01-23,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/january/23/pipeline-regulations,Government Website,Saskatchewan Modernizes Pipeline Regulations," Released on January 23, 2020 Province Introduces The First Electronic Pipeline Registry In Canada  The Government of Saskatchewan is modernizing and strengthening its regulatory oversight of oil and gas pipeline infrastructure in the province, with the proclamation of the Pipelines Amendment Act, 2019 (the Act).    “This is the culmination of several years work and delivers on our promise, made in 2017, to ensure that Saskatchewan citizens and our environment are protected to the highest standard,” Energy and Resources Minister Bronwyn Eyre said.  “The introduction of substantial enhancements to our pipeline licensing system will also provide more efficiency and regulatory certainty for our oil and gas sector.”   In recent years, the province has enhanced regulatory systems to monitor and review pipeline construction and operations, with more stringent inspection, investigation, penalty and audit powers.      The new Act and regulations will expand regulatory oversight to include retroactive licensing of approximately 80,000 flowlines across the province over the next four years and more stringent scrutiny of applications at higher-risk locations, such as waterways.  With these changes, the Ministry of Energy and Resources has fully addressed all outstanding issues raised by the Provincial Auditor regarding the integrity and safety of pipelines in Saskatchewan.   This is the first system of its kind in Canada to adopt an entirely electronic registry of pipeline licensing and administration.  The Act establishes a new module in the Integrated Resource Information System (IRIS) for an Online license registry, similar to the Saskatchewan Land Titles Registry, which will issue and administer licenses for the oil, gas and mining sectors.   “In developing the pipeline regulatory framework, the Government of Saskatchewan worked to ensure both regulatory efficiency and predictability for operators,” Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) Vice-President of Western Canada Operations, Brad Herald said.  “The new pipeline module, with its Online licensing registry, highlights the province’s commitment to monitoring and upholding the highest standards of safety for the public and the environment; standards that are also continuing priorities for industry.”  The new system will also streamline the review of applications and reduce the time required for routine approvals.  In addition, the introduction of administrative penalties will complete the overall compliance framework tied to pipeline regulation.  The Pipelines Administration and Licensing Regulations are now in effect, along with Directive PNG034: Saskatchewan Pipelines Code, which clarifies and enhances requirements set out in previous regulations.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Deb Young Energy and Resources Regina Phone: 306-787-4765 Email: deb.young@gov.sk.ca "
570,2020-01-23,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/january/23/solid-waste-management-strategy,Government Website,Saskatchewan Develops New Strategy To Manage And Reduce Waste," Released on January 23, 2020 Environment Minister Dustin Duncan released a new Solid Waste Management Strategy for the province today.  This strategy is a starting point to providing a practical and sustainable solid waste management system to achieve specific goals over the next 20 years.  Used packaging, food scraps, electronics, plastic, paper and scrap materials are a few examples of solid waste.  Saskatchewan produces the second-highest amount of waste per capita in Canada – an amount equivalent to each resident of the province generating about 842 kilograms of waste.  This is roughly the weight of 60 regular household bags of garbage per person per year.  The strategy was developed in an effort to change that statistic and move toward more responsible waste management.  “This strategy is about working together to address the ongoing challenges of waste management and to identify potential new economic opportunities for industry,” Duncan said.  “This is important because the status quo is unsustainable and the province needs a comprehensive and strategic action plan to address the unique challenges posed by solid waste management.”    Since 2018, a Solid Waste Management Advisory Committee engaged extensively with stakeholders, which led to a list of recommendations for government to consider when developing the strategy.  The strategy outlines six goals to reduce the amount of waste generated per person by 30 per cent by 2030, and 50 per cent by 2040, based on 2014 baseline levels.   The six goals are to:  Enhance education, awareness and technical understanding of waste management best practices and the risks of improper practices across Saskatchewan; Encourage regional collaboration to enhance the cost effectiveness of waste management infrastructure; Foster innovative and sustainable solutions to manage waste; Demonstrate government leadership in waste management; Provide a modern, efficient and effective regulatory system for waste disposal and management; and Enhance waste diversion across Saskatchewan.  Meeting these targets will require dedicated efforts to educate and better inform waste management decisions by all Saskatchewan residents.  It will also require innovation and local solutions to better understand the value of the province's waste as a resource, and build upon the success of Saskatchewan's established recycling and waste stewardship programs.  “It’s no secret that waste is an issue in Saskatchewan and around the world,” Solid Waste Management Advisory Committee Chair Richard (Porky) Porter said.  “This strategy is a significant start and will help our province develop policies and programs to address a number of ongoing challenges related to waste management.”  Effective waste management is essential to responsible growth.  The Solid Waste Management Strategy aligns with Saskatchewan’s Growth Plan and will serve as the roadmap for waste reduction and management for the well-being of the province, its people and its future.  “We are pleased that education is a priority and encouraged by the focus on waste diversion and organics management,” Saskatchewan Waste Reduction Council Executive Director Joanne Fedyk said.  “We look forward to the implementation of the Solid Waste Management Strategy and applaud the provincial government for pursuing funding opportunities.”  Every Saskatchewan resident can contribute by generating less waste, recycling and composting.

The Government of Saskatchewan is encouraged by the positive results it is seeing at the 34 Saskatchewan schools that are participating in initiative.  Since FTV has been put into place in these classrooms, positive outcomes of the initiative include:  a 20 per cent increase in credit attainment; and an 11.8 per cent increase in three-year graduation rates.  “It is great to see the positive impact Following Their Voices has had on the students of our province,” Deputy Premier and Education Minister Gordon Wyant said.  “There are now more First Nations, Métis and Inuit students attaining more credits and graduating from high school than ever before.”  Following Their Voices offers support to teachers as they build strong and positive relationships with First Nations, Métis and Inuit students.  This is achieved by changing student-teacher relationships and interactions, changing how teachers instruct and what the classroom or learning environment looks and feels like.    The initiative partners with provincial and First Nation schools to provide ongoing training and support to school-based teams and teachers.  In addition, a broad representation of Saskatchewan First Nations and Métis Elders and Knowledge Keepers representing all the Indigenous language groups in the province provide ongoing engagement, advice and guidance.  Canoe Lake Miksiw School and Rossignol High School in Île-à-la-Crosse recently participated in a video highlighting the benefits of FTV in their schools and the positive impact it has had on staff, teachers and students.  Watch the video here at https://youtu.be/MnNW-7Vyr-w.  Canoe Lake Miksiw School became an FTV school in 2017.  Since then, Principal Arliss Coulineur has seen a noticeable change in teacher-student relationships and improved student participation and grades.  “I feel that I can best explain how the cultural responsiveness has changed with the implementation of Following Their Voices into the Canoe Lake Miksiw School,” Canoe Lake Miksiw School Principal Arliss Coulineur said.  “By using nehiyawewin-Cree language terminology, the spirit of our language, you can gain a sense of the relationship that is gained between the student and teacher.  “First word is tipeyimisowin: it means 'take charge of it'.  Taking charge of oneself.  Helping a student to manage oneself to the point that they can take charge of themselves and become an independent learner.  “Second word is kakehtawisowin: this refers to being like a wise old person.  Teachers recognize that students are intelligent beings.  The teacher brings out the strengths in their students by recognizing how each individual student learns and employs a variety of teaching practices to do so.  “Moving forward, this program has enabled the relationships between the students and our educators to begin, generate, and flourish.  Following Their Voices will always be a part of the culture of the Canoe Lake Miksiw School.”  Over the past five years, the FTV initiative has involved:  39 schools, including 26 provincial schools, 12 First Nation schools and one joint provincial and federal school; more than 1,000 participants, including 870 teachers and more than 130 school administrators; and approximately 36,000 students, with 14,000 self-declaring as First Nations, Métis or Inuit.  The Government of Saskatchewan has contributed $8.65 million to Following Their Voices since 2014.  In 2017, Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) committed $3.32 million to this initiative in a three-year funding agreement.  ISC staff members have also provided support to the initiative.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Chris Hodges Education Regina Phone: 306-787-1069 Email: chris.hodges@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-533-7506 "

Harrison is nominated for this year’s awards for creating Saskatchewan’s ‘Help Cut Red Tape’ web page, launched in January 2019.  The ‘Help Cut Red Tape’ web page is available to Saskatchewan citizens and businesses to provide feedback on how the province may offer services more effectively and efficiently.  Since inception, until the end of 2019, the web page had 2,684 visitors from outside of government and 44 red tape irritants submitted.  Nearly all submissions have either been resolved or forwarded to the appropriate Municipal or Federal government for consideration.  For example, one submission identified the need to streamline the appeal process under the Residential Tenancies Act that affected more than 8,000 appeals per year.  This red tape issue is now in the process of being resolved.  Action items in the Growth Plan to reduce red tape and regulatory burdens are aimed at encouraging businesses to expand and invest in the province.  In addition, the 2018-19 Regulatory Modernization Annual Report from government identified an achieved forecasted savings of $229.7 million over the next 10 years across government and Crown corporations.  Overall, this will contribute to the province’s main goal of increasing jobs by 100,000 and reaching 1.4 million people in population by 2030.   Specific red-tape reduction action items outlined in the Growth Plan include:  Appointing a business advisory panel from communities across the province to identify priorities for the Government of Saskatchewan’s Red Tape Reduction Committee; Address issues identified by individuals and businesses through the ‘Help Cut Red Tape’ web page; Keeping the province’s finances strong and investing in priorities such as infrastructure and health care, which are areas of concern for small businesses; and  Utilizing the Government of Saskatchewan’s Direct Cost Estimator to make informed decisions.

Caregivers who would like to start a licensed home-based child care business in Saskatchewan have access to:  grant money to help with start-up and food costs; training and workshops; assistance from educated child care consultants; and inclusion in government materials provided to parents seeking child care.

Additional housing initiatives include:  $570,000 to the YWCA Youth Mentorship project – six units of affordable housing for Prince Albert youth; Up to $495,000 to develop two single-family homes in Île-à-la-Crosse and Pinehouse under the Trades Training program; and $130,000 to Habitat for Humanity, through the Saskatchewan Priorities component of the National Housing Strategy, to construct two single-family homes, one in Melfort and one in Estevan.  Adam Vaughan, Member of Parliament for Spadina-Fort York and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development, on behalf of Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development, along with Social Services Minister and Minister Responsible for the Saskatchewan Housing Corporation (SHC) Paul Merriman, City of Regina Mayor Michael Fougere and Habitat for Humanity Regina Chief Executive Officer Kelly Holmes-Binns, made the announcements today.  “I’m thrilled to meet the families today who will soon call this new community home,” said Vaughan.  “Under Habitat’s vision, the Haultain Crossing development is making a significant impact in the lives of dozens of residents, positive change that could last for generations.  Our government is committed to supporting dedicated partners like Habitat through the National Housing Strategy, here and across the country, on housing initiatives that help make life more affordable for all Canadians.”  “Today’s announcements are part of our commitment to work with the federal government on the National Housing Strategy to provide safe and affordable housing to Saskatchewan people,” Merriman said.  “Together, we are pleased to support Habitat for Humanity’s vital mission to help vulnerable families build homes and communities across the province.  These initiatives are wonderful examples of partnerships in action to help Saskatchewan families find a place to call home and focus on their future.”  ""Support for Habitat is critical due to the ever-present need for affordable housing in Regina,” Fourgere said.  ""The Haultain Crossing project is a great example of the importance of having all levels of government support the work happening in local communities to provide affordable housing and eradicate homelessness.  I look forward to this kind of support continuing in the future as we work toward the implementation of our Plan To End Homelessness.”  “The Haultain Crossing project would not be possible without support from all three levels of government, donors, supporters and volunteers alike,” Holmes-Binns said.  “We honour these partnerships today and acknowledge our collective accomplishment – the completion of 45 homes to date and 17 homes remaining.  Thank you to everyone who continues to help provide a hand up to local low-income families through safe, decent and affordable homeownership.  Your support changes the lives of families in our communities.”  Quick Facts:  Located at 1033 Edgar Street, Haultain Crossing will contain 62 townhouse-style condominiums in Regina’s Eastview neighbourhood.  Together, the main and upper floors of each home will total 1,216 ft2 or 113 m2.  Homes assigned to larger families will have a partially finished basement. The Government of Canada, through Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), and the Government of Saskatchewan, through Saskatchewan Housing Corporation (SHC), are jointly contributing $675,000 to build these 11 homes through the Canada-Saskatchewan bilateral agreement under the National Housing Strategy. The City of Regina has provided funding of $15,000 for each of the units. Main private sponsors for these 11 units include: The Mosaic Company, Farm Credit Canada, Sherwood Co-op Gas and Food Stores and Co-op Refinery Complex. Habitat and the Trade and Skills Construction Apprenticeship Program (TASCAP) are partnering to engage and train high school students during the construction of these 11 homes.  Students receive on the job training and are on-site daily for an entire semester during construction.  Qualified instructors lead students through the build from the foundation up, while students earn credits through the program and apprenticeship hours that can be put toward future training in trades. The Government of Canada is currently rolling out its National Housing Strategy (NHS), an ambitious 10-year, $55 billion plan that will create 125,000 new housing units and lift 530,000 families out of housing need, as well as repair and renew more than 300,000 housing units and reduce chronic homelessness by 50 per cent. The province’s overall commitment to Habitat for Humanity totals more than $11.8 million since March 2009.  This total includes funding of $600,000 from the provincial Summit Action Fund. Habitat’s innovative delivery model provides opportunities for families to stabilize their housing and to achieve their homeownership goals.  Each partner family selected by Habitat contributes 500 partnering hours in building their home or other Habitat homes.  To learn more about Habitat for Humanity and their work across Saskatchewan, visit www.habitat.ca.

581,2020-01-14,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/january/14/cut-red-tape,Government Website,"Tax Filings Made Easier, Less Costly For Saskatchewan Businesses"," Released on January 14, 2020                  The government is continuing its efforts to cut red tape, making Saskatchewan more attractive for small- and medium-sized businesses.  As one of the first red-tape reduction initiatives of the new year, Saskatchewan is raising threshold amounts for businesses that file returns for the Provincial Sales Tax (PST), Liquor Consumption Tax (LCT), and Beverage Container Program.  In addition, due dates for electronic filers are being extended.  “These changes will make tax filings easier for Saskatchewan businesses and reduce their administrative costs,” Red Tape Reduction Committee Chair Gene Makowsky said on behalf of Finance Minister Donna Harpauer.  “The changes also provide more incentive for businesses to switch to electronic filing.”  Effective April 1, 2020:  the threshold for annual filing of PST, LCT, and beverage container returns will increase to $4,800 (from $3,600); the threshold for quarterly filing will increase to a range of $4,800 to $12,000 (from $3,600 to $7,200); and the threshold for monthly filing will increase to $12,000 (from $7,200).  Once the changes take effect, more than 4,600 Saskatchewan businesses will be able to file their returns less frequently.   The Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) is pleased with the changes.  “Red tape at all levels of government continues to be a top concern of business owners in Saskatchewan and across Canada,” CFIB Vice-President (Western Canada and Agri-business) Marilyn Braun-Pollon said.  “The Saskatchewan Government has taken major strides to reduce red tape in recent years, and we applaud these latest measures to make things easier for business owners in the province.” Beginning with the April 2020 tax return, due dates for PST, Liquor Tax and the beverage container program will be extended from the 20th to the last of the month for businesses that file and pay electronically.  Businesses that file on paper will continue to have a due date of the 20th of the month following the end of the reporting period.  Businesses are encouraged to sign up for Saskatchewan eTax Services (SETS) at www.sets.saskatchewan.ca.   “The due date extension gives businesses more time to collect and complete their returns, and aligns due dates with the federal GST,” Makowsky said.  “For monthly filers, this allows businesses to complete their book work once at the end of the month, rather than twice a month.”  Based on calculations using the government’s Direct Cost Estimator, these changes will save Saskatchewan businesses more than 11 per cent of their administrative costs related to the filing of PST, LCT, and beverage container returns.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Jeff Welke Finance Regina  Phone: 306-787-6046 Email: jeff.welke@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-536-1185 "

Communities included in the second round of auctions are the Rural Municipality (RM) of Blucher, Carlyle, RM of Corman Park, Esterhazy, Gull Lake, RM of Kindersley, Langham, RM of Longlaketon, Regina Beach, RM of Shellbrook, Unity and White City.  “There was strong interest during the initial online auction for permits that concluded in December,” Minister Responsible for the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority Gene Makowsky said.  “The auction process has worked well and ensures that available liquor permits in the province are allocated efficiently and transparently.”  Each auction will have an opening bid of $1,000 and interested bidders are required to register at www.McDougallBay.com, which is the website where all bidding will take place.  More information about the auction process can be found at www.slga.com.  The availability of permits is determined by the population of a community and the number of current retailers operating.  A community must have a minimum population of 500 to be eligible for a retail liquor permit.  An auction will only occur if someone expresses interest in a community where there is an available retail store permit.  In cases where there is more than one permit available in a community/RM, the auction will determine the applicant for one permit only.  Future auctions will be held for additional available permits.  The winning bidder must also meet all terms associated with holding a liquor permit.  Further auctions will be held over the next few months until all current expressions of interest are addressed.  After the initial rounds, auctions will take place on a quarterly basis, if interest is expressed in a community where there is at least one available permit.  -30-  For more information, contact:  David Morris Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority Regina Phone: 306-787-1721 Email: dmorris@slga.gov.sk.ca "

The ADF program is supported through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership, a five-year, $388 million investment in strategic initiatives for Saskatchewan agriculture by the federal and provincial governments.  “Producers reap huge rewards from the new knowledge and discoveries developed by research – they become more profitable and more productive,” said Bibeau.  “By investing in applied research relevant to Saskatchewan producers’ needs, we are increasing the competitiveness of our industry.”  “We’re strategically investing in crop-related research that will increase our industry capacity, driving toward our goal of increasing crop production to 45 million metric tonnes,” Marit said.  “The research we’re investing in includes projects that explore how to manage clubroot, mitigate herbicide resistance and add value to our commodities.  These projects will support producers and agribusinesses and help secure our place as a world leader in agriculture research.”  Support for ADF projects is awarded on a competitive basis to researchers looking to examine areas of importance to Saskatchewan producers.  For example, a project co-funded with Western Grains Research Foundation and SaskWheat looks at new visual analytics tools for improved crop breeding tools.  In addition to funding provided by the federal and provincial governments, projects supported through the ADF are also receiving $8.7 million in funding from the following partners: Western Grains Research Foundation, Saskatchewan Canola Development Commission, Saskatchewan Wheat Development Commission, Saskatchewan Barley Development Commission, Alberta Wheat and Barley Commission, Manitoba Wheat and Barley Growers Association, Saskatchewan Flax Development Commission, Saskatchewan Forage Seed Development Commission, Saskatchewan Cattlemens’ Association, Genome Canada, and the Canadian Wheat Research Coalition.  “We continue to see tremendous value in a collaborative approach to funding research,” Western Grains Research Foundation (WGRF) Board Chair Terry Young said.  “WGRF partners with producer commodity organizations and government funding agencies to maximize the investment farmers are making in crop research.  WGRF is excited about the potential impact these projects can have for western Canadian farmers.”  For more information, including a full list of funded projects, please visit www.saskatchewan.ca and search “Agriculture Development Fund”.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Megan Burns Agriculture  Regina Phone: 306-787-5155 Email: megan.burns@gov.sk.ca  Cell: 306-536-3851  Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Ottawa Phone: 1-866-345-7972  Email: aafc.mediarelations-relationsmedias.aac@canada.ca "

586,2020-01-13,Canada,Saskatchewan,,https://www.saskatchewan.ca/government/news-and-media/2020/january/13/clubroot-survey,Government Website,Updated Saskatchewan Clubroot Distribution Map Released," Released on January 13, 2020 Today, the Government of Saskatchewan and SaskCanola released an updated version of the Saskatchewan Clubroot Distribution Map, which outlines the rural municipalities (RMs) where clubroot has been identified. Since 2017, visible symptoms of clubroot have been confirmed in 51 commercial canola fields.  This has increased by eight fields since the release of the map in January 2019.  In addition, the clubroot pathogen was detected in five fields without visible symptoms in 2019.  These results were compiled through ministry surveys or through reports or samples submitted to the ministry and SaskCanola by producers and agrologists.  “Clubroot awareness and management is of increasing importance for the agriculture industry,” Agriculture Minister David Marit said.  “We want to help farmers prevent further spread of the disease.  Knowing where clubroot exists in the province helps us do that.”  The ministry and SaskCanola offered farmers the opportunity to take home soil testing kits to fill and mail in for testing.  There were 180 kits submitted and sent to Discovery Labs, where they were tested for the clubroot pathogen.  Of these kits, four returned positive results.  Visible symptoms were also known to be present in two of the four fields.  SaskCanola covered the costs of testing the submitted kits.  “The soil testing kits were a big help in determining where in the province clubroot is located, and we’d like to thank all of the producers who took the time to send one in,” SaskCanola Board of Directors Chair Lane Stockbrugger said.  “With clubroot’s potential to negatively impact the canola industry, this survey is a very important investment for SaskCanola.  By actively participating in submitting soil samples, farmers are helping to ensure a stronger, more resilient sector for everyone.”  The key to managing clubroot, a declared pest under Saskatchewan’s Pest Control Act, is keeping pathogen levels as low as possible to minimize potential impact on canola yields.  A proactive and science-based clubroot management strategy should include the use of clubroot-resistant canola varieties in a minimum three-year rotation.  An extended crop rotation helps minimize yield losses while protecting the effectiveness of clubroot-resistant canola varieties.  More than 1,700 fields were tested as part of the survey during the summer and fall of 2019.  The landowners of all fields with visible clubroot symptoms or the presence of the clubroot pathogen have been contacted.  The locations of these fields have also been shared with the appropriate RM office if the RM has enacted a clubroot-specific bylaw.  The ministry is working with RMs and the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities to ensure a farmer-driven approach to clubroot management.  As part of this approach, the landowners and/or producers of fields with visible clubroot symptoms will be required to develop a clubroot management agreement.  This agreement must fit their production practice and include science-based clubroot management strategies for infected fields.  All clubroot-infested fields will be monitored by an appointed Pest Control Officer in subsequent years.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Charlotte McGraw Agriculture Regina Phone: 306-787-4031 Email: charlotte.mcgraw@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-526-7833              "

Applications for traffic safety grants are assessed against criteria focused on priority areas including intersection safety, aggressive driving, speeding and vulnerable road users.  Applications for new PSE locations need to demonstrate the proposed location is either high-risk, the site of frequent speed-related crashes, or is used by a high volume of vulnerable pedestrians.  Applicants also must demonstrate that previous measures have been unsuccessful.  Provincial Traffic Safety Fund grants are awarded twice annually, and applications for new PSE locations are evaluated once each year.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Tyler McMurchy Saskatchewan Government Insurance Regina Phone: 306-751-1837 Email: tmcmurchy@sgi.sk.ca Cell: 306-535-6207              "

Ashlyn George, the 2015 Saskatchewanderer will kick things off January 10.  On January 17 and January 24, the Saskatchewanderer social media channels will be taken over by two other past fan favourites.  In early February, the new 2020 Saskatchewanderer, who will continue showcasing our province until the end of the year, will be officially announced.    “The Saskatchewanderer program has been a very successful platform to feature our province as a great place to visit, live, play and work year-round,” Parks, Culture and Sport Minister and Minister Responsible for Tourism Saskatchewan Gene Makowsky said.  “I look forward to hearing about what some of our previous Wanderers are up to now and then following our 2020 Saskatchewanderer on his or her adventures.”  CAA continues as the official vehicle sponsor of the Saskatchewanderer, renewing its support annually since the program launched.  “It certainly is official,” CAA President and CEO Fred Titanich said.  “CAA Saskatchewan is very pleased to return as the vehicle sponsor of the Saskatchewanderer program.  We look forward to celebrating 10 years of exploring this great province with the Wanderer.  CAA Saskatchewan’s reputation as a successful business leader with 100 years of experience in the travel, insurance, roadside assistance and automotive maintenance sectors, certainly helps to profile the best that Saskatchewan has to offer.  On behalf of our board of directors, staff and valued members, we wish the 2020 Wanderer the very best in safe travels and excellent storytelling.”     Along with the new 2020 Saskatchewanderer, the announcement in February will also reveal a new title sponsor.  Through social media “teasers” the audience can start to guess which Saskatchewan business has come onboard to support the program.

The innovative approach supports professors and instructors at Saskatchewan Polytechnic, the University of Saskatchewan and the University of Regina to develop open textbooks and other open educational resources for students.  The initiative is expected to save current and future students at least $6.4 million with the resources developed so far.   “The Government of Saskatchewan supports innovation in the delivery of public programs and services,” Advanced Education Minister Tina Beaudry-Mellor said.  “We continue to invest in supports and affordability efforts that make a difference for post-secondary students.  Our province’s $1.25 million investment in the development of open text books over the past five years is helping reduce costs for approximately 70,000 students.  “This year marks the fifth consecutive year open textbook funding has been allocated to Saskatchewan’s three largest institutions.  Saskatchewan Polytechnic, the University of Saskatchewan and the University of Regina each received a $83,000 grant for 2019-20.”  Open textbooks benefit students by lowering costs, increasing access and enriching the quality of learning.  Faculty members benefit from the flexibility to tailor resources to their teaching styles, add local context and meet unique cultural needs.  -30-  For more information, contact:  Karen Prokopetz Advanced Education Regina Phone: 306-787-0279 Email: karen.prokopetz@gov.sk.ca Cell: 306-527-5231 "

These specialists join eight other SPSA staff already in Australia helping crews battle bushfires.  They will relieve those that deployed at the beginning of December as part of a Canadian contingent co-ordinated by the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC).  “Australia is in dire need of help and the Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency is more than willing to answer that call,” SPSA President Marlo Pritchard said.  “As a province well versed in evacuations and fighting wildfires, the province of Saskatchewan sends not only its assistance but also its heartfelt condolences to those affected by this tragedy.”  This is the third Saskatchewan deployment of Canadian firefighters to Australia under the Exchange of Wildland Fire Management Resources Agreement.  Canada has called on Australian firefighters four times since 2015.  The original group has been helping to manage wildland fire incidents in the areas around Glen Innes, Grafton, Casino and Kempsey in the northeastern part of the state.  The National Resource Sharing Centre in Melbourne requested assistance from Canadian wildfire agencies to fight bushfires along the east coast of Australia.  Canadian fire management staff are filling operational, planning and aviation roles.  A severe and early fire season in eastern Australia has led to fatalities, property loss and the destruction of large areas of New South Wales and Queensland.  Saskatchewan is a member of the CIFFC.  When appropriate, Canadian provincial wildfire agencies export firefighting resources at the request of other jurisdictions through mutual aid resource sharing agreements.

Some consumers may not ask the right questions or fully read the contract before signing up for a membership, and encounter problems later on regarding cancellation rights, membership packages, and extra programs and services included in a membership.   Here are some tips to consider before signing a gym membership contract:  Make sure you’ve read the entire contract and understand the terms and conditions.  By law, your gym contract must not exceed two years in length. Find out the total cost of your membership, including the regular fees for programs and services.  Remember to ask questions if you don’t understand something. Know that you have the right to cancel your contract within seven business days of receiving a written copy.  You may also be able to cancel if:      you move more than 30 km away from your home gym or one of its other locations; you experience material physical, medical, or mental changes supported by your medical practitioner that would make gym participation unreasonable; or there are material changes in the services being provided, or if the facility moves more than 10 km from its former location.
