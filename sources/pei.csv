0,2020-09-24,Canada,Prince Edward Island,,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/statement-premier-king-federal-speech-throne,Government Website,Statement by Premier King on Federal Speech from the Throne,"   Breaking      Prince Edward Island Premier Dennis King issued the following statement in response to the federal Throne Speech:  		  		“Collectively, as a federation, we need to continue to work together to ensure the safety and wellbeing of Canadians from the COVID-19 virus, while at the same time rebuilding our country. We can only do this if we work together as a country and as leaders. The Speech from the Throne shows that the federal government is willing to continue to invest in and support Canadians at a time when there is so much uncertainty ahead. For the past six months during our weekly First Minister’s calls, I have been advocating for supports that will help Islanders navigate these challenging times, and I am pleased to see reference to these issues. These supports include the extension of the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS), sector specific funding for industries such as tourism, increased funding for expanding access to high speed internet, and the need to modernize our employment insurance program. These supports will help communities, businesses, and everyday Islanders in the months ahead. As we rebuild as a country, we need to commit to a more sustainable future. We need our federal government’s support for industries such as tourism, fisheries, agriculture and clean energy to ensure these industries are resilient and continue to be key pillars of our economy for years to come. Climate change drastically impacts these key economic drivers and I will continue to advocate to the federal government for the need to rebuild these industries to be more resilient in the face of a changing climate.   For the past number of years, we have led the country when it comes to early childhood and childcare. I look forward to working with the federal government on a national early learning and childcare system, to enhance what already exists in our province and further support young families on Prince Edward Island.  Canadians got us to where we are today – both historically and during this pandemic – by staying united.  Collectively, we need to continue to address gender inequality, racism, and work towards reconciliation with our indigenous communities. Our federal government reaffirmed their commitment to work with provinces and Canadians to address these, and other inequities in our country.  Last, I look forward to future discussions among my provincial counterparts and our federal government on more stable and sustained health care funding and reaching a long-term agreement on the Canadian Health Transfer in advance of the next fiscal year.”   Media Contact:  	Amanda Hamel 	Executive Director, Communications and Public Affairs 	Office of the Premier 	(902) 368-4400ahamel@gov.pe.ca       Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

It never hurts to be prepared for an emergency.”   Minister of Justice and Public Safety, Bloyce Thompson.   The PEI Emergency Measures Organization monitors for any situations that may put residents’ lives, environment or economy at risk and utilizes the four phases of emergency management to address those situations as needed. “We learned a great deal from last year’s hurricane season and are continually looking at ways to doing things differently. As PEI EMO goes back to routine monitoring, we continue to encourage Islanders to regularly check on their household preparedness plans,” adds Tanya Mullally, Provincial Emergency Management Coordinator.  The Province thanks all Islanders, municipalities, community organizations, public utilities, firefighters, law enforcement, Island EMS and peace officers for their hard work preparing and supporting the minimal impacts of post-tropical storm Teddy.

Dr. Stephen Morais began caring for Island patients earlier this month at his Charlottetown office.   “Dr. Morais is highly skilled and qualified and he will be a valuable addition to the health care team here in Prince Edward Island. One in five Islanders lives with arthritis and it is extremely important that Islanders have access to the best possible care and treatment for this chronic disease.”  - Health and Wellness Minister James Aylward  Among many impressive academic milestones, Dr. Morais most recently completed his Rheumatology Fellowship at the University of Massachusetts Medical School and a Critical Care Medicine Fellowship at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Centre in New Hampshire. “There are many forms of arthritis, all of which can have a profound effect on quality of life and overall health,” said Dr. Morais. “I’m excited to be back home on PEI providing this service to patients and their health care providers.” September is Arthritis Awareness Month across Canada and the Arthritis Society is encouraging everyone living with arthritis to raise awareness with the slogan, “Arthritis Won’t Stop Me.” More than 27,000 Islanders of all ages live with the devastating effects of the disease. ”The Arthritis Society believes patients need access to arthritis care where they live and we are thrilled that the provincial government  supported the addition of Dr. Morais to provide that care for Islanders with inflammatory arthritis,” says Jone Mitchell, executive director, Arthritis Society, Atlantic Region.

Fall is a great time to plant some trees or just appreciate their beauty. Every tree we plant leaves a better Island for future generations.” - Environment, Water and Climate Change Minister Natalie Jameson  Prince Edward Island has one of the most diverse provincial tree nurseries in Canada. The J. Frank Gaudet Tree Nursery grows more than two dozen species of native trees and shrubs for reforestation and watershed enhancement efforts across PEI. In the past year, the Department of Environment, Water and Climate Change has partnered with local watershed groups,  municipalities, schools, kindergartens, day cares, churches and community groups to see trees planted for a variety of purposes. To monitor the Island’s forests, the 2020 Corporate Land Use Inventory is currently underway to map every inch of the Island and all its land uses.  This work will help government assess the current state of Prince Edward Island’s forests and plan for the future. Healthy forests require the involvement of all Islanders, especially those who own forested land.  The department has programs that provide technical advice and financial assistance to landowners such as the Forest Enhancement Program. The Province also recognizes the important role forests play in mitigating climate change.  The Carbon Capture Tree Planting Program is designed for landowners willing to plant cleared land, so it will become a future forest. This program is financially support by the Province of Prince Edward Island and Environment and Climate Change Canada. Most of Prince Edward Island is private land, but there are about 30,000 hectares of public land that are open for people to explore, which include forests, ponds, bogs, marshes and other areas where people can reconnect with nature.  Learn more about these lands at Public Lands  here and find them on the Public Land Atlas. 	 Media contact: 	Leanne Ritchie 	Department of Environment, Water and Climate Change 	(902) 314-0134lpritchie@gov.pe.ca      Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

6,2020-09-23,Canada,Prince Edward Island,,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/pei-emergency-measures-organizations-prepares-recovery-efforts,Government Website,PEI Emergency Measures Organizations prepares for recovery efforts,"   Government, public utilities, road crews and municipal partners continue to work together to shift from preparedness to potential recovery efforts across Island communities.  Post-tropical storm Teddy continues to impact communities across the province. Islanders are encouraged to remain vigilant and to stay home as much as possible until the impacts of the post-tropical storm are understood. The safety and wellbeing of Islanders remains a top priority. Provincial road crews, municipal and community partners are ready to begin an on the ground assessment of Teddy’s impacts and begin restoration work, if needed, as early as tomorrow morning. Key activities include: Road crews will be clearing the provincial roads of potential debris; Schools in the Public School Branch and La Commission scolaire de langue française are closed for the day; Island Waste Management deferred regular Wednesday curbside pickup for the Eastern Region to Saturday; Confederation Bridge implemented high-sided vehicle restrictions; Northumberland Ferries cancelled sailings for the day; and Emergency Measures Organization will continue to work closely with municipalities and help Islanders locate their reception centre, if operational.   PEI EMO continues to support public utilities like Maritime Electric, Bell Alliant and Eastlink on an expedited travel process for out of region crews if needed for restoration efforts.

Dr. Morrison recognized that as more Islanders return to work, many of them may be required to travel outside of the Atlantic Bubble for their work. With this in mind, Islanders are reminded to follow self-isolation protocols when returning to the province from outside the Atlantic Bubble.  Individuals who can work from home throughout the 14-day self-isolation period should have a plan in place for contactless delivery of essentials during this period of time. Individuals who must return to work following travel outside the Atlantic Bubble (but within Canada), must follow work-isolation protocols and public health measures, including: self-isolating when not at the workplace, monitoring for symptoms of COVID-19, physical distancing as much as possible, wearing a non-medical mask when at work, and have a plan in place for contactless delivery of essentials.  Islanders who are rotational workers (those who travel frequently or routinely outside the Atlantic Bubble (within Canada), spending at least half of their time working outside of Atlantic Canada), do not need to self-isolate or work-isolate. Instead, rotational workers must be tested on a regular basis, monitor for symptoms and follow public health measures such as physical distancing, frequent hand washing and wearing a non-medical mask when physical distancing is not possible. This protocol has been in place since the early onset of the pandemic to balance an acceptable risk of transmission with the need for rotational workers to see their families for the limited time they are home. Effective October 1, individuals who work outside of the Atlantic Bubble (within Canada) who are required to work outside of their home upon return to PEI can apply to work-isolate, via a self-declaration form that will be available on the provincial website. A letter from the worker’s employer indicating their schedule is required. More information on the work-isolate declaration will be available online early next week.  Anyone experiencing symptoms related to COVID-19, can access drop-in testing clinics for a test. These clinics do not require a call to 8-1-1 or an appointment. New guidance documents have been added to the Renew PEI, Together webpage, including: multiple gatherings; sports and recreational activities; school outbreaks; CPHO school directives; and holiday guidance.  Holiday guidance permits door-to-door trick-or-treating, but with precautions in place. Children should only visit households in their neighborhood/apartment building and those that they know; no contact treat pick up is recommended; and be respectful of households that do not wish to participate this year.  	 Backgrounder:  The Chief Public Health Office continues to work closely with the federal government, provincial and territorial counterparts, government departments and Health PEI to monitor the pandemic situation and prepare for all COVID-19 related impacts to the province, including health, social and economic.

Due to the COVID-19 response and school closures in the spring of 2020, immunization clinics to provide the second dose of HPV to Grade 6 students were not possible.  The school clinics to make up for the missed dose will be happening early in the 2020-2021 school year, beginning this week, to provide the opportunity for students to receive their remaining dose of HPV vaccine and ensure they have completed the vaccine series.  An information letter was distributed to students in Grade 7 with the upcoming clinic date for their school. These immunizations will be provided based on previously signed consent forms for the HPV vaccine. Those consent forms would have been distributed when students were in their Grade 6 year in the fall of 2019.  Anyone with questions or who would like more information can contact their local Public Health Nursing office.

It allows this renewable energy project to proceed and reduce greenhouse gases emissions that cause climate change while mitigating the project’s impact to the Island’s ecosystem,” said Minister Jameson. “By having an environmental management plan and wildlife protocols in place, setting up a committee to work together, and adding to protected areas, we can do this the right way for our kids’ sake.”  Approval of the 30-megawatt wind farm is subject to conditions that require the PEI Energy Corporation to: Prepare an Environmental Management Plan which covers each phase of the wind farm’s development (construction, operation, and decommissioning) to be approved by the Department of Environment, Water and Climate Change (EWCC);  Set up an Environmental Management Committee as a forum for people to bring forward concerns when the wind farm goes into operation, with suggested representatives including L’nuey, the Souris and Area Wildlife Branch, the Rural Municipality of Eastern Kings and local residents;  Establish a conflict resolution protocol to deal with issues such as noise and shadow flicker;  Purchase and legally protect from development a minimum 42-hectares of forested property within Kings County in order to compensate for the 14-forested hectares lost as part of the project;  Invite L’nuey to provide an environmental monitor for the construction phase of the project and invite L’nuey’s monitor to visit the site prior to the construction to assist in identifying any culturally significant species of flora, including black ash;  Conduct a two-year post-construction study in the project area monitoring any impact from the wind farm on bats and birds;  Implement a protocol that requires reporting of bird mortalities to federal and provincial authorities;  Develop mitigation measures that will be implemented should the project be shown to have a significant impact on birds or bats; and,  Provide monthly updates to EWCC detailing the status of each of the conditions associated with the Environmental Impact Assessment. A full copy of the Minister’s Environmental Impact Assessment approval is available online by going to Projects Under Environmental Review (Undertakings)  and clicking the search button to view materials for the Eastern Kings Wind Farm project. Media contact: Leanne Ritchie Department of Environment, Water and Climate Change 902-314-0134 lpritchie@gov.pe.ca 	  Backgrounder On October 23, 2019, the PEI Energy Corp. filed its environmental impact statement to expand the Eastern Kings Wind Farm. Regulated under the Environmental Protection Act, an environmental impact assessment review helps to determine any possible impacts, positive or negative, that a proposed project might have on the environment. The PEI Energy Corp. led public engagement, with a public meeting organized November 19, 2019. Public comments were received by EWCC until January 20, 2020.   In total, 80 submissions were received by mail and email. A technical review committee – consisting of experts from both the Government of Canada and Prince Edward Island – looked at the impacts of the project on people, animals, plants, land, air, water and climate and proposed mitigation strategies. EWCC also reached out to the municipal authority and engaged in Aboriginal consultation with L’nuey.  This approval addresses requirements pursuant to the EWCC’s environmental impact assessment process; however, there may be other approvals required from other departments, agencies, governments before the project can proceed.       Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

I have always admired her deep sense of community, love of family and commitment to empowering Islanders, especially women, to become leaders.   Nancy had a long and storied career as a Member of the Legislative Assembly where her passion for politics and public service were on display. While serving as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly in 1993, she was part of a unique moment in Canadian political history as one of five women who simultaneously held the five most influential legislative government positions in Prince Edward Island – Premier, Leader of the Official Opposition, Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, and Lieutenant Governor – a feat yet to be repeated in Canadian public life. Nancy and her family made Prince Edward Island home in the 1970’s where she worked in the health care field as a radiotherapist and raised her family with her late husband Gregg.  Nancy first served as a member Summerside Town Council for many years before being elected as Member of the Legislative Assembly for 5th Prince in a by-election in 1987. She was re-elected in the general elections of 1989, 1993 and 1996, holding serval cabinet portfolios during that time, including Minister of Tourism and Parks, Minister of Labour, Minister responsible for the Status of Women, and Minister responsible for Human Rights before being elected Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. Nancy was also among a handful of Members of the Legislative Assembly who were elected to represent both dual and single member districts. Following her career in politics, she later served as Chair of the Workers Compensation Board.  Nancy was always a fierce advocate for her adopted home community of Summerside during her years of public service. She was a leader, a trailblazer and an inspiration to so many Islanders. More importantly, she was a devoted mother and grandmother who will be forever missed by her loved ones and her friends.”  Media Contact: 	Amanda Hamel 	Executive Director, Communications and Public Affairs 	Office of the Premier 	(902) 368-4400ahamel@gov.pe.ca      Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

They are being followed daily by public health nursing. They had very limited close contacts, and contact tracing is now complete.  The three men travelled on Air Canada flight AC626 from Toronto to Halifax on August 5.

The goal is to build capacity here on the Island and support a new generation of climate change champions in our communities.”  - Environment, Water and Climate Change Minister Natalie Jameson  ClimateSense is currently looking for organizations interested in hosting a recent post-secondary graduate for a six-to-twelve month internship, beginning in 2021.  During this time, the intern will work with mentors within the host organization to complete a sector-specific adaptation project, as well as take part in ClimateSense Training and Professional Development Programs. “We know that across Canada and around the world, climate change is having a larger impact on populations affected by systemic racism, as well as vulnerable groups like the elderly, children, and people with chronic mental and physical illnesses, disabilities, and economic vulnerability. Climate change affects our most vulnerable and I encourage organizations from all sectors to consider applying,” said Dr. Adam Fenech, Associate Dean, School of Climate Change and Adaptation at the University of Prince Edward Island. 	  	ClimateSense will cover all or most of the costs associated with supporting the intern (depending on the type of organization).  A minimum of 12 interns will be placed with organizations as part of the ClimateSense Professional Internship Program. Interested organizations should visit  Professional Internship Program for an application and guidelines. The deadline to apply is end of day September 7, 2020.  Media contact: 	Leanne Ritchie 	Department of Environment, Water and Climate Changelpritchie@gov.pe.ca 	902-314-0134 Backgrounder  	The Climate Sense program is a partnership between Prince Edward Island, the University of Prince Edward Island’s School of Climate Change and Adaptation and Natural Resources Canada’s Building Regional Adaptation Capacity and Expertise (BRACE) Program. Other partners include the Architects Association of PEI, EngineersPEI, PEI Institute of Professional Planners, and the PEI Watershed Alliance. There are two streams to the program. A professional development and training program is fostering collaboration and teaching Island professionals and recent graduates to understand the impacts of a changing climate and to integrate climate change adaptation into their daily work. More than 200 professionals have participated in 12 programs since ClimateSense launched in July 2019. An internship program is providing recent graduates with development opportunities and building adaptive capacity within organizations across the province.  The goal of ClimateSense is to facilitate the sharing of knowledge, tools and resources on climate change adaptation across various professions, sectors and disciplines that can be applied to other regions in Canada. Natural Resources Canada’s BRACE program is an $18-million strategic investment under the Adaptation and Climate Resilience pillar of the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change. The program works directly with provinces to deliver projects that include training, internships and knowledge-sharing activities that will build the capacity Canadians need to respond to the effects of a changing climate.

Though we will miss hearing the cheers and noisemakers of the tintamarre and Ave Maris Stella sung proudly through the streets of Island communities from tip to tip this year, the events will be no less of a celebration of the vibrant spirit of these incredible people. This summer, in particular, Acadians, Francophones and French-speaking Islanders intend on highlighting a very important historical milestone: the 300th anniversary since calling Prince Edward Island their home.  I encourage all Islanders to take part in the many celebrations the Acadian and Francophone community have organized for us all to enjoy. Let’s discover together the uniqueness of a community known for their warmth, their culture and infectious joie de vivre. Happy National Acadian Day.

My wife and I were interested in farming and permaculture , and moving to Prince Edward Island meant that we could be closer to family, have the opportunity to run a hobby farm, and I could continue to practice medicine."" “My favourite thing about working at Western Hospital is the great nursing staff and my very capable and collaborative colleagues, particularly Dr. Bajelan,” he said. “I enjoy the problem solving that is related to acute illness and the fulfillment that comes from helping patients feel better.” When Dr. Campanaro isn’t in the emergency department, he enjoys spending time on his hobby farm or building boats.   “My role as an emergency department doctor gives me work-life balance which had sometimes been lacking when I had a full general practice in Ontario. I have time now to work on developing our hobby farm and can spend more time with my family.”  Dr. Campanaro says he’s also pleased with new skills he has been able to learn on the job at Western Hospital to help his patients.  “I have to thank Dr. Megan Burns and the administrative staff at Western Hospital who were instrumental in securing an ultrasound machine for the emergency department. I have taken some basic ultrasound training and can now use this in my emergency room practice. There are rewarding career opportunities and competitive incentives here on PEI for physicians looking for experience in a rural setting that isn’t remote. Dr. Campanaro says what makes working at Western Hospital so incredible is the support system.  “Most physicians know that the heart of any emergency department is the nursing staff and I can say without reservation that the team at Western Hospital is a great group to work alongside. They care about getting it right for our patients. I have great respect for my fellow ED colleagues, most notably Dr. Bajelan, who has been the bedrock of the department for many years.  We also receive crucial support from our specialist colleagues from across the province, especially from Prince County Hospital in Summerside.” Learn more about emergency medicine opportunities on Prince Edward Island. 	       Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

With overwhelming support, dogged determination and an unbridled passion for sport, local organizers and residents of Tyne Valley have done their part to ensure their community made it into the finals.

Calian Emergency Management Solutions, experts in the industry, was selected to provide an independent review of the provincial response to one of the most significant weather events in recent Atlantic Canadian history.  In its final report, Calian concludes that the Province managed a successful, well-coordinated response to post-tropical storm Dorian and has outlined six areas of opportunity to explore to enhance the provincial response to the next disaster event. These include resource management; training and exercise; information management; concept of operations; business continuity; and decision centre tools.  “Dorian was an eye-opening experience for Islanders and the entire province. It was an extraordinary weather event not seen in recent history and I am incredibly proud of the coordinated effort the province provided Islanders,” said Bloyce Thompson, Minister of Justice and Public Safety. “  This last year, government has responded to a series of unusual events which includes Dorian, supply chain impacts from the rail blockades, a malware attack and currently, COVID-19. The Emergency Measures Organization has been an active contributor throughout these events and it is clear that its role has expanded well beyond isolated weather events.”  “My thanks go to the experts at Calian for this thorough independent review. The recommendations from this report will be part of our plan to build an even stronger and sustainable provincial response plan for all future events,” added Thompson. Close to 300 Islanders took part in focus groups, interviews and a bilingual survey from late February to March this year to provide their insights and experiences related to the provincial response to Dorian.

The goals of both programs are to: provide healthy and affordable options to all students while using local food when possible; provide equitable access for all students by offering various payment options such as the pay-what-you-can model; and, provide food literacy opportunities for all students. These programs will guide the province’s plans for a universal healthy school food program to provide a healthy, hot meal option within each Island school beginning in the 2021-2022 school year. “The PEI Home and School Federation is pleased to learn about the continued and expanded school food initiatives to support Island children,” said Cory Thomas, President of the PEI Home and School Federation. “Such a program supports our children by providing nutritious food.

With travel plans paused, size limits on gatherings and physical distancing required, many couples have had to postpone or adapt their wedding celebration plans. Allen owns Elysian Weddings and Events and she is helping couples adjust their wedding plans to the meet the current guidance for organized gatherings under Phase #4 of Renew PEI.  “We’ve been working closely with our clients in various ways to help them reduce their guest list if needed, have discussions with their guests, coordinate the venue to optimize floor space for the safety of guests and employees, and help them decide which elements of their event can be changed or eliminated.”      Allen says many couples have opted for a plated meal since buffets are out, and are focusing more on the ceremony and meal, without a dance.  “In the end, each couple will have a different definition of an amazing wedding day so we are doing our best to support each couple to make that happen and help them work through any planning struggles.”  While this year’s wedding events might not be what couples had originally hoped or planned for Allen says it’s important to keep in mind that the marriage is about the relationship, not the party.  “I’ve seen many couples who have chosen a small elopement or socially distanced wedding; the love and support from friends and family is still there. “It may feel strange to follow the guidelines under our new normal, but people understand that it’s for everyone’s health and safety.  I tell my clients, if any of your guests are not comfortable attending in the current climate, don’t take it personally.

The club currently has over 300 active members, ranging from three to 18 years of age.  “Sport and recreation are important parts of physical and mental health and it is important that Islanders, especially our youth, in rural communities have access to these activities close to home. One of the goals of the Rural Growth Initiative is to help communities build this kind of important infrastructure, which is vital to the mental and physical well-being of their residents.” - Hon. Jamie Fox, Minister of Fisheries and Communities  The provincial government is investing $100,000 to support construction of the new clubhouse. KASC has worked closely with the Town of Kensington on the project and Cavendish Farms is also a major sponsor. “We are very proud of our local soccer club,” said Mayor Rowan Caseley. “This project shows the tireless efforts being made by volunteers in our community to support youth and sport. The Town of Kensington is pleased to partner with KASC on such a worthwhile initiative.” “We are proud to support Island communities where our employees live and work,” said Robert K. Irving, president of Cavendish Farms. “The soccer club serves a great need in the area and this new clubhouse will allow local youth to continue to develop soccer and life skills. The clubhouse will also be a place where community members can gather and will allow them to host tournaments bringing visitors to the area and local businesses.” “As a volunteer community organization, we are so thankful for the support of the Town of Kensington, the Province of PEI, and our community partner; Cavendish Farms,” said DJ Welton, president of KASC. “This clubhouse will do much more for our members than just provide washrooms and storage; it will give them a central meeting place that will create a stronger sense of community within our club for years to come.” Learn more about the Rural Growth Initiative of the Department of Fisheries and Communities at PrinceEdwardIsland.ca/ruralgrowth.

RISE is a new program that provides educational, legal and emotional to support to Islanders dealing with sexual violence trauma. The program is offered through Community Legal Information (CLI), an organization that helps people navigate and better understand the legal system.   ""Reporting or disclosing an experience of sexual violence is immensely personal,” shared CLI project manager Alia Hack. “The goal of RISE and of our organization is to support victims and to ensure they are well informed about their legal options.”  The free program uses a trauma-informed approach and provides sexual assault survivors with access to legal information, up to four hours of free legal advice, and personalized assistance to navigate the justice system and community supports, as well as emotional support to address the trauma of sexual violence. RISE program staff will work closely with Rape and Sexual Assault Services, Victim Services of the Department of Justice and Public Safety and the legal community to enhance supports and responses for survivors of sexual violence. “Sexual violence is unfortunately a reality of our society. These complex crimes have a traumatic and long lasting effects on the survivors,” said Bloyce Thompson, Minister of Justice and Public Safety and Attorney General.  “The survivors need services and supports to be accessible, coordinated and available in the most seamless way possible. I am very optimistic that our partnership with CLI will give survivors of these serious crimes some much needed support and relief in knowing that we are there to help.”  The provincial government provided $200,000 to support the program over two years to complement existing services CLI offers to Islanders.  The RISE program is available by email at info@legalinfopei.ca, or by phone 902.218.6143.

This work occurs every 10 years. The data, once assembled and analyzed, will provide Islanders with increased knowledge of all of PEI's lands and forests.  “For the first time, the 2020 inventory will include measurements to enable the Province to assess the standing volume of carbon sequestered in its forests and contribute to carbon budget modelling and accounting. This will inform climate change efforts, and allow monitoring of carbon dynamics and assessment of the resiliency of our forests.” - Minister of Environment, Water and Climate Change Natalie Jameson  TDB Consultants Inc. & Airborne Sensing Corporation will take more than 4,000 photos from the air, which will be digitally stitched together to form a complete mosaic of the Island.  Work will then begin on analyzing and verifying the data. First every photograph will be analyzed to define land uses such as forestry, agricultural, wetland, industrial, recreational, residential and transportation. Forest ground measurements of more than 800 plots will be compared to the air photo to provide information that cannot be gathered from the photos, like the types of ground vegetation and tree diameters.   The 2020 Corporate Land Use inventory will also update provincial LiDAR (digital elevation) coverage to provide more detailed information on elevation of ground, vegetation and structure heights.  Taken together, this air photo mosaic, land use and LiDAR information is used extensively by every government department, RCMP, emergency responders, UPEI, Holland College, municipalities, and watershed groups.  A new map of the Island is expected early 2021 with analysis and detailed verification of the information occurring until the end of 2022.   Media contact: 	Jill Edwards 	Department of Environment, Water and Climate Changejedwards@gov.pe.ca  	       Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

For many years, Mr. Simmons has been trying to win this very special harness race and to see him smiling in the winner’s circle, holding the winner’s cooler, was one of the most special and emotional sporting moments in Island history. Trained under the careful and watchful eye of Wade Sorrie and driven expertly by Brodie MacPhee, Bugsy Maguire broke free just before the three-quarter pole and sprinted to the finish line, much to the delight of all in attendance as well as the thousands tuned in online. Mr. Simmons, who turned 95 this year, has been around Island harness racing his entire life and has owned hundreds of horses. He has had hundreds of trips to the winner’s circle but has always dreamt of winning his hometown race – the Governor’s Plate. To do so in such thrilling style, upsetting a field of more favoured horses, made it extra special for Mr. Simmons. Bugsy Maguire left from post position four and went off at 13/1 odds. The sport of harness racing is part of the social fabric of Prince Edward Island and contributes greatly to our economic success. Although COVID-19 has made it difficult for our harness racing industry, a safe, fast and successful week of racing was held at Red Shores Summeriside, culminating with a terrific running of the Summerside Chrysler Dodge Governor’s Plate. Thank you to all horse owners, drivers, trainers, grooms, sponsors, organizers and fans for making the 52nd running of the Governor’s Plate unforgettable.”  Media Contact: 	Amanda Hamel 	Executive Director, Communications and Public Affairs 	Office of the Premier 	(902) 368-4400ahamel@gov.pe.ca      Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

Starting immediately, Islanders can visit Land Matters Project to provide input about land issues in PEI. This engagement is part of the Province’s review of the Lands Protection Act and Planning Act and input will be used to provide recommendations on changes to regulations and legislation. “Land protection and management has been a priority for Prince Edward Island since before Confederation,” said Bloyce Thompson, Minister of Agriculture and Land. “The upcoming review will help government identify Islanders’ concerns about our land and design ways to protect and preserve our land for future generations.”  Land ownership is currently governed by the Lands Protection Act and regulated by the Island Regulatory and Appeals Commission (IRAC). The Land Matters Project is being initiated as a response to public request, findings of past land reports, and current mandates to review the Lands Protection Act and Planning Act. “In the next few weeks, we will also establish a Land Matters Advisory Committee of Islanders who will carry out conversations with the public,” said Minister Thompson. “We are looking for individuals with expertise in all aspects of land ownership, use, and planning. We want to hear from interested parties and we want to address land policy and legislation in a way that meets the needs of every Islander. Everything is up for discussion and we want to hear from you.” Details of how to apply to the Land Matters Advisory Committee will be available soon on the Land Matters website. The site will also be updated with other information as progress unfolds. For more information, visit the Lands Protection Act, the Planning Act and the Land Matters Project.

The two additional cases are both men in their 20s and residents of PEI. They are both close contacts of one of the cases reported yesterday, an individual who travelled to Nova Scotia and came in contact with someone from the United States. Contact tracing is now underway for the two new cases. At this point, there is no evidence of community spread of COVID-19 in Prince Edward Island. The risk of transmission of COVID-19 in PEI remains low. The woman in her 20s who is a staff member at Whisperwood Villa identified nine close contacts, all of whom tested negative but will remain in self-isolation for 14 days. A total of 129 residents and 140 staff members of Whisperwood Villa were tested and had a negative test result. All residents and staff will be re-tested later this week as an added precaution. Visitors who were at Whisperwood Villa on Tuesday, June 30 are being contacted to arrange for testing today. The Chief Public Health Office continues to work closely with Whisperwood Villa. Over the past 24 hours, extensive contact tracing has been underway and will continue. Contact tracing within 24-48 hours of diagnosis is key to containing the spread of COVID-19. Every precaution is being taken to limit the spread of COVID-19 in Prince Edward Island. This cluster of cases is a clear indication that COVID-19 is still present in the province and Islanders must remain vigilant and continue to be cautious and follow public health measures. Backgrounder: The Chief Public Health Office continues to work closely with the federal government, provincial and territorial counterparts, government departments and Health PEI to continue to monitor the situation globally, nationally and locally. The public health risk of COVID-19 is continually reassessed and Islanders will be updated as new information becomes available.

None of the cases are related to seasonal residents or the opening of the Atlantic Bubble. All three individuals are essential workers:  a man in his 50s, a man in his 20s and a woman in her 20s.  The man in his 50s recently traveled outside of the region and has been self-isolating since returning home.  The man and woman in their 20s are believed to be connected, the man had traveled to Nova Scotia and had contact with someone who had traveled from the United States. The woman is a staff member at Whisperwood Villa and recently worked at the facility. She wore appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and does not provide direct personal care to residents. She left the facility as soon as she experienced symptoms.  Whisperwood Villa was contacted last evening as soon as the Chief Public Health Office became aware of the positive case. As a precaution, all residents and staff at Whisperwood Villa will be tested for COVID-19. Staff are being contacted individually regarding the process to get tested, and resident testing is already underway. None of the residents at Whisperwood Villa are currently experiencing new COVID-19 symptoms. As an additional precaution, anyone who visited Whisperwood Villa on Tuesday, June 30 is also being contacted directly to arrange for testing.  Contact tracing of the cases through public health nursing has started. Early and comprehensive contact tracing is key to containing further spread of COVID-19 in Prince Edward Island.  The Chief Public Health Office continues to work with Whisperwood Villa, who has been diligent about following public health guidance since the pandemic began. All indoor and outdoor visits at the facility are cancelled until further notice and there will be no communal dining. The frequency of resident temperature checks will now take place twice a day, in addition to two screenings per day.  All necessary steps are being taken to mitigate any spread of COVID-19 in the facility and keeping residents and staff safe is a top priority.  Backgrounder:  The Chief Public Health Office continues to work closely with the federal government, provincial and territorial counterparts, government departments and Health PEI to continue to monitor the situation globally, nationally and locally.

90,2020-07-02,Canada,Prince Edward Island,,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/agreement-to-grow-protected-areas-and-urban-forest,Government Website,Agreement to grow protected areas and urban forest,"   Islanders will see more protected greenspace in the Hillsborough Park area as part of an agreement to offset construction impacting the Royalty Oaks protected area.  “We engaged with residents of Hillsborough Park and surrounding communities, as well as local conservationists and watershed groups, to come up with a plan that adds to our protected green spaces, supports active transportation and bike lanes, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, and strengthens public safety. We will add new land to Royalty Oaks natural area and, in partnership with the Department of Social Development and Housing, we will seek protection for an additional 28-acres around Wright’s Creek and close to Royalty Oaks.” - Environment, Water and Climate Change Minister Natalie Jameson  Specifically, government will follow the advice of the Natural Area Protection Act technical advisory committee and: Designate new protected areas next to the existing Royalty Oaks natural area to offset the loss of .76 acre to the 10.84-acre protected area; and, Ensure the Technical Advisory Committee works with the Department of Transportation, Infrastructure and Energy’s environmental coordinator to review and provide feedback on the environmental management plan for the project to ensure the least amount of interference possible. Government will also pursue Natural Areas Protection Act designation for a 28-acre parcel along Wright’s Creek in Hillsborough Park, close to Royalty Oaks. This will strengthen the watersheds and green spaces network in the neighbourhood and city of Charlottetown. The Department of Transportation, Infrastructure and Energy is adding a bike lane and additional right turning lane from the arterial bypass highway onto St. Peter’s Road. This improvement will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, commuter and idling time, improve air quality and public safety, and allow for free-flowing traffic; however, it requires removing the protection designation from approximately .76 acres of Royalty Oaks land.  Public consultations were held from May 9 through May 23, 2020.  During this time, 124 written submissions from the public were received. An additional 34 people participated in the public tours of the site offered by the Department of Transportation, Infrastructure and Energy.   Media Contact: 	Leanne Ritchie 	Department of Environment, Water and Climate Change 	902-314-0134lpritchie@gov.pe.ca  Backgrounder:  The Royalty Oaks protected area was established to protect a hardwood grove with historical and biological attributes within the city.  The mature stand contains large, old red oak trees.   The Natural Areas Protection Act (NAPA) is used to protect areas across the province that still contain special ecological features.  Natural areas include both public and private lands and may cover an entire property or just a specific area within a property.  As of Jan. 31, 2020, PEI’s protected and conserved area network was at 24,848 hectares or 4.38 per cent of PEI protected as Natural Areas under the Act.  About 1/4 of these lands are owned and managed by individuals and by private organizations. Sites designated as Natural Areas may include those with rare or uncommon plant species, unique geological features, special habitats or habitats that are ecologically fragile and therefore, require additional protection. When properties, or portions of properties, are proposed for designation under NAPA, management plans are prepared and the public and interested groups are asked to provide comments.  Additional designations proposed in the above plan will undergo public consultation in the coming months.

Prince Edward Island will begin welcoming family, friends and visitors from Atlantic Canada at 12:01 a.m. on Friday, July 3. Atlantic Canadians will need to complete an online self-declaration form before traveling to the Island. Individuals traveling in the same vehicle need only complete one form with each person traveling identified on the form. A submission identification number will be generated when the form is submitted and will be later verified when entering the province. Atlantic Canadians traveling to Prince Edward Island are asked to apply within two days of their scheduled arrival date. Everyone entering the province, including Islanders returning home, will go through a health screening at the point of entry. Additional public health and screening measures will be maintained as part of the travel bubble: Seasonal residents traveling from outside Atlantic Canada will need to apply for pre-approved travel and have a self-isolation plan; Islanders returning from travel outside Atlantic Canada will need to self-isolate for 14 days; and, Operation Isolation will continue to follow those self-isolating. Residents of Atlantic Canada currently self-isolating in Prince Edward Island who have not traveled outside the region in the last 14 days can discontinue their self-isolation as of Friday, July 3. Islanders and visitors should continue to practice physical distancing, washing their hands with soap and water, staying home when feeling ill, and following other public health measures. Travel bubble requirements may be different for each Atlantic province. Islanders traveling to other Atlantic provinces should inquire about the entry requirements and public health measures for the province they wish to visit before beginning their travels. When returning to Prince Edward Island, Islanders will be required to show two pieces of identification to confirm they are a permanent or seasonal resident.

92,2020-07-02,Canada,Prince Edward Island,,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/province-releases-plan-safely-return-students-school-september,Government Website,Province releases plan to safely return students to school in September,"   Prince Edward Island’s new Welcome Back to School plan supports the safe return of all K-12 students and staff to school in September. Under the guidance of the Chief Public Health Office, the plan outlines protocols to support physical distancing, enhanced hygiene and the safe flow of students through the school.  “Students are telling us that the classroom is the best learning environment because they can learn together and face-to-face with their teachers, they can be with their friends and be part of their school community. Our goal is to safely return students and staff to school while being prepared to adapt to changing public health conditions at any time.” - Education and Lifelong Learning Minister Brad Trivers  The plan was developed by a provincial Fall Readiness Committee which worked closely with the Chief Public Health Office. The Public Schools Branch and Commission scolaire de langue française will work with each school on operational plans that address the needs of their school. 	The plan includes guidelines for all schools to keep students and staff safe, for example: Students will work in cohorts, or groups of the same students, as much as possible. Cohorts will distance themselves from other groups to limit exposure to other students. Classrooms will be configured to support physical distancing. Schools will work to reduce class sizes and when necessary, alternate space such as multi-purpose rooms will be used as classrooms. Lunch and recess breaks will be staggered, as well as drop-off and pick-up times. Protocols will be in place to safely move students through the school and reduce congestion in hallways and common areas. Students and staff will be required to stay home when they are unwell and there will be screening protocols for all people entering a school. Students will be educated on the importance of physical distancing and hand washing. Enhanced cleaning protocols will be followed in the school and on the school bus. To reduce the number of students on buses, parents will be asked to transport their children to and from school whenever possible and buses will be added where necessary. The plan for September is based on current evidence and recommendations of the Chief Public Health Office. While in-school learning is the preferred model, back-up plans will be in place to move to at-home learning should public health conditions change. 	Staff will return to school on September 1 and students on September 8. Orientation on new operational requirements will be held for all staff. Professional learning for teachers will focus on the revised curriculum, online teaching and learning, and student wellness. “By focusing on content that had to be omitted this spring and on key areas of the curriculum early in the school year, schools will be in a good position to minimize the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on student learning,” said Minister Trivers. “We are confident that, by working together, we can bring our students back safely and provide them with opportunities that are critical to their academic, social and emotional development.” Minister Trivers said parents and guardians will play an important role in their children’s transition to new learning environments. The Department and school leaders will seek input from parents and be in close contact with them regarding any adjustments that may be required. Additional teachers and cleaning staff will be hired to support the implementation of the plan. For more information, visit: Welcome Back to School Plan.

We have heard from Islanders and collaborated with all parties to shape this budget. Health, education, environment and the social and economic needs of Islanders remain the core priorities in Budget 2020-21.  Many new and ongoing initiatives will also play a key role in the province’s recovery and growth efforts, including:  a Small Business Tax Reduction that will bring the province to the lowest levels in the region;  an increase to the Island Advantage Bursary that will make post-secondary education in Prince Edward Island more affordable; a School Lunch Program, offered in partnership with local providers, that will provide healthy food to more Island schoolchildren;  a Pathway to Net Zero and Sustainable Communities that will set the province on a path to full energy sustainability;  as well as the creation of:  		a Social Sector Community Partners Fund that will provide more secure core support to our key partners and advance special projects;  a Telework Adaptation Fund to incentivize smart work remotely; and,  a Climate Challenge Fund to build better solutions for Prince Edward Island.  “In working with my department and senior officials, it became evident that the budget presented today has been the most challenging to prepare in recent history,” said Minister Compton. “Our government will continue to be responsive and responsible as we create a future where Islanders excel, businesses thrive, communities are inclusive and Prince Edward Island emerges as a sustainability leader.”  For more information on planned expenditures, visit  2020-21 Operating Budget.

Islanders want to work to support themselves and their families and lobster processing plants across PEI are experiencing unprecedented labour shortages.  Hopefully Islanders and students can fill these jobs so processors can continue to supply customers with PEI’s quality lobster products.”  -  Fisheries and Communities Minister Jamie Fox.  “Every plant is short of workers and without an adequate workforce we can’t process all the lobsters being caught in PEI waters,” said executive director of the PEI Seafood Processors Association, Jerry Gavin.  “Processors are concerned that they will not be able to process enough lobsters to meet market demands as the world starts to recover from Covid-19 and re-open the economy.”  Through the Team Seafood Program, students returning to post-secondary studies in the fall of 2020 will receive a $2,000 bursary and students returning to high school will receive a $1,000 bursary. The bursary amounts were doubled over last year to encourage more students work in the seafood sector.  Minister Fox also recognized the leadership and efforts of fishers, processors and buyers who worked hard to address the many issues facing the seafood sector because of the Covid-19 crises.  They are  doing their part to protect the health and well-being of Islanders by working with the Chief Public Health Office to put guidelines and measures in place, including personal protective equipment, to protect workers and their communities from COVID-19.      “People working in seafood industries are supporting the food system and PEI’s economy; seafood harvesting and processing are essential services that are vital to the well-being of Islanders and our province,” said Minister Fox. “Our seafood community continues to be resilient in the face of a challenging situation. We will do what we can to support them.” To register to be connected through the seafood processing initiative, job seekers and seafood industry employers are encouraged to visit Opportunities in PEI Seafood.

Dishonest individuals and organizations will use various sophisticated and opportunistic tactics to exploit people, such as insurance, investment and banking scams, as well as fake schemes pretending to support a good cause.   “It is incredibly disappointing that there are people preying on others, especially the vulnerable, during one of the most challenging times of our lives. We have all heard the expression that if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. I encourage all Islanders to always do their due diligence when investing or donating their hard-earned money. Ask questions and check with the regulators in the department before making important financial decisions.” - Justice and Public Safety Minister Bloyce Thompson  Companies and individuals authorized to sell insurance and investment products are reviewed and regulated through the Department of Justice and Public Safety.

Between 2017 and 2018, in Prince Edward Island, there was a reduction of about 25,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions according to the latest information. This is roughly the equivalent of taking 5,400 passengers vehicles off the road for one year.  “This data reflects the awareness among Islanders of the importance of tackling climate change. It shows people moving away from using oil to heat their buildings and farms,” said Minister Jameson.  “Islanders have a deep connection to their environment and as we continue with our Renew PEI, together plan we will include climate change as a consideration in recovery plans.”  In 2018, Prince Edward Island’s emissions were 1.7 million tonnes. Emissions declined 1.5 per cent compared to 2017, despite a 2.1 per cent increase in population and a 2.8 per cent increase in economic growth over 2017. PEI is only one of three provinces in Canada where emissions decreased in 2018 along with New Brunswick and Saskatchewan.  The new data is part of the federal government’s National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report, which forms part of Canada’s submission to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Data is published with a two-year delay to allow time to assemble the information.

Some of the major considerations include community energy generation, getting PEI to net-zero, and making our energy grid sustainable for the next 25 years. As we work with Island communities to help them become more sustainable, we need an integrated piece of energy legislation that empowers our whole province to move towards our net-zero goals.” - Transportation, Infrastructure and Energy Minister Steven Myers  The Electric Power Act regulates rates for electric power, energy efficiency measures, and the regulation of the public utilities.  The Renewable Energy Act encourages the use of renewable energy sources to enhance the capacity and reliable of the provincial energy supply.  Government’s energy partners – Maritime Electric, Summerside Electric, and the PEI Energy Corporation – have been advised of the plans to review this legislation and government has asked for their feedback on what energy legislation should look like for PEI.  The Sustainable Communities Initiative is still accepting expressions of interest from community members. Government is looking for community champions to develop a local approach to sustainable community energy generation.  The goal is to empower innovative community-led and community-based energy generation models. Participating communities will directly benefit through energy independence, local economic development, and long-term savings on their energy bills. “Energy independence for PEI communities will require diverse, local solutions and there is no one size fits all solution,” said Minister Myers. “The current legislation has been identified as a barrier to empowering innovative community-based solutions. We need to make sure our legislative framework supports the great ideas we are hearing from these communities, and sets up Island communities for success over the long term.” Government will be accepting detailed written submissions from our energy partners and from Islanders beginning Monday, May 25 until end of business day on Monday, June 8. With COVID-19 public health restrictions in mind, virtual public consultations will also be arranged for the middle of June. Further details will be provided.  For more information on consultations on PEI’s energy legislation, visit: Energy legislation consultation.

Burning permits are required for all outdoor burning in PEI during fire season – March 15 to November 30. Islanders interested in applying for a burning permit online can visit Burning Permits.   “Islanders need to get a permit before burning materials such as fallen trees, branches, leaves and grass so they know how to burn safely, what their responsibilities are, and so we can keep local fire departments informed. Moving the application system online is more convenient for Islanders, and also allows us to support fire safety and protect Islanders as we continue to maintain public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.” Environment, Water and Climate Change Minister Natalie Jameson  A Burning Permit allows property owners to burn grasses, leaves, branches and other woody debris. Once a property owner has a permit and before they start an outdoor fire on their property, they still must: Ensure the Fire Weather Index  in their fire region is Low and that wind speeds are less than 10 km/hr by checking the Fire Weather Index; and, Call to activate the permit each time before they start to burn. All domestic open burning must be 50 feet from structures, while recreational campfires must be 25 feet from structures.  “Uncontrolled wildfires can be destructive to homes, cottages, forests, farm buildings, crops, livestock and of course people. Most wildfires in PEI result from burning old grasses, clearing land for development or equipment sparks,” said Mike Montigny, Field Services manager with the Forests, Fish and Wildlife division. “We want to work with Islanders to ensure they know how to follow safe outdoor burning practices.” Forestry staff will review burning permit applications Monday through Friday during regular working hours. Applicants can expect a response within 48 hours. Burning permits are free to property owners living in areas where municipal fire or burning by-laws do not apply.

Our unique Island mosaic is deeply rooted in our diverse cultural history, which includes Mi’kmaq traditions and language. This week, I hope all Islanders will take the opportunity to celebrate our Indigenous history and learn more about Abegweit First Nation, Lennox Island First Nation and Indigenous organizations active in our province.

128,2020-05-15,Canada,Prince Edward Island,,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/province-outlines-plans-child-care,Government Website,Province outlines plans for child care,"                 Today, the Province of Prince Edward Island announced further details about the expansion of child care services as the province begins to ease public health measures.  The plan for child care services, in accordance with recommendations and guidelines provided by the Chief Public Health Office, will include a phased approach to gradually and safely reopen licensed and unlicensed early learning centres.  “As our province begins to ease public health restrictions and opens up more of our economy so Islanders can get back to work, we need to recognize that child care remains a difficult issue,” said Premier Dennis King. “We will continue to work with families and community partners to find new and alternative ways to ensure any Islander in need has access to affordable, high-quality child care opportunities.” As the province prepares to enter Phase 2 of Renew PEI, Together on May 22, the provincial government released its plan for expanded child care, which includes:   increasing the number of licensed child care centres operating from 22 to 155;  providing child care at licensed centres in groups of 5 people, with no more than 20 people in a centre;  allowing private home-based child care centres to re-open to their full capacity (up to 7 children); and,  providing a new childcare allowance to support families using either licensed of private child care services.   Families returning to work will receive $75 per child, per week until June 26 to help with child care costs. Licensed centres will receive the payment directly. For parents using private child care services, they will need to complete an application form. The form will be available on the government’s website beginning May 22.  The Child Care Subsidy Program is also available for families based on their income and family situation. To check eligibility, Islanders can use the child care subsidy calculator.  “As we learn to live and adjust to COVID-19, we will continue to evaluate the way child care services are delivered in our province,” said Minister of Education and Lifelong Learning Brad Trivers.  “We know we need to balance the need of Islanders returning to work with keeping our children safe and we will continue to work with our educational partners and families to achieve this. Together, we can ensure that parents have the supports they need to work and raise their families and that children have the opportunity to thrive.” Parents who have questions about available child care can contact the Department of Education and Lifelong Learning at (902) 368-6513. Parents unable to secure a space, and have no other child care options, are asked to go to www.princeedwardisland.ca/childcareservices.  Media Contact: 	Amanda Hamel 	Executive Director, Communications and Public Affairs 	Office of the Premier 	(902) 368-4400 ahamel@gov.pe.ca   Background:  License Child Care Centres 	Priority in licensed child care centres during Phase 2 will be given to parents who must leave home to work and who have no other child care options.  Parents who had children in licensed centres before the pandemic will be given priority to return to that spot.  Licensed child care operators are now reaching out to families in their centres to identify their needs. Once that is determined, they will offer any remaining spaces to parents who have requested one.  While public health guidelines restrict infants and those who are immunocompromised from returning to licensed child care centres at this time, private child care services are still available. Children who are immunocompromised may return to a centre if they have written approval from a health care practitioner.  Children with special needs will continue to be supported by the early childhood education team on a case-by-case basis. In addition, child care centres are working directly with families to support the needs of each child.  Parents not returning to work during this phase will not lose their space in centres. In addition, essential workers now using licensed child care centres will continue to have a space in a licensed centre.  Private Home-Based Centres 	More than 300 home-based centres across the province will be permitted to take up to 7 children each while practicing physical distancing based on their COVID-19 Operation Plan required by the Chief Public Health Office.       Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

The province has been working with industry, public health, regional counterparts and the federal government to find a way to safely hold a spring fishing season in the midst of the global pandemic while also offering relief packages to help fisheries and aquaculture operators navigate the changing market conditions and other economic challenges related to COVID-19. “Fishers never really know ahead of time how a season will go and that is particularly true this year,” said Minister Fox. “My hope is for Island fishers and aquaculturists to have a strong 2020 season, but we know that this will be a challenging year. The best way to show our support this year is by buying and enjoying Island seafood.”  The fishing industry has worked closely with the Chief Public Health Office to ensure health and safety precautions and guidelines are in place to protect fishers, their coworkers and the community from COVID-19 during the spring season.   “I know all Islanders will be rooting for fishers as they head out on their boats on setting day. This year, Islanders are asked to follow public health measures and hold off on going down to the local wharf or harbour this year. Let’s find new ways of encouraging fishers and aquaculture operators while giving them the space and peace of mind that they need to conduct their business safely,” added Minister Fox.  Media Contact: 	Ron Ryder 	Department of Fisheries and Communities 	902-314-6367 rrryder@gov.pe.ca  	       Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

During this pandemic, now, more than ever, is a time for us to come together and to look out for our Island children and youth. By working together with our valued partners across all sectors, guided by the active participation of Island children and youth, we will ensure PEI’s children and youth are heard and involved in finding our way through this unprecedented time.”  - Premier Dennis King  The mandate of the PEI Children and Youth Table is to engage children and youth, including children in care and in provincial facilities, to identify issues and potential solutions to areas of concern related to children and youth on Prince Edward Island, as well as review programs developed in response to COVID-19 using a child rights-based approach to identify potential challenges. The efforts of the provincial table will be guided by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.  “Staff of the Office of the Child and Youth Advocate are delighted to support this child-centered collaborative response to protecting PEI children and youth during this global COVID-19 pandemic. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child provides a valuable framework to guide this important initiative,” said Rona Smith, Executive Director for Office of the Child and Youth Advocate. Key objectives of the provincial table include:  Establish the need and priorities for children and youth; Address gaps and areas of concern related to children and youth;  Identify supportive structures and processes for children and youth;  Facilitate assessment and engagement; and, Ensure monitoring evaluation and reporting related to matters concerning children and youth. The PEI Children and Youth Table will work within the legislative and regulatory practices that are currently in place within Prince Edward Island, while finding opportunities for efficiency and enhancement until the Child and Youth Advocate is appointed. Upon appointment, the future of any formal structure/group would then be under the jurisdiction of the Office of the Child and Youth Advocate and the independent office will have authority over scope, membership, roles and functions thereafter.

Islanders rely on our roadways and vehicles to get to work, support their household and move goods and services. Driving can also be a dangerous endeavor at the best of times as motorists have to be mindful of both their actions on the road and the actions of drivers around them.  Every year, hundreds of Islanders are injured or lose their lives in motor vehicle accidents, many of which are preventable. We can all make safer choices before getting behind the wheel – drive the speed limit or consider driving slower based on weather and road conditions, refrain from driving when impaired, wear your seat belt and don’t text while driving.    Road safety happens through the efforts of many. This week, I encourage all Islanders to think about the actions they can take to protect themselves, their loved ones and fellow motorists when driving.”   Media Contact: 	Amanda Hamel 	Executive Director, Communications and Public Affairs 	Office of the Premier 	(902) 368-4400ahamel@gov.pe.ca      Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

As a province, we are fortunate to have more than 2,000 nurse professionals – nurse practitioners, registered nurses and licensed practical nurses – working in a variety of settings across our province.

It is because of our collective efforts and the leadership of Dr. Morrison and her team that we are in a position to move a little more quickly, but with continued caution, to allow for greater flexibility to interact with family and friends.”  - Premier Dennis King  Beginning today:  Members of the same household may gather indoors with up to 5 other individuals from different households. Members of the same household may gather outdoors with up to 10 other individuals from different households. Maintaining physical distancing is important during any gatherings with those from outside your household.  You may extend your household unit by one or two members, who are important to supporting your household or who you feel may need closer contact and support (ex: hug, handshake, etc.) “We know that limiting our close interactions with others is our best defense against COVID-19.  But we also know that there are people who are feeling isolated or who have loved ones in need,” said Dr. Heather Morrison. “As Prince Edward Island now has no evidence of active COVID-19, we will now permit indoor and outdoor gatherings of a limited size, while maintaining physical distancing as much as possible.” Islanders are asked to consider the risks when gathering to protect their household and loved ones. This means considering postponing gatherings with those who may be of increased risk such as those who are older or immunocompromised, anyone who has traveled in the past two weeks, or anyone who is feeling sick.  It is important to note that key public health measures have not changed and that will continue to be important:  Self-isolating for 14 days if you have recently traveled out of province; practicing physical distancing of two-metres;  staying home when you are sick; washing your hands; and, covering your cough. Increased testing and enhanced screening at the points of entry will also continue. With increased interaction in the days and weeks to come, Islanders are encouraged to keep a log of the people that they’ve had contact with.  This will help the Chief Public Health Office to do contact tracing for any new cases.  For more information about Renew PEI, Together, visit www.princeedwardisland.ca/renewPEI.  Backgrounder:  The Chief Public Health Office continues to work closely with the federal government, provincial and territorial counterparts, government departments and Health PEI to continue to monitor the situation globally, nationally and locally. The public health risk of COVID-19 is continually reassessed and Islanders will be updated as new information becomes available. Government’s special situation response group also continues to work collaboratively with the Chief Public Health Office, stakeholders and community partners in preparing for all impacts related to COVID-19 to the province, including health, social and economic.  Everyone is encouraged to follow routine prevention measures: Washing hands frequently with soap and water Cough and sneeze into your elbow or a tissue If ill with acute respiratory symptoms, stay home if possible Limit touching your eyes, nose and mouth Don’t share items like drinking glasses and water bottles Frequently clean surfaces like taps, doorknobs and countertops Media Contact: 	Samantha Hughes 	Health and Wellness 	(902) 368-5610shughes@gov.pe.ca      Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "
143,2020-05-07,Canada,Prince Edward Island,,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/province-announces-support-for-essential-workers-small-business-and-fisheries,Government Website,"Province announces support for essential workers, small business and fisheries","                 Today, the Province of Prince Edward Island announced additional investments to support essential workers, small businesses, and the fishing and aquaculture industries as the province moves into its renewal phase of the pandemic.  This includes a wage top-up for certain essential workers, support to help businesses ensure the health and safety of their staff and customers and new programs to help impacted fishers.  Minister of Finance Darlene Compton announced the $16.7 million COVID-19 Incentive to Support Essential Workers. This temporary wage top-up program is for Island workers employed by any business or organization, including for-profit, non-profit or other entity providing essential services, as defined by the Prince Edward Island Chief Public Health Office. The list of essential services can be found at Essential and Non-Essential Services: COVID-19. Essential workers who have been working through the pandemic and make less than $3,000 per four-week period will receive a one-time payment of $1,000 through their employers. Approximately 17,000 Islanders will benefit from this incentive. Employers can fill out the application form on behalf of their eligible employers by visiting the COVID-19 business page.  “The effects of the COVID-19 have been wide spread, placing unimaginable demands on our people, our economy and our resources. Essential workers in sectors that support our food supply chain, transportation, health care and other areas have remained unwavering in their commitment to serving Islanders during these exceptionally challenging times,” said Minister Compton. “On behalf of all Islanders, I want to thank our essential workers and the important role they are playing. It is the hard work and resiliency of our Island workforce that made and will continue to make our economy strong.” Minister of Fisheries and Communities Jamie Fox announced two new programs designed to assist fisheries and aquaculture operators who may be negatively impacted by economic conditions related to COVID-19.  The Prince Edward Island Fish Emergency Loan Program, a targeted loan portfolio offered by Finance PEI and the PEI Credit Unions, will provide loans up to $25,000 to Islander harvesters at 4 per cent interest over a five-year term. The principal will be deferred for the first 18 months. In addition, the Department of Fisheries and Communities will pay interest on behalf of the borrower for the first 18 months.  The Interest Relief Program will support fish harvesters with up to 12 months of interest relief and service debt costs on a maximum of $250 million at an average interest rate of 5 per cent. Fish harvesters that can demonstrate a 30 per cent or more decrease in fish-related revenues for the 2020 fishing season will be eligible.  “Our Island fishing and aquaculture sectors have long played an important role in strengthening our economy. They continue to show great leadership in the face of COVID-19, taking appropriate steps to ensure they can operate safely in these unprecedented times,” said Minister Fox. “While the pandemic has meant uncertainty in the marketplace, we know that the industry can rebound over time because of our province’s reputation for high quality, world-class seafood. These programs will help support our Island fishing families in the meantime.” Minister of Economic Growth, Tourism and Culture Matthew MacKay announced the COVID-19 Workspace Adaption Assistance Fund to help small businesses purchase and install protective measures such as plexiglass dividers or handwashing stations to safeguard employees and customers.  Businesses can receive up to $2,000 and the program will be retroactive to March 16th to support businesses that have already put measures in place to operate safely.  Renew PEI, Together outlines the gradual reopening of businesses, services and public spaces. The plan will be implemented in four distinct phases with a progressive lifting of public health measures on individuals, communities and organizations over three-week periods. Renew PEI, Together is a general plan for Prince Edward Island. However, organizations and businesses are not required to re-open at the initiation of the relevant phase and may choose to continue operations in a manner and timeline they are comfortable with.  Businesses open to the public must take every reasonable step to minimize interactions of individuals within 2 metres and implement enhanced cleaning and disinfection of shared areas and surfaces. The Chief Public Health Office has developed a reference guide and operational plan template to help support businesses and organizations. The template can be found through the Renew PEI, Together website. Businesses and organizations that have questions can email envhealth@ihis.org. “There is no crystal ball as to how COVID-19 will impact our economy long term, but by preparing now and putting the right measures in place, including enhanced safety measures for staff and customers, we can start to work toward recovery,” said Minister of Economic Growth, Tourism and Culture Matthew MacKay. “We know that the last few weeks have been incredibly challenging for Island businesses and we want to ensure that they can get through this as best as possible.” Additionally, Minister MacKay provided an update on the opening of all provincial golf courses, day parks and campgrounds.  All provincial day parks will open Friday, June 5, including the mountain bike trails at Brookvale. Brudenell River Golf Course and The Links at Crowbush Cove will open Friday, May 15 and Dundarave Golf Course will open Friday, May 22. All provincial campgrounds will open for the season on Friday, June 26. However, at this time, they will only be open for Islanders who booked their seasonal campsite prior to March 31, 2020.

The bursary amounts were doubled over last year to encourage more students work in agriculture.  These employment initiatives build on provincial supports announced in recent weeks in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including direct support for the potato industry as well as AgriStability and AgriInsurance programs to support agriculture producers and processors.  Minister Thompson also recognized the leadership and efforts Island producers and processors who are doing their part to protect the health and well-being Islanders by working with the Chief Public Health Office to put guidelines and measures in place, including personal protective equipment, to protect workers and the agriculture community from COVID-19.      “People working in agriculture right now are supporting the food system and PEI’s economy; agriculture is an essential service that is vital to the well-being of Islanders and our province,” said Minister Thompson. “Our agriculture community continues to be resilient in the face of a challenging situation. We will continue to do what we can to support them. I welcome the federal government’s aid package announced earlier today that will further help our farmers and processors, and look forward to working with my federal counterpart to get much needed financial support into the hands of our agriculture industry as quickly as possible.”  To register to be connected through the Agriculture Labour Support Initiative, job seekers and agricultural employers can visit www.workpei.ca/alsi.

Normal angling regulations, as well as guidelines related to COVID-19, will be in effect.  ""Thank you to of PEI’s anglers and fishers who remained patient and vigilant in our efforts to protect Islanders from COVID-19 as it spread across the country and the world. Islanders have a deep connection to the outdoors. It is because of our concerted effort that the province is in the position it is to ease public health measures carefully."" - Environment, Water and Climate Change Minister Natalie Jameson  Minister Jameson encouraged Islanders to use the online e-licensing option, and to continue to follow public health advice. Outdoor gatherings of more than five people from different households are not permitted. This includes for camping and camps, as well as fishing out of boats. Licenses are being distributed to vendor locations across the Island starting Thursday, April 30.

152,2020-04-28,Canada,Prince Edward Island,,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/province-outlines-plans-renew-pei-together,Government Website,"Province outlines plans to “Renew PEI, Together”","                 Today, Prince Edward Island Premier Dennis King and Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Heather Morrison outlined the province’s safe, measured plan to ease public health restrictions related to COVID-19 for Islanders. Renew PEI, Together outlines the guiding principles and phased approach to the reopening of businesses, services and public spaces. The first phase will begin Friday, May 1.    “Over the past several weeks, Prince Edward Islanders have experienced the most challenging health, social and economic circumstances in recent memory, but Islanders have met the challenges posed by the global pandemic head on with determination and resolve. We have all rapidly changed the way we live, learn, work and play to protect ourselves, our neighbours and our communities. It is because of this concerted effort that the province is in the position it is to ease public health measures carefully.” - Premier Dennis King  The plan will be implemented in four distinct phases with a progressive lifting of public health measures on individuals, communities and organizations over three-week periods. Progression will be gradual and constantly evaluated based on the latest public health information from PEI’s Chief Public Health Office. Decisions during each phase will be based on public health evidence and continuous monitoring. If there are concerns about progressing into a next phase, progress will be slowed, halted or even reversed to continue to protect the health and safety of Islanders.  “As we move cautiously, but optimistically, forward it is important to understand that this phased approach does not mean business as usual. All services, businesses, and organizations are going to need to modify their operations in light of COVID-19,” said Dr. Heather Morrison. “It is our collective action that will contribute to the success of this plan. Together, we can safely renew Prince Edward Island and carve a path forward for living with COVID-19.”  Priority non-urgent health care services will begin May 1. This includes certain elective surgeries and other priority services (e.g. cardiac supports, cancer screening) and select health service providers including, for example, physiotherapists, optometrists, opticians, chiropractors, foot care providers, occupational therapy and naturopaths. Where possible and feasible, other health care delivery will continue virtually.  Also beginning May 1, outdoor gatherings and non-contact outdoor recreational activities of no more than five individuals from different households, while maintaining physical distancing, will be permitted. This includes recreational fishing, golf courses and current PEI residents going to their own seasonal properties. In addition, select outdoor and construction services – landscaping, road construction, indoor construction projects, watershed clean-up and outdoor photography – will be allowed with proper physical distancing practices in place.  For the foreseeable future, border screening will continue at points of entry and all persons entering the province will be required to self-isolate for 14 days.  Visitor restrictions in long-term care facilities will be maintained as well as priority public services, child care for essential service workers and home-based learning options.  Further information about the plans for the education system and student learning will be provided later this week.  Renew PEI, Together is a general plan for Prince Edward Island. However, organizations and businesses are not required to re-open at the initiation of the relevant phase and may choose to continue operations in a manner and timeline they are comfortable with. Any organization or business that is unsure may seek direction from the Chief Public Health Office.   For the most up-to-date information, please visit www.princeedwardisland.ca/renewPEI.

We will continue to work with and for the people of this province as we navigate the uncertainties we are all facing.” Finance Minister Compton welcomes the oversight the Auditor General will offer to ensure programs and services developed to address the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are delivered to meet their intended targets, and Island taxpayer dollars are spent responsibly. The Department of Finance is committed to maintaining strong lines of communication and transparency to support this important oversight work. “We remain committed to helping Islanders, especially during these challenging times. It is more important than ever that we ensure money is there so that these relief programs can continue to help,” said Finance Minister Darlene Compton. “As we look at easing public health measures and re-opening the economy, the Province will do what is needed to support our industries and, at the same time, I also encourage all Islanders to consider supporting and buying local as much as possible. We will need the help of all Islanders to get through this together.” Islanders, businesses and industries can continue to apply for support under the broad suite of provincial relief and bridge programs online at www.princeedwardisland.ca/COVID19 or by calling toll-free 1-833-533-9333. “Islanders’ creativity and hard work have built our province to be what it is today and in these hard times, government has to step up to lend them a helping hand and that’s what we are doing,” said Matthew MacKay, Minister of Economic Growth, Tourism and Culture. “We are rolling out programs quickly to reach as many Islanders as possible and we will continue to be flexible to help those who drive our economy get through this and be as equipped as possible for a strong comeback when the ease back plan can begin.” The Government of Prince Edward Island continues to work with the Government of Canada to ensure that programs being offered are representative of the needs of Islanders and that programs implemented by the province will not be clawed back by the federal government.  	The Province also announced that necessary regulatory changes have been made that will allow ferment on premise businesses to begin operating effective April 25, 2020. These changes will allow locations to brew, bottle, and deliver products to Islanders, as they continue to abide by the direction of the Chief Public Health Office in ensuring the continued safety of their clients.

It is in our very nature to want to reach out, to hold our loved ones close and be together in moment of heartache, but because of the COVID-19 pandemic it’s not possible at this time. Even though we cannot physically be together, we must call on our inner strength to find a different way in sharing our sorrow.” - Premier Dennis King   Islanders are invited to honour the victims, their families and loved ones by sharing an online message of condolence at www.princeedwardisland.ca/nscondolences.   Beginning at 8:00 p.m. this evening, and every evening until the end of April, the Prince Edward Island government administration building (Shaw Building) in Charlottetown will be lit up in blue to honour the victims and show the province’s support for Nova Scotians, the RCMP and all those grieving.  Nova Scotian music will also be heard around the government complex and an artistic metal crafted silhouette of Nova Scotia will be placed in front of the Shaw Building as a show of solidarity. The metal artwork was produced locally by Atlantic Advantage Power Technologies. Flags have been flying at half-mast across all provincial buildings since the beginning of the week. “I have seen so many examples of Islanders sharing their grief for our neighbours and for their fellow Islanders who have been touched by this tragedy. There is a long tradition of storytelling and sharing in times of grief that offer comfort and can bring our homes a little closer together as we stay apart,” added Premier King. “Anyone who wants to share a memory, a message of sympathy or a story please add them to our book of condolences.” The Government of Nova Scotia also invites condolences on Facebook at StrongerTogetherNS or by email to condolences@novascotia.ca.

Since yesterday, PEI has received 119 new negative COVID-19 test results. There have been a total of 26 positive COVID-19 cases in the province, 24 of which are now recovered.   New testing criteria and the addition of more groups to be regularly tested is now being updated. Individuals currently being tested include: anyone experiencing symptoms related to COVID-19, close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases, anyone admitted to hospital or Intensive Care Units with respiratory symptoms, residents being admitted to long term care and residents in a long term care facility who is experiencing symptoms. New testing criteria will expand to include staff members who work at more than one long term care facility. There are also discussions underway to consider testing for long haul truckers residing in PEI. Dr. Morrison reminded Islanders that to get to the point where restrictions can be safely eased back, public health measures in place now must continue. This includes self-isolation when required, staying home as much as possible, physical distancing when in public and good hand washing. She clarified that Islanders should still not visit with anyone they do not live with, even if it is in an outdoor setting.   For answers to general questions about COVID-19 call 1-833-533-9333 or visit our webpage at: www.princeedwardisland.ca/covid19.  Backgrounder:  The Chief Public Health Office continues to work closely with the federal government, provincial and territorial counterparts, government departments and Health PEI to continue to monitor the situation globally, nationally and locally.

It is important for not only our economy and food supply, but also our culture and tradition that they remain productive during the pandemic,” said Premier Dennis King. “As our province deals with the consequences of COVID-19, government is committed to working with partners to ensure our primary industries can remain strong and resilient.” In order to support the potato industry of Prince Edward Island, the Province of Prince Edward Island is working with producers and processors to provide $4.7 million towards shipping and storage costs of potatoes for processing. This investment will help mitigate a potato surplus resulting from market conditions related to COVID-19.  Additionally, through the Department of Agriculture and Land’s Business Risk Management (BRM) Programs, the province will help farmers manage risks that threaten the viability of their farm operations. Minister of Agriculture and Land Bloyce Thompson announced up to $8.8 million in support for farmers through the BRM programs for the next two years.  The AgriStability Program package includes paying the provincial portion of the costs to increase the coverage level for producers enrolled in the program from 70 per cent to 85 per cent, and removing the reference margin limit which will have a positive impact on the livestock industry. In addition, the province is offering interim payments of up to 75 per cent to get funding into producer’s hands in a timely manner.  When combined, this will provide an estimated $5.6 million in support for farmers over two years.  The AgriInsurance Program will offer a 10 per cent discount on the producer’s share of insurance premiums, saving farmers an estimated $3.2 million over two years.  These programs are made available through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership, a $3 billion, five-year investment by federal, provincial and territorial governments to strengthen the agriculture, agri-food and agri-based products sector.  “The current global situation is creating uncertainty for our farm community and immediate support is necessary for the sustainability of our agriculture industry and the long-term strength of our food supply system,” said Minster Thompson. “By supporting the industry, and our farm families and workers, our province can retain economic strength and prepare for a return to full economic activity.” Minister Thompson also encouraged farmers, farm families and farm workers who need them to access the mental health supports available through www.FarmersTalk.ca. Minister of Fisheries and Communities Jamie Fox thanked the federal department of Fisheries and Oceans, the Prince Edward Island Fisherman’s Association, and Chief Public Health Office for their partnership to open the spring lobster fishery on May 15.  “While not the opening date that ever fisher wanted, it is encouraging to see that we will have a spring lobster season as many Islanders rely on jobs on the boats and in the processing plants,” said Minister Fox.  “The industry has shown great leadership in this difficult and unprecedented time and are taking health and safety precautions seriously, working with the province and Chief Public Health Office to put guidelines in place to protect themselves, their coworkers and the community from this illness. Islanders look forward to their first feed of lobster as we ease back into a new normal for our province.” Additionally, Minister Fox thanked municipal governments for the precautions they have put in place to protect their communities and reminded them that the province’s Rural Growth Initiative is available to help small communities and rural organizations. He also reminded employers of opportunities to apply for wage supports through various programs being offered through the Employment Development Agency and Skills PEI.  For more information on the provincial government’s response to COVID-19, including resources, program applications and important public health information, visit: www.princeedwardisland.ca/COVID19.  Media contact: 	Amanda Hamel 	Executive Director, Communications and Public Affairs 	Office of the Premier 	(902) 368-4400 ahamel@gov.pe.ca      Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

PEI’s rate of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people is 19. All cases in have been related to travel outside the province.  Dr. Morrison reminded Islanders that all travel into the province must be essential. All essential workers travelling to the province must self-isolate when not working. Compassionate visits are being looked at on a case by case basis.  Health PEI’s Chief of Nursing, Marion Dowling, says work is now underway to coordinate a gradual reintroduction of health services. Individual services will each undergo a public health risk assessment.  Dowling reminded Islanders that anyone in PEI who is experiencing symptoms related to COVID-19 should call their physician, nurse practitioner or call 811.

The programs and services that Islanders rely on are still available. They may look a little different as we have minimized physical contact, but we have not minimized care.” - Premier Dennis King  Today, the Province added a mental health and addictions information service via the COVID-19 Response Line. Any Islander can access this service by calling toll-free 1-833-533-9333. Calls will be answered by trained mental health and addictions staff from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday to Friday. “We recognize that many Islanders are feeling stressed or anxious because of COVID-19. Islanders living with mental illness or struggling with addiction may be feeling particularly vulnerable because of the need for public health measure such as isolation and physical distancing. I want all Islanders to know that you are not alone, we are here for you and help is available,” said Health and Wellness Minister James Aylward.   Mental health and addictions services through Health PEI continue to be offered while following the recommendations of the Chief Public Health Officer for physical distancing and as the health care system prepares for the potential demand for emergency care. ""It is critical that we support the efforts of Dr. Heather Morrison. This means we are working to provide mental health and psychiatry supports to patients in their own homes as much as possible,” said Dr. Heather Keizer, Chief of Mental Health and Addictions with Health PEI. “We are also working hard to keep admissions to hospital to a minimum by intervening early. We want Islanders to know we are available and able to provide support and connections by telephone and video even when we must be separate physically."" In order to take pressure off the of the QEH and PCH Emergency Departments, Psychiatric Urgent Care Clinics have been established at Hillsborough Hospital in Charlottetown and at the Prince County Hospital in Summerside, where patients with serious psychiatric issues, potentially in need of admission, can be seen and assessed by multiple disciplinary teams and by a telehealth psychiatrist, as necessary. The Charlottetown Psychiatric Urgent Care Clinic is open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. at Hillsborough Hospital seven days a week. The Summerside Psychiatry Urgent Care Clinic is opening this week.  Community Mental Health and Addictions continues to provide assessment, counselling, and programming, but is moving to delivering these services by telephone. One-on-one counselling can be provided by phone call and group programming will be offered by conference call. Call-in clinics for both mental health services and addictions programming have been developed in communities across the province to replace walk-in clinics. No appointment or referral is required and Islanders in need are able to speak to registered health care workers specialized in mental health and addictions who can offer support and, if needed, refer callers to other services for additional help.  The Strongest Families program for children and youth seeking help for mental health and other issues impacting health and well-being as well as the ICAN Adult Anxiety Program also continue. These and other e-mental supports can be found at www.bridgethegapp.ca/adult/online-programs. As a COVID response, the Transitional Unit for those recovering from addiction, which had been operating at the Provincial Addictions Treatment Facility, has temporarily moved to Queen Charlotte Junior High and is operating as a day program.   Health PEI is also working in partnership with community organizations such as Family Services PEI to provide online sessions for those dealing with increased anxiety due to COVID-19. Additional community supports are available through organizations such as the Canadian Mental Health Association, PEI Family Violence Prevention Services and Family Services PEI.  In addition, the Province will be providing Lennon Recovery House Association Inc. (Lennon House) with $365,000 in funding to help with start-up costs and initial capacity of seven beds. Using a holistic approach to recovery through peer-support workers who have experienced addictions themselves, Lennon House will be well-positioned to help support Islanders suffering from addiction and concurring mental health challenges with long-term transitional housing.

161,2020-04-21,Canada,Prince Edward Island,,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/province-planning-easing-public-health-measures,Government Website,Province planning for easing of public health measures ,"                 Premier Dennis King and Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Heather Morrison say a phased-in approach to easing back on public health measures in Prince Edward Island could begin as early as May 1. The approach, called “Re-opening PEI, together”, will focus on public health and safety and requires Islanders to act smartly, cautiously and methodically. The framework for how and when public health measures could be lifted is being developed, ensuring there is time to conduct risk assessments as testing and surveillance continue.   “Today, we are able to talk about moving toward re-opening our province because Islanders have taken their responsibility seriously, following the public health directions laid out by Dr. Morrison. Prince Edward Island is in a strong, and rather unique, position as we have done very well in containing COVID-19. We are not done yet. We will need to Islanders to continue to be patient, understanding and be part of the process as we cautiously take steps towards easing public health measures. We need to keep Islanders safe, and we need to do it together.” - Premier Dennnis King  Public health officials are looking at initially easing public measures related to some outdoor activities and non-urgent health care services such as elective surgeries. Before this can happen, several factors will be taken into consideration, including:   whether there has been community transmission; whether there have been any outbreaks; and, supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), especially at long-term care homes.  “Each of us has a role to play, and it is extremely important that Islanders continue to follow public health measures if we want to gradually lift some of the restrictions currently in place,” said Dr. Morrison. “This phased-in approach to easing public health measures will be dynamic, and will be reviewed and adjusted frequently in order to keep Islanders safe and contain the spread of COVID-19 in our province. It is important that we continue to maintain strong screening measures at points of entry into our province and test anyone experiencing symptoms related to the virus throughout this process in an effort to protect our most vulnerable Islanders.”  More details on the phased-in approach to easing public health measures will be shared with Islanders in the days and weeks ahead.  For more information about COVID-19, call 1-833-533-9333 or visit our webpage at www.princeedwardisland.ca/COVID19.  Backgrounder:  The Chief Public Health Office continues to work closely with the federal government, provincial and territorial counterparts, government departments and Health PEI to continue to monitor the situation globally, nationally and locally. The public health risk of COVID-19 is continually reassessed and Islanders will be updated as new information becomes available. Government’s special situation response group also continues to work collaboratively with the Chief Public Health Office, stakeholders and community partners in preparing for all impacts related to COVID-19 to the province, including health, social and economic.  Everyone is encouraged to follow routine prevention measures:  Washing hands frequently with soap and water Cough and sneeze into your elbow or a tissue If ill with acute respiratory symptoms, stay home if possible Limit touching your eyes, nose and mouth Don’t share items like drinking glasses and water bottles Frequently clean surfaces like taps, doorknobs and countertops  Media Contact: 	Samantha Hughes 	Health and Wellness 	(902) 368-5610 shughes@gov.pe.ca      Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

163,2020-04-16,Canada,Prince Edward Island,,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/prince-edward-island-declares-state-emergency,Government Website,Prince Edward Island declares a state of emergency,"                 To further enhance and support existing efforts to protect the health, safety and welfare of Islanders, the province has today declared a state of emergency and renewed the state of public health emergency. Premier Dennis King extended the state of public health emergency initially declared under the Public Health Act on March 16 for an additional 30 days to ensure Prince Edward Island’s Chief Public Health Officer continues to have the necessary authority to lead the province’s ongoing public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.   “From the beginning, I have said we will take our direction in navigating this unprecedented situation from Dr. Morrison. She has been steadfast in doing what is right to keep Islanders safe and we must continue to follow her lead. We have been clear in our commitment to supporting her efforts, as she needs us to do right now, and we will not hesitate to make difficult decisions quickly to help our province get through this pandemic. Together, we can and we will persevere through this.” - Premier Dennis King  To further support the provincial public health response to the global pandemic, and following discussions with Dr. Morrison, Justice and Public Safety Minister Bloyce Thompson today confirmed that a state of emergency is being declared across the province until the end of the month under the Emergency Measures Act. This additional state of emergency complements the existing authority set out in the public health order and enables a more efficient deployment of resources that will assist the Chief Public Health Officer’s guidance to protect Islanders, particularly through enhanced controls and screening at points of entry. The Emergency Measures Organization, under the direction of the Minister of Justice and Public Safety, will support the Chief Public Health Office in controlling access at various points of entry to the province, along with any other access points to the province and, where applicable, direct individuals to leave Prince Edward Island. This includes, but is not limited to, the Confederation Bridge, the Charlottetown airport, ferry terminals at Wood Islands and Souris, as well as any port, harbour, wharf, launching, beach, and any part of the provincial shoreline.  “Dr. Morrison has been a strong leader for all Islanders through this pandemic,” said Minister Thompson. “Putting this order through today, and further engaging the Emergency Measures Organization and law enforcement, will give her more tools at her disposal to do what is needed to protect the health and safety of Islanders. Let’s continue doing what she asks of us every day so that we can come out of this on top.” During the period of the state of emergency, individuals travelling to Prince Edward Island will be required to disclose the purpose of their travel to determine if it is deemed essential or not as per the direction of the Chief Public Health Office to the Emergency Measures Organization by email publicsafety@gov.pe.ca or by phone 902-894-0385. This process will complement current border controls and screenings in place in both New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.  The state of emergency will be in effect from April 17, 2020 at 8:00 a.m. to April 30, 2020 at 11:59 p.m.  For the latest information visit www.princeedwardisland.ca/covid19 or for non-travel related inquiries, call 902-368-5025.

In total, up to $66 million in support will be provided to meet the immediate needs of the tourism industry.   “This time of year is typically a busy one for our tourism operators as they would be preparing to showcase our Island’s culture and hospitality to millions of travelers but this year is anything but normal as we deal with the world-wide economic downturn due to COVID-19. Our government has been working with our tourism industry to address the immediate needs, develop short-term strategies to adapt and determine long-term plans to ensure Prince Edward Island’s reputation as a top tourist destination can be maintained going forward.” - Premier Dennis King  Minister of Economic Growth, Tourism and Culture Matthew Mackay announced a new $50 million tourism assistance loan facility through Finance PEI, with maximum financing of up to $1 million at 4 per cent interest available for working capital. Both the principal payments on the loan, as well as interest, will be deferred for the first 18 months.  Additionally, Minister MacKay announced that the province will provide interest relief on existing loans to tourism business for up to 18 months.  	Recognizing the need to support the tourism industry’s quick recovery, Minister MacKay announced $1 million towards expanded marketing. As well, the province is waiving the licensing, inspection and Tourism PEI advertising fees for the 2020 operating season.  Non-profit organizations that have received funding from Tourism PEI and/or the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA) for events that have been canceled as a result of COVID-19 will be fully compensated for all eligible expenses.  The Province of Prince Edward Island continues to work with its federal counterparts to initiate new programs and expand existing programs to support seasonal workers, including those in the tourism industry.  “Our tourism sector has been hard hit due to COVID-19 and is facing many challenges as our country and the world implements measures to protect the health and safety of citizens,” said Minister MacKay. “There is not a simple solution or a crystal ball to figure out when we will get back to normal or what our new normal will look like but tourism operators should know that the provincial government is here for you and that we will work with you to make sure you can continue to operate and contribute to what makes Prince Edward Island so special.” Minister of Agriculture and Land Bloyce Thompson announced the expansion of the successful Island Producers Helping Producers initiative to support rural Islanders in need. The initiative is a partnership of the Province of Prince Edward Island, Amalgamated Dairies Limited (ADL) and the PEI Potato Board.  Drive-thru pick up will be set up at the following locations this Saturday from 10 a.m. until 1 p.m. or while supplies last:    Westisle Composite High School (39570 Western Road, Elmsdale)   Bluefield High School (924 Colville Road, North Wiltshire)   Rodd Brudenell River Resort (86 Dewars Lane, Cardigan)   To support physical distancing, Islanders are asked to remain in their vehicles while volunteers place the care package in the trunk.  	The Province is reaching out to community groups that support vulnerable Islanders who may not have transportation and will work with them to set aside packages for those in need, when possible.  “As Islanders, we are generous and caring by nature and our Island producers take pride in their ability to help feed Island families,” said Minister Thompson. “During this difficult and uncertain time, it has been no different and Islanders continue to offer their help to friends, neighbours and our communities. By working together, supporting each other, and following the lead of the Chief Public Health Officer, we will get through this crisis and come out stronger because of it.” The Island Producers Helping Islanders initiative is intended to help Islanders and families in need; however, it is open to everyone. Islanders interested in making a donation in light of the free care package may do so online to a local charity of their choice.  Minister Thompson reminded Islanders that at any time, littering and dumping is illegal. While Island Waste Management Corporation sites continue to be closed to the public, regularly scheduled garbage pick-up continues. Islanders are able to include two additional bags with their carts, as always, and blue bag collection is still on schedule.  The Province also announced that in consultation with the Fire Marshal’s Office, all outdoor burning is prohibited on Prince Edward Island effective immediately. This includes recreational campfires unless the fire is contained in a fire pit with spark arrester screen or has a chimney with spark arrester.  The ban is in place to keep volunteer and government fire fighters safe as they are essential workers and almost all wildland fires on Prince Edward Island are the result of fires that have escaped from a controlled burn.  Existing 2020 burning permits issued by the Department of Environment, Water and Climate Change and the Fire Marshal’s Office are also suspended until further notice and no new permits will be issued.  For more information on the provincial government’s response to COVID-19, including resources, program applications and important public health information, visit: www.princeedwardisland.ca/COVID19.   Media contact: 	Amanda Hamel 	Executive Director, Communications and Public Affairs 	Office of the Premier 	(902) 368-4400 ahamel@gov.pe.ca Backgrounder Additional supports for tourism operators previously announced:  Private sector wage subsidies through the Jobs for Youth and Post-Secondary Employment Program have been increased from 50 per cent to 75 per cent.  Business Adaptation Advice Program covers the cost for businesses and entrepreneurs to hire a professional to provide advice and support on how to adapt or recover from the impacts of the pandemic.

In total, the Province will support the creation of 1,000 new job placements for Island high school and post-secondary students through increases to current employment programs and partnerships with community and industry as long as the jobs can follow the health and safety recommendations of the Chief Public Health Office.  “We know that Island post-secondary students have been negatively impacted as a result of this pandemic and the province is here to help. Whether they anticipated working over the summer to help pay the cost of their tuition and expenses or they were ready to embark on their first career after graduating, we have put supports in place to help. Every Islander is dealing with the unique challenges of COVID-19 and we need to be there to support those individual needs so that we can all get through this together.” - Premier Dennis King  The Province of Prince Edward Island has been working with the federal government and students’ unions to understand the economic challenges Island students are facing and fill potential gaps in funding currently available so that the immediate and long-term needs of students are met. Minister of Fisheries and Communities Jamie Fox announced an expansion of the Team Seafood program to encourage more Island youth to participate in the fishing and aquaculture industries. Through Team Seafood, the province provides a bursary, on top of employee wages, to high school or post-secondary students. The province will support 250 new placements through this program.

Projections by June 1, 2020:  Total hospital stays are estimated to be 120 with strong controls in place, and 14,000 with mild controls in place. Acute care bed needs are estimated to be 15 with strong controls in place, and 3,250 with mild controls in place. Critical care bed needs are estimated to be 4 with strong controls in place, and 840 with mild control measures in place. Total fatalities are estimated to be 9 with strong controls in place, and 900 with mild controls in place.  Dr. Morrison said next steps in modelling are to assess scenarios for modifying public health measures and testing strategies, to control the epidemic without overwhelming our health system. Premier Dennis King said the numbers demonstrate just how serious this pandemic is and why Islanders have been working so hard together to mitigate and contain the spread of COVID-19. Islanders should continue to adhere to public health advice, as we look toward the time when an ease back plan can be implemented. Premier King recognized that although the health needs of Islanders come first, there are other needs to be considered, such as social economic, community and education. “I am proud of the measures we have put in place and the cooperation we have had from Islanders,” said Premier King. “We have been successful to date because we are taking the Island approach of being in this together and we need to continue that approach in the name of reducing illness and saving lives in our province.” For answers to general questions about COVID-19 call 1-833-533-9333 or www.princeedwardisland.ca/covid19.

Farming has helped build our province and we will stand with our farmers and farm workers to help tackle the challenges of today and plan for our future.” - Agriculture and Land Minister Bloyce Thompson.  Minister Thompson announced a new $750,000 COVID-19 Strategic Fund for Agriculture under the Canada Agriculture Partnership to help commodities and small processors adapt to the pandemic. Eligible projects could include changing a workplace environment to accommodate physical distancing, doing more business on-line, or adjusting quickly to changing markets.  The Canadian Agricultural Partnership is a five-year, $37 million investment in strategic initiatives for Prince Edward Island agriculture by the federal and provincial governments. The agriculture minister also announced that the province is looking at ways to address some of the labour challenges facing the industry, including enhancing the Farm Team Student bursary. The bursary provides a financial incentive, on top of employee wages, to high school or post-secondary students who work in the agriculture industry. The province is adding a job matching service to the program so that job seekers can be paired quickly with farmers looking for workers this season.  To help support the health and well-being of Island farmers, Minister Thompson announced increased support for Farmers Talk. The program provides farmers, farm workers and their families with advice and counselling from individuals who understand the agriculture industry.  The Department of Agriculture and Land is currently reviewing all its programs to ensure they meet the most pressing needs of the agriculture industry. Minister Thompson reminded farmers to enroll in the suite of Business Risk Management programs offered through the province including Agri-Insurance, Agri-Invest and Agri-Stability. Minister Thompson thanked local producers, Amalgamated Dairies Limited (ADL) and the PEI Potato Board for their partnership on the Island Producers Helping Islanders initiative. This weekend, any Island family in need can receive a care package. Drive-thru pick up will be set up on Saturday from 10am until 3pm or while supplies last at the following locations:  Summerside: Credit Union Place parking lot (511 Notre Dame Street) Charlottetown: PEI Government Complex parking lot (Terry Fox Drive).  To support the health and safety of truck drivers and their loved ones, Minister of Transportation, Infrastructure and Energy Steven Myers announced a partnership with the PEI Trucking Sector Council, Emergency Measures Organization and Rodd Royalty Inn & Suites to make rooms available for truck drivers so they can practice self-isolation between trips.  “The trucking industry and truck drivers are providing an important, essential service during these challenging and uncertain times, ensuring the uninterrupted movement of goods like groceries and other essential supplies to Islanders and Canadians alike,” said Minister Myers. “We know that they are concerned about their own health and safety and that of their loved ones while traveling across provincial and territorial borders and we want to help them as much as they are helping us.” Truckers with a valid Class 1 license or equivalent from other jurisdictions are eligible for a significantly reduced fee of $20 per night billed directly to the driver’s company. Truck drivers can call 902-892-2253 for booking information, parking directions and availability.  Additionally, Minister Myers announced that a decision has been made, in conjunction with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, to delay the provincial recreational fishing season to June 1.  Anyone caught fishing out of season will be charged.  The Province of Prince Edward Island also announced it would be placing an indefinite moratorium on burning during the pandemic.  For more information on the provincial government’s response to COVID-19, including resources, program applications and important public health information, visit: www.princeedwardisland.ca/COVID19.  Media contact: 	Amanda Hamel 	Executive Director, Communications and Public Affairs 	Office of the Premier 	(902) 368-4400 ahamel@gov.pe.ca      Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

This is not a decision we have taken lightly. As Dr. Morrison has said, we are in an important time. How well we do at social distancing in the next few weeks will have an impact on the health and the lives of Islanders in the months to come. That means staying apart and avoiding contact at places like gas stations, boat launches and popular fishing and recreation spots.” - Environment, Water and Climate Change Minister Natalie Jameson  The delay applies to both inland and tidal water fisheries. It includes trout, Atlantic salmon, smelt, striped bass, mackerel, flounder, perch, scallop, softshell clam, bar clam, razor clam and mussels. It also closes all recreational shellfish until June 1, 2020. “When making this decision, we considered the need to protect our front-line staff like Conservation Officers and first responders. They are already working incredibly hard during this time to keep us safe. We need to stay apart to support them,” said Jamie Fox, Minister of Fisheries and Communities. “I talk regularly with my Atlantic and federal colleagues about how we can best protect public health while preserving our fisheries. I know the fishing community will do its part as we go through these difficult times.” Fisheries and Oceans Canada has made the necessary regulatory changes to support the delay.

175,2020-04-08,Canada,Prince Edward Island,,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/province-highlights-supports-and-awareness-family-violence-prevention,Government Website,Province highlights supports and awareness for family violence prevention,"                 Today, the Province of Prince Edward Island highlighted expanded partnerships and efforts to support safe and healthy families during COVID-19. A Special Cabinet Committee on Family Violence Prevention has been established to ensure parents, children, and individuals at risk of family violence have the proper resources available during this difficult and uncertain time. The committee consists of ministers and staff of the departments of Justice and Public Safety, Social Development and Housing and the Interministerial Women’s Secretariat. Minister of Justice and Public Safety Bloyce Thompson chairs the committee. “There is no doubt that the measures that governments and community are taking to protect the health and safety of Islanders are necessary during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Minister Thompson. “However, the threat of violence remains present in our communities and anyone facing those situations needs to know that we are still here to help. If anyone needs support, reach out.  Now, more than ever, is a time to come together and to look out for our Island family.” Minister Thompson stated that COVID-19 specific resources for individuals and families have been developed to address topics such as co-parenting,  how to support and answer questions from children and youth, and taking care of your mental health.  To help provide parents with techniques and strategies for handling parenting challenges, Minister of Social Development and Housing Ernie Hudson announced that the province has purchased 150 additional licenses for the Positive Parenting Program so more Islanders can access the program free of charge online. The Positive Parenting Program, commonly known as Triple P, is one of the most effective, evidenced-based parenting programs in the world. The program is available in English and French and each online session ranges from 30-60 minutes.  This week, Triple P launched a COVID-19 specific session for parents. Island parents interested in the program should visit www.triplep-parenting.ca/can-en/find-help/triple-p-parenting-in-prince-edward-island. Minister Hudson urged parents who need additional support to reach out to Child and Family Services. The primary goal of Child and Family Services is keeping children secure by offering support to parent and caregivers so that they can provide children with a safe, caring, healthy home.  “Staying apart doesn’t mean going it alone,” said Minister Hudson. “As Islanders, we are here to support one another; to lift up our neighbours and friends and ensure that no person feels unsafe, unvalued or unwanted. It is so very important that those who are in difficult situations know that they are not alone, that there is support available and that there are people who care about them and their well-being.” Minister responsible for the Status of Women Natalie Jameson reminded Islanders experiencing domestic abuse or violence who need to flee their homes that support is available and thanked individuals who continue to provide essential services to keep families safe during this difficult time.  “While people need to stay at home as much as possible, we know that not every home is safe,” said Minister Jameson. “Sometimes women need to leave to protect themselves and their children. It is important to know that during these times that help is available. There are still services for people who are experiencing violence. You are not alone and you will not be alone.”  For information, resources and community support available for family violence prevention, visit www.princeedwardisland.ca/familyviolenceprevention.   If you are in immediate danger, contact 9-1-1. If you suspect a child is being abused or neglected by a parent or guardian, by law you need to report it. Call Child Protection Services at 1-877-341-3101 or after hours 1-800-341-6868.

As a province, we are operating under the hope that there will be a spring fishing season. We know that there are many questions about the fishing sector and Islanders are seeking clarity and equity in the federal decision-making process.

Employers can apply by visiting princeedwardisland.ca/jobsforyouth. Approved businesses will be posted to the province’s website and young people will apply directly to the jobs that interest them. The Jobs for Youth Program normally supports 400 students annually. Minister Fox reiterated the province’s commitment to helping Islanders return to work and to help businesses and organizations hire the staff they need and that it will continue to review its programs to ensure that they best serve Islanders when the province moves into a period of recovery.  Minister of Education and Lifelong Learning Brad Trivers provided an update on initiatives through his department to support children, youth, teachers and essential workers during COVID-19 that include emergency child care services, at home learning, and the school food program which all began last week.  “During these unimaginable times, we are reminded of the very important role of our health care professionals, essential service workers and our educators,” said Minister Trivers. “Our schools are at the heart of our communities and they are reaching out to support our children and families in ways that we’ve never experienced before. We also recognize the enormous efforts of other organizations who are providing support and resources to Island children and families.”  Teachers are working closely with staff in the Department of Education and Lifelong Learning, the Public Schools Branch and Commission scolaire de langue française to provide the best home learning supports for Prince Edward Island’s 20,000 students.

Wearing a homemade cloth mask has not been proven to protect the person who is wearing it, and should not be used in replacement of public health measures. However, wearing a mask in public where social and physical distancing could be difficult may be appropriate to ensure the safety of the people and workers around you, for example public transit.   Health PEI’s Chief Nursing Officer, Marion Dowling, says plans for a virtual care platform to be used by physicians, nurse practitioners, and mental health and addictions will launch this week. This will allow health care providers to offer services, over a secure video platform, to improve access for patients while reducing the need for in-person visits.  Cough and fever clinics and drive thru testing clinics continue to run seven days a week in both Charlottetown and Summerside. This weekend, 148 patients were seen in Charlottetown and 63 patients in Summerside. Appointments to the cough and fever clinics are by referral from family physicians, nurse practitioners or 811.

The Province of Prince Edward Island will continue to work alongside the federal government, our local community leaders and all Islanders to put the necessary supports in place to us get through these unprecedented times, together.” - Premier Dennis King  To help address the non-health related impacts of COVID-19 on Islanders, the Province of Prince Edward Island announced an initial $25 million Emergency Contingency Fund to support new provincial programs and the expansion of current programs.

These supports have been substantial and comprehensive,” said Minister Myers. “However, we realize that every Islander has unique needs that may not be covered in the programs rolled out so far and we want to ensure that everyone is supported.” The COVID-19 Special Situations Fund will provide up to $1,000 to Islanders who have experienced urgent income loss as a result of COVID-19 and are not eligible for other federal and provincial funding support. Islanders are to review the various programs available and if they do not quality they may be eligible for support.  Islanders can call 1-833-533-9333 to apply for support under the fund, which will be available until June 16, 2020.  Social Development and Housing Minister Ernie Hudson provided updates on provincial initiatives to support community needs and also provided more details on the recently announced Temporary Rental Assistance Benefit to help Islanders whose income has been impacted by the pandemic.

The Office of the Attorney General filed a notice of application to the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island on March 26, 2020 seeking to suspend the enforcement of eviction orders to protect the health and safety of both Island tenants and sheriffs who are responsible for the enforcement of eviction orders.  On April 1, 2020, the Supreme Court of PEI held a hearing and a decision was made to support this application to suspend enforcement of eviction orders until the courts can resume regular operations. Anyone seeking an order for an eviction must follow the procedures of the Director or the Island Regulatory and Appeals Commission. On March 30, 2020, the Commission advised the public that the Rental Office will not hold hearings for non-payment of rent. It will only hold hearings for urgent matters, such as serious threats to the health and safety of tenants and landlords. “The COVID-19 pandemic has touched the lives of Islanders, Canadians and everyone around the world. During these difficult times, we know that it is filled with many challenges,” said Bloyce Thompson, Minister of Justice and Public Safety and Attorney General of Prince Edward Island. “With so much unknowns, government was looking for a temporary solution that would address the housing concerns of many Islanders.” “We appreciate the Court’s decision today. We recognize that this is not a complete solution but it is one of the many measures we are considering as part of our provincial response. As the situation continues to evolve, government will continue to adapt,” added Minister Thompson. “These decisions are not made lightly and it continues to be a delicate balance between, at times, conflicting interests.” Islanders looking for the latest information on the provincial response to the COVID-19 pandemic can visit www.princeedwardisland.ca/covid19    Media contact: 	Amanda Hamel 	Executive Director, Communications and Public Affairs 	Office of the Premier 	(902) 368-4400ahamel@gov.pe.ca 	       Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

The recently established Premier’s Economic Recovery Council, a strategic business working group made up of individuals from across business sectors, will leverage the experience, knowledge and ingenuity of the business community to advise the Premier on the issues being faced by the business community and opportunities as the province looks down the road to economic recovery.  “We want to work closely with businesses – those who drive our economy and have been responsible for our recent economic strength as a province – so that we are doing everything we can to minimize the economic impacts of COVID-19 on our province and looking to the future when we can set a course for recovery and return to normal,” said Premier King.   The initial Council held its first virtual meeting on Saturday and will continue to meet as required through the duration of the pandemic. The Council will consult broadly with other businesses and across all business networks as part of the “all-hands-on-deck” model.  As part of government’s efforts to support this initiative, the Premier also launched PEI Sourced Solutions, an online portal to help Island residents and businesses meet the challenges of the pandemic, including the need for medical supplies, virtual care services, or to share ideas on how the province can help businesses and industries weather the impacts of COVID-19.  “Islanders are innovative and resourceful, and we continue to see them stepping up to support each other during this unimaginable time. The new online portal will help connect provincial efforts and community supports so that we are ready and able to respond to the continued needs of our province going forward.

All cases are related to international travel and the individuals all self-isolated immediately upon return. Contact tracing is now underway.  Dr. Morrison is reminding Islanders that social distancing means physical distancing. Physical distancing means staying home as much as possible. If you need to go out for essential items, you should stay at least six feet away from others. Physical distancing does not mean visiting family and friends, having people over to your home, meeting up in groups outdoors, grocery shopping in groups, or playdates with children. If you do not live with someone, you should not be visiting with them.  Dr. Morrison reiterated that she does expect the situation on PEI to get worse.  Similar to what is being seen across the country, PEI will likely experience community transmission. She reminded Islanders that this is why practicing physical distancing, along with self-isolation upon return from travel, is so crucial in our efforts in slowing the spread of the virus here in PEI.  Screening measures have now been strengthened at the Confederation Bridge and the Charlottetown Airport. Additional information is being gathered from travelers, including where they are travelling from, where they are going, and if they have a support system to deliver supplies to them while they are in self-isolation.  The Chief Public Health Office has received 56 complaints of those failing to self-isolate upon return from travel outside the province. 26 of these resulted in a visit from an officer, 12 resulted in verbal warnings to self-isolate and nine resulted in a written warning for violating the Public Health Order.  	Those issued written warnings have been advised any further failure to comply will result in charges. A number of the 56 complaints received have more than one complaint against an individual.  Islanders experiencing symptoms (cough, fever, or shortness of breath) within 14 days after travelling outside the province should call 8-1-1 to be screened and, if necessary, directed for testing. Those requiring immediate medical attention should call 9-1-1.   For answers to general questions about COVID-19 call 1-833-533-9333 or visit: www.princeedwardisland.ca/covid19.  Backgrounder:  The Chief Public Health Office continues to work closely with the federal government, provincial and territorial counterparts, government departments and Health PEI to continue to monitor the situation globally, nationally and locally. The public health risk of COVID-19 is continually reassessed and Islanders will be updated as new information becomes available. Government’s special situation response group also continues to work collaboratively with the Chief Public Health Office, stakeholders and community partners in preparing for all impacts related to COVID-19 to the province, including health, social and economic.  Everyone is encouraged to follow routine prevention measures:  Washing hands frequently with soap and water Cough and sneeze into your elbow or a tissue If ill with acute respiratory symptoms, stay home if possible Limit touching your eyes, nose and mouth Don’t share items like drinking glasses and water bottles Frequently clean surfaces like taps, doorknobs and countertops  Media Contact: 	Samantha Hughes 	Health and Wellness 	(902) 368-5610 shughes@gov.pe.ca 	       Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

The measures put in place today are not unlike measures that have been put in place in other Canadian jurisdictions in recent days.  “These decisions aren’t made lightly and should signal to Islanders the seriousness of what’s before us with COVID-19. It is our collective responsibility to do our part, whether that is self-isolating, practicing social distancing or offering a helping hand to those in need. We are at a crucial point in the COVID-19 situation and the decisions we make now will help us in the long run.” - Premier Dennis King  The penalties outlined today for Islanders who do not comply include:  A fine of $1,000 for a first offence; A fine of $2,000 for a second offence; or, A fine of $10,000 for a third offence and every offence thereafter. 		  “Dr. Morrison has been giving Islanders expert advice daily on what we must do to contain the spread of COVID-19,” said Justice and Public Safety Minister Bloyce Thompson.

The time to act is now and our individual actions will have a direct impact on how successful we are in protecting the health and safety of everyone.” Islanders returning to Prince Edward Island from domestic or international travel must self-isolate for 14 days. Exceptions are being made for essential workers, including truck drivers, airline crews, essential public and private sector workers in critical sectors, as well as on compassionate grounds.  New screening measures have been put in place at all entry points into the province – Confederation Bridge, Charlottetown Airport and Magdalen Ferry Terminal.  “This is a significant adjustment for all of us and while people are understandably anxious about these changes, they are necessary changes to protect our community,” said Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Heather Morrison. “We don’t want to have to use these measures, but we will if we need to. Islanders need to go home and stay home.

As we move forward together in this, Islanders can expect that government will be alongside with you to support you,” said Minister Trivers.  We will be supporting licensed operators by ensuring: all child care spaces are maintained; staff are eligible for employment insurance benefits;  provincial operational grants and subsidies are continued; and the ability to apply for business support grants is provided.  Additionally, emergency child care services will be available to essential workers who have no other alternative during this pandemic.  If you are an essential service worker with children and require child care, please fill out the online form survey at Emergency Child Care Services.

210,2020-03-18,Canada,Prince Edward Island,,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/statement-premier-king-suspension-local-cbc-news-programming,Government Website,Statement from Premier King on the suspension of local CBC news programming,"   The Premier issued the following statement today in response to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation’s decision to suspend their local television news programming:  “I am incredibly disappointed in the Canadian Broadcast Corporation’s (CBC) decision to suspend local news broadcasts across the country, including Prince Edward Island’s own CBC News: Compass program.  I have been saying all along that these are unprecedented times, and the challenge we are facing with COVID-19, as a province and as country, is like nothing that we have ever seen before. The COVID-19 situation continues to evolve rapidly – hour by hour, and day by day – and we continue to see the emotional and economic impact it is having on Islanders and their families. With the health and safety of Islanders at the forefront, it is vital that we continue to share the latest information with Islanders in real time.  It is my opinion that now is not the time for the CBC to suspend its local news programming, and I will be bringing this up on my scheduled call with Deputy Prime Minister Freeland later today. I will also be reaching out to the Prime Minister to express my concerns.  Prince Edward Island is a largely rural province with varying internet connectivity to access local online news from CBC Prince Edward Island. Many Island seniors do not use the internet, have social media or pay attention to digital news platforms. They are our most vulnerable Islanders and need the most up-to-date information to properly protect themselves from COVID-19.  CBC News: Compass is the only local daily television news program in our province, and it provides a vital public service that keeps Islanders informed. The reach of CBC News: Compass into the living rooms of Island households, community and long-term care homes and seniors’ residences is essential now, more than ever. Our Chief Public Health Officer and government are working together to share important information, recommendations and directions for Islanders as we navigate the current state of public health emergency in our province and CBC News: Compass is a critical partner in helping us do this. As Premier of Prince Edward Island, I am formally requesting the Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault, as minister of the crown responsible for the CBC, exercise his authority and reverse the decision to suspend local news broadcasts. We will be contacting the Minister to discuss our concerns and ask him to intervene.  We acknowledge and share the CBC’s concern for the health and safety of their staff. CBC Prince Edward Island staff and journalists are our friends, neighbours and community partners. As a government, we are more than willing to work with local CBC station and national leadership to ensure continuity of the local CBC television news program in our province.  If we are going to get through this pandemic situation, we need to do so together and by leveraging all of the resources we have. Now is not the time to scale back.”        Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

It is advised that anyone on this flight should self-isolate for 14 days.  Dr. Morrison reminded Islanders to call ahead if you have a health-related appointment booked. If it is not considered essential, it may be rebooked.  She encourages Islanders to help support each other in different ways, like through telephone, FaceTime, Skype, e-mail and more.  Islanders with questions about COVID-19 should call PEI’s toll-free information line at 1-800-958-6400.

Premier King updated the mayor on provincial efforts to respond to both health and non-health related impacts of COVID-19 and asked for continued partnership to help minimize the short and long-term impact to Islanders. Three task groups have been established to provide rapid response to the potential non-health related impacts of COVID-19. This is in addition to the provincial COVID-19 situation response table which has been in operation for two weeks. The three groups are focused on economic and business support, labour and social supports, and the maintenance of essential services offered across government. A Joint Health Response Team has also been operational the past two weeks and the Emergency Measures Organization is activated. Mayor Brown offered the Premier his best wishes and updated the Premier on the efforts the municipality has taken including closures to recreation and community centres. The two discussed their shared desire to minimize economic disruptions, in particular the effects on the cruise ship industry and primary industries. The Mayor brought up the need to advocate to the federal government to expand Employment Insurance benefits to not only sick-leave benefits but all EI benefits. Premier King agreed this was a priority as well as ensuring those Islanders who are near the end of their EI benefits are not negatively impacted. The health and safety of Islanders is the greatest priority. The Province of Prince Edward Island is working closely with local, provincial, territorial and federal partners to minimize its health, economic and social impacts in Prince Edward Island and across the county. The overall risk to the province remains low at this time. Islanders with questions about COVID-19 should call PEI’s toll-free information line at 1-800-958-6400.

She is experiencing mild symptoms and is doing well at home.  It is strongly recommended to that Islanders follow the advice of the Chief Public Health Office and:  self-isolate for 14-days following out-of-country travel, whether experiencing symptoms or not. This includes teachers, students and health care workers.  cancel all non-essential travel outside of country.  reconsider attending social gatherings where a 2-meter distance between people is not possible, especially if elderly or immune-compromised people are present. Dr. Morrison clarified that the recommendation to self-isolate for two weeks following out-of-country travel applies to individuals who have returned from travel effective March 8, 2020, onward.  She also elaborated that essential travel means the movement of goods and the transportation of people across borders. This would apply to individuals such as truck drivers and airline crews. These individuals can continue their daily activities, including work; however, it is important that self-monitor daily. They should self-isolate and call 8-1-1 if they begin to experience symptoms.  If the person self-isolating is not showing symptoms, those living with them can continue daily activities as normal and follow good hygiene practices. If the person self-isolating is experiencing symptoms, those living with them should also self-isolate and monitor their symptoms until test results are confirmed.  Islanders with questions about COVID-19 should call PEI’s toll-free information line at 1-800-958-6400. The information line is taking messages 24-hours a day, 7 days a week and Islanders who leave messages will receive a call back within 24 hours from the Chief Public Health Office.  Islanders experiencing symptoms (cough, fever, or shortness of breath) within 14 days after international travel should call 8-1-1 to be screened and, if necessary, directed for testing.

Like many Islanders, my family and I had planned a spring trip several weeks ago. In the days prior to leaving, the details for the First Ministers Meetings in Ottawa were confirmed and arrangements were made for me to travel to Ottawa from Boston where I was located. My family and I drove to Boston early Wednesday morning and I boarded a plane for Ottawa on Thursday morning, having spent less than 24-hours in the United States. While enroute to Ottawa, the decision was made to cancel the in-person meetings with Premiers and the Prime Minister. Much changed over the 24-hour period between Wednesday and Thursday.   Earlier today, PEI’s Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Heather Morrison, issued new travel recommendations and precautions related to COVID-19. I have been in regular contact with Dr. Morrison on our general response to contain the virus and raised my particular circumstance with her as well.  While my risk of exposure to COVID-19 is considered extremely low and my family and I are feeling great – we are not experiencing any symptoms and do not believe that we have been in contact with anyone who is symptomatic – we will be following her expert advice, as all Islanders should, and self-isolating and self-monitoring at home for the next 14 days.  We are facing an unprecedented challenge in COVID-19. The health and safety of Islanders is our biggest concern. As Premier, I will continue to lead our overall government efforts to support our public health professionals in containing the virus and in responding to the community and economic challenges it is raising. I will work from a satellite office in my home. Meetings will take place virtually or over the phone until I am able to return to my government office.  I encourage all Islanders to follow the advice of Dr. Morrison and take the appropriate precautions to protect you and your family. Islanders are resilient, and we will get through this by working together and supporting one another.”   	    Media Contact: 	Amanda Hamel 	Executive Director, Communications and Public Affairs 	Office of the Premier 	(902) 368-4400ahamel@gov.pe.ca       Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

The operation will receive a federal investment of $446,642 under Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada’s Agricultural Clean Technology Program, $271,467 from the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA) Regional Economic Growth through Innovation program, $89,328 from the PEI Department of Agriculture and Land and $85,847 from Atlantic Grown Organics.   Atlantic Grown Organics has been using waste bio-products as fuel for the operation of its greenhouses. Their operation has been able to make use of bio-waste from a local oilseed processing plant but have been required to supplement this system with fuel oil.  Through this support, the farm will test and demonstrate the adaptation of a clean technology boiler system, a first of its kind to be installed in North America. The new boiler system will help turn the greenhouse operation into 100 per cent renewable heating, and promote the adoption of clean technologies in the sector. Quotes “This first of its kind technology to be installed in North America is a terrific example of how producers from coast-to-coast-to-coast are looking to ‘grow greener’. Our Government is committed to supporting research into sustainable agriculture practices. This project showcases how the ingenuity of our farm families in adopting new technologies can help Canada be a leader on sustainable farming and food.” - Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food “Growing the economy can compare to nurturing produce –both take time and require consistent effort and support to thrive. We are here to best equip entrepreneurs like Marc and Krista who are passionate about quality food, the environment and sustainable business practices to remain competitive.” - Mélanie Joly, Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages and Minister responsible for ACOA “Prince Edward Island’s government believes in agriculture that is progressive and dynamic, while being both financially sound and environmentally responsible. Clean, renewable energy projects are part of reducing the ecological footprint of this vital industry.” - Bloyce Thompson, Prince Edward Island Minister of Agriculture and Land “Greenhouses in our Canadian climate need a lot of energy and most greenhouses in Canada use fossil fuels for heat. Being able to grow local organic vegetables in a “green” way is certainly rewarding. There is a lot of risk in testing new technology. The funding from the Agricultural Clean Technology Program, ACOA and Canadian Agricultural Partnership Program was essential to lower the risk involved and realize the positive outcomes of the investment.” - Marc Schurman, owner of Atlantic Grown Organics  Quick Facts The Agricultural Clean Technology Program supports research, development and adoption of clean technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, generate a wide range of positive impacts on the environment from agricultural production, and promote sustainability and clean growth.

During the video consultation, nurses and other medical staff are on hand at Western Hospital to take the patient’s vitals, facilitate examination and testing or provide medications as needed.   “The award-winning virtual care model at Western Hospital is an excellent example of using new, innovative technology to reduce wait times and enhance rural health care for Islanders. Given the success we’ve seen so far we’re looking at expanding this model to Kings County Memorial Hospital to improve emergency department access for people and benefit communities in that area of the province as well.” - Health and Wellness Minister James Aylward  This model for ED care at Western Hospital is being offered as a pilot program and was developed collaboratively by Heath PEI and Maple, a Canadian virtual care provider.  “The response from our patients has been incredible and overwhelmingly positive,” said community hospitals west administrator Paul Young. “We are so excited to have partnered with Maple to create this innovative model that can help effectively reduce wait times for our patients, support the workload of our ED physician and help provide more stable, quality services to our patients.” “We count ourselves very lucky to have found a health system whose bold vision for Canadian healthcare matches ours,” said Dr. Brett Belchetz, a practicing emergency department physician and the CEO and Co-founder of Maple. “While Maple has demonstrated the potential of online health care for more than four years now — many days seeing more patients than the three busiest EDs in the country combined — we’ve made some of our most exciting strides alongside the teams at Western Hospital and Health PEI, who have enthusiastically embraced technological solutions that will drive innovation forward for the entire country.”     “I am very pleased to see this efficient approach to ED care at Western Hospital in addition to the other great supports such as the tele-rounding initiative to provide the best care possible to patients, said Minister Aylward. “This model also allows Western Hospital to offer some urgent care services to people even during times when physicians cannot be on-site at the hospital emergency department which is helping to enhance rural health overall.”    About Maple 	Maple is a technology platform that tackles some of the world’s most meaningful issues in healthcare, starting with timely and convenient access to doctors and other healthcare providers. It allows patients to connect directly with doctors for medical care in minutes from their smartphone or computer 24/7, and also provides custom technological solutions for hospitals looking to advance their delivery of care.

These are women who extend the hand of friendship across cultures and encourage us to aspire to create a rich legacy – a legacy where we build inclusive and vibrant communities, where women feel valued and respected, and where future generations can say ‘Because of you,’” said Debbie Langston, chairperson of the Prince Edward Island Advisory Council on the Status of Women. A celebration will take place in Charlottetown on Sunday, March 8 from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. at Trinity United Church Hall at 220 Richmond Street. The event is organized and hosted by network of organizations that support and support women’s rights and advance gender equality. People will be able to participate in singing, music and movement, and hear speakers reflecting on their diverse experiences as women. Refreshments provided and admission is free. All ages and genders welcome. For more information, visit: Advisory Council on the Status of Women.

The first International Women’s Day was observed on March 19, 1911, in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland. That day, more than one million people showed their support by participating in public events. In the years that followed, other countries began to observe and celebrate this day. The United Nations recognized 1975 as International Women’s Year and began celebrating International Women’s Day on March 8 of that year.  Today, International Women’s Day is celebrated around the world – in many countries, it is a national holiday. It has grown to become a global day of recognition of women’s achievements and a call to action to support women’s rights and advance gender equality.

Participating communities will directly benefit through energy independence, local economic development, and long-term savings on their energy bills.”  - Transportation, Infrastructure and Energy Minister Steven Myers  Samso is a carbon-neutral island in Denmark. They produce more energy than they use. Samso has reduced their heating costs by 40 per cent and created local energy businesses that don’t rely on imported oil.  In Samso, they have four district heating plants, burning straw or waste wood and using solar or wind power. They buy the straw from local farmers at above market prices.  The heat from straw goes to heat homes for a much lower price than burning fossil fuels. The waste from their district heating plant goes to fertilize crops to complete the sustainable cycle. In Gottingen, Germany, government representatives toured a co-generation power plant that produces electricity and district heat from corn, to fuel two villages. This is one of 9,000 such plants in Germany.  Representatives also visited HAWK University, where scientists are researching ways to turn waste into power through highly efficient district heating systems – making district heating technology more viable than ever. “We need to hear from Islanders on how they want to make community energy generation a reality in their towns, villages and neighborhoods,” said Minister Myers. “Communities will have direct involvement - and direct benefit - from the sustainable infrastructure that will power their homes, businesses and community centres for decades to come.” More information on sustainable communities, including the request for expressions of interest, is available at Sustainable Communities Initiative.  In the coming weeks, there will be community information sessions across the province to begin the dialogue on how communities make energy generation work for them.  Media contact: 	Katie MacDonald 	Department of Transportation, Infrastructure and Energy 	902-314-3996katiemacdonald@gov.pe.ca      Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

This project will help conserve approximately 4,400 hectares of high-priority areas and habitats, including PEI’s forests and wetlands, and will expand upon existing protected areas and establish new conserved areas in the province. Importantly, the project will protect PEI’s old-growth forest and will have numerous benefits for species at risk including the common nighthawk, the Canada warbler, and the rusty blackbird. “Prince Edward Island and its partners are contributing to Canada’s biodiversity by protecting and conserving PEI’s natural heritage. The Government of Canada is proud to be a partner in this effort, which is an important step toward our targets of protecting a quarter of Canada’s lands and a quarter of its oceans by 2025 and working toward 30 percent of each by 2030. Together, we will ensure a healthy, prosperous environment for generations to come.” – The Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Prince Edward Island and other partners including Ducks Unlimited Canada, Island Nature Trust, Nature Conservancy of Canada, and the Mi’kmaq Confederacy of PEI are contributing $3.4 million in cash or in-kind donations to this $4.8 million project.  “Islanders have a deep connection to the land, water, and forests. We need to work together to protect the habitats of our most vulnerable wildlife species.” – The Honourable Brad Trivers, Minister of Environment, Water and Climate Change  Through the $500 million Canada Nature Fund, the Government of Canada supports the efforts of partners across the country to protect nature. Federal investments are matched by philanthropic foundations, corporations, not-for-profits, provinces, territories, and other partners, raising a total of $1 billion for conservation action in Canada.   Media contacts: Leanne Ritchie 	Department of Environment, Water and Climate Change 	902-314-0134lpritchie@gov.pe.ca Moira Kelly 	Press Secretary 	Office of the Minister of Environment and Climate Change 	819-271-6218moira.kelly@canada.ca Media Relations 	Environment and Climate Change Canada 	819-938-3338 or 1-844-836-7799 (toll-free)ec.media.ec@canada.ca   Backgrounder  The Government of Canada is committed to doubling the amount of protected nature in our lands and waters across Canada. Through Budget 2018, the Government invested a historic $1.3-billion to protect Canada’s nature, including the establishment of new protected and conserved areas as well as new Indigenous protected and conserved areas. Globally, Canada has 20 percent of freshwater resources, 24 percent of wetlands, 25 percent of temperate rainforests, and 33 percent of remaining boreal forest. Canada also has almost one third of all land-based carbon storage: a vital element of action on climate change. PEI is the most densely populated province in Canada, and it has the highest percentage of private land. These two factors combine to make land protection in PEI particularly challenging. This investment in the protection of 4,440 hectares on the island is impressive.  PEI’s current protected area stands at 24,848 hectares (4.4 percent of the land base). The province is committed to meeting its stated target of protecting 7 percent of its land, by the end of 2020.  The Government of Canada has also invested in expanding PEI’s protected and conserved areas through the Quick Start component of the Canada Nature Fund.

The proposed modernized legislation is now available online and clearly outlines rules that affect landlords and tenants in key areas such as emergency repairs, rent increases, fees, inspections, evictions and payment of rent.  “The new legislation provides a modern legislative framework for the rental of residential property in our province. We are hoping that as many Islanders as possible will share their opinions during the consultations to ensure that the new legislation best meets the needs of Islanders.” - Hon. Brad Trivers, Minister of Education and Lifelong Learning  Islanders are encouraged to provide their feedback by the end of March through:  Written submissions by March 20; An online survey from March 3 to March 20; and Public consultation sessions: 		 March 9: Alberton, Holland College West Prince Campus, 6-8 p.m. March 11: Summerside, Credit Union Place, 6-8 p.m. March 25:  Montague, Montague Regional High School, 6-8 p.m. March 26:  Charlottetown, Jack Blanchard Hall, 6-8 p.m.    Introducing updated residential rental legislation is part of government’s overall efforts to address housing challenges across the province. Last year, there were just over 1,500 housing starts, of which rental units accounted for almost half. The new Residential Tenancy Act would replace the Rental of Residential Properties Act which is now 30 years old. “The Act is intended to provide better protection for both tenants and landlords while addressing the current realities of housing in Prince Edward Island,” said Social Development and Housing Minister Ernie Hudson. “We want to hear from Islanders on how the new legislation would impact them and how it could be improved.” More information on the proposed Act and the consultation process can be found at PrinceEdwardIsland.ca/ResidentialTenancy.

251,2020-02-13,Canada,Prince Edward Island,,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/more-transitional-housing-support-islanders,Government Website,More transitional housing support for Islanders ,"            Minister of Social Development and Housing Ernie Hudson and Dianne Smith of Smith Lodge.          A 28-bed transitional housing complex will help support the needs of Islanders experiencing homelessness.  The province has entered into a purchase and sale agreement for properties and land in Charlottetown to develop new transitional supports for men, women and families. The properties, currently known collectively as Smith Lodge, will be renovated and ready to open by summer 2020.    “Adding more transitional beds in Charlottetown will help shelters such as Bedford MacDonald House and Blooming House that are seeing increased demand. The provincial government and community partners will work together to support people as they transition to more permanent living arrangements. Smith Lodge will provide safe and supportive housing to Islanders at a vulnerable time in their life and also offer them assistance and encouragement as they get back on their feet.” - Social Development and Housing Minister Ernie Hudson  In November 2019, the province finalized a community needs assessment for emergency shelter and since then announced several actions including continued partnerships with Bedford MacDonald House, Blooming House, and the Salvation Army, setting up a new community outreach centre and partnering with a local landlord to provide 10-transition beds in Charlottetown.  A new 20-bed transitional home for survivors of family violence and children aging out of care is also under construction and expected to be complete this spring.  These efforts and others to address the various housing needs of Islanders are highlighted in an 18-month progress report released today. Additional initiatives include supporting the construction of 372 new affordable housing units, investing in 1150 new mobile rental vouchers and collaborating with more than 20 housing partners. Current housing priorities for government are: creating 100 new government-owned social housing units across the province;  continuing to  partner with communities and developers to create more non-government owned units;  making it easier for people to access home renovation and repair programs;  public consultation and  legislative changes to the Rental of Residential Properties Act to support tenants and landlords; and  considering ways to provide Island students with more housing support.  “Housing is critical for raising healthy families and fostering success in education, jobs and aging in place. It’s not just about buildings. Safe and suitable housing helps to strengthen the economy, build communities and support overall personal well-being,” said Minister Hudson. “Much progress has been made over the past 18 months but there is more work to be done. Through successful partnerships, we will continue to provide timely access to housing that meets the current and future needs of Islanders.”  For more information, visit Home Together Affordable Housing for PEI.  Media contact: 	April Gallant 	Department of Social Development and Housing 	902-620-3409aldgallant@gov.pe.ca       Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

In 2019, the province lost one-third of its substitute drivers. Due to a high number of retirements, many substitute drivers took on full-time driver jobs or other jobs which are becoming more available in a strong economy.  In response, school bus driver training programs were expanded and the number of drivers being trained this year increased from 24 to 48 new drivers. Training was supported by Skills PEI funding of $198,450 under the Labour Market Development Agreement.   “Given the current shortage of school bus drivers in PEI and across the country, we are pleased that so many Islanders have answered the call for training. School bus drivers take their responsibility to safely transport more than 18,000 Island students to and from school each day very seriously, and it is very important that we have an adequate supply of school bus drivers.”  -  Education and Lifelong Learning Minister Brad Trivers.  As a result of job fairs and promotional campaigns, many people are now taking part in the six-week training program which is free to participants.  In addition to the JVI School Bus Driver Program and First Aid Certification, student drivers take on-the-job training which provides them with hands-on-experience on the bus, and classroom sessions to develop working knowledge of common situations. The training programs are coordinated by Rural Community Learning Inc. in Alberton. “It is encouraging to see so many people graduating from the driver training programs,” said Public Schools Branch Director Parker Grimmer. “School bus drivers play a key role in helping students get ready to learn each day. They are often the first adult outside the home that a student will see each morning. They help students begin their day in a positive way which can make them more apt to attend school and be in a positive mindset to learn.”  Anyone interested in becoming a part of the public school bus driver team is asked to contact the Public Schools Branch at or the French Language School Board.  Media contact: 	Jean Doherty     	Department of education and Lifelong Learning 	902 314 5702 jmdoherty@gov.pe.ca      Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

The last time the act was reviewed was in 2006.    “Workplaces have changed over the years so our employment standards need to evolve too. Islanders have asked for a full review and today I’m proud to say that we are committed to doing exactly that, so together we can continue to create healthy and supportive workplaces in Prince Edward Island.” - Economic Growth, Tourism and Culture Minister Matthew MacKay  Calls to complete a comprehensive review of the act have been made by several interest groups and the Employment Standards Board. A review is also included as an action item in the Poverty Reduction Action Plan for Prince Edward Island.  A panel will be set up to carry out the review of the act and its associated regulations.

We are pleased to collaborate on this innovative project which will reduce costs for students and ensure that they have the materials they need to learn.” - Education and Lifelong Learning Minister Brad Trivers  Textbook and other learning resource costs can contribute significantly to student debt. A proven method to reduce costs and barriers to learning for students is the use of open textbooks and other types of OERs. One of the UPEISU policy priorities for 2018/2019 was an open textbook pilot project to reduce the cost of accessing educational resources. As a result of the student union’s hard work and determined efforts, the OER Development Program at UPEI has been created at the Robertson Library, with support from the provincial government. “What a great collaboration and I’m really looking forward to working with librarians, instructors and students on this initiative – a first in the region,” said Donald Moses, University Librarian at UPEI. “Librarian Kim Mears will be the project lead and manages Pressbooks, the open source OER platform used by the library. OERs generated out of this program will reduce cost and barriers to learning by providing access to content to students in multiple formats.”  ""We are extremely excited about the changes this program will bring to students in terms of affordability,” said Sweta Daboo, vice-president academic and external at the UPEISU. “Rising textbook costs pose a significant barrier to education, and this is a monumental first step in addressing that issue. We thank the province and the university for putting the work and resources into this project and look forward to continued investments and collaboration for students.”  The funding program will run through 2020 and will be administered by the Robertson Library. It provides a variety of funding opportunities including:  an open textbook grant to support the development of a new open textbook on a topic that is currently not covered by an existing open textbook,  an open textbook adaptation grant to support the adaptation of one or more open textbooks to create a new version or edition of an open textbook, a supplementary resources grant to support the creation of ancillary materials for existing open textbooks, including, but not limited to test banks, slide decks, or interactive media, for an open textbook or other open education resource, or an honoraria for open textbook peer reviews to support individuals completing a formal peer review of an existing open textbook.   The funding is available to any instructor of a credit course at UPEI and either an individual or a team can apply.

The service is an expansion of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).  Dr. Brown, a native of Charlottetown, completed her medical degree at Memorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador followed by her pediatrics residency at Western University. She is returning to the Island after completion of specialized training in Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine at Dalhousie University.  “For the entirety of my medical training I have been looking forward to the day when I join the QEH as a neonatologist; it has been my long-term aspiration to advance neonatal intensive care on Prince Edward Island,” said Dr. Brown. “Together, we will provide more specialized care to both premature babies and to full-term babies who are significantly unwell. This specialized care will not only include advanced neonatal intensive care services, but also enhanced family-centered care.  In providing such care, families will be able to stay together and be part of the medical team providing care to their babies. This is the tremendous advantage of family-centered care, and it is this type of care that has been shown to improve outcomes for these babies.”  “It is wonderful to have Dr. Brown return home to practice and increase availability of specialized care for Islanders whose babies are born prematurely. For newborns, having their parent(s) and families nearby can positively impact their development, and may even mean they can go home sooner.” - Health and Wellness Minister James Aylward  Once the Neonatology Service becomes fully operational, premature babies born up to 12 weeks early and full-term babies requiring advanced intensive care services will no longer be transferred off Island to receive necessary care.  It will also mean families of these babies will remain together on PEI. Furthermore, while some babies needing surgical and other specialized care will still be transferred off Island, these babies will be transferred back to the Island sooner meaning a reduction in the amount of time babies and families spend out of province.  ""I am happy that Dr. Brown is joining the Health PEI family and that she is bringing added knowledge to the pediatric services at the QEH that will benefit Islanders,"" said Dr. Andre Celliers, Executive Director of Medical Affairs for Health PEI. ""We will be able to repatriate infants sooner to PEI from the IWK and decrease the hardship of new parents that have to travel and be away from home for long periods with premature babies."" In addition to hiring a full-time Neonatologist, government will be hiring several specialized staff including a neonatal nurse practitioner, respiratory therapists, a registered nurse and other supports for the Neonatology Service.

Being open, listening and speaking without judgment, and knowing how to respond can have a huge positive impact on survivors of family violence. Communities across the Island will mark the week by holding Walks in Silence, information presentations and family activities to raise awareness of family violence. The events kick off with a reception at Rodd Charlottetown Hotel on February 10 from 4-6 pm. “This year’s theme will help all of us to better understand how the community can respond when we know someone has experienced family violence,” said Danya O’Malley, executive director of PEI Family Violence Prevention Services. “Being supportive is key to helping survivors move forward.” Islanders can show their support by taking part in the week’s activities. For example, Wednesday February 12 is Wear Purple Day in Prince Edward Island. A full schedule of activities can be found at Premier’s Action Committee on Family Violence Prevention 2020 campaign.  “One of the great things about living on the Island is that we care about our neighbours and supporting survivors is something we can all do.

Businesses have a role to play as well. New resources have been created to help businesses respond to family violence that happens in a workplace setting. A new leave was introduced in November 2019 allowing employees to take up to three days paid, and seven days unpaid for issues related to domestic violence. Wednesday, February 12 is Wear Purple Day in Prince Edward Island. Islanders are encouraged to wear purple: To raise awareness of Family Violence Prevention Week To remember victims of violence and their families To show that violence in any relationship is not acceptable. Still not sure how to respond? There are professionals that can help.

259,2020-02-05,Canada,Prince Edward Island,,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/students-getting-more-literacy-support-through-classroom-libraries,Government Website,Students getting more literacy support through classroom libraries,"            East Wiltshire Intermediate students enjoy classroom book clubs using books from their new classroom library while Minister Trivers, teacher Ashlley Bell and secondary literacy coordinator Kendra MacLaren look on.          New classroom libraries are giving Island students more opportunity to develop their literacy and critical thinking skills. Research shows that the more contact children have with books and the more time they spend reading, the better readers they will become. Once the Grade 7 libraries are all set up this month, all grades 7 to 12 students will have daily access to high quality literature in their classrooms.  “Access to books is one of the most powerful indicators of a child’s ability to read and love reading. By giving all students at-the-elbow access to a variety of good books on a daily basis, we are helping them develop as readers, writers and lifelong learners.” - Education and Lifelong Learning Minister Brad Trivers  New language arts curriculum focuses on 50 percent independent reading, 25 percent book club and 25 percent core text. The classroom libraries allow students to choose from hundreds of carefully selected titles which support the curriculum outcomes they are expected to achieve at their grade level.  The books are chosen by teachers, librarians and education partners such as Mi’kmaq Confederacy of PEI and the Human Rights Commission. Students are also involved in the evaluation and selection process. The classroom collections include a range of reading difficulty. Teachers have been trained on how to use the books to support the curriculum and to help students develop a love of reading. The books are used to support themes they are exploring in class. Book clubs allow students to discuss a book with their peers and deepen their understanding of what they are reading. Book Talks enable students to present a summary of a book and based on their recommendations, students keep wish lists of which books or authors they will read next.  Classroom libraries differ from school libraries in that they focus on the curriculum and what students are learning at their grade level. Librarians and teachers work together to help children become lifelong learners. Many librarians report that use of the school library has increased as a result of the reading enjoyment students are gaining in the classroom. The intermediate and high school classroom libraries have been installed and refreshed over the past few years in English and French schools through an investment of $1.2 million.

260,2020-02-04,Canada,Prince Edward Island,,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/island-forest-firefighters-bound-for-australia,Government Website,Island forest firefighters bound for Australia,"   Two wildfire fighters from Prince Edward Island are heading to Australia to assist with the unprecedented forest fires happening there. On February 6, two staff members from the department of Environment will travel to the state of Victoria, Australia with a team of professional wildland fire fighters and fire management specialists for a 31-day deployment. The Islanders will be part of a 20-person crew from Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Quebec involved in direct suppression work on fire incidents within the state.  “Our hearts go out to those who have been impacted by the fires in Australia. I wish our forest firefighters a safe journey as they help to end these wildfires.” - Brad Trivers, Minister of Environment, Water and Climate Change.  According to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, there are already Canadian firefighters in both states of New South Wales and Victoria as well as in South Australia.  “Firefighters play a critical part in keeping our communities safe,” said Bloyce Thompson, Minister of Justice and Public Safety. “We are grateful to have an incredibly skilled fire response force on the Island.” It has been an unprecedented fire season in Australia with severe fires along the east coast with some starting as early as August. Since late December other large fires have erupted in southern New South Wales and eastern Victoria and more recently in Australian Capital Territory. Fire conditions continue to be challenging. Here in Prince Edward Island, the department of Environment, Water and Climate Change is responsible for wild fire response within the province. Staff deployed to Victoria will gain skills that could be needed if PEI faces serious wildfires in the future. Traditionally, most wildfires on PEI tend to happen in May and early June. The skill of forest fire fighting staff from the Island is recognized nationally. During the extreme fires of 2018, Island wild fire staff provided assistance to British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario and Alberta again in 2019.

For some spouses remaining at home this could mean thousands of extra dollars that they will be able to keep. At least 80 families will benefit right away.   “I’ve heard from a number of Islanders with partners in long-term care who have concerns about the way their income has been allocated. Islanders work their entire lives to build financial security for the future, and they should not have to lose that security when their spouse requires long-term care. This change will help ease those concerns, allow spouses at home to maintain their financial independence, and is in keeping with our commitment to put people first.” - Health and Wellness Minister James Aylward.   Islanders who live in public or private nursing homes are responsible for the cost of their room and board, as well as personal expenses. Subsidies have always been available for those who can’t afford the full cost, and any long-term care resident can apply for the subsidy, which is based on an income-means test. This will not change, but the updates to the long-term care subsidy assessment make it fairer to everyone and will also make the process easier for those applying.  “The regulations were very out-dated and I am pleased that with this change, more Islanders will be able to comfortably stay in their homes in the company of family, friends, neighbours and community while their spouse receives the long-term care support they need,” Minister Aylward said.   For more information about Long-Term Care Subsidization, call 1-888-365-5313.

263,2020-01-31,Canada,Prince Edward Island,,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/more-adoption-information-available-soon,Government Website,More adoption information available soon,"   Changes to the Adoption Act will provide adult adoptees and birth parents access to more information and offer the option for privacy upon request. Any adoption that is finalized after January 31, 2020 will be considered open. For adult adoptees, 18 years of age or older, this means information contained on their original birth registration, including name at birth and the identity of their birth parent(s), will be made available upon request. For birth parents, it means being able to find out the adopted name given to the child at the time of adoption.  “The adoption process is extremely personal and sensitive for those involved. These changes will allow for more openness with respect to birth records related to adoption but at the same time, they offer balance for those individuals who were promised confidentiality at the time of the adoption.” - Hon. Ernie Hudson, Minister of Social Development and Housing  Adult adoptees and birth parents involved in adoptions finalized before January 31, 2020 can choose whether they want their information shared. This is the way it is done in other Canadian jurisdictions that have open adoption records. Between January 31, 2020 and January 30, 2021, adult adoptees and birth parents can submit a disclosure veto if they do not want their identifying information to be released. For this reason, adoption records for adoptions finalized before January 31, 2020 will not be opened until January 31, 2021. A disclosure veto may still be placed at any time after January 31, 2021, as long as the identifying information has not already been released. All adult adoptees and birth parents have the option to file a contact preference which allows them to indicate how they would like to be contacted if the other party is looking for them. Options may include contact by email or phone, in-person visits, or no contact at all.  A contact preference does not prevent the release of identifying information; it only specifies the type of contact a person would prefer. After January 31, 2021, Government may release identifying information upon request subject to the terms of the contact preference. The person requesting the information must agree to abide by the terms before they receive the information or could face penalties. A disclosure veto or contact preference can be modified or removed at any time by the person who placed it and it expires one year after their death. For more information about the changes and to fill out an application, visit PrinceEdwardIsland.ca/OpenAdoptionRecords, email adoption@gov.pe.ca or call toll-free 1-844-982-0507.

Bloyce Thompson, PEI Minister of Agriculture and Land          Prince Edward Island’s farmers and their families have a new resource to help them deal with the mental and emotional stress that can come with farming life. The new website www.farmerstalk.ca encourages farmers, producers and family members to open up about the challenges they face, to support each other and to reach out for help with any mental health struggles they may be dealing with. The site reminds farmers that they are not alone and includes personal messages about mental health, links to support services and advice on how farmers can take care of their mental health before it becomes a crisis. Hog producer Donald MacDonald saw how heavy the emotional burden of farming can be when a friend and colleague who had expressed concern about financial pressures went on to take his own life. “This was a solid, hard working guy, who didn’t talk much about things that were bothering him,” MacDonald said. “I think sometimes people in this industry just feel that there isn’t a way to get out or to improve things. If people can talk about how they are doing and if we can listen to each other maybe that will help.” Agriculture and Land Minister Bloyce Thompson launched the website today at the annual meeting of the PEI Federation of Agriculture.  ""I can tell you from my experience and from the lives of those around me, farming can be a stressful way to make a living. Too many of our friends and colleagues wrestle alone with anxiety, depression and isolation. We want to open up conversations about mental health and farming. There are people who care and services available to help.” - Hon. Bloyce Thompson  Farmers and those that support them are encouraged to visit the FarmersTalk.Ca site, download the talk bubble to spark conversation and post social media messages of support using the hashtag #FarmersTalk. “You can talk about your own experiences, you can offer encouragement – the important thing is that we let each other know that we are there for each other as farmers dealing with stress, depression or anxiety,” Thompson said. “I want my fellow farmers to understand that they are not in this struggle alone.” FarmersTalk.Ca was developed by the Department of Agriculture and Land in cooperation with Island farm organizations, and provincial mental health services. The resource builds on support already being offered through the Farmer Assistance Program, which offers six free sessions to farmers, their families and their employees dealing with mental health issues. “The Prince Edward Island Federation of Agriculture  is proud of the fact we have been offering counseling services through the Farm Assistance Program since 2004” said president David Mol. “Mental health is an incredibly important issue in today’s farming environment and it is crucial that as an industry we stand beside each other and ensure people’s well being is taken care of. The Farmer Assistance Program is there for that reason and we look at Farmers Talk as one more way to shed light on this issue and how we are not alone.” Media contact: 	Ron Ryder 	Department of Agriculture and Land 	902-314-6367rrryder@gov.pe.ca        Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

This program benefits both businesses and the community and I encourage all potential employers to explore their opportunities through Jobs for Youth.” - Fisheries and Communities Minister Jamie Fox  Employers can apply for funding at 2020 Jobs for Youth Program by March 31, 2020.  Students can participate in the program by applying directly to employers. A full list of employers will be available at 2020 Jobs for Youth Program. The following improvements were made to the program based on feedback from the 2019 participants to better serve the needs of students and employers: minimum age of eligibility for students changed from 16 to 15; application deadline for employers is now March 31; employers approved for funding will be posted online in May ; students can now apply directly to employers for positions that interest them;  WorkPEI will assist students and employers with recruitment, application and hiring processes. Last year Jobs for Youth helped employers create summer jobs for 379 Island students to work with businesses, non-profits and public sector employers. “This program helps employers meet their labour needs but it’s also an important boost for our students,” said Minister Fox. “Job experiences, like those afforded by the Jobs for Youth program are invaluable for young people beginning their careers.” Media contact: 	Ron Ryder 	Communications Officer 	902-314-6367rrryder@gov.pe.ca       Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

Islanders can read the summary report from the public consultations at On The Level.  “The connection with our land, water and air is deeply personal for Islanders. How we regulate and protect our water is important and a responsibility that we all share. We appreciate the hundreds of Islanders and organizations who shared their thoughts and opinions on how we regulate water withdrawals here on Prince Edward Island, and we are incorporating their feedback as we work on drafting a second version of the water withdrawal regulations.” - Environment, Water and Climate Change Minister Brad Trivers  Other themes identified by Islanders in the consultation summary report include: calls for more independent science;  fairness in water access among users; the ability for the Minister to order drought contingency plans if necessary; the need to manage water resources at the watershed level; and, concern about fish and wildlife conservation.  The draft regulations have been available for public comment since the summer of 2019. In the fall, four public consultation meetings were held across the Island to gather public input and feedback on the draft regulations. The meetings were further supported by an online survey for those unable to attend in person.  As part of the interactive consultations, members of the public, industry and non-profit organizations were asked eight questions related to the processes laid out in the draft regulations. People worked in groups to pull out themes with the highest consensus. The feedback is being used to help assess any further amendments required to the draft regulations before bringing the Water Act into effect.  To learn more about water on PEI, visit On The Level. Media contact: 	Leanne Ritchie 	Department of Environment, Water and Climate Change 	902-314-0134lpritchie@gov.pe.ca Backgrounder  The Water Act was tabled during the fall 2017 sitting of the legislature and received Royal Assent on December 20, 2017. It is expected to be brought into force 90 days after the final water withdrawal regulations are presented to the Standing Committee on Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability. The water withdrawal regulations are one of four sets of regulations that need to be in place in order to implement the Water Act.  The water withdrawal regulations will help the Province manage and track who is using what amounts of water. For the first time, permits will be required for those who use more than normal household levels. Other regulations that must be in place to implement the Water Act include: well construction regulations (consultations occurred in spring 2019); water supply and wastewater treatment regulations (consultations occurred in spring 2019); and, sewage disposal systems regulations must be transferred from under the Environmental Protection Act to the Water Act.

The Strength Program offers a range of programming and supports, both residential and day treatment, for Island youth aged 15-24 and their families. The program includes up to 16 weeks of residential care and 24 weeks of follow up aftercare using a holistic approach and helping youth transition back into community living.    “The youth who come to our program are ready to make changes and are looking for  support and treatment to do that,” said Jayelee Grady, youth mental health & addiction services program manager. “In many cases they have hit a point where outpatient treatment is not enough, but they are not at a point where they require acute care or hospitalization. We are here to help them improve their mental health, overcome addictions, develop healthy life skills and set new goals.” The Strength Program has supported 700 Island youth over the last ten years. The program’s focus on reintegrating youth into the community is worth celebrating and ties closely to the community-first philosophy supporting the mental health and addiction revitalization planning that is currently underway.    “It is extremely beneficial to help these youth gain the skills, knowledge and confidence to reintegrate into their communities, close to their support systems. The success of the Strength program is a great example of why this works.

I encourage all family members to build time for learning into their daily routines by doing things such as reading, playing, singing and telling stories together.” - Education and Lifelong Learning Minister, Brad Trivers  Public libraries will be highlighting various literacy types such as physical, digital and emotional literacy. All Islanders are welcome to celebrate at various events, whether that’s dancing at the Cornwall Public Library's Family Dance Party, learning about Google Calendar at the Tyne Valley Public Library, or cozying up at the Family Literacy Day Read-In at the Montague Rotary Library.

Quitting smoking is the single best thing you can do for your health.” In addition to the smoking cessation program, Islanders who are thinking about quitting smoking and using tobacco products can get support and information through the Smokers’ Helpline at 1-877-513-5333 or by visiting: Smokers' Helpline. Tobacco use accounts for approximately 250 deaths per year in the province. Up to half of the Island's 18,282 adult smokers are likely to become ill or die from tobacco use.

We are accepting Minister’s Aylward’s request to recommend a new recruitment model with enthusiasm.” MSPEI will work closely with the Department of Health and Wellness and Health PEI to develop its recommendations on a new recruitment model, based on the principle of physicians recruiting physicians. The project will include assessing best recruitment practices in other parts of the country and beyond, seeking input from PEI physicians and hosting a facilitated workshop with stakeholders.
