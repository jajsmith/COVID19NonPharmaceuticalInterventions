A large majority of these tests have been Islanders between the ages of 20 and 29 years of age. On Sunday, Islanders in their 20s were encouraged to be tested after a cluster of positive COVID-19 cases was identified in this age group. An additional 2,000 COVID-19 tests are currently pending results. “It is so encouraging to see young Islanders respond quickly to the call to be tested. The results of these tests will give us a better sense of any potential spread of COVID-19 throughout this age group and can assist in stopping the chain of transmission,” said Dr. Morrison. “It is clear that those in their 20s, as well as all Islanders, care deeply for their community and are willing to do whatever it takes to look after one another.” The Chief Public Health Office is asking individuals 20 - 29 years of age living in the greater Charlottetown area who live with multiple roommates in the same age group, work in a crowded setting with others in this age group (such as the fast food industry) or who are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 to get tested as soon as possible. Anyone in the 20-29 age group in the greater Charlottetown area who does not have symptoms can be tested any time over the next several days. People in this category do not need to self-isolate before or after getting tested while awaiting results and can attend work or school.  COVID-19 test clinic hours have been extended for this week at various locations across the province to support the increase in demand. Today, an additional test clinic was set up at Holland College primarily for staff, students and those without a vehicle, and tomorrow there will be a drop-in testing clinic at UPEI primarily for staff and students. All testing clinics and staff are working together to ensure individuals are tested as quickly as possible and no one is turned away. All Islanders should get tested if they experience any symptoms of COVID-19, and self-isolate until the results come back. Islanders are also encouraged to download the free national COVID Alert app, which will to let them know if they have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Prince Edward Island currently has 14 active cases of COVID-19 and has had a total of 84 positive cases of COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic.

24,2020-12-06,Canada,Prince Edward Island,,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/enhanced-measures-protect-our-school-communities,Government Website,Enhanced measures to protect our school communities,"   The Province of Prince Edward Island, in partnership with the English and French language school boards, has updated back to school plans to further support enhanced public health measures announced today and protect school communities. For the next two weeks – from Monday, December 7 through Friday, December 18 – high schools in the Capital region will move to remote learning. This includes Colonel Gray, Charlottetown Rural and Bluefield High Schools, as well as students in grades 10 through 12 at École François-Buote.  These measures are being taken due to the recent cases of COVID-19 in the Capital region, the demographic of the positive cases and the cohorting challenges at the high school level.  “Our education system has been working hard since the start of this pandemic to ensure that regardless of the circumstances posed by COVID-19, all students have access to high-quality learning,” said Minister of Education and Lifelong Learning, Brad Trivers. “We are committed to providing the resources needed to keep students learning and staff supported. Our school plans will continue to be updated as the situation changes.” Since April, the Department of Education and Lifelong Learning has been working with the province’s education authorities – the Public Schools Branch and la Commission Scolaire de langue française – to ensure a transition to remote learning can occur successfully. This includes: curriculum revisions to address potential learning gaps and prioritize key foundational learning outcomes early in the school year; identifying the internet and technology needs of students; establishing protocols to handle the distribution of school devices to students quickly and efficiently as needed; and, introducing and integrating digital learning into the classroom to familiarize students and parents with online educational platforms. Teachers and education staff at Colonel Grey, Charlottetown Rural and Bluefield will be at school on Monday, December 7 to prepare for remote learning. There will be no instructional lessons for students.  Additionally, there will be no instructional lessons on Monday, December 7 for grades 10-12 at École François-Buote however, grades k-9 will continue as normal. Remote learning will begin Tuesday. Schools will communicate directly with students and parents through email, school website and social media.  In order to maintain routines and offer students an equitable and consistent learning experience, a regular daily schedule will be followed wherever possible. For instance, if on Day 2, a student has grade 10 math at 10:15, then the lesson for math will begin at 10:15. A resource guide is available to help parents navigate online learning platforms. A plan for students with special educational needs will be outlined in the coming days.  With the move to remote learning for high schools in the Capital region, bussing schedules may be impacted.  Today, the Province of Prince Edward Island also announced that before and after school programs, as well as the community use of schools, at all 62 Island schools will be paused for the next two weeks.  For more information, please visit: Back to School.

These measures will be in place for a two-week period. Effective 8am on Monday, December 7 until December 21, the following public health measures will be in place:  Islanders should stay at home as much as possible, only going out for essential purposes.  Households should designate one person to do essential errands such as grocery shopping, pharmacy visits, and banking.  No personal gatherings. A household can only associate with two persons outside of their household. Persons living alone may choose to interact with one designated household.  Organized gatherings, including faith gatherings, are limited to 10 people maximum indoors or outdoors (excluding staff).  Funerals and weddings are limited to 10 people maximum (excluding officiants).  No in-room dining at restaurants. Take-out and delivery can continue with enhanced precautions.  No organized recreational or team sports.  Gyms, fitness facilities, museums, libraries, bingo halls and casinos will be closed.  Personal services will remain open for appointments only and non-medical masks must be worn at all times by staff and patrons.  Retail stores and markets must operate at a maximum 50 per cent patron capacity.  Daycares will continue to operate as they currently do. High schools in the Charlottetown area are moving to remote learning. This includes Colonel Gray, Charlottetown Rural and Bluefield High Schools, as well as students in grades 10 through 12 at École François-Buote.  In-person mental health and addiction services and programs, including residential day programs, will continue.  Long-term care and community care facilities will limit partners in care to one designated person. There will be no other visitors during this time.  Dr. Morrison firmly stated that enforcement efforts will be stepped up across the province to ensure these circuit breaker measures are being followed for the next two weeks. In the event a gathering exceeds the new capacity limit, a fine will be issued to every person in attendance, not just the host.  Individuals 20 to 29 years of age living in the capital region (greater Charlottetown area) are encouraged to get tested for COVID-19. Individuals in this age group experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 should get tested as soon as possible and self-isolate until they receive the results. Individuals in this age group who are not experiencing symptoms can get tested in the coming days, can attend school/work, and do not need to self-isolated while awaiting the test result.   Dr. Morrison is also reminding all Islanders of the importance of getting tested if experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19, and to self-isolate until the results come back. Islanders are also encouraged to download the free national COVID Alert app, which will to let them know if they have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.

39,2020-11-27,Canada,Prince Edward Island,,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/islanders-living-diabetes-receive-additional-support,Government Website,Islanders living with diabetes receive additional support,"   More Islanders will benefit from additional financial assistance and coverage for diabetes supplies, including insulin pumps and test strips, starting in the new year.   Effective January 1, 2021, the Insulin Pump Program – which assists with the costs of insulin pumps and supplies – will be expanded to include Islanders up to 25 years old. The Diabetes Drug Program – which helps with the costs of diabetes medications and supplies – will expand monthly blood glucose test strip coverage from 100 strips to 120.   “Diabetes effects more than 15,000 Islanders, and it is so important that we offer additional support to these individuals so they can live healthy, fulfilling lives without cost as a barrier. In addition to this funding, I am pleased to present the new Diabetes Strategy as we move forward with a renewed focus on diabetes prevention, detection and management.” - Health and Wellness Minister James Aylward  The Health PEI Diabetes Strategy 2020-2024 was developed after the review of the previous strategy and is guided by recommendations from the steering committee and public engagement with Islanders living with diabetes, family members and current evidence-based best practices in diabetes care.  In addition to financial assistance, Health PEI’s Provincial Diabetes Program offers education, support and diabetes management advice to Islanders living with diabetes or those who are at risk of developing diabetes. This service is offered in various communities across the province so Islanders can receive support close to home, no matter where they live.  “As a chronic disease, diabetes has an impact on the entire body, leading to increased risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney damage, and nerve damage,” said Denise Lewis Fleming, Health PEI CEO. “Effective management of diabetes and diabetes education is extremely important in improving the lives of those with the disease. The new Diabetes Strategy, along with the expanded insulin pump and testing strip funding, will help people with diabetes take control of their health and help improve outcomes.” November is National Diabetes Awareness Month, a time to bring attention to the disease. This month, Diabetes Canada is working diligently to raise awareness through their campaign that encourages Canadians to use the hashtag #EndDiabetes. “We’re very pleased to see the renewal of the provincial Diabetes Strategy, which addresses gaps in services and enhances diabetes programs and supports on PEI,” says Terry Lewis, Manager of Community Engagement for Diabetes Canada. “As diabetes rates continue to grow rapidly across Canada, a coordinated approach to tackling this epidemic aligned, as this is, with the Diabetes 360° strategy, will help improve the health and wellbeing of Islanders. We look forward to working with the government on the implementation of the new Diabetes Strategy.” For more information about Prince Edward Island’s diabetes program, including cost assistance programs and other supports, visit: Diabetes Program.  Media contact: 	Samantha Hughes 	Senior Communications Officer 	Health and Wellness 	(902) 368-5610 shughes@gov.pe.ca Backgrounder:  About Diabetes 	Diabetes mellitus is a chronic condition that results from the body’s inability to produce and/or use insulin sufficiently.  In the absence of insulin or sufficient amounts of insulin, blood glucose levels rise, which can result in immediate and long-term detrimental effects for the individual.  	Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes diagnosed with a higher prevalence in adults over 40 years of age.  	Many people don't experience symptoms of diabetes until later stages of the disease. It's important to recognize these signs and talk to your primary care provider:  The most common signs of diabetes include:   unusual thirst frequent urination weight change (gain or loss) extreme fatigue or lack of energy blurred vision frequent or reoccurring infections cuts and/or bruises that are slow to heal tingling or numbness in hands or feet trouble getting or maintaining an erection  About 1 in 10 Islanders 20 years of age and older are living with diabetes.  Quick Facts  Diabetes is a common and serious disease Many people do not know they have diabetes Early screening for diabetes can help avoid serious complications such as blindness, kidney disease, heart disease, stroke, limb amputation and premature death. Many people already have complications such as eye disease before being diagnosed. Early diagnosis and treatment gives persons with diabetes the opportunity to make changes that could improve their lives for years to come. Risk factors for diabetes include: 		 Being overweight is a major preventable risk factor for diabetes  Age 4o years and older  Inactive, sedentary lifestyle  A close relative with diabetes Member of high risk ethnic group such as African, Asian or Indigenous  A history of diabetes related to pregnancy, or having a baby weighing greater than 9 pounds High blood pressure     Strategies for prevention of diabetes and improving overall health include: 		 Regular physical activity Healthy eating habits healthy weight         Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

Additionally, all visitors to schools, k-12, are required to wear masks at all times while indoors.  These updated guidelines apply to both PSB and CSLF schools and will be reviewed and a further update provided in early December.  “Because of the good work of islanders in following the health and safety protocols of the Chief Public Health Office, our students have been able to learn in-class with minimal disruptions unlike other provinces and territories,” said Minister Trivers. “As the second wave continues to be felt across the country including our neighbouring provinces, now is the time to increase precautions to help maintain the health and safety of our island communities. Physical distancing and cohorting are a concern at the high school level so we are taking these additional measures to be proactive.  We will continue to adjust our back to school plans as necessary to ensure a successful and safe school year for students and staff.” Wearing a facial covering/non-medical mask in the community is not a substitute for physical distancing and hand washing.

We want to live in a place where people are safe, respected, and treated well. It’s important to support community organizations in their efforts to shed light on violence, support survivors, and bring attention to online violence and harassment.” - Minister Responsible for the Status of Women, Natalie Jameson    The following organizations will receive Violence Against Women Prevention grants:  PEI Family Violence Prevention Services will receive $7,500 to increase awareness of services that support individuals affected by violence and the many ways to access them. Actions Femmes IPE will receive $10,000 to shed light on the taboo and secrecy surrounding domestic violence, particularly in small Acadian communities in rural areas. The PEI Rape and Sexual Assault Centre will receive $15,000 to build on the success of the Take Back the Night 2020 event on PEI, to raise awareness, support survivors, and bring attention to the work needed to end sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual abuse, and all other forms of sexualized violence.  The PEI Coalition for Women in Government will receive $15,950 to document experiences of women in leadership during COVID-19, with a focus on online gender-based cyber violence. The work will help inform the best way to deal with online harassment.   “The urgency to stop family violence has been raised throughout the pandemic. Now more than ever, we need to ensure people are aware of the multiple ways they can connect and access services. Our team has worked hard to adapt our services so that we are able to get help to those who need it, in a safe and timely way. This funding will help us promote those efforts,” said Danya O’Malley, executive director of PEI Family Violence Prevention Services. 	November 25 is the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. In Prince Edward Island, it is also the launch of the Purple Ribbon Campaign to support survivors.  Each year, the PEI Advisory Council on the Status of Women asks Islanders to wear a purple ribbon for 16 days – from November 25 to December 10 – to raise awareness about violence against women and children here on PEI, across Canada, and throughout the world. The 2020-2021 theme of the Purple Ribbon Campaign is ‘Support Survivors.’  “Every year, hundreds of Islanders are the victims of violence against women and children. Most survive. The message of the Purple Ribbon Campaign is that we must work together to end violence and abuse and learn how to support the survivors in our communities,” said Jameson.  This year the Montreal Massacre Memorial Service will occur online due to COVID-19. It will be broadcast at noon on Sunday, Dec. 6 through Zoom. Everyone is welcome to join and tickets are free.  This annual gathering honours the lives of women that have been lost to violence: PEI women, the 14 women of l’Ecole Polytechnique, and missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls.

Prince Edward Island has done well in responding to the pandemic and our priority remains focused on protecting Islanders and the progress we have made. This temporary suspension of non-essential travel with in the region is a pre-emptive step to help us slow down the spread of the COVID-19 and maintain the movement and activities we now enjoy in our province.” - Premier Dennis King  Islanders should only travel outside of PEI for essential purposes or work. Anyone who needs to travel to Prince Edward Island, including residents of Atlantic Canada, will have to apply for pre-travel approval in advance. Island residents do not require pre-travel approval to return to the province, but will be required to self-isolate or apply to work-isolate for 14 days upon their return.  “Over the past few days it has become apparent that our neighbors in Atlantic Canada, especially those in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, are experiencing the second wave of COVID-19. It is now more important than ever to remain vigilant in following public health measures,” said Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Heather Morrison. “While we recognize we cannot reduce the risk to zero, it is important that we take steps to protect Islanders from COVID-19 and our health system from being overwhelmed.”    Islanders who need to travel within Atlantic Canada for essential purposes, such as for medical appointments, transportation of goods, or picking up students from university are not required to self-isolate if they are able to return to Prince Edward Island that same day. While traveling outside of the province, Islanders must avoid stores, dine-in restaurants and visiting with family and friends. Islanders who frequently travel within Atlantic Canada for work or Atlantic Canadians who frequently travel to Prince Edward Island to work, including rotational workers and truck drivers, will need to apply to work-isolate or register as a rotational worker. However, for the next seven days they will not be required to follow the testing regimen. This grace period will allow time for registration and to determine demand for additional testing requirements.  Individuals working in long-term care or community care who travel off-Island will not be eligible to work isolate. Out of an abundance of caution, partners in care who have returned from out-of-province travel in the last week must not visit their loved one in long-term care or community care until they have been in PEI for 14 days.   “It is important that anyone who is travelling for essential reasons closely follow the public health measures put in place,” said Premier King. “By working together, we can protect ourselves, our loved ones and our Island community from the importation of COVID-19.”  The two-week temporary suspension of the Atlantic Travel Bubble will be reviewed by the provinces and a further update will be provide in early December.  Dr. Morrison also confirmed one new case of COVID-19 in Prince Edward Island. The individual is a female in her 40s who recently travelled from outside the Atlantic Bubble. She is self-isolating and contact tracing is underway.  At this point, there is no evidence of community spread of COVID-19 in Prince Edward Island. Prince Edward Island has had a total of 69 positive cases of COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic. All cases to date have been travel-related. Information about the province’s COVID-19 cases is available online.

The Oyster Enhancement Fund redistributed more than four million surplus oysters from water-column oyster growers to enhance commercial oyster beds all over PEI.  “This funding project was a direct response to the impact that COVID-19 has had on the oyster market. Many other industries that helped the oyster industry thrive in recent years have also been hit hard so when industry and stakeholders identified this need our government was happy to put an action plan in place to help.” - Fisheries and Communities MinisterJamie Fox  The Oyster Enhancement Fund was funded and administered in collaboration with Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, PEI Aquaculture Alliance, PEI Shellfish Association and provincial Department of Fisheries and Communities. Through the project oysters were placed on commercially fished areas to enhance oyster beds, a new oyster bed was developed for future harvests, the amount of brood stock available in a spat collection reserve was increased and a pilot project was developed to improve water quality and environmental conditions in areas where there are annual water quality issues. “PEI’s aquaculture sector is a vital source of employment for Islanders, and it’s essential to the health and sustainability of our economy here,"" said the Honourable Lawrence MacAulay, on behalf of the Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages and Minister responsible for ACOA Honourable Mélanie Joly. “The Government of Canada is proud to work with our oyster industry and support these innovative steps to help the industry recover and grow.” ""The PEI Shellfish Association sees enhancement of commercial oyster beds as key to the success of our industry,” said president of PEI Shellfish Association Bob MacLeod. “This program provided a wonderful opportunity to increase our regular enhancement efforts and for our industry to collaborate with the oyster aquaculture sector.""

Now we have the opportunity to work and enjoy life in the community of Tignish and we are both looking forward to coming and participating.” 	Recruitment and Retention, Health PEI and the Tignish Health Centre have worked collaboratively to recruit a physician to the Tignish area and have ensured continued coverage in the interim.  “This is wonderful news for the people of Tignish and surrounding areas. The Tignish Health Centre is very happy to welcome a fulltime family physician, Dr Entwhistle along with his wife Anne to take over the practice at the Centre,” said Wendy Arsenault, Manager of the Tignish Health Center. “This could not have been possible without great teamwork done by our board of directors, the West Prince team, Recruitment and Retention and Health PEI.

Much like our neighbours in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, we are relying on Islanders to do the right thing and routinely wear a mask when in public places,” said Dr. Morrison. “While not our first line of defense, masks provide an additional layer of protection. Masks supplement, and do not replace, other public health measures. Even when wearing a mask, it is important to keep a distance of six feet from people who do not live in your household.” Masks will be mandatory in locations, including but not limited to: Stores and retail businesses; Personal services and salons; Restaurants (except when eating or drinking); Arts, sports and recreation facilities (except during exercise or when masks cannot be worn); Places of worship; Government buildings where public services are provided; Taxis and public transit; and Workplaces that are open to the public. Exemptions to mandatory masks include, but not limited to: Children under the age of 2; Children under 5 who will not wear a mask; Anyone who cannot remove a mask without assistance; and Valid medical reasons, such as active breathing problems (most people with underlying medical conditions can wear a mask safely). Dr. Morrison noted that for those who cannot wear a mask for medical reasons, sometimes these reasons are not visible to others. Islanders and businesses are encouraged to be trusting and kind, and show compassion and understanding in these cases. Dr. Morrison does not recommend that individuals and families travel to or from PEI over the holidays. Family members who decide to travel to PEI over the holidays from outside the Atlantic Bubble, must apply for pre-travel approval through the Family Connections Stream and be prepared to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival. Pre-travel approval applications should be submitted by December 1 to allow adequate time to process applications and to facilitate staffing throughout the holiday season.  Holiday gatherings should be kept small to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19. While the personal gathering limit is 20 people, this number is only permitted if at least six feet of physical distancing can be maintained.  At this point, there is no evidence of community spread of COVID-19 in Prince Edward Island and the risk of transmission in the province remains low. Prince Edward Island has had a total of 68 positive cases of COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic. All cases to date have been travel-related.

The COVID-19 Workforce Integration Fund will support innovative projects from organizations that help Islanders gain skills and knowledge so they can find long lasting jobs, advance their careers and access entrepreneurship opportunities.  “We are doing everything we can to get more Islanders into the labour market. We know this is an Island-wide issue and we must come together to create supports and solutions. I encourage all organizations to submit their project ideas, so that together, we can help Islanders get work and keep our province moving forward.” - Economic Growth, Tourism and Culture Minister Matthew MacKay  Proposals under the fund should support people and groups most highly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including women, youth, members of the Black, Indigenous and People of Colour (BIPOC) community, newcomers, social assistance recipients and Islanders living with disabilities. “The Workforce Integration Fund was designed with input from stakeholders including women’s organizations, industry and trade councils, and educational groups in Prince Edward Island. It was an entirely new process to ensure this lens was applied before the fund was finalized,” said Minister Responsible for the Status of Women Natalie Jameson.  “This fund will provide support to projects and programs aimed at helping women, youth, and under-represented groups get back into the workforce. Our efforts need to be on recovery and growth where all members of the population, including women, succeed and thrive,” Jameson added. Each approved project will receive up to 100 per cent funding for eligible costs to a maximum of $500,000.   The deadline for proposals is 2 p.m. on December 4, 2020.

Part of government’s vision is to see climate change considered in each department and in every decision we make. Having climate change coordinators across government supports our public servants to take on the challenges and opportunities of climate change and fosters home grown solutions.” - Environment, Water and Climate Change Minister Natalie Jameson  Climate change coordinators will be trained to apply a climate change lens to executive council policies and decisions and work together across departments to help solve problems. They will also offer training to their peers within their departments to help them better understand and manage the impacts of climate change.    Climate change coordinators include: Christine MacKinnon, acting director of municipal affairs, Fisheries and Communities Danielle Gillan, policy analyst, Justice and Public Safety Erin Montgomery, archaeologist, Executive Council Office Jaclynne Hamel, reconciliations coordinator, Executive Council Office Jennifer MacDonald-Donovan, manager of policy, planning, and regulatory affairs, Finance John Morrison, director of sport, recreation, and physical activity, Health and Wellness Kal Whitnell, executive director – economic and population growth, Economic Growth, Tourism and Culture Matt Angus, forest inventory analyst, Environment, Water and Climate Change Melanie Bos, climate solutions strategies coordinator, Agriculture and Land Olivia Cox, sustainable transportation coordinator, Transportation, Infrastructure and Energy Robin Phillips, program evaluation officer, Education and Lifelong Learning Spencer Matheson, policy and intergovernmental affairs coordinator, Executive Council Office Vernon MacIntyre, program analyst, Social Development and Housing Some examples of work underway by climate challenge coordinators include reducing greenhouse gas emissions by developing sustainable transportation options, helping farmers reduce their greenhouse gas emissions through the Agriculture Stewardship Program and working to manage Prince Edward Island’s forest to help sequester carbon. “Trees and forests are possibly our greatest asset in offsetting carbon emissions, so my work is intrinsically linked to climate change,” said Matt Angus, forest inventory analyst, Environment, Water and Climate Change. “Climate change is at the forefront of challenges that farmers face every day through the uncertainty, risk and economic impact it brings to the agriculture industry,” said Melanie Bos, climate solutions strategies coordinator, Agriculture and Land. “I see my work as promising and exciting because making changes in our farming practices can help reverse greenhouse gas emissions that drive climate change.” Prince Edward Island is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions 40 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 as part its commitment to the Pan Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change. The Province is approximately 46 per cent of the way towards this goal. As part of the five-year Climate Change Action Plan (2018-2023), Prince Edward Island is committed to helping Islanders understand and take responsibility for the environmental impacts of their actions by developing education programs and integrating climate change principles into learning environments. The Province is also committed to work with Indigenous, provincial, and regional partners to advance climate change research and knowledge in Prince Edward Island.

We are pleased to offer increased funding supports for Island families who are accessing these important services. It is not uncommon for individuals or couples to experience various challenges in starting or growing their family, but fortunately, there are options and medical assistance. This funding will help reduce the financial burden.” - Health and Wellness Minister James Aylward  The program will provide a minimum of $5,000 and up to $10,000 annually, based on family income, for eligible expenses associated with IUI and/or IVF.  An individual can access maximum annual funding for up to three years.  “Infertility impacts many Islanders who have dreams of starting their own families and while initial testing can be done on PEI, we are excited that patients who need further treatments such as IVF or IUI will have fewer obstacles preventing them from reaching their family goals."" says Dr. Maeghan Keddy, Obstetrician/Gynecologist at The Charlottetown Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic.

Early Years Centres also have government-regulated fees. There are now 54 provincial Early Years Centres on Prince Edward Island.   “Early childhood development is one of the best investments that government can make in the future of our province and provides children with a solid foundation for the skills and confidence they need to thrive. We will continue to make important investments like this that support children and families and help make our Island communities stronger.” - Education and Lifelong Learning Minister Brad Trivers  In 2020-21, an additional $2.1 million was added to the Department of Education and Lifelong Learning annual budget to support the early years.

The consequences of impaired driving in Prince Edward Island are well known to Islanders and are amongst the most severe in Canada. Though the penalties may have contributed to an overall decrease of charges laid in the last 10 years, impaired driving continues to be a significant problem in this province.  “Impaired driving on PEI is not the sole responsibility of law enforcement to stop. It is the responsibility of all Islanders to realize that we have to work together to stop impaired driving,"" said Cst. Stephen Duggan, PEI RCMP officer and Board Member of MADD Canada. ""The RCMP provincially and nationally works with MADD Canada toward that goal of reducing and eliminating impaired driving in our communities. Your local MADD Chapters are entirely volunteer based and if you want to make a difference in your community, contact your local MADD Chapter. Impaired driving will only stop if we work together as a team. Your local RCMP members are very dedicated and pro-active in removing impaired drivers off our roads.”    The Province is beginning a public awareness campaign with law enforcement and first responder partners to encourage Islanders to change complacent attitudes and behaviours related to impaired driving and ultimately, to help save lives.   “The numbers may say there’s a decrease but the truth is, impaired driving is still a big problem in our province. We have to stop tolerating this behaviour and we need Islanders to help us do that. We can’t do this alone."" - Justice and Public Safety Minister Bloyce Thompson  Impaired driving is the leading cause of criminal injury and death in Canada and has caused over hundreds of preventable tragedies across our province in the last decade. “As a volunteer firefighter, I have been called out for countless emergencies. I never really know what to expect when I attend a scene until I’m there. It can be downright devastating, especially when it’s someone you know from your own community. Every event stays with you,” said fire chief of North River Fire and Rescue, Anson Grant. “Every action has consequences and with impaired driving, those consequences don’t stop with the person behind the wheel. Impaired driving tragedies hurt the victim, their families and the community. And of course, what happens in one part of the province affects us all,” minister Thompson said. “We need change and it needs to start today.” To learn more, visit: Impaired Driving.

I think it’s really important to see and hear about these things directly from the farmers and having these discussions about innovation and growth certainly benefits our industry.” - Agriculture and Land Minister Bloyce Thompson  The tours allowed farmers to showcase a number of new agriculture approaches including the raising of dairy/beef cross calves for the Island beef market, research into new crop rotations and varieties, and upgrades to poultry processing facilities. “On our visit to the Visser family’s farm in Orwell I was able to see how a good crop rotation is allowing a potato grower to improve soil quality while growing rotation crops that build organic matter and discourage potato pests,” the minister said. William Visser said farmers are trying to improve the way they produce crops and to reduce their environmental impact. “I’m very encouraged as I see farmers continue to adapt as we become more aware of areas to improve. Many, many farmers are making investments in sustainability in soil health and protecting the environment,” Visser said. “Perfection is hard to attain but I’m really encouraged when I see people working together and individually to do what they can to improve things.”  Feedback from the farming community will assist the department as it reviews programs and supports to ensure they meet the needs of Island farmers, support innovation and environmental stability, and encourage continued economic growth for the province.  “Through these farm tours we were able to meet with almost every farming industry on PEI, and I want to thank all the farmers from West to East that shared their thoughts with us, as well as the staff that helped us visit each farm safely,” the minister said.  Department specialists also had the opportunity to speak with farmers about programs that ranged from the new Soil Health Analysis Package and Product & Market Development Program to larger funding opportunities covering multiple sectors including the Agriculture Stewardship Program For more information on all programs available, visit: Department of Agriculture and Land.

The new signage regulations are a positive step in providing Islanders with clarity around where electric vehicle parking spots are located and who can use them. Businesses and organizations can also create their own branded signage under the regulations.   “Signage continues to evolve as we work towards a more sustainable future for PEI. We hope to see more Islanders purchase new or used electric vehicles and we need the infrastructure in place to make this happen. Transportation is a big cause of our Island’s GHG emissions and electric vehicles are one way to help reduce that impact.” - Transportation, Infrastructure and Energy Minister Steven Myers  The province encourages Islanders to be aware and not take a parking space that is meant for an electric vehicle. People who park a non-electric vehicle in a charging spot will potentially face fines. “The network of electric vehicle chargers continues to grow across the Island. I think many people would be surprised at how many already exist in communities. I hope the new signage will bring more attention to existing chargers and helps to eliminate some of the anxiety people have in terms of how far they may have to go to find a charging station,” said Minister Myers. Encouraging the use of electric vehicles is part of the Sustainable Transportation Action Plan. Supporting more sustainable transportation in Prince Edward Island will help Islanders lower their impact on the environment, while also encouraging people to walk, cycle and use community transit more often.

FAST stands for:  Face: is it drooping? Arms: can you raise both?  Speech: is it slurred or jumbled?  Time: to call 9-1-1 right away.  In PEI there are approximately 350 strokes every year – this equals nearly one stroke every day. Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in Canada, with over 400,000 stroke survivors.  “Talking to your primary care provider about the risk factors and signs of a stroke is important so that Islanders are able to call 9-1-1 for assistance as soon as symptom’s start. It’s also important for stroke survivors and their families to be aware of supports that are available to help people during recovery and as they transition back into community living.” - Health and Wellness Minister James Aylward  Community partners also play a pivotal role in providing services to Islanders. For example, the new After Stroke Strategy website launched by March of Dimes Canada is a valuable resource and offers easy access to programs, services, education and information to support stroke survivors and caregivers in PEI and across Canada.  “There is a need for more community-based services for stroke survivors on Prince Edward Island and this resource is extremely helpful for people,” said provincial stroke steering committee chair, Dr. Ed Harrison. “The site focuses on navigating people through tools and services available for stroke survivors during recovery, their return home and back to community participation and independence.” For further details, visit: March of Dimes Afterstroke Program.

The report I received from IRAC states that there are reasonable and probable grounds that two individuals and the corporation involved contravened the Lands Protection Act by having aggregate land holdings in excess of the prescribed limits during the time period reviewed by IRAC. The involved parties have received correspondence from government asking them to divest land and become compliant with the Lands Protection Act within 120 days.  The parties will be required to report their actions to become compliant directly to IRAC who will then confirm this with government.  If they do not come into compliance within 120 days, I am prepared to take further enforcement steps as may be determined necessary. As government, there are two options for penalty for individuals or corporations who contravene the Lands Protection Act.  An order can be issued to reduce aggregate land holding to the maximum permitted, which is currently in progress.  There is also an option to pursue a summary conviction, which would be brought before a provincial court judge. In addition to these options, IRAC has the ability to impose a financial penalty as well.    I would like to encourage the Standing Committee on Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability to invite IRAC to present their findings of the investigation, and provide members of the Legislative Assembly an opportunity to ask questions on the investigation. Our government is committed to respecting and enforcing the Lands Protection Act.  I hope that all those involved in this investigation will respect the findings of the investigation and act to take the corrective actions.”  Media Contact: 	Ron Ryder 	Department of Agriculture and Land 	902-314-6367 rrryder@gov.pe.ca      Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

Regular screening with a Pap test to detect abnormal changes in the cells at an early stage can help prevent cervical cancer and improve chances for a complete recovery.   “We’re making sure that screening services for women are convenient and easy to access. In general, women should have a regular pap test every three years, so we encourage Island women to learn more about cervical cancer risk factors and make an appointment to get screened today.”  - Health and Wellness Minister James Aylward  Islanders can call 1-888-561-2233 to book an appointment at one of the cervical cancer screening clinics at: Pap Screening and Cervical Cancer Prevention or complete an online booking form, or speak with their primary care provider.     “Having a pap test is important to catch early signs of cervical cancer, so it is essential to make time for it in your schedule.” said Anja Nied-Kutterer, PEI Cervical Cancer Screening Program Coordinator. “We know that cancer screening can save lives, and with changes to the provincial screening guidelines, it is recommended that Islanders go for screening at age 25.”  The current pap screening guidelines recommend women should have a Pap test if they: are 25-65 years of age and have been sexually active (including intercourse, as well as oral or touch with a partner’s genital area, male or female); are over 65 years of age and have not had three negative tests in the last 10 years. “With vaccination against HPV, the virus known to cause cervical cancer, and early detection through screening, cervical cancer is one of the most preventable and treatable forms of cancer,” said Natalie Jameson, Minister Responsible for the Status of Women. “Take the time to look after yourself, for your family and the ones you love.” Cervical Cancer Pap Clinics are located across PEI in Souris, Montague, Charlottetown, Summerside, Tyne Valley, Lennox Island, O’Leary, Alberton and Tignish.

It is because of hardworking Islanders and a determined business community that we have been able to weather one of the most challenging times in our province’s history.   The global pandemic has forced our business community to adapt in unimaginable ways, and now, perhaps more than ever, we need to support them as they adjust to living with COVID-19. As a government, we will continue to work together with our business community to ensure flexibility in provincial and federal support programs so that as many Island businesses and industries as possible can take advantage of them. As the world economy rebounds and new markets continue to open, we will do our part to assist businesses and industries in reaching those markets. By working side-by-side with businesses we are identifying opportunities to reinvigorate our economy, to foster business innovation, to better support industry and grow our workforce.   This week, we recognize and thank small businesses across our province for their leadership and the tremendous economic and social contributions they make to our province every day. I ask all Islanders to join me in supporting small businesses across Prince Edward Island by buying local as much as possible. We have an opportunity to build an even more prosperous future for everyone to enjoy, and that starts by investing right here, at home.”   Media Contact:  	Amanda Hamel 	Executive Director, Communications and Public Affairs 	Office of the Premier 	(902) 368-4400 ahamel@gov.pe.ca      Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

We must continue to work together to support, respect and inspire women in our communities – to ensure their voices are heard, their thoughts and ideas are valued and that they have every opportunity to become the great leaders they were meant to be.  As Nellie McClung once said, ‘I believe in women – in their ability to do things, and in their influence and power’.  As we continue to celebrate Women’s History Month, I encourage all Islanders to celebrate the women in their lives and all women who have fought for gender equality here at home and around the world.

The Department of Environment, Water and Climate Change, Island Waste Management Corporation, and the City of Charlottetown invite all Islanders to take part in a five-day food waste challenge to help people get a better understanding of where their food waste comes from and how to make changes that reduce food waste.  “Waste Reduction Week is an opportunity for all of us to take action in our day-to-day lives. Spending time with your family or colleagues learning how to reduce food waste is a great way to support the environment."" - Environment, Water and Climate Change Minister Natalie Jameson  Islanders can visit Take Charge Action for Climate Change to take the food waste challenge and be guided through five days of activities that include: learning about the issue of food waste; tracking one’s food waste and leftovers; storing fruits and vegetables properly so they last longer; getting creative with leftovers; and thinking about food safety and expiry dates “Reducing the material we dispose of is important every day of the year,” says the CEO of Island Waste Management Corporation (IWMC), Gerry Moore. “During Waste Reduction Week, we can build on PEI’s waste diversion successes and focus on reducing food waste.  Together, let’s change our behaviour to cut down on the amount of ‘good food’ that ends up in compost.” A study by Dalhousie University shows an increase in household food waste by 13.5 per cent since the start of the pandemic. IWMC confirmed that there was an increase in domestic food waste on Prince Edward Island by roughly 1 kg per month since the start of the pandemic.  “We all have a responsibility to do our part to reduce our impacts on the environment,” said Charlottetown Mayor Philip Brown. “Participating in the food waste challenge is a great and easy way to make a difference. We also encourage the public to check out the City’s social media channels for education resources, challenges, incentives and prizes available during Waste Reduction Week.” Islanders can pledge to complete the #FoodWasteFridayPEI challenge on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram using the hashtag #FoodWasteFridayPEI from October 19 - 28, 2020 and be entered to win local prizes from the three sponsors.

Dominic LeBlanc, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs & President of the Queen’s Privy Council.  Premier King expressed his appreciation for the continued support of the federal government throughout the last seven months, but highlighted concerns with the continued delay for sector specific funding for tourism and the lack of dedicated federal support for the Canadian airline industry.  Premier King reiterated to Minister LeBlanc that further delays in support for Canadian airlines will lead to further disruptions of air travel in Atlantic Canada, similar to what was recently announced by WestJet. Premier King praised the leadership from the Charlottetown Airport Authority for working with carriers to maintain critical routes during the last seven months, but those efforts must be complemented with a significant, dedicated federal support program to assist airlines as they deal with drastic decreases in passenger travel.    Premier King also used the opportunity to urge Minister LeBlanc to work with his federal cabinet colleagues to expedite the federal support package for the tourism sector. With the traditional peak tourism season now past, tourism operators are expressing high levels of concerns on the outlook in the upcoming months and a federal support package is needed immediately to ensure that tourism remains a key economic driver for Prince Edward Island.   	Premier King also mentioned that he would be raising both issues with the Prime Minister this evening during the First Ministers teleconference.

104,2020-10-14,Canada,Prince Edward Island,,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/island-women-encouraged-get-regular-breast-screenings,Government Website,Island women encouraged to get regular breast screenings,"                 Island women are encouraged to follow breast screening guidelines and have regular mammograms.  October is Breast Cancer Awareness month and the perfect time to remind everyone about the importance of getting screened and finding breast cancer early. Breast screening is available to women aged 40-79 without a referral from a physician through the PEI Breast Screening Program.   “With regular mammograms, women are more likely to discover breast cancer early and have a better chance of recovering. We encourage all women who are eligible for the program to book an appointment – it is as simple as making a call.” - Health and Wellness Minister James Aylward  Through the breast screening program, women ages 40-49 are able to get a screening every year through self-referral. Those at high risk of breast cancer are also recommended to have yearly screenings. This includes women who have had radiation therapy to the chest (prior to age 30) to treat another cancer or condition (e.g., Hodgkin lymphoma) or who have a gene mutation (e.g., BRCA1, BRCA2). Women ages 50-74 are recommended to have a screening mammogram every two years, if they do not have symptoms or any other known risk factors.   In 2019, 10,436 breast screening exams were completed through the breast screening program. “While we are proud of the more than 10,000 women who self-refer and get their regular mammograms, we know there are many more eligible women who have yet to make an appointment,” said Jamie-Lynn Bell, Interim Provincial Breast Screening Coordinator for Health PEI. “We hope those women are reminded to make the call and get scheduled for a screening as soon as possible.” Minister Responsible for the Status of Women, Natalie Jameson said it is important for people to remember the impact breast cancer has on Island women.  	“Everyone knows a wife, a sister, a mother, a daughter or a loved one who has experienced breast cancer. It affects our communities, our families, and it has taken many lives,” said Minister Natalie Jameson. “Being aware of the risk of breast cancer and taking steps to detect it early on is vitally important. I urge women, don’t put off screening because of COVID-19. You are too important.” The provincial breast screening program, which operates  at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital and Prince County Hospital, is taking appointments. Islanders can schedule an appointment by calling 1-888-592-9888 (toll-free).  Between regular screening appointments, women are encouraged to do self-examinations for any changes or unusual bumps on their breasts and speak with their primary care provider to determine if a mammography is needed.

We were excited about the prospects for growth and greater connection to the rest of Canada. Today, Islanders are faced with limited air access, which has a direct impact on families and businesses.            For several months, I have consistently raised concerns about tourism and travel with the Prime Minister and the Federal Government, and for months I have been assured that support would be provided to these sectors. I once again call on the Federal Government to urgently address the pressures being faced by tourism and travel businesses, which play such a vital role in Prince Edward Island. The Charlottetown Airport Authority has worked hard in the context of COVID-19 to ensure good service for Islanders. Ours was one of a few airports in the region that maintained low fees for airlines and passengers when traffic decreased dramatically.  We will continue to work with the Authority, as well as the tourism and business communities, to advocate for needed access to PEI. I look forward to conversations tomorrow with the Honourable Dominic LeBlanc, federal Minister for Intergovernmental Affairs, on how the Federal Government will commit to support air access and tourism.”              Media Contact: 	Amanda Hamel 	Executive Director, Communications and Public Affairs 	Office of the Premier 	(902) 368-4400 ahamel@gov.pe.ca      Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

Together, we have faced challenge after challenge, and we are still finding our way through to a new normal while living with COVID-19. Throughout these past few months, Islanders have shown incredible resilience, kindness and courage in the face of difficult times.  Mental health is everyone’s business. We have all experienced moments when we have felt anxious, stressed, overwhelmed, sad and even afraid. For some, those feelings will go away after a short time; for others, they are present all the time and may even grow into something more serious that impacts their overall well-being – this can happen to anyone of us.  Since the onset of the pandemic, our mental health care teams have been able to adapt many programs and services available in communities across the province. They have also introduced new ones through telehealth to make them more accessible from the comfort of home or anywhere you are – simply call or text to connect with a trained mental health professional. If you need help, please reach out. They are there to support you.  Today, and every day, I encourage Islanders to talk openly about their mental health struggles and well-being. The more we talk about mental health the more we challenge the stigma that prevents many from reaching out for help. Together, we can support the mental health of Islanders and truly make a difference for generations to come.”     For more information on mental health care offered across Prince Edward Island, visit: Mental Health Services.

It is a quick and easy step to take to further protect yourself and others.”  Starting today, individuals in Prince Edward Island who test positive for COVID-19 and have downloaded the free app can receive a one-time use key from public health that they can enter into the app to activate the notification function. Those who have been in close contact with this individual (for more than 15 minutes, less than two meters apart, in the past 14 days) and have also downloaded the COVID Alert app will receive an anonymous alert through the app indicating that they may have been exposed to COVID-19.  Islanders who receive a notification through the COVID Alert app should immediately visit a Drop-in Testing Clinic to be tested, and remain at home until they receive their test results.  The COVID Alert app, which can be downloaded through the App Store or Google Play, uses Bluetooth signals to exchange codes with nearby phones that also have the app installed. COVID Alert does not collect any personally identifiable information like your name, location, address or any health information.   The COVID Alert exposure notification system does not replace the manual contact tracing that is required under the Prince Edward Island Public Health Act. Public health nurses perform contact tracing for all positive cases of COVID-19 detected in the province. Through contact tracing, public health nurses work with individuals who test positive to identify close contacts and then notify those individuals who are likely to have come into close and prolonged contact with a positive case beginning 48 hours prior to symptom onset (or 48 hours prior to testing for cases without symptoms).

We all have a responsibility to help those we love and those in our communities. I can’t think of a better way to support a family member, friend, neighbour, or colleague, than to help them get the help they need.”  - Health and Wellness Minister James Aylward  Most mental health and addictions services delivered through Health PEI are now back to regular operations as the province enters the new normal phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Child and youth programming such as Strength, INSIGHT, Walk-in Clinics, Strongest Families, Student Well Being Teams, and Community Mental Health, have all resumed  regular operations.   Also, new telehealth services (online, telephone and text) have helped reduce wait times and  continue to be available to assist Islanders. Health PEI has also established a new, temporary Child and Youth Psychiatric Inpatient unit at Hillsborough Hospital while work is being done to reinstate the acute psychiatric unit at the QEH. Psychiatrists are also on call 24/7 and are available for consultation by telehealth at both PCH and QEH Emergency Rooms and at the Psychiatry Urgent Care Clinic at Hillsborough Hospital.  Islanders can refer themselves or their loved ones to many services. A full list of all existing supports and services is available on the Health PEI website – Mental Health Services. “We are committed to providing Islanders with high quality mental health and addictions services when and where they need them,” said chief of mental health and addictions, Dr. Heather Keizer.  “We’re very pleased that new telehealth services have greatly reduced wait times and improved access for people who need care, but we know there’s more work to do.  We welcome feedback from patients and their families on how we can deliver the best possible care for Islanders.”  Health PEI continues to make progress on the new mental health and addictions acute care hospital,  and plans are in the works to launch two significant community-first programs in the coming months.    “The redevelopment project is historic in scope, but it’s not just about infrastructure,” said Verna Ryan,  chief administrative officer with mental health and addictions.  “New facilities are needed, but the community-first programming we will be delivering locally is what will make a real difference in the lives of Islanders.” Media contact: 	Samantha Hughes 	Senior Communications Officer 	Department of Health and Wellness 	902-368-5610 	Everton McLean 	Senior Communications Officer 	Health PEI 	902-213-1507 Backgrounder:  Mental Health and Addictions Services are available in communities across the province.

Islanders who are experiencing symptoms should immediately visit a Drop-in Testing Clinic to be tested.  New Brunswick public health officials are focusing efforts on identification, isolation and testing of close contacts of the cases. The origin of this outbreak is unknown, and we anticipate that more information will be available in the coming days.  This outbreak is a reminder that following public health measures – physical distancing, frequent handwashing, coughing into your elbow, wearing a non-medical mask in indoor public spaces, staying home if you’re feeling unwell, keeping your circle of contacts small – remain crucial to protecting ourselves and others from COVID-19.  COVID-19 is a virus that spreads easily and quickly. While the risk of COVID-19 transmission in Prince Edward Island remains low, the virus continues to present a serious threat to our province. We must remain vigilant and not let our guard down; this is not the time to be complacent in our attitudes and behaviours regarding COVID-19. Every Islander is vulnerable to contracting the virus, and we need to be careful about having contact with people outside our household – just because we know the people we are in contact with, it does not reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19.”  For more information about Prince Edward Island’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, visit: COVID-19 (coronavirus) in Prince Edward Island.

124,2020-10-03,Canada,Prince Edward Island,,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/province-warns-presence-fentanyl,Government Website,Province warns of presence of fentanyl,"   Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Heather Morrison is warning Islanders of the presence of a highly potent opioid, fentanyl, in the province following an accidental overdose involving the drug.  The Coroner reported an accidental overdose death involving fentanyl – a man in his 40s – to Summerside police and the Chief Public Health Office late Friday.  Investigations are ongoing.  Fentanyl is a powerful opioid that is 50-100 times stronger than morphine and has caused accidental overdoses and death in individuals who consume street drugs. Dr. Morrison says anyone consuming street drugs – not only opioids, but any drug in pill or powdered form – should take steps to reduce the risks, carry naloxone and inform others who may use drugs that naloxone is available.  If an individual feels that they need a naloxone kit, they can contact the provincial Needle Exchange Program toll-free by calling 1-877-637-0333 or visit a program site. Free kits are also available to clients of mental health and addiction programs and select community groups. More information is available at: Preventing Opioid-Related Overdoses.  The Summerside Police Services is continuing its investigation into this incident and are very concerned about the presence of fentanyl within the Summerside area and all of Prince Edward Island.  Anyone with any information in relation to this matter, or other drug related information, is asked to contact the Summerside Police Services at 902-432-1201, Prince District Joint Forces Drug Section at 902-432-9300, or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477) There have now been 11 accidental opioid-related overdoses in the province since April 2020, 8 of which involved fentanyl. Not all overdoses have resulted in death.   A Public Health Alert for fentanyl remains in place for the province. Islanders are encouraged to call 911 right away if they suspect an overdose.  The Departments of Health & Wellness, Justice and Public Safety, Health PEI, Island EMS and local Police Services are actively monitoring the situation and working closely together on Preventing Opioid-Related Overdoses and Deaths. Backgrounder:  What should you do if you suspect an overdose? Call 911 right away if you suspect an overdose. The sooner you call the better the chance of recovery. An overdose might look different from one person to the next. But there are a few things you can look for if you suspect someone may have overdosed on an opioid like fentanyl. This includes slow, shallow breathing or no breathing and severe sleepiness or the person is not responsive. The Canadian Good Samaritan law protects people from being charged for simple drug possession. Call 911 to save the life of someone who overdoses. Call 911 even if naloxone is used because it may not be enough to permanently reverse the overdose; it only lasts for 20 minutes,  so it is important to get medical help for the best chance of survival. Is there help for someone who wants to quit? Many resources are still available to Islanders suffering with addiction. If you need assistance, call 1-888-299-8399 (toll-free), speak with your health-care provider, or connect with a counsellor at the Addiction Services Call-In Clinic.

Treaty Day is a special day that strengthens the shared commitment of government and the Mi’kmaq to advance the overall wellbeing of Indigenous peoples in Prince Edward Island. Through ongoing discussions, the PEI Mi’kmaq and the Province are actively working together to address mutual interests, including Mi’kmaq rights issues, while building on the good work accomplished to date on reconciliation. This year, Islanders will have the opportunity to learn from the PEI Mi’kmaq about their culture and history through special performances of traditional drumming and singing.

This Treaty Education initiative will help all Islanders gain a better understanding of Mi’kmaq Section 35 rights, including treaty rights.  “Awareness of Mi’kmaq culture and history, as well as recognition of Mi’kmaq Treaties is key to reconciliation. Premier King demonstrated the true depth of his understanding of the importance of the Treaties to all Islanders when he proclaimed October 1st as Treaty Day one year ago today. With his leadership and commitment today to establish a Treaty Education partnership with L’nuey, he has once again shown the Mi’kmaq and all Islanders his sincere appreciation of the importance of our Treaty relationship. We are all Treaty people and our new Treaty Education Partnership will allow the Mi’kmaq and PEI government to work together to create opportunities for all Islanders to learn about the Mi’kmaq, our inherent Aboriginal and Treaty rights and most importantly, our shared history,” said Chief Darlene Bernard of Lennox Island First Nation. 	  	“We are proud to join the PEI government in recognizing and celebrating Treaty Day here in Epekwitk. We look forward to this annual partnership to raise awareness of Mi’kmaq history and culture,” said Chief Junior Gould of Abegweit First Nation. “This is an important day not only for the Epekwitk Mi’kmaq, but all Islanders, and I encourage everyone to reflect on the special Treaty relationship we share as Treaty people.” Chiefs Darlene Bernard of Lennox Island First Nation and Junior Gould of Abegweit First Nation will raise the Mi’kmaq Grand Council flag together with Premier Dennis King at the provincial government offices on October 1st to honour Treaty Day. The Mi’kmaq Grand Council flag will fly for the month of October to honour the PEI Mi’kmaq.  “This year has been like no other but the important work of reconciliation cannot and did not take a break. We know that the contributions of the PEI Mi’kmaq are many and will continue to have a meaningful place in how we move forward as a province. The development of a new Treaty Education Partnership will help realize the Province and the Mi’kmaq’s shared vision of making our Island the very best it can be for all our residents. Special days like Treaty Day also offers us all a unique opportunity to gain more understanding and appreciation for Mi’kmaq culture and heritage. Standing alongside Chiefs Bernard and Gould, I am confident that together, we will continue to realize meaningful change for Prince Edward Island.” - Premier Dennis King  To learn more about reconciliation and treaties, visit: Understanding Indigenous Matters.

128,2020-10-01,Canada,Prince Edward Island,,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/free-book-giving-program,Government Website,Free book giving program,"   The PEI Literacy Alliance launched the Dolly Parton Imagination Library program on September 30, 2020, in partnership with Rotary Clubs and the Province of Prince Edward Island. The launch was held at their 30th Annual General Meeting. The Imagination Library, a free book giving program, will be available to Island children ages 0-4. Each month, registered children will receive high-quality books by mail, at no cost to families.  “We are thrilled to help build libraries in Island homes because we know that access to books has a positive impact on lifelong learning.” says Nathan Steeves, Chair at the PEI Literacy Alliance. “While looking for ways to expand our existing Free Books for Kids program, we were approached by Senator Dianne Griffin about the Imagination Library. Senator Griffin has since been key in moving this initiative forward.”   Dolly Parton first launched this program in 1995 to inspire a love of reading, and it’s working. Parents registered with the program say their children are excited to receive books in the mail and are more interested in learning how to read.    “As parents and caregivers, we are our children’s first and most important teachers. Through the Imagination Library initiative, Island families will be able to support their children in developing important literacy and language skills through the gift of books and reading,” said Premier Dennis King.  “When we invest in our children’s literacy we are creating an opportunity for them to be successful and building a brighter future for many generations of Islanders.” The Imagination Library has been successfully growing in Canada since 2006. It reaches more children than any other early childhood book giving program worldwide. This program is now available to up to 2,000 children in PEI this year with funding from the Province of PEI and Rotary Clubs of Charlottetown, Montague and Eastern PEI and Charlottetown Royalty. By 2023, the PEI Literacy Alliance expects the program will grow to serve 4000 children. “As a Rotarian, I am thrilled that the Rotary Clubs of Charlottetown, Montague and Eastern PEI and Charlottetown Royalty have signed on to support bringing Imagination Library to PEI. Given that literacy is one of Rotary’s six areas of focus, I think that this will prove to be a fruitful collaboration for years to come.” says Senator Diane Griffin. “Access to books is one of the most powerful avenues to support a child’s ability to read and foster a love reading,” said Minister of Education and Lifelong Learning, Brad Trivers. “By giving children at-home access to a variety of good books, we are helping them develop as readers, writers and lifelong learners.” Children ages 0-4 are eligible to participate in this program. Beginning September 30, families can register online at www.peiliteracy.ca.   Media contact: Amanda Beazley  	Family Literacy Director 	PEI Literacy Allianceamanda@peiliteracy.ca 	902-314-7714  	About the PEI Literacy Alliance Founded in 1990, the Alliance works to achieve its mission to advance literacy for Islanders by:  delivering free literacy programs and services raising awareness of literacy  partnering with organizations, communities, businesses and government departments to share knowledge, build capacity, and deliver programs.  Connect with the PEI Literacy Alliance.

129,2020-09-30,Canada,Prince Edward Island,,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/government-provides-economic-and-fiscal-outlook-province,Government Website,Government provides economic and fiscal outlook for the province,"   Today, Finance Minister Darlene Compton provided the fall economic and fiscal update, which outlines for Islanders the province’s current economic position as it enters the new normal phase of living with COVID-19. Prince Edward Island experienced growth in the first quarter of 2020 and was in a strong economic position, which put it in a better place to weather the impacts of the pandemic. Overall, the province’s economy is anticipated to decrease by 3.9 per cent this year, which is better than the 5.1 per cent decrease projected in June. The collective efforts of Islanders in mitigating and containing the spread of COVID-19 has allowed many public health restrictions to be relaxed and most sectors to re-open sooner than in other areas of the country.  “Prince Edward Island has not been immune to the economic impacts of the global pandemic; however, we have fared better than most provinces and in our initial projections,” said Minister of Finance Darlene Compton.    “We’ve seen some recovery as Islanders return to work and businesses re-open, although we know the service industry – accommodation, food and beverage services – continues to be the hardest hit.  Our economy continues to move forward, and the hard work, ingenuity and resiliency of Islanders will allow us to renew and strengthen our economic position for the betterment of everyone.” The current forecast for 2020-2021 shows a deficit of $178.1 million, a slight increase of $5.4 million from the budget tabled in June.  The 2020-2021 budget included contingencies for managing economic recovery and supporting Islanders during a second wave of COVID-19.  The fall fiscal update maintains these contingencies for the continued support of Islanders. Total revenue is forecasted to decrease by $36.8 million, primarily due to decreases in both federal and provincial revenue sources.  Offsetting this is an increase in revenues for government business enterprises due to better than anticipated sales as a result of the Atlantic Travel Bubble. Total expenditures are forecasted to decrease by $31.4 million, primarily due to delays in infrastructure projects under the New Build Canada Fund, delays in new hires, and interest savings. 	  	Employment across Prince Edward Island continues to recover from what was seen in April and is projected to reach previous levels by late fall. The reopening of childcare services and return to full-time classroom learning in schools allows even more Islanders, especially women, to return to the workforce. With the momentum of strong growth in the first quarter of 2020, Prince Edward Island continues to see growth in several key economic areas, including wholesale trade, international exports, housing starts, and farm cash receipts. The bond ratings issued by the three credit rating agencies for the Prince Edward Island remain stable and allow the province to experience favourable borrowing conditions and lower than expected interest rates. Prince Edward Island’s population grew by 2,363 people in the first half of 2020, bringing the total population to 159,625 – a one and a half per cent annual growth rate, the fastest growth among the provinces.  Immigration is also expected to grow to near pre-COVID levels this year, which will further support the residential construction sector.   	  	Moving forward, Prince Edward Island’s economy is expected to rebound significantly in 2021 and will be boosted by factors such as an increase in immigration to the province, federal income supports, and economic improvements among other provinces in the country and for trading partners around the world.

130,2020-09-30,Canada,Prince Edward Island,,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/influenza-season-arrives-pei,Government Website,Influenza season arrives in PEI,"   The influenza vaccine for this year’s flu shots has arrived in Prince Edward Island and Islanders are encouraged to get their flu shot to protect themselves and their loved ones.   “In our efforts to minimize the impact of the flu in Prince Edward Island, we are proud to provide free flu shots for all Islanders at various sites across the province. For the first time this year, high dose influenza vaccine will be offered to all Island seniors free of charge. Getting a flu shot is a quick and easy way to protect ourselves, our families and our communities; it is an important step we can all take to stay healthy this flu season.” - Health and Wellness Minister James Aylward  The vaccine is currently available at public health clinics, pharmacies, and nurse practitioners’ and physicians’ offices. Public health will be offering influenza vaccine by appointment only starting in early October; call 1-844-975-3303 or visit Flu Vaccination Clinics for more information and clinic locations.  	“Getting a flu shot and washing your hands frequently is the best way to protect yourself from getting the flu or spreading the flu to those around you,” said Dr. Heather Morrison, the province’s chief public health officer. All Islanders are encouraged to protect themselves and get immunized, especially those who are at a higher risk of becoming seriously ill from influenza such as young children, elderly people, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems or other chronic health conditions. This flu season is extraordinary because both COVID-19 and seasonal influenza viruses will be circulating at the same time. I encourage all Islanders to get vaccinated.” There are many vaccines recommended for adults.  All Islanders over the age of 65 should also get a pneumococcal (Pneu-P-23) vaccine. It helps protect against pneumococcal disease including a serious type of pneumonia, blood infections, and meningitis. Islanders can take the adult immunization self-assessment tool anytime to find out what other vaccines they may need. In addition to getting a flu shot, Islanders should practice the three C’s to limit the spread of any respiratory illness:  Clean – properly wash your hands frequently; Cover – cover your cough and sneeze; and Contain – contain your germs by staying home if you are sick.  To learn more visit Flu Vaccination Clinics. Media contact: 	Samantha Hughes 	Department of Health and Wellness shughes@gov.pe.ca Backgrounder About influenza 	Influenza, also known as the flu, affects the airways and the lungs. It spreads easily through coughing and sneezing, or by touching things that have been contaminated by the virus and then touching your mouth, eyes or nose. It can sometimes cause severe illness or even death.  Why get vaccinated against influenza? 	Seasonal influenza (flu) is a highly contagious virus. Even healthy people can get very sick from the flu and spread it to others. Vaccination is the single most effective way of lowering your risk of getting the flu. When you get your flu shot, you protect yourself, your family and your community. The flu can lead to serious complications for individuals with pre-existing illness (cancer, COPD or asthma), the very young and the elderly. Complications may include pneumonia, hospitalization, and death. Individuals with symptoms of acute respiratory infection, including minor symptoms such as sore throat or runny nose, should defer influenza immunization until they have recovered, as they can pose an unnecessary risk to others and healthcare providers if they have COVID-19. Those who are self-isolating should defer vaccination for influenza until they are no longer required to isolate. What is the flu shot? 	The World Health Organization (WHO) determines the most likely flu virus strains to be circulating in the upcoming flu season. The vaccine is then manufactured to protect against these strains. Because the flu shot contains particles of inactivated (dead) flu virus, you cannot get influenza from the flu shot. This year's flu vaccine offers protection against 4 strains of influenza viruses specified by the World Health Organization:  2 strains of influenza A and 2 strains of influenza B. The following influenza vaccines will be made available to immunizers for the 2020-2021 influenza season for the following indications: 1)    QIV injectable inactivated quadravalent vaccine for both adults and children (6 months of age and older 	2)    HD TIV for all adults  65+  	3)     Flumist QIV is for children 2 to 17 years of age and is available at Public health Nursing and some physician offices. How does it work? 	The flu shot protects against four strains of influenza viruses that experts anticipate will circulate during the influenza season. It does this by stimulating your immune system to build up antibodies against the viruses, making it stronger so that it’s ready to fight off the illness before it starts. Seasonal influenza vaccine is effective at lowering the risk of influenza illness and hospitalization depending on the age and health status of the person receiving the vaccine. Why should I get it early in the season? 	Getting your flu shot early in the season lets your immune system build up antibodies sooner, so it’s ready when flu season starts. It can take up to two weeks for antibodies to build up after you get the shot. Who should get it? 	The flu shot is recommended for everyone over six months of age. It’s especially important for:  people with weakened immune systems those who have a chronic illness, including asthma or are morbidly obese residents of long term care young children pregnant women those aged 65 and over people who identify as Indigenous anyone who takes care of people in these groups  To reduce the risk of severe illness that could potentially arise from co-infection with COVID-19 and influenza, individuals who fall into the following groups are also particularly recommended to receive the influenza vaccine this fall:  People at high risk of COVID-19 related illness People capable of transmitting influenza to those at high risk of severe and critical illness related to COVID-19   What are the potential side effects? 	The most common side effect from a flu shot is soreness at the injection site. It is usually temporary and rarely interferes with normal activities. What are the symptoms of Influenza? 	Influenza symptoms can include sudden onset of fever, headache, muscle pain, runny nose, sore throat, extreme tiredness, and cough. Children may also experience nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Symptoms can begin about one to four days after a person is first exposed to the influenza virus. Fever and other symptoms may last up to seven to ten days, with the cough and weakness lasting up to two more weeks. Where can Islanders receive the flu shot?  Health PEI Public Health Nursing clinics (schedule of clinics is available at Flu Vaccination Clinics Family physicians and nurse practitioners offices Various pharmacies  Is there a charge for getting the flu shot? 	All individuals living in PEI are eligible for a free flu shot. The government of Prince Edward Island covers both the cost of the medication, and the administrative fee.

The Province of Prince Edward Island is pleased to share that they will be contributing $1.25 million to the construction of a new Ronald McDonald House in Halifax that, once complete, will double the number of families it can serve annually. Health & Wellness Minister, James Aylward, announced the funding at an event today in Stratford.  “When a child is undergoing treatment or medical care, it is so important that the child and their entire family is well supported. Over the years, many Island families have been comforted by this home away from home, and now with the new build we will see the number of supported families double each year.” - Health & Wellness Minister, James Aylward  For parents with a sick or seriously injured child, life can be very difficult. Their situation leaves them emotionally drained, anxious and financially stressed. Without the support of Ronald McDonald House, Maritime families would face an estimated $272/day for accommodations and meals. In the past ten years, Ronald McDonald House in Halifax has provided 6,368 nights of comfort for Island families and in 2019, the organization supported 2,076 Maritime families. Along with the Ronald McDonald House, RMHC Atlantic’s programs also include two Ronald McDonald Family Rooms® which provide families with a space for calm and support at the IWK Health Centre and the Moncton Hospital. Quotes: “Investing in social infrastructure that supports families is essential to building healthy and resilient communities. The new Ronald McDonald House in Halifax will help lighten the load for Prince Edward Island families with sick children at the IWK Health Centre. We are very proud to work with our partners to deliver this important project for Islanders. It is most fitting that it is an esteemed Islander, Lori Barker, at the helm.” Sean Casey, Member of Parliament for Charlottetown “For Maritime families with sick children, Ronald McDonald House is their home-away-from-home. As a community, we share the responsibility to ensure that they have a loving place to stay together as they face unimaginable challenges.” Scott McCain & Leslie McLean, Co-Chairs, RMHC Atlantic Campaign  	“In the past ten years alone, Ronald McDonald House Charities Atlantic provided nearly 6,400 nights of comfort to families from Prince Edward Island. These are our neighbours and friends who have endured the heartbreaking experience of a seriously sick or injured child, and have had to travel far from their homes for the hospital care they need. With that experience comes a great deal of emotional and financial stress. That’s where RMHC Atlantic comes in.” David McKenna, Regional Lead, PEI, RMHC Atlantic Campaign   	“I remember arriving at the Ronald McDonald House the night before my third surgery, along with my dad and older brother. We checked in after supper, played some board games, and I drew and colored with a volunteer and another boy while my brother played video games. It was amazing. It helped us to forget about the surgery.  It was a place we could relax and feel like we were at home.” Bretton Bannister (age 17), RMHC Family, from Emyvale, Prince Edward Island  	""While the new Ronald McDonald House will be built in Halifax, it truly belongs to all of us.  We thank the Province of Prince Edward Island for recognizing the important role RMHC Atlantic plays in reducing the financial and emotional stresses families face while travelling for medical care.  Our new space will be a home-away-from-home for thousands of Island families in the years to come, and we look forward to being there to support them so they can focus on what’s most important – their sick child.” Lori Barker, Chief Executive Officer, RMHC Atlantic      Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

We can only do this if we work together as a country and as leaders. The Speech from the Throne shows that the federal government is willing to continue to invest in and support Canadians at a time when there is so much uncertainty ahead. For the past six months during our weekly First Minister’s calls, I have been advocating for supports that will help Islanders navigate these challenging times, and I am pleased to see reference to these issues. These supports include the extension of the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS), sector specific funding for industries such as tourism, increased funding for expanding access to high speed internet, and the need to modernize our employment insurance program. These supports will help communities, businesses, and everyday Islanders in the months ahead. As we rebuild as a country, we need to commit to a more sustainable future. We need our federal government’s support for industries such as tourism, fisheries, agriculture and clean energy to ensure these industries are resilient and continue to be key pillars of our economy for years to come. Climate change drastically impacts these key economic drivers and I will continue to advocate to the federal government for the need to rebuild these industries to be more resilient in the face of a changing climate.   For the past number of years, we have led the country when it comes to early childhood and childcare. I look forward to working with the federal government on a national early learning and childcare system, to enhance what already exists in our province and further support young families on Prince Edward Island.  Canadians got us to where we are today – both historically and during this pandemic – by staying united.  Collectively, we need to continue to address gender inequality, racism, and work towards reconciliation with our indigenous communities. Our federal government reaffirmed their commitment to work with provinces and Canadians to address these, and other inequities in our country.  Last, I look forward to future discussions among my provincial counterparts and our federal government on more stable and sustained health care funding and reaching a long-term agreement on the Canadian Health Transfer in advance of the next fiscal year.”   Media Contact:  	Amanda Hamel 	Executive Director, Communications and Public Affairs 	Office of the Premier 	(902) 368-4400 ahamel@gov.pe.ca       Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

Dr. Morrison recognized that as more Islanders return to work, many of them may be required to travel outside of the Atlantic Bubble for their work. With this in mind, Islanders are reminded to follow self-isolation protocols when returning to the province from outside the Atlantic Bubble.  Individuals who can work from home throughout the 14-day self-isolation period should have a plan in place for contactless delivery of essentials during this period of time. Individuals who must return to work following travel outside the Atlantic Bubble (but within Canada), must follow work-isolation protocols and public health measures, including: self-isolating when not at the workplace, monitoring for symptoms of COVID-19, physical distancing as much as possible, wearing a non-medical mask when at work, and have a plan in place for contactless delivery of essentials.  Islanders who are rotational workers (those who travel frequently or routinely outside the Atlantic Bubble (within Canada), spending at least half of their time working outside of Atlantic Canada), do not need to self-isolate or work-isolate. Instead, rotational workers must be tested on a regular basis, monitor for symptoms and follow public health measures such as physical distancing, frequent hand washing and wearing a non-medical mask when physical distancing is not possible. This protocol has been in place since the early onset of the pandemic to balance an acceptable risk of transmission with the need for rotational workers to see their families for the limited time they are home. Effective October 1, individuals who work outside of the Atlantic Bubble (within Canada) who are required to work outside of their home upon return to PEI can apply to work-isolate, via a self-declaration form that will be available on the provincial website. A letter from the worker’s employer indicating their schedule is required. More information on the work-isolate declaration will be available online early next week.  Anyone experiencing symptoms related to COVID-19, can access drop-in testing clinics for a test. These clinics do not require a call to 8-1-1 or an appointment. New guidance documents have been added to the Renew PEI, Together webpage, including: multiple gatherings; sports and recreational activities; school outbreaks; CPHO school directives; and holiday guidance.  Holiday guidance permits door-to-door trick-or-treating, but with precautions in place. Children should only visit households in their neighborhood/apartment building and those that they know; no contact treat pick up is recommended; and be respectful of households that do not wish to participate this year.  	 Backgrounder:  The Chief Public Health Office continues to work closely with the federal government, provincial and territorial counterparts, government departments and Health PEI to monitor the pandemic situation and prepare for all COVID-19 related impacts to the province, including health, social and economic. The public health risk of COVID-19 is continually reassessed and Islanders will be updated as new information becomes available. Everyone is encouraged to follow routine prevention measures: 	•    Washing hands frequently with soap and water 	•    Cough and sneeze into your elbow or a tissue 	•    Stay home if you are not feeling well 	•    Limit touching your eyes, nose and mouth 	•    Keep your circle of contacts small 	•    Wear a mask in closed, indoor public spaces 	•    Maintain a distance of two meters from others as much as possible 	•    Don’t share items like drinking glasses and water bottles 	•    Frequently clean surfaces like taps, doorknobs and countertops   Media Contact: 	Samantha Hughes 	Health and Wellnessshughes@gov.pe.ca  	       Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

The national campaign is headed by the Canadian Institute of Public Health Inspectors (CIPHI). This year’s theme is Public Health is a Collective Effort.   “Environmental health officers work together with the industry and facility operators to reduce the chance of illness and to prevent disease in PEI. They provide a tremendous support to the Chief Public Health Office and play a big role in protecting the health of Islanders.”   - Health and Wellness Minister James Aylward  The work of environmental health professionals often goes unnoticed until a crisis arises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.  Environmental health professionals are dedicated individuals, committed to promoting and protecting the health and safety of Islanders, especially during these uncertain times.  These professionals are working the front line of the COVID-19 pandemic response led by the Chief Public Health Office.   In PEI, there are 11 Environmental Health Officers involved in inspection, enforcement and education activities in a wide variety of settings and service areas. Some of these areas include: food premises, recreational water, long term care facilities, childcare facilities, personal services, drinking water systems, sewage systems, air quality, and rental accommodations.   In addition to routine work duties, Environmental Health Officers have been deployed as front line staff for the Chief Public Health Office as part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  “Our Environmental Health Officers have been instrumental throughout the response to the COVID-19 pandemic as they have a distinct skill set to complete risk assessments, enforce regulations and provide education, often simultaneously,” said Dr. Morrison.  Additional duties have included: completing COVID inspections at PEI businesses; reviewing and approving COVID-19 operational plans;   responding to COVID-19 concerns and complaints from Islanders and local businesses;   completing health screenings of travelers at all entry points to PEI and identifying when self-isolation is required; providing infection prevention and control guidance and support to Islanders and businesses.   Environmental Health Officers in PEI hold national certification with the Canadian Institute of Public Health Inspectors.  As part of this certification, all have achieved the education, training and testing requirements as designated by the national organization.  They must complete yearly professional development hours to maintain their certification.  Media contact: 	Samantha Hughes 	Senior Communications Officer 	Health and Wellness 	(902) 368-5610shughes@gov.pe.ca      Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

We all can do our part to keep ourselves and our homes safe by taking simple steps,” said David Rossiter, PEI Fire Marshal. “With Teddy arriving this week, it’s a good reminder for us all to check our smoke and carbon monoxide alarms. It will be especially important to practice safe generator use and to be extra careful with candles and cooking appliances if we experience any power outages.”  Easy fire measures can include: Regularly changing batteries for all smoke and carbon monoxide alarms. Practicing home fire drills with all household members. Keeping anything that can burn at least three feet away from heating equipment. Never leaving any cooking appliance unattended. Keeping matches and lighters out of reach and out of sight of children. Properly disposing of any ignition source materials  Having any heating equipment or generators installed by professionals and scheduling regular maintenance.

It allows this renewable energy project to proceed and reduce greenhouse gases emissions that cause climate change while mitigating the project’s impact to the Island’s ecosystem,” said Minister Jameson. “By having an environmental management plan and wildlife protocols in place, setting up a committee to work together, and adding to protected areas, we can do this the right way for our kids’ sake.”  Approval of the 30-megawatt wind farm is subject to conditions that require the PEI Energy Corporation to: Prepare an Environmental Management Plan which covers each phase of the wind farm’s development (construction, operation, and decommissioning) to be approved by the Department of Environment, Water and Climate Change (EWCC);  Set up an Environmental Management Committee as a forum for people to bring forward concerns when the wind farm goes into operation, with suggested representatives including L’nuey, the Souris and Area Wildlife Branch, the Rural Municipality of Eastern Kings and local residents;  Establish a conflict resolution protocol to deal with issues such as noise and shadow flicker;  Purchase and legally protect from development a minimum 42-hectares of forested property within Kings County in order to compensate for the 14-forested hectares lost as part of the project;  Invite L’nuey to provide an environmental monitor for the construction phase of the project and invite L’nuey’s monitor to visit the site prior to the construction to assist in identifying any culturally significant species of flora, including black ash;  Conduct a two-year post-construction study in the project area monitoring any impact from the wind farm on bats and birds;  Implement a protocol that requires reporting of bird mortalities to federal and provincial authorities;  Develop mitigation measures that will be implemented should the project be shown to have a significant impact on birds or bats; and,  Provide monthly updates to EWCC detailing the status of each of the conditions associated with the Environmental Impact Assessment. A full copy of the Minister’s Environmental Impact Assessment approval is available online by going to Projects Under Environmental Review (Undertakings)  and clicking the search button to view materials for the Eastern Kings Wind Farm project. Media contact: Leanne Ritchie Department of Environment, Water and Climate Change 902-314-0134 lpritchie@gov.pe.ca 	  Backgrounder On October 23, 2019, the PEI Energy Corp. filed its environmental impact statement to expand the Eastern Kings Wind Farm. Regulated under the Environmental Protection Act, an environmental impact assessment review helps to determine any possible impacts, positive or negative, that a proposed project might have on the environment. The PEI Energy Corp. led public engagement, with a public meeting organized November 19, 2019. Public comments were received by EWCC until January 20, 2020.   In total, 80 submissions were received by mail and email. A technical review committee – consisting of experts from both the Government of Canada and Prince Edward Island – looked at the impacts of the project on people, animals, plants, land, air, water and climate and proposed mitigation strategies. EWCC also reached out to the municipal authority and engaged in Aboriginal consultation with L’nuey.  This approval addresses requirements pursuant to the EWCC’s environmental impact assessment process; however, there may be other approvals required from other departments, agencies, governments before the project can proceed.       Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

We will continue to work with our education partners to review our policies as the school year progresses and ensure a successful school year for all.” -  Education and Lifelong Learning Minister Brad Trivers  Updates to the mask policy include: masks will be required for all students K-12 while riding the bus; masks will be required for bus drivers when they are not seated, facing forward and driving the bus; masks will be required for students in Grades 7-12 during transitions and emergency procedures; masks will be required for staff teaching Grades 7-12 during transitions and emergency procedures;  masks will be required for any visitor to the school during transitions and emergency procedures; and  exceptions will be made on a case-by-case basis. These changes were made in consultation with the Public Schools Branch, Commission scolaire de langue français, the Prince Edward Island Teachers’ Federation, Canadian Union of Public Sector Employees and the Prince Edward Island Home and School Federation along with Prince Edward Island’s Chief Public Health Office.  Mask policies for students and staff in grades K-6 while in school have not changed. Masks are encouraged when physical distancing cannot be maintained.  Schools and buses will have masks available for any student or staff member who needs one.  In September, students, families and staff can expect to see the following in schools: physical distancing, directional signage and increased hand washing and sanitizing stations; staggered recess, lunch and arrival and departure times; classrooms reorganized to increase spacing; movement and schedules in cohorts to minimize contact; cohorts will be kept as small as possible; a focus on student and staff well-being; revised curriculum to address potential gaps; breakfast, snack and lunch programs will continue under CPHO food premises guidelines;  students will have the opportunity to engage in all subject areas, although some subject areas may look different;  school sports will be paused during school start-up; and student committees such as Student Council activities will need to follow all guidelines and virtual options will be encouraged.  Additionally, schools have the option to stagger start dates and hold an orientation day for new grades to the school on Tuesday, September 8th. If a school chooses to do this, the remaining grades would start school on Wednesday, September 9th. Schools will communicate directly to their school community with their intended start dates.  The Province of Prince Edward Island has approved approximately $2 million through the COVID-19 Contingency Fund to support student learning, the well-being of students and staff and protect the health and safety of the school community. This includes adding additional teachers, educational assistants, counselling consultants, bus drivers and cleaners for the 2020-2021 school year.  A recent investment of $10 million from the Government of Canada will further increase these activities and promote enhanced cleaning, transportation support, technology for remote learning and ongoing training for staff. More details on how these funds will be used will be announced in the coming days.  For more information, including individual school operational plans, visit Back to School.

I have always admired her deep sense of community, love of family and commitment to empowering Islanders, especially women, to become leaders.   Nancy had a long and storied career as a Member of the Legislative Assembly where her passion for politics and public service were on display. While serving as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly in 1993, she was part of a unique moment in Canadian political history as one of five women who simultaneously held the five most influential legislative government positions in Prince Edward Island – Premier, Leader of the Official Opposition, Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, and Lieutenant Governor – a feat yet to be repeated in Canadian public life. Nancy and her family made Prince Edward Island home in the 1970’s where she worked in the health care field as a radiotherapist and raised her family with her late husband Gregg.  Nancy first served as a member Summerside Town Council for many years before being elected as Member of the Legislative Assembly for 5th Prince in a by-election in 1987. She was re-elected in the general elections of 1989, 1993 and 1996, holding serval cabinet portfolios during that time, including Minister of Tourism and Parks, Minister of Labour, Minister responsible for the Status of Women, and Minister responsible for Human Rights before being elected Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. Nancy was also among a handful of Members of the Legislative Assembly who were elected to represent both dual and single member districts. Following her career in politics, she later served as Chair of the Workers Compensation Board.  Nancy was always a fierce advocate for her adopted home community of Summerside during her years of public service. She was a leader, a trailblazer and an inspiration to so many Islanders. More importantly, she was a devoted mother and grandmother who will be forever missed by her loved ones and her friends.”  Media Contact: 	Amanda Hamel 	Executive Director, Communications and Public Affairs 	Office of the Premier 	(902) 368-4400ahamel@gov.pe.ca      Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

All three cases are males, two are in their 30s and one in his 40s. They are all essential workers employed in the same non-health care related industry. They travelled to PEI from outside the country and have been in self-isolation since they arrived in PEI on August 5. The men continue to do well and remain in self-isolation. They are being followed daily by public health nursing. They had very limited close contacts, and contact tracing is now complete.  The three men travelled on Air Canada flight AC626 from Toronto to Halifax on August 5. Out of an abundance of caution, all passengers who travelled on this flight should monitor for symptoms.  If any passengers on this flight develop symptoms of COVID-19 they should call 811 to arrange for testing. Additionally, Dr. Morrison also announced that, effective immediately, gathering limits for events are increasing to allow for up to three cohorts of 50 people to gather for an event such as a worship service, concert, and sporting events. The increase in gathering capacity is subject to an approved operation plan that ensures physical distancing and separate controlled entrances, exits and designated washrooms for each cohort. Organizations and groups wishing to host an event with three cohorts of 50 people should submit their operational plan to the Chief Public Health Officer for review at least two weeks in advance.  Dr. Morrison confirmed that singing is also allowed with physical distancing of six feet between individuals and provided that non-medical masks are worn by those singing. This easing of a previous restriction will have a positive impact on worship services, choirs, music programs and events.  Guidelines for gatherings and singing activities are being updated to reflect changes announced today and will be available online at Renew PEI Together.  Overall, Dr. Morrison reminded Islanders that the risk of individuals in the province contracting COVID-19 remains low. It is important that the province continues with measures and processes to keep Islanders safe, including: border security, pre-travel approval, self-isolation requirements, operation isolation and testing. It is also important that Islanders continue to practice physical distancing, good hand hygiene and that they wear a mask when in closed, indoor public spaces.  Backgrounder:  	The Chief Public Health Office continues to work closely with the federal government, provincial and territorial counterparts, government departments and Health PEI to monitor the pandemic situation globally, nationally and locally. The public health risk of COVID-19 is continually reassessed and Islanders will be updated as new information becomes available. Government’s special situation response group continues to work collaboratively with the Chief Public Health Office, stakeholders and community partners in preparing for all COVID-19 related impacts to the province, including health, social and economic.  Everyone is encouraged to follow routine prevention measures: Washing hands frequently with soap and water Cough and sneeze into your elbow or a tissue If ill with acute respiratory symptoms, stay home if possible Limit touching your eyes, nose and mouth Don’t share items like drinking glasses and water bottles Frequently clean surfaces like taps, doorknobs and countertops Media Contact: 	Amanda Hamel 	Executive Director, Communications and Public Affairs 	Office of the Premier 	902-368-4400ahamel@gov.pe.ca       Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

The goal is to build capacity here on the Island and support a new generation of climate change champions in our communities.”  - Environment, Water and Climate Change Minister Natalie Jameson  ClimateSense is currently looking for organizations interested in hosting a recent post-secondary graduate for a six-to-twelve month internship, beginning in 2021.  During this time, the intern will work with mentors within the host organization to complete a sector-specific adaptation project, as well as take part in ClimateSense Training and Professional Development Programs. “We know that across Canada and around the world, climate change is having a larger impact on populations affected by systemic racism, as well as vulnerable groups like the elderly, children, and people with chronic mental and physical illnesses, disabilities, and economic vulnerability. Climate change affects our most vulnerable and I encourage organizations from all sectors to consider applying,” said Dr. Adam Fenech, Associate Dean, School of Climate Change and Adaptation at the University of Prince Edward Island. 	  	ClimateSense will cover all or most of the costs associated with supporting the intern (depending on the type of organization).  A minimum of 12 interns will be placed with organizations as part of the ClimateSense Professional Internship Program. Interested organizations should visit  Professional Internship Program for an application and guidelines. The deadline to apply is end of day September 7, 2020.  Media contact: 	Leanne Ritchie 	Department of Environment, Water and Climate Changelpritchie@gov.pe.ca 	902-314-0134 Backgrounder  	The Climate Sense program is a partnership between Prince Edward Island, the University of Prince Edward Island’s School of Climate Change and Adaptation and Natural Resources Canada’s Building Regional Adaptation Capacity and Expertise (BRACE) Program. Other partners include the Architects Association of PEI, EngineersPEI, PEI Institute of Professional Planners, and the PEI Watershed Alliance. There are two streams to the program. A professional development and training program is fostering collaboration and teaching Island professionals and recent graduates to understand the impacts of a changing climate and to integrate climate change adaptation into their daily work. More than 200 professionals have participated in 12 programs since ClimateSense launched in July 2019. An internship program is providing recent graduates with development opportunities and building adaptive capacity within organizations across the province.  The goal of ClimateSense is to facilitate the sharing of knowledge, tools and resources on climate change adaptation across various professions, sectors and disciplines that can be applied to other regions in Canada. Natural Resources Canada’s BRACE program is an $18-million strategic investment under the Adaptation and Climate Resilience pillar of the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change. The program works directly with provinces to deliver projects that include training, internships and knowledge-sharing activities that will build the capacity Canadians need to respond to the effects of a changing climate.

This summer, in particular, Acadians, Francophones and French-speaking Islanders intend on highlighting a very important historical milestone: the 300th anniversary since calling Prince Edward Island their home.  I encourage all Islanders to take part in the many celebrations the Acadian and Francophone community have organized for us all to enjoy. Let’s discover together the uniqueness of a community known for their warmth, their culture and infectious joie de vivre. Happy National Acadian Day.

My wife and I were interested in farming and permaculture , and moving to Prince Edward Island meant that we could be closer to family, have the opportunity to run a hobby farm, and I could continue to practice medicine."" “My favourite thing about working at Western Hospital is the great nursing staff and my very capable and collaborative colleagues, particularly Dr. Bajelan,” he said. “I enjoy the problem solving that is related to acute illness and the fulfillment that comes from helping patients feel better.” When Dr. Campanaro isn’t in the emergency department, he enjoys spending time on his hobby farm or building boats.   “My role as an emergency department doctor gives me work-life balance which had sometimes been lacking when I had a full general practice in Ontario. I have time now to work on developing our hobby farm and can spend more time with my family.”  Dr. Campanaro says he’s also pleased with new skills he has been able to learn on the job at Western Hospital to help his patients.  “I have to thank Dr. Megan Burns and the administrative staff at Western Hospital who were instrumental in securing an ultrasound machine for the emergency department. I have taken some basic ultrasound training and can now use this in my emergency room practice. There are rewarding career opportunities and competitive incentives here on PEI for physicians looking for experience in a rural setting that isn’t remote. Dr. Campanaro says what makes working at Western Hospital so incredible is the support system.  “Most physicians know that the heart of any emergency department is the nursing staff and I can say without reservation that the team at Western Hospital is a great group to work alongside. They care about getting it right for our patients. I have great respect for my fellow ED colleagues, most notably Dr. Bajelan, who has been the bedrock of the department for many years.  We also receive crucial support from our specialist colleagues from across the province, especially from Prince County Hospital in Summerside.” Learn more about emergency medicine opportunities on Prince Edward Island. 	       Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "
197,2020-08-13,Canada,Prince Edward Island,,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/update-provinces-five-recent-covid-19-cases,Government Website,Update on province’s five recent COVID-19 cases,"   Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Heather Morrison, has confirmed additional information regarding PEI’s newest five positive COVID-19 cases, which were first announced yesterday.    The five individuals travelled on Air Canada flight AC8360 from Toronto to Charlottetown on July 30. Out of an abundance of caution, all passengers who travelled on this flight should monitor for symptoms.  If any passengers on this flight develop symptoms of COVID-19 they should call 811 to arrange for testing. The cases are all males in their 30s or 40s. They are essential workers, of the same industry (non-health care related), who travelled to PEI from outside the country. The workers have been in self-isolation since they arrived in PEI on July 30. They each had routine testing between day 10 and 12 of their self-isolation period, and it was at that time the positive cases were confirmed. The cases continue to do well and remain in self-isolation. They had very limited close contacts, and contact tracing is now complete.  The detection of these five new cases is indicative that our system is working. They have been in self-isolation since arriving, they were diagnosed on routine testing and they have very limited close contacts.  The risk of Islanders contracting COVID-19 remains low. It is important that we continue maintaining our processes to keep Islanders safe, including: border security, pre-travel approval, self-isolation requirements, operation isolation and testing. It is also important that Islanders continue maintaining physical distance, practicing good hand hygiene and wearing a mask when in closed, indoor public spaces.  Backgrounder:  	The Chief Public Health Office continues to work closely with the federal government, provincial and territorial counterparts, government departments and Health PEI to continue to monitor the situation globally, nationally and locally. The public health risk of COVID-19 is continually reassessed and Islanders will be updated as new information becomes available. Government’s special situation response group also continues to work collaboratively with the Chief Public Health Office, stakeholders and community partners in preparing for all impacts related to COVID-19 to the province, including health, social and economic.  Everyone is encouraged to follow routine prevention measures: Washing hands frequently with soap and water Cough and sneeze into your elbow or a tissue If ill with acute respiratory symptoms, stay home if possible Limit touching your eyes, nose and mouth Don’t share items like drinking glasses and water bottles Frequently clean surfaces like taps, doorknobs and countertops Media Contact: 	Samantha Hughes 	Health and Wellness 	(902) 368-5610shughes@gov.pe.ca      Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

However, Montigny emphasized that people having a campfire on their own property are still responsible for the fire and should it escape, for any and all suppression and damage costs.  Anyone wishing to have a campfire at a campground or cottage rental should have the owners’ permission. The Fire Weather Index is updated around noon each day. Current information is available on-line. Fire Weather Index information is also available from any forest district office or by calling (902) 368 4800 after hours to hear an automated recording.                              	Media contact: 	Leanne Ritchie 	Department of Environment, Water and Climate Change 	902-314-0134 	       Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

We saw a province and a region come together to Rally for the Valley and turn a dream of building a new facility into reality.  So many people have worked passionately over the past few months to organize Tyne Valley’s entry into this year’s Kraft Hockeyville competition. With overwhelming support, dogged determination and an unbridled passion for sport, local organizers and residents of Tyne Valley have done their part to ensure their community made it into the finals.

It was an extraordinary weather event not seen in recent history and I am incredibly proud of the coordinated effort the province provided Islanders,” said Bloyce Thompson, Minister of Justice and Public Safety. “  This last year, government has responded to a series of unusual events which includes Dorian, supply chain impacts from the rail blockades, a malware attack and currently, COVID-19. The Emergency Measures Organization has been an active contributor throughout these events and it is clear that its role has expanded well beyond isolated weather events.”  “My thanks go to the experts at Calian for this thorough independent review. The recommendations from this report will be part of our plan to build an even stronger and sustainable provincial response plan for all future events,” added Thompson. Close to 300 Islanders took part in focus groups, interviews and a bilingual survey from late February to March this year to provide their insights and experiences related to the provincial response to Dorian.

A new province-wide Healthy School Lunch Program will use a pay-what-you-can model, to a maximum of $5 per meal, in partnership with local producers to provide healthy food options that meet Canada’s Food Guide.  “Ensuring that every child has access to healthy, nutritious food not only ensures that all students have the fuel they need throughout the day to learn but it also helps develop lifelong healthy eating habits. We will continue to make investments in the health and well-being of Island students to ensure our families and communities are strong.” - Hon.

The goals of both programs are to: provide healthy and affordable options to all students while using local food when possible; provide equitable access for all students by offering various payment options such as the pay-what-you-can model; and, provide food literacy opportunities for all students. These programs will guide the province’s plans for a universal healthy school food program to provide a healthy, hot meal option within each Island school beginning in the 2021-2022 school year. “The PEI Home and School Federation is pleased to learn about the continued and expanded school food initiatives to support Island children,” said Cory Thomas, President of the PEI Home and School Federation. “Such a program supports our children by providing nutritious food. The program also supports Island farmers, fishers and our many small businesses.” The food security program that began delivering meals to students at home when schools closed in March is also continuing during July and August.

With travel plans paused, size limits on gatherings and physical distancing required, many couples have had to postpone or adapt their wedding celebration plans. Allen owns Elysian Weddings and Events and she is helping couples adjust their wedding plans to the meet the current guidance for organized gatherings under Phase #4 of Renew PEI.  “We’ve been working closely with our clients in various ways to help them reduce their guest list if needed, have discussions with their guests, coordinate the venue to optimize floor space for the safety of guests and employees, and help them decide which elements of their event can be changed or eliminated.”      Allen says many couples have opted for a plated meal since buffets are out, and are focusing more on the ceremony and meal, without a dance.  “In the end, each couple will have a different definition of an amazing wedding day so we are doing our best to support each couple to make that happen and help them work through any planning struggles.”  While this year’s wedding events might not be what couples had originally hoped or planned for Allen says it’s important to keep in mind that the marriage is about the relationship, not the party.  “I’ve seen many couples who have chosen a small elopement or socially distanced wedding; the love and support from friends and family is still there. “It may feel strange to follow the guidelines under our new normal, but people understand that it’s for everyone’s health and safety.  I tell my clients, if any of your guests are not comfortable attending in the current climate, don’t take it personally. You may be able to have them celebrate with you in another way.” Allen started her business in 2016 and it has been growing it ever since. With everything looking different this year, she has been looking at new and creative ways to help her clients. She said the provincial government’s Covid-19 business supports are also allowing her to update her website to offer decor inventory online and access a larger piece of the market.  Learn more about the Phase #4 guidance for organized gatherings.  Get more information on COVID-19 supports for Island businesses.

As she travelled to the QEH by ambulance, she had no contact with anyone in the waiting room. She was in a private room. On July 11, when her symptoms worsened, she called 8-1-1 and tested positive for COVID-19. She is doing well and has been at home self-isolating since July 4.  All close contacts and all health care workers that cared for her at the QEH emergency department are being tested.

He works at the QEH emergency department and on July 4 he cared for a woman who later tested positive for COVID-19. The health care worker traveled outside the Atlantic Bubble and arrived in the province on July 2 on WestJet flight 654 from Toronto to Charlottetown. He tested negative for COVID-19 before going to work on July 4. He wore appropriate PPE and followed all hospital procedures when caring for patients.  The Chief Public Health Office, Health PEI and the Queen Elizabeth Hospital have initiated contact tracing and testing related to the health care worker. Approximately 100 patients and 125 staff that have been identified as close contacts of the health care worker and are being called to arrange for testing. Anyone who travel on WestJet flight 654 on July 2 and is experiencing symptoms related to COVID-19 should call 8-1-1 to arrange for testing.  As a further precaution, Health PEI is temporarily limiting visitors to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital until contact tracing and testing is completed and more information about the situation is known.  At this time, no visitors are being permitted to the hospital with the exception of those visiting patients in Labour and Delivery, Pediatrics or the Intensive Care units. Visitation to these units is limited to two designated people, and visitors must call ahead to the nursing unit before going to the hospital. Exceptions to the visitor restrictions may be granted for compassionate reasons, including for patients nearing the end of life.  The Queen Elizabeth Hospital has also put enhanced Personal Protective Equipment protocols in place for all staff (e.g. face shields, gloves, gowns) until all test results are received and more information about the situation is known.  Islanders and visitors to Prince Edward Island are urged to adhere to public health measures.

For many years, Mr. Simmons has been trying to win this very special harness race and to see him smiling in the winner’s circle, holding the winner’s cooler, was one of the most special and emotional sporting moments in Island history. Trained under the careful and watchful eye of Wade Sorrie and driven expertly by Brodie MacPhee, Bugsy Maguire broke free just before the three-quarter pole and sprinted to the finish line, much to the delight of all in attendance as well as the thousands tuned in online. Mr. Simmons, who turned 95 this year, has been around Island harness racing his entire life and has owned hundreds of horses. He has had hundreds of trips to the winner’s circle but has always dreamt of winning his hometown race – the Governor’s Plate. To do so in such thrilling style, upsetting a field of more favoured horses, made it extra special for Mr. Simmons. Bugsy Maguire left from post position four and went off at 13/1 odds. The sport of harness racing is part of the social fabric of Prince Edward Island and contributes greatly to our economic success. Although COVID-19 has made it difficult for our harness racing industry, a safe, fast and successful week of racing was held at Red Shores Summeriside, culminating with a terrific running of the Summerside Chrysler Dodge Governor’s Plate. Thank you to all horse owners, drivers, trainers, grooms, sponsors, organizers and fans for making the 52nd running of the Governor’s Plate unforgettable.”  Media Contact: 	Amanda Hamel 	Executive Director, Communications and Public Affairs 	Office of the Premier 	(902) 368-4400ahamel@gov.pe.ca      Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

Starting immediately, Islanders can visit Land Matters Project to provide input about land issues in PEI. This engagement is part of the Province’s review of the Lands Protection Act and Planning Act and input will be used to provide recommendations on changes to regulations and legislation. “Land protection and management has been a priority for Prince Edward Island since before Confederation,” said Bloyce Thompson, Minister of Agriculture and Land. “The upcoming review will help government identify Islanders’ concerns about our land and design ways to protect and preserve our land for future generations.”  Land ownership is currently governed by the Lands Protection Act and regulated by the Island Regulatory and Appeals Commission (IRAC). The Land Matters Project is being initiated as a response to public request, findings of past land reports, and current mandates to review the Lands Protection Act and Planning Act. “In the next few weeks, we will also establish a Land Matters Advisory Committee of Islanders who will carry out conversations with the public,” said Minister Thompson. “We are looking for individuals with expertise in all aspects of land ownership, use, and planning. We want to hear from interested parties and we want to address land policy and legislation in a way that meets the needs of every Islander. Everything is up for discussion and we want to hear from you.” Details of how to apply to the Land Matters Advisory Committee will be available soon on the Land Matters website. The site will also be updated with other information as progress unfolds. For more information, visit the Lands Protection Act, the Planning Act and the Land Matters Project.

We will add new land to Royalty Oaks natural area and, in partnership with the Department of Social Development and Housing, we will seek protection for an additional 28-acres around Wright’s Creek and close to Royalty Oaks.” - Environment, Water and Climate Change Minister Natalie Jameson  Specifically, government will follow the advice of the Natural Area Protection Act technical advisory committee and: Designate new protected areas next to the existing Royalty Oaks natural area to offset the loss of .76 acre to the 10.84-acre protected area; and, Ensure the Technical Advisory Committee works with the Department of Transportation, Infrastructure and Energy’s environmental coordinator to review and provide feedback on the environmental management plan for the project to ensure the least amount of interference possible. Government will also pursue Natural Areas Protection Act designation for a 28-acre parcel along Wright’s Creek in Hillsborough Park, close to Royalty Oaks. This will strengthen the watersheds and green spaces network in the neighbourhood and city of Charlottetown. The Department of Transportation, Infrastructure and Energy is adding a bike lane and additional right turning lane from the arterial bypass highway onto St. Peter’s Road. This improvement will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, commuter and idling time, improve air quality and public safety, and allow for free-flowing traffic; however, it requires removing the protection designation from approximately .76 acres of Royalty Oaks land.  Public consultations were held from May 9 through May 23, 2020.  During this time, 124 written submissions from the public were received. An additional 34 people participated in the public tours of the site offered by the Department of Transportation, Infrastructure and Energy.   Media Contact: 	Leanne Ritchie 	Department of Environment, Water and Climate Change 	902-314-0134lpritchie@gov.pe.ca  Backgrounder:  The Royalty Oaks protected area was established to protect a hardwood grove with historical and biological attributes within the city.  The mature stand contains large, old red oak trees.   The Natural Areas Protection Act (NAPA) is used to protect areas across the province that still contain special ecological features.  Natural areas include both public and private lands and may cover an entire property or just a specific area within a property.  As of Jan. 31, 2020, PEI’s protected and conserved area network was at 24,848 hectares or 4.38 per cent of PEI protected as Natural Areas under the Act.  About 1/4 of these lands are owned and managed by individuals and by private organizations. Sites designated as Natural Areas may include those with rare or uncommon plant species, unique geological features, special habitats or habitats that are ecologically fragile and therefore, require additional protection. When properties, or portions of properties, are proposed for designation under NAPA, management plans are prepared and the public and interested groups are asked to provide comments.  Additional designations proposed in the above plan will undergo public consultation in the coming months.

Additional public health and screening measures will be maintained as part of the travel bubble: Seasonal residents traveling from outside Atlantic Canada will need to apply for pre-approved travel and have a self-isolation plan; Islanders returning from travel outside Atlantic Canada will need to self-isolate for 14 days; and, Operation Isolation will continue to follow those self-isolating. Residents of Atlantic Canada currently self-isolating in Prince Edward Island who have not traveled outside the region in the last 14 days can discontinue their self-isolation as of Friday, July 3. Islanders and visitors should continue to practice physical distancing, washing their hands with soap and water, staying home when feeling ill, and following other public health measures. Travel bubble requirements may be different for each Atlantic province. Islanders traveling to other Atlantic provinces should inquire about the entry requirements and public health measures for the province they wish to visit before beginning their travels. When returning to Prince Edward Island, Islanders will be required to show two pieces of identification to confirm they are a permanent or seasonal resident.

Under the guidance of the Chief Public Health Office, the plan outlines protocols to support physical distancing, enhanced hygiene and the safe flow of students through the school.  “Students are telling us that the classroom is the best learning environment because they can learn together and face-to-face with their teachers, they can be with their friends and be part of their school community. Our goal is to safely return students and staff to school while being prepared to adapt to changing public health conditions at any time.” - Education and Lifelong Learning Minister Brad Trivers  The plan was developed by a provincial Fall Readiness Committee which worked closely with the Chief Public Health Office. The Public Schools Branch and Commission scolaire de langue française will work with each school on operational plans that address the needs of their school. 	The plan includes guidelines for all schools to keep students and staff safe, for example: Students will work in cohorts, or groups of the same students, as much as possible. Cohorts will distance themselves from other groups to limit exposure to other students. Classrooms will be configured to support physical distancing. Schools will work to reduce class sizes and when necessary, alternate space such as multi-purpose rooms will be used as classrooms. Lunch and recess breaks will be staggered, as well as drop-off and pick-up times. Protocols will be in place to safely move students through the school and reduce congestion in hallways and common areas. Students and staff will be required to stay home when they are unwell and there will be screening protocols for all people entering a school. Students will be educated on the importance of physical distancing and hand washing. Enhanced cleaning protocols will be followed in the school and on the school bus. To reduce the number of students on buses, parents will be asked to transport their children to and from school whenever possible and buses will be added where necessary. The plan for September is based on current evidence and recommendations of the Chief Public Health Office. While in-school learning is the preferred model, back-up plans will be in place to move to at-home learning should public health conditions change. 	Staff will return to school on September 1 and students on September 8. Orientation on new operational requirements will be held for all staff. Professional learning for teachers will focus on the revised curriculum, online teaching and learning, and student wellness. “By focusing on content that had to be omitted this spring and on key areas of the curriculum early in the school year, schools will be in a good position to minimize the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on student learning,” said Minister Trivers. “We are confident that, by working together, we can bring our students back safely and provide them with opportunities that are critical to their academic, social and emotional development.” Minister Trivers said parents and guardians will play an important role in their children’s transition to new learning environments. The Department and school leaders will seek input from parents and be in close contact with them regarding any adjustments that may be required. Additional teachers and cleaning staff will be hired to support the implementation of the plan. For more information, visit: Welcome Back to School Plan.

However, some public health and screening measures will be maintained as part of the travel bubble:  Atlantic visitors to Prince Edward Island will be required to complete a self-declaration form online and provide a copy of the completed form at points of entry to the province (form will be available before July 2);  public health and proof of residency screening will be maintained at points entry to all Atlantic Canadian provinces;    all Atlantic Canada residents, including seasonal residents, should continue to practice physical distancing, regular hand washing, stay home if feeling unwell and contact their primary care provider or call 8-1-1 to be directed to testing for COVID-19.   Islanders returning from travel outside of Atlantic Canada will still need to self-isolate for 14 days before being able to travel within the province or region.  Seasonal residents travelling from outside Atlantic Canada will still need to apply for pre-approved travel to Prince Edward Island and have a 14-day self-isolation plan. Once they have completed 14 days of self-isolation, documentation confirming the self-isolation period was completed will be provided, as requested, before they can participate in the travel bubble. “The health and safety of Islanders is our number one priority. This is another measured step forward as we learn to live with COVID-19 based on the best public health research, facts and information to date from all four Chief Public Health Officers,” added Premier King.  Atlantic Chief Public Health Officers have been working on a shared plan and protocols for strengthening public health measures should there be an increase in cases of COVID-19 within a province or the region.  For information about Prince Edward Island’s response to COVID-19, visit: Renew PEI Together.

Now is the time to chart a new path forward for our province and our people as we learn to live with COVID-19. This budget reinforces our commitment to Islanders, communities and industries. It also provides the necessary supports for our province to not only recover, but thrive in the face of adversity as we reimagine our future.” Premier Dennis King  Budget 2020-21 is an important step on the path to recovery from COVID-19.  While taking a measured response to the pandemic, with this budget government is also advancing its mandate of putting people first. We have heard from Islanders and collaborated with all parties to shape this budget. Health, education, environment and the social and economic needs of Islanders remain the core priorities in Budget 2020-21.  Many new and ongoing initiatives will also play a key role in the province’s recovery and growth efforts, including:  a Small Business Tax Reduction that will bring the province to the lowest levels in the region;  an increase to the Island Advantage Bursary that will make post-secondary education in Prince Edward Island more affordable; a School Lunch Program, offered in partnership with local providers, that will provide healthy food to more Island schoolchildren;  a Pathway to Net Zero and Sustainable Communities that will set the province on a path to full energy sustainability;  as well as the creation of:  		a Social Sector Community Partners Fund that will provide more secure core support to our key partners and advance special projects;  a Telework Adaptation Fund to incentivize smart work remotely; and,  a Climate Challenge Fund to build better solutions for Prince Edward Island.  “In working with my department and senior officials, it became evident that the budget presented today has been the most challenging to prepare in recent history,” said Minister Compton. “Our government will continue to be responsive and responsible as we create a future where Islanders excel, businesses thrive, communities are inclusive and Prince Edward Island emerges as a sustainability leader.”  For more information on planned expenditures, visit  2020-21 Operating Budget.

Islanders want to work to support themselves and their families and lobster processing plants across PEI are experiencing unprecedented labour shortages.  Hopefully Islanders and students can fill these jobs so processors can continue to supply customers with PEI’s quality lobster products.”  -  Fisheries and Communities Minister Jamie Fox.  “Every plant is short of workers and without an adequate workforce we can’t process all the lobsters being caught in PEI waters,” said executive director of the PEI Seafood Processors Association, Jerry Gavin.  “Processors are concerned that they will not be able to process enough lobsters to meet market demands as the world starts to recover from Covid-19 and re-open the economy.”  Through the Team Seafood Program, students returning to post-secondary studies in the fall of 2020 will receive a $2,000 bursary and students returning to high school will receive a $1,000 bursary. The bursary amounts were doubled over last year to encourage more students work in the seafood sector.  Minister Fox also recognized the leadership and efforts of fishers, processors and buyers who worked hard to address the many issues facing the seafood sector because of the Covid-19 crises.  They are  doing their part to protect the health and well-being of Islanders by working with the Chief Public Health Office to put guidelines and measures in place, including personal protective equipment, to protect workers and their communities from COVID-19.      “People working in seafood industries are supporting the food system and PEI’s economy; seafood harvesting and processing are essential services that are vital to the well-being of Islanders and our province,” said Minister Fox. “Our seafood community continues to be resilient in the face of a challenging situation. We will do what we can to support them.” To register to be connected through the seafood processing initiative, job seekers and seafood industry employers are encouraged to visit Opportunities in PEI Seafood.

Between 2017 and 2018, in Prince Edward Island, there was a reduction of about 25,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions according to the latest information. This is roughly the equivalent of taking 5,400 passengers vehicles off the road for one year.  “This data reflects the awareness among Islanders of the importance of tackling climate change. It shows people moving away from using oil to heat their buildings and farms,” said Minister Jameson.  “Islanders have a deep connection to their environment and as we continue with our Renew PEI, together plan we will include climate change as a consideration in recovery plans.”  In 2018, Prince Edward Island’s emissions were 1.7 million tonnes. Emissions declined 1.5 per cent compared to 2017, despite a 2.1 per cent increase in population and a 2.8 per cent increase in economic growth over 2017. PEI is only one of three provinces in Canada where emissions decreased in 2018 along with New Brunswick and Saskatchewan.  The new data is part of the federal government’s National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report, which forms part of Canada’s submission to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Data is published with a two-year delay to allow time to assemble the information.

The focus of these teams will include modernizing health care services, enhancing how our students learn, and improving frontline government services to better serve the needs of Islanders.   A number of groups and organizations will have the opportunity to partner with the Council, contributing from their own perspective and that of their respective industry. These partners will be announced in the coming weeks.    Each member of the Legislative Assembly also will be asked by the Premier to engage their constituents through a variety of interactions including meetings, round table discussions or virtual platforms for contributions to Renew PEI.

Some of the major considerations include community energy generation, getting PEI to net-zero, and making our energy grid sustainable for the next 25 years. As we work with Island communities to help them become more sustainable, we need an integrated piece of energy legislation that empowers our whole province to move towards our net-zero goals.” - Transportation, Infrastructure and Energy Minister Steven Myers  The Electric Power Act regulates rates for electric power, energy efficiency measures, and the regulation of the public utilities.  The Renewable Energy Act encourages the use of renewable energy sources to enhance the capacity and reliable of the provincial energy supply.  Government’s energy partners – Maritime Electric, Summerside Electric, and the PEI Energy Corporation – have been advised of the plans to review this legislation and government has asked for their feedback on what energy legislation should look like for PEI.  The Sustainable Communities Initiative is still accepting expressions of interest from community members. Government is looking for community champions to develop a local approach to sustainable community energy generation.  The goal is to empower innovative community-led and community-based energy generation models. Participating communities will directly benefit through energy independence, local economic development, and long-term savings on their energy bills. “Energy independence for PEI communities will require diverse, local solutions and there is no one size fits all solution,” said Minister Myers. “The current legislation has been identified as a barrier to empowering innovative community-based solutions. We need to make sure our legislative framework supports the great ideas we are hearing from these communities, and sets up Island communities for success over the long term.” Government will be accepting detailed written submissions from our energy partners and from Islanders beginning Monday, May 25 until end of business day on Monday, June 8. With COVID-19 public health restrictions in mind, virtual public consultations will also be arranged for the middle of June. Further details will be provided.  For more information on consultations on PEI’s energy legislation, visit: Energy legislation consultation.

Burning permits are required for all outdoor burning in PEI during fire season – March 15 to November 30. Islanders interested in applying for a burning permit online can visit Burning Permits.   “Islanders need to get a permit before burning materials such as fallen trees, branches, leaves and grass so they know how to burn safely, what their responsibilities are, and so we can keep local fire departments informed. Moving the application system online is more convenient for Islanders, and also allows us to support fire safety and protect Islanders as we continue to maintain public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.” Environment, Water and Climate Change Minister Natalie Jameson  A Burning Permit allows property owners to burn grasses, leaves, branches and other woody debris.

All domestic open burning must be 50 feet from structures, while recreational campfires must be 25 feet from structures.  “Uncontrolled wildfires can be destructive to homes, cottages, forests, farm buildings, crops, livestock and of course people. Most wildfires in PEI result from burning old grasses, clearing land for development or equipment sparks,” said Mike Montigny, Field Services manager with the Forests, Fish and Wildlife division. “We want to work with Islanders to ensure they know how to follow safe outdoor burning practices.” Forestry staff will review burning permit applications Monday through Friday during regular working hours. Applicants can expect a response within 48 hours. Burning permits are free to property owners living in areas where municipal fire or burning by-laws do not apply.

Licensed centres will receive the payment directly. For parents using private child care services, they will need to complete an application form. The form will be available on the government’s website beginning May 22.  The Child Care Subsidy Program is also available for families based on their income and family situation. To check eligibility, Islanders can use the child care subsidy calculator.  “As we learn to live and adjust to COVID-19, we will continue to evaluate the way child care services are delivered in our province,” said Minister of Education and Lifelong Learning Brad Trivers.  “We know we need to balance the need of Islanders returning to work with keeping our children safe and we will continue to work with our educational partners and families to achieve this. Together, we can ensure that parents have the supports they need to work and raise their families and that children have the opportunity to thrive.” Parents who have questions about available child care can contact the Department of Education and Lifelong Learning at (902) 368-6513. Parents unable to secure a space, and have no other child care options, are asked to go to www.princeedwardisland.ca/childcareservices.  Media Contact: 	Amanda Hamel 	Executive Director, Communications and Public Affairs 	Office of the Premier 	(902) 368-4400 ahamel@gov.pe.ca   Background:  License Child Care Centres 	Priority in licensed child care centres during Phase 2 will be given to parents who must leave home to work and who have no other child care options.  Parents who had children in licensed centres before the pandemic will be given priority to return to that spot.  Licensed child care operators are now reaching out to families in their centres to identify their needs. Once that is determined, they will offer any remaining spaces to parents who have requested one.  While public health guidelines restrict infants and those who are immunocompromised from returning to licensed child care centres at this time, private child care services are still available. Children who are immunocompromised may return to a centre if they have written approval from a health care practitioner.  Children with special needs will continue to be supported by the early childhood education team on a case-by-case basis. In addition, child care centres are working directly with families to support the needs of each child.  Parents not returning to work during this phase will not lose their space in centres. In addition, essential workers now using licensed child care centres will continue to have a space in a licensed centre.  Private Home-Based Centres 	More than 300 home-based centres across the province will be permitted to take up to 7 children each while practicing physical distancing based on their COVID-19 Operation Plan required by the Chief Public Health Office.       Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

As a government, we are working together with communities, organizations and groups to address the economic and social realities facing Island families every day. COVID-19 has placed unimaginable pressures on Island families and we are responding with supports and resources to assist children, parents and caregivers.  		  		We have seen so many wonderful and creative examples of how families, both related and chosen, have come together, while staying apart, to support one another and their communities through these unprecedented times.

I wish our lobster fishers and their families much success as they head out onto the waters tomorrow morning.”   - Fisheries and Communities Minister Jamie Fox  Prince Edward Island’s seafood sector is a key driver of the province’s economy and is valued at more than $600 million annually. The province has been working with industry, public health, regional counterparts and the federal government to find a way to safely hold a spring fishing season in the midst of the global pandemic while also offering relief packages to help fisheries and aquaculture operators navigate the changing market conditions and other economic challenges related to COVID-19. “Fishers never really know ahead of time how a season will go and that is particularly true this year,” said Minister Fox. “My hope is for Island fishers and aquaculturists to have a strong 2020 season, but we know that this will be a challenging year. The best way to show our support this year is by buying and enjoying Island seafood.”  The fishing industry has worked closely with the Chief Public Health Office to ensure health and safety precautions and guidelines are in place to protect fishers, their coworkers and the community from COVID-19 during the spring season.   “I know all Islanders will be rooting for fishers as they head out on their boats on setting day. This year, Islanders are asked to follow public health measures and hold off on going down to the local wharf or harbour this year. Let’s find new ways of encouraging fishers and aquaculture operators while giving them the space and peace of mind that they need to conduct their business safely,” added Minister Fox.  Media Contact: 	Ron Ryder 	Department of Fisheries and Communities 	902-314-6367 rrryder@gov.pe.ca  	       Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

Unfortunately, the global pandemic has had a profound impact on Islanders and the Island way of life.

Over the past few weeks, we have worked closely with fishery and aquaculture to chart a new path forward, supporting an industry that defines our culture and helps drive our economy. Prince Edward Island’s seafood products are second to none and, as we look ahead to the start of the spring lobster season, we will continue to work with industry to get their products to market and on tables around the world. I encourage Islanders to show their support this year by buying Island seafood. The wharfs will look much different this setting day because of COVID-19, but our support for fishers is stronger than ever. Islanders are resilient, and our fishermen and women will ensure our traditions continue even during these unprecedented times.

Driving can also be a dangerous endeavor at the best of times as motorists have to be mindful of both their actions on the road and the actions of drivers around them.  Every year, hundreds of Islanders are injured or lose their lives in motor vehicle accidents, many of which are preventable. We can all make safer choices before getting behind the wheel – drive the speed limit or consider driving slower based on weather and road conditions, refrain from driving when impaired, wear your seat belt and don’t text while driving.    Road safety happens through the efforts of many.

It is because of our collective efforts and the leadership of Dr. Morrison and her team that we are in a position to move a little more quickly, but with continued caution, to allow for greater flexibility to interact with family and friends.”  - Premier Dennis King  Beginning today:  Members of the same household may gather indoors with up to 5 other individuals from different households. Members of the same household may gather outdoors with up to 10 other individuals from different households. Maintaining physical distancing is important during any gatherings with those from outside your household.  You may extend your household unit by one or two members, who are important to supporting your household or who you feel may need closer contact and support (ex: hug, handshake, etc.) “We know that limiting our close interactions with others is our best defense against COVID-19.  But we also know that there are people who are feeling isolated or who have loved ones in need,” said Dr. Heather Morrison. “As Prince Edward Island now has no evidence of active COVID-19, we will now permit indoor and outdoor gatherings of a limited size, while maintaining physical distancing as much as possible.” Islanders are asked to consider the risks when gathering to protect their household and loved ones. This means considering postponing gatherings with those who may be of increased risk such as those who are older or immunocompromised, anyone who has traveled in the past two weeks, or anyone who is feeling sick.  It is important to note that key public health measures have not changed and that will continue to be important:  Self-isolating for 14 days if you have recently traveled out of province; practicing physical distancing of two-metres;  staying home when you are sick; washing your hands; and, covering your cough. Increased testing and enhanced screening at the points of entry will also continue. With increased interaction in the days and weeks to come, Islanders are encouraged to keep a log of the people that they’ve had contact with.  This will help the Chief Public Health Office to do contact tracing for any new cases.  For more information about Renew PEI, Together, visit www.princeedwardisland.ca/renewPEI.  Backgrounder:  The Chief Public Health Office continues to work closely with the federal government, provincial and territorial counterparts, government departments and Health PEI to continue to monitor the situation globally, nationally and locally.

This temporary wage top-up program is for Island workers employed by any business or organization, including for-profit, non-profit or other entity providing essential services, as defined by the Prince Edward Island Chief Public Health Office. The list of essential services can be found at Essential and Non-Essential Services: COVID-19. Essential workers who have been working through the pandemic and make less than $3,000 per four-week period will receive a one-time payment of $1,000 through their employers. Approximately 17,000 Islanders will benefit from this incentive. Employers can fill out the application form on behalf of their eligible employers by visiting the COVID-19 business page.  “The effects of the COVID-19 have been wide spread, placing unimaginable demands on our people, our economy and our resources. Essential workers in sectors that support our food supply chain, transportation, health care and other areas have remained unwavering in their commitment to serving Islanders during these exceptionally challenging times,” said Minister Compton. “On behalf of all Islanders, I want to thank our essential workers and the important role they are playing. It is the hard work and resiliency of our Island workforce that made and will continue to make our economy strong.” Minister of Fisheries and Communities Jamie Fox announced two new programs designed to assist fisheries and aquaculture operators who may be negatively impacted by economic conditions related to COVID-19.  The Prince Edward Island Fish Emergency Loan Program, a targeted loan portfolio offered by Finance PEI and the PEI Credit Unions, will provide loans up to $25,000 to Islander harvesters at 4 per cent interest over a five-year term. The principal will be deferred for the first 18 months. In addition, the Department of Fisheries and Communities will pay interest on behalf of the borrower for the first 18 months.  The Interest Relief Program will support fish harvesters with up to 12 months of interest relief and service debt costs on a maximum of $250 million at an average interest rate of 5 per cent. Fish harvesters that can demonstrate a 30 per cent or more decrease in fish-related revenues for the 2020 fishing season will be eligible.  “Our Island fishing and aquaculture sectors have long played an important role in strengthening our economy. They continue to show great leadership in the face of COVID-19, taking appropriate steps to ensure they can operate safely in these unprecedented times,” said Minister Fox. “While the pandemic has meant uncertainty in the marketplace, we know that the industry can rebound over time because of our province’s reputation for high quality, world-class seafood. These programs will help support our Island fishing families in the meantime.” Minister of Economic Growth, Tourism and Culture Matthew MacKay announced the COVID-19 Workspace Adaption Assistance Fund to help small businesses purchase and install protective measures such as plexiglass dividers or handwashing stations to safeguard employees and customers.  Businesses can receive up to $2,000 and the program will be retroactive to March 16th to support businesses that have already put measures in place to operate safely.  Renew PEI, Together outlines the gradual reopening of businesses, services and public spaces. The plan will be implemented in four distinct phases with a progressive lifting of public health measures on individuals, communities and organizations over three-week periods. Renew PEI, Together is a general plan for Prince Edward Island. However, organizations and businesses are not required to re-open at the initiation of the relevant phase and may choose to continue operations in a manner and timeline they are comfortable with.  Businesses open to the public must take every reasonable step to minimize interactions of individuals within 2 metres and implement enhanced cleaning and disinfection of shared areas and surfaces. The Chief Public Health Office has developed a reference guide and operational plan template to help support businesses and organizations. The template can be found through the Renew PEI, Together website. Businesses and organizations that have questions can email envhealth@ihis.org. “There is no crystal ball as to how COVID-19 will impact our economy long term, but by preparing now and putting the right measures in place, including enhanced safety measures for staff and customers, we can start to work toward recovery,” said Minister of Economic Growth, Tourism and Culture Matthew MacKay. “We know that the last few weeks have been incredibly challenging for Island businesses and we want to ensure that they can get through this as best as possible.” Additionally, Minister MacKay provided an update on the opening of all provincial golf courses, day parks and campgrounds.  All provincial day parks will open Friday, June 5, including the mountain bike trails at Brookvale. Brudenell River Golf Course and The Links at Crowbush Cove will open Friday, May 15 and Dundarave Golf Course will open Friday, May 22. All provincial campgrounds will open for the season on Friday, June 26. However, at this time, they will only be open for Islanders who booked their seasonal campsite prior to March 31, 2020.

The bursary amounts were doubled over last year to encourage more students work in agriculture.  These employment initiatives build on provincial supports announced in recent weeks in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including direct support for the potato industry as well as AgriStability and AgriInsurance programs to support agriculture producers and processors.  Minister Thompson also recognized the leadership and efforts Island producers and processors who are doing their part to protect the health and well-being Islanders by working with the Chief Public Health Office to put guidelines and measures in place, including personal protective equipment, to protect workers and the agriculture community from COVID-19.      “People working in agriculture right now are supporting the food system and PEI’s economy; agriculture is an essential service that is vital to the well-being of Islanders and our province,” said Minister Thompson. “Our agriculture community continues to be resilient in the face of a challenging situation. We will continue to do what we can to support them. I welcome the federal government’s aid package announced earlier today that will further help our farmers and processors, and look forward to working with my federal counterpart to get much needed financial support into the hands of our agriculture industry as quickly as possible.”  To register to be connected through the Agriculture Labour Support Initiative, job seekers and agricultural employers can visit www.workpei.ca/alsi.

Progression will be gradual and constantly evaluated based on the latest public health information from PEI’s Chief Public Health Office. Decisions during each phase will be based on public health evidence and continuous monitoring. If there are concerns about progressing into a next phase, progress will be slowed, halted or even reversed to continue to protect the health and safety of Islanders.  “As we move cautiously, but optimistically, forward it is important to understand that this phased approach does not mean business as usual. All services, businesses, and organizations are going to need to modify their operations in light of COVID-19,” said Dr. Heather Morrison. “It is our collective action that will contribute to the success of this plan.

These services have never been more important than they are now, as tests performed by laboratories are helping curb COVID-19. April 26 – May 2 is National Medical Laboratory Week in Canada. In PEI’s provincial medical laboratories, 159 staff including physicians and medical laboratory technologists follow highly-regulated processes and standards to ensure safe, high-quality tests that are quickly accessible to health care teams.  Most recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, laboratory services have enhanced their ability to test for coronavirus locally through both Health Canada approved and locally developed processes.  Laboratory services are located in Charlottetown, Summerside, Souris, Montague, O’Leary, and Alberton community hospitals. Services provided by provincial laboratories include Anatomical Pathology, Blood Transfusion Services, Clinical Chemistry (blood, urine, stool, and body fluid analysis); Hematology Immunology; Microbiology; Point of Care Testing, performed outside the lab but in close proximity to where a patient is receiving care; and Specimen Accessioning, which includes specimens being received, sorted, logged, labeled, and processed for analysis. More information about National Medical Lab Week will be shared throughout the week. You can learn more about lab services at Canadian Society for Medical Labratory Science.  Media contact: 	Everton McLean 	Health PEI 	902-368-6135 emclean@gov.pe.ca        Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

We will continue to work with and for the people of this province as we navigate the uncertainties we are all facing.” Finance Minister Compton welcomes the oversight the Auditor General will offer to ensure programs and services developed to address the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are delivered to meet their intended targets, and Island taxpayer dollars are spent responsibly. The Department of Finance is committed to maintaining strong lines of communication and transparency to support this important oversight work. “We remain committed to helping Islanders, especially during these challenging times. It is more important than ever that we ensure money is there so that these relief programs can continue to help,” said Finance Minister Darlene Compton. “As we look at easing public health measures and re-opening the economy, the Province will do what is needed to support our industries and, at the same time, I also encourage all Islanders to consider supporting and buying local as much as possible. We will need the help of all Islanders to get through this together.” Islanders, businesses and industries can continue to apply for support under the broad suite of provincial relief and bridge programs online at www.princeedwardisland.ca/COVID19 or by calling toll-free 1-833-533-9333. “Islanders’ creativity and hard work have built our province to be what it is today and in these hard times, government has to step up to lend them a helping hand and that’s what we are doing,” said Matthew MacKay, Minister of Economic Growth, Tourism and Culture. “We are rolling out programs quickly to reach as many Islanders as possible and we will continue to be flexible to help those who drive our economy get through this and be as equipped as possible for a strong comeback when the ease back plan can begin.” The Government of Prince Edward Island continues to work with the Government of Canada to ensure that programs being offered are representative of the needs of Islanders and that programs implemented by the province will not be clawed back by the federal government.  	The Province also announced that necessary regulatory changes have been made that will allow ferment on premise businesses to begin operating effective April 25, 2020. These changes will allow locations to brew, bottle, and deliver products to Islanders, as they continue to abide by the direction of the Chief Public Health Office in ensuring the continued safety of their clients.

It is in our very nature to want to reach out, to hold our loved ones close and be together in moment of heartache, but because of the COVID-19 pandemic it’s not possible at this time. Even though we cannot physically be together, we must call on our inner strength to find a different way in sharing our sorrow.” - Premier Dennis King   Islanders are invited to honour the victims, their families and loved ones by sharing an online message of condolence at www.princeedwardisland.ca/nscondolences.   Beginning at 8:00 p.m. this evening, and every evening until the end of April, the Prince Edward Island government administration building (Shaw Building) in Charlottetown will be lit up in blue to honour the victims and show the province’s support for Nova Scotians, the RCMP and all those grieving.  Nova Scotian music will also be heard around the government complex and an artistic metal crafted silhouette of Nova Scotia will be placed in front of the Shaw Building as a show of solidarity. The metal artwork was produced locally by Atlantic Advantage Power Technologies. Flags have been flying at half-mast across all provincial buildings since the beginning of the week. “I have seen so many examples of Islanders sharing their grief for our neighbours and for their fellow Islanders who have been touched by this tragedy. There is a long tradition of storytelling and sharing in times of grief that offer comfort and can bring our homes a little closer together as we stay apart,” added Premier King. “Anyone who wants to share a memory, a message of sympathy or a story please add them to our book of condolences.” The Government of Nova Scotia also invites condolences on Facebook at StrongerTogetherNS or by email to condolences@novascotia.ca.

Since yesterday, PEI has received 119 new negative COVID-19 test results. There have been a total of 26 positive COVID-19 cases in the province, 24 of which are now recovered.   New testing criteria and the addition of more groups to be regularly tested is now being updated. Individuals currently being tested include: anyone experiencing symptoms related to COVID-19, close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases, anyone admitted to hospital or Intensive Care Units with respiratory symptoms, residents being admitted to long term care and residents in a long term care facility who is experiencing symptoms. New testing criteria will expand to include staff members who work at more than one long term care facility. There are also discussions underway to consider testing for long haul truckers residing in PEI. Dr. Morrison reminded Islanders that to get to the point where restrictions can be safely eased back, public health measures in place now must continue. This includes self-isolation when required, staying home as much as possible, physical distancing when in public and good hand washing. She clarified that Islanders should still not visit with anyone they do not live with, even if it is in an outdoor setting.   For answers to general questions about COVID-19 call 1-833-533-9333 or visit our webpage at: www.princeedwardisland.ca/covid19.  Backgrounder:  The Chief Public Health Office continues to work closely with the federal government, provincial and territorial counterparts, government departments and Health PEI to continue to monitor the situation globally, nationally and locally.

It is important for not only our economy and food supply, but also our culture and tradition that they remain productive during the pandemic,” said Premier Dennis King. “As our province deals with the consequences of COVID-19, government is committed to working with partners to ensure our primary industries can remain strong and resilient.” In order to support the potato industry of Prince Edward Island, the Province of Prince Edward Island is working with producers and processors to provide $4.7 million towards shipping and storage costs of potatoes for processing. This investment will help mitigate a potato surplus resulting from market conditions related to COVID-19.  Additionally, through the Department of Agriculture and Land’s Business Risk Management (BRM) Programs, the province will help farmers manage risks that threaten the viability of their farm operations. Minister of Agriculture and Land Bloyce Thompson announced up to $8.8 million in support for farmers through the BRM programs for the next two years.  The AgriStability Program package includes paying the provincial portion of the costs to increase the coverage level for producers enrolled in the program from 70 per cent to 85 per cent, and removing the reference margin limit which will have a positive impact on the livestock industry. In addition, the province is offering interim payments of up to 75 per cent to get funding into producer’s hands in a timely manner.  When combined, this will provide an estimated $5.6 million in support for farmers over two years.  The AgriInsurance Program will offer a 10 per cent discount on the producer’s share of insurance premiums, saving farmers an estimated $3.2 million over two years.  These programs are made available through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership, a $3 billion, five-year investment by federal, provincial and territorial governments to strengthen the agriculture, agri-food and agri-based products sector.  “The current global situation is creating uncertainty for our farm community and immediate support is necessary for the sustainability of our agriculture industry and the long-term strength of our food supply system,” said Minster Thompson. “By supporting the industry, and our farm families and workers, our province can retain economic strength and prepare for a return to full economic activity.” Minister Thompson also encouraged farmers, farm families and farm workers who need them to access the mental health supports available through www.FarmersTalk.ca. Minister of Fisheries and Communities Jamie Fox thanked the federal department of Fisheries and Oceans, the Prince Edward Island Fisherman’s Association, and Chief Public Health Office for their partnership to open the spring lobster fishery on May 15.  “While not the opening date that ever fisher wanted, it is encouraging to see that we will have a spring lobster season as many Islanders rely on jobs on the boats and in the processing plants,” said Minister Fox.  “The industry has shown great leadership in this difficult and unprecedented time and are taking health and safety precautions seriously, working with the province and Chief Public Health Office to put guidelines in place to protect themselves, their coworkers and the community from this illness. Islanders look forward to their first feed of lobster as we ease back into a new normal for our province.” Additionally, Minister Fox thanked municipal governments for the precautions they have put in place to protect their communities and reminded them that the province’s Rural Growth Initiative is available to help small communities and rural organizations. He also reminded employers of opportunities to apply for wage supports through various programs being offered through the Employment Development Agency and Skills PEI.  For more information on the provincial government’s response to COVID-19, including resources, program applications and important public health information, visit: www.princeedwardisland.ca/COVID19.  Media contact: 	Amanda Hamel 	Executive Director, Communications and Public Affairs 	Office of the Premier 	(902) 368-4400 ahamel@gov.pe.ca      Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

PEI’s rate of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people is 19. All cases in have been related to travel outside the province.  Dr. Morrison reminded Islanders that all travel into the province must be essential. All essential workers travelling to the province must self-isolate when not working. Compassionate visits are being looked at on a case by case basis.  Health PEI’s Chief of Nursing, Marion Dowling, says work is now underway to coordinate a gradual reintroduction of health services. Individual services will each undergo a public health risk assessment.  Dowling reminded Islanders that anyone in PEI who is experiencing symptoms related to COVID-19 should call their physician, nurse practitioner or call 811. For those experiencing non-Covid-19 related health issues, urgent or emergent care as well as other essential services, is still available.  For answers to general questions about COVID-19 call 1-833-533-9333 or visit our webpage at: www.princeedwardisland.ca/covid19.  Backgrounder:  The Chief Public Health Office continues to work closely with the federal government, provincial and territorial counterparts, government departments and Health PEI to continue to monitor the situation globally, nationally and locally.

306,2020-04-22,Canada,Prince Edward Island,,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/supporting-mental-health-islanders,Government Website,Supporting the mental health of Islanders,"   By working together, the Province of Prince Edward Island, Health PEI and community are supporting the mental health and addictions needs of Islanders during the COVID-19 pandemic.   “Not only is it important that we find real solutions to continue to address the mental health and addictions needs of Islanders, we also have to look at ways to support all Islanders as we navigate an uncertain, difficult and stressful time for our communities. The programs and services that Islanders rely on are still available. They may look a little different as we have minimized physical contact, but we have not minimized care.” - Premier Dennis King  Today, the Province added a mental health and addictions information service via the COVID-19 Response Line. Any Islander can access this service by calling toll-free 1-833-533-9333. Calls will be answered by trained mental health and addictions staff from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday to Friday. “We recognize that many Islanders are feeling stressed or anxious because of COVID-19. Islanders living with mental illness or struggling with addiction may be feeling particularly vulnerable because of the need for public health measure such as isolation and physical distancing. I want all Islanders to know that you are not alone, we are here for you and help is available,” said Health and Wellness Minister James Aylward.   Mental health and addictions services through Health PEI continue to be offered while following the recommendations of the Chief Public Health Officer for physical distancing and as the health care system prepares for the potential demand for emergency care. ""It is critical that we support the efforts of Dr. Heather Morrison. This means we are working to provide mental health and psychiatry supports to patients in their own homes as much as possible,” said Dr. Heather Keizer, Chief of Mental Health and Addictions with Health PEI. “We are also working hard to keep admissions to hospital to a minimum by intervening early. We want Islanders to know we are available and able to provide support and connections by telephone and video even when we must be separate physically."" In order to take pressure off the of the QEH and PCH Emergency Departments, Psychiatric Urgent Care Clinics have been established at Hillsborough Hospital in Charlottetown and at the Prince County Hospital in Summerside, where patients with serious psychiatric issues, potentially in need of admission, can be seen and assessed by multiple disciplinary teams and by a telehealth psychiatrist, as necessary. The Charlottetown Psychiatric Urgent Care Clinic is open from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. at Hillsborough Hospital seven days a week. The Summerside Psychiatry Urgent Care Clinic is opening this week.  Community Mental Health and Addictions continues to provide assessment, counselling, and programming, but is moving to delivering these services by telephone. One-on-one counselling can be provided by phone call and group programming will be offered by conference call. Call-in clinics for both mental health services and addictions programming have been developed in communities across the province to replace walk-in clinics. No appointment or referral is required and Islanders in need are able to speak to registered health care workers specialized in mental health and addictions who can offer support and, if needed, refer callers to other services for additional help.  The Strongest Families program for children and youth seeking help for mental health and other issues impacting health and well-being as well as the ICAN Adult Anxiety Program also continue. These and other e-mental supports can be found at www.bridgethegapp.ca/adult/online-programs. As a COVID response, the Transitional Unit for those recovering from addiction, which had been operating at the Provincial Addictions Treatment Facility, has temporarily moved to Queen Charlotte Junior High and is operating as a day program.   Health PEI is also working in partnership with community organizations such as Family Services PEI to provide online sessions for those dealing with increased anxiety due to COVID-19. Additional community supports are available through organizations such as the Canadian Mental Health Association, PEI Family Violence Prevention Services and Family Services PEI.  In addition, the Province will be providing Lennon Recovery House Association Inc. (Lennon House) with $365,000 in funding to help with start-up costs and initial capacity of seven beds. Using a holistic approach to recovery through peer-support workers who have experienced addictions themselves, Lennon House will be well-positioned to help support Islanders suffering from addiction and concurring mental health challenges with long-term transitional housing.

307,2020-04-21,Canada,Prince Edward Island,,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/province-planning-easing-public-health-measures,Government Website,Province planning for easing of public health measures ,"                 Premier Dennis King and Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Heather Morrison say a phased-in approach to easing back on public health measures in Prince Edward Island could begin as early as May 1. The approach, called “Re-opening PEI, together”, will focus on public health and safety and requires Islanders to act smartly, cautiously and methodically. The framework for how and when public health measures could be lifted is being developed, ensuring there is time to conduct risk assessments as testing and surveillance continue.   “Today, we are able to talk about moving toward re-opening our province because Islanders have taken their responsibility seriously, following the public health directions laid out by Dr. Morrison. Prince Edward Island is in a strong, and rather unique, position as we have done very well in containing COVID-19. We are not done yet. We will need to Islanders to continue to be patient, understanding and be part of the process as we cautiously take steps towards easing public health measures. We need to keep Islanders safe, and we need to do it together.” - Premier Dennnis King  Public health officials are looking at initially easing public measures related to some outdoor activities and non-urgent health care services such as elective surgeries. Before this can happen, several factors will be taken into consideration, including:   whether there has been community transmission; whether there have been any outbreaks; and, supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), especially at long-term care homes.  “Each of us has a role to play, and it is extremely important that Islanders continue to follow public health measures if we want to gradually lift some of the restrictions currently in place,” said Dr. Morrison. “This phased-in approach to easing public health measures will be dynamic, and will be reviewed and adjusted frequently in order to keep Islanders safe and contain the spread of COVID-19 in our province. It is important that we continue to maintain strong screening measures at points of entry into our province and test anyone experiencing symptoms related to the virus throughout this process in an effort to protect our most vulnerable Islanders.”  More details on the phased-in approach to easing public health measures will be shared with Islanders in the days and weeks ahead.  For more information about COVID-19, call 1-833-533-9333 or visit our webpage at www.princeedwardisland.ca/COVID19.  Backgrounder:  The Chief Public Health Office continues to work closely with the federal government, provincial and territorial counterparts, government departments and Health PEI to continue to monitor the situation globally, nationally and locally.

Premier Dennis King extended the state of public health emergency initially declared under the Public Health Act on March 16 for an additional 30 days to ensure Prince Edward Island’s Chief Public Health Officer continues to have the necessary authority to lead the province’s ongoing public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.   “From the beginning, I have said we will take our direction in navigating this unprecedented situation from Dr. Morrison. She has been steadfast in doing what is right to keep Islanders safe and we must continue to follow her lead. We have been clear in our commitment to supporting her efforts, as she needs us to do right now, and we will not hesitate to make difficult decisions quickly to help our province get through this pandemic. Together, we can and we will persevere through this.” - Premier Dennis King  To further support the provincial public health response to the global pandemic, and following discussions with Dr. Morrison, Justice and Public Safety Minister Bloyce Thompson today confirmed that a state of emergency is being declared across the province until the end of the month under the Emergency Measures Act. This additional state of emergency complements the existing authority set out in the public health order and enables a more efficient deployment of resources that will assist the Chief Public Health Officer’s guidance to protect Islanders, particularly through enhanced controls and screening at points of entry. The Emergency Measures Organization, under the direction of the Minister of Justice and Public Safety, will support the Chief Public Health Office in controlling access at various points of entry to the province, along with any other access points to the province and, where applicable, direct individuals to leave Prince Edward Island. This includes, but is not limited to, the Confederation Bridge, the Charlottetown airport, ferry terminals at Wood Islands and Souris, as well as any port, harbour, wharf, launching, beach, and any part of the provincial shoreline.  “Dr. Morrison has been a strong leader for all Islanders through this pandemic,” said Minister Thompson. “Putting this order through today, and further engaging the Emergency Measures Organization and law enforcement, will give her more tools at her disposal to do what is needed to protect the health and safety of Islanders. Let’s continue doing what she asks of us every day so that we can come out of this on top.” During the period of the state of emergency, individuals travelling to Prince Edward Island will be required to disclose the purpose of their travel to determine if it is deemed essential or not as per the direction of the Chief Public Health Office to the Emergency Measures Organization by email publicsafety@gov.pe.ca or by phone 902-894-0385.

In total, up to $66 million in support will be provided to meet the immediate needs of the tourism industry.   “This time of year is typically a busy one for our tourism operators as they would be preparing to showcase our Island’s culture and hospitality to millions of travelers but this year is anything but normal as we deal with the world-wide economic downturn due to COVID-19. Our government has been working with our tourism industry to address the immediate needs, develop short-term strategies to adapt and determine long-term plans to ensure Prince Edward Island’s reputation as a top tourist destination can be maintained going forward.” - Premier Dennis King  Minister of Economic Growth, Tourism and Culture Matthew Mackay announced a new $50 million tourism assistance loan facility through Finance PEI, with maximum financing of up to $1 million at 4 per cent interest available for working capital. Both the principal payments on the loan, as well as interest, will be deferred for the first 18 months.  Additionally, Minister MacKay announced that the province will provide interest relief on existing loans to tourism business for up to 18 months.  	Recognizing the need to support the tourism industry’s quick recovery, Minister MacKay announced $1 million towards expanded marketing. As well, the province is waiving the licensing, inspection and Tourism PEI advertising fees for the 2020 operating season.  Non-profit organizations that have received funding from Tourism PEI and/or the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA) for events that have been canceled as a result of COVID-19 will be fully compensated for all eligible expenses.  The Province of Prince Edward Island continues to work with its federal counterparts to initiate new programs and expand existing programs to support seasonal workers, including those in the tourism industry.  “Our tourism sector has been hard hit due to COVID-19 and is facing many challenges as our country and the world implements measures to protect the health and safety of citizens,” said Minister MacKay. “There is not a simple solution or a crystal ball to figure out when we will get back to normal or what our new normal will look like but tourism operators should know that the provincial government is here for you and that we will work with you to make sure you can continue to operate and contribute to what makes Prince Edward Island so special.” Minister of Agriculture and Land Bloyce Thompson announced the expansion of the successful Island Producers Helping Producers initiative to support rural Islanders in need. The initiative is a partnership of the Province of Prince Edward Island, Amalgamated Dairies Limited (ADL) and the PEI Potato Board.  Drive-thru pick up will be set up at the following locations this Saturday from 10 a.m. until 1 p.m. or while supplies last:    Westisle Composite High School (39570 Western Road, Elmsdale)   Bluefield High School (924 Colville Road, North Wiltshire)   Rodd Brudenell River Resort (86 Dewars Lane, Cardigan)   To support physical distancing, Islanders are asked to remain in their vehicles while volunteers place the care package in the trunk.  	The Province is reaching out to community groups that support vulnerable Islanders who may not have transportation and will work with them to set aside packages for those in need, when possible.  “As Islanders, we are generous and caring by nature and our Island producers take pride in their ability to help feed Island families,” said Minister Thompson. “During this difficult and uncertain time, it has been no different and Islanders continue to offer their help to friends, neighbours and our communities. By working together, supporting each other, and following the lead of the Chief Public Health Officer, we will get through this crisis and come out stronger because of it.” The Island Producers Helping Islanders initiative is intended to help Islanders and families in need; however, it is open to everyone. Islanders interested in making a donation in light of the free care package may do so online to a local charity of their choice.  Minister Thompson reminded Islanders that at any time, littering and dumping is illegal. While Island Waste Management Corporation sites continue to be closed to the public, regularly scheduled garbage pick-up continues. Islanders are able to include two additional bags with their carts, as always, and blue bag collection is still on schedule.  The Province also announced that in consultation with the Fire Marshal’s Office, all outdoor burning is prohibited on Prince Edward Island effective immediately. This includes recreational campfires unless the fire is contained in a fire pit with spark arrester screen or has a chimney with spark arrester.  The ban is in place to keep volunteer and government fire fighters safe as they are essential workers and almost all wildland fires on Prince Edward Island are the result of fires that have escaped from a controlled burn.  Existing 2020 burning permits issued by the Department of Environment, Water and Climate Change and the Fire Marshal’s Office are also suspended until further notice and no new permits will be issued.  For more information on the provincial government’s response to COVID-19, including resources, program applications and important public health information, visit: www.princeedwardisland.ca/COVID19.   Media contact: 	Amanda Hamel 	Executive Director, Communications and Public Affairs 	Office of the Premier 	(902) 368-4400 ahamel@gov.pe.ca Backgrounder Additional supports for tourism operators previously announced:  Private sector wage subsidies through the Jobs for Youth and Post-Secondary Employment Program have been increased from 50 per cent to 75 per cent.  Business Adaptation Advice Program covers the cost for businesses and entrepreneurs to hire a professional to provide advice and support on how to adapt or recover from the impacts of the pandemic.

Whether they anticipated working over the summer to help pay the cost of their tuition and expenses or they were ready to embark on their first career after graduating, we have put supports in place to help. Every Islander is dealing with the unique challenges of COVID-19 and we need to be there to support those individual needs so that we can all get through this together.” - Premier Dennis King  The Province of Prince Edward Island has been working with the federal government and students’ unions to understand the economic challenges Island students are facing and fill potential gaps in funding currently available so that the immediate and long-term needs of students are met.

Projections by June 1, 2020:  Total hospital stays are estimated to be 120 with strong controls in place, and 14,000 with mild controls in place. Acute care bed needs are estimated to be 15 with strong controls in place, and 3,250 with mild controls in place. Critical care bed needs are estimated to be 4 with strong controls in place, and 840 with mild control measures in place. Total fatalities are estimated to be 9 with strong controls in place, and 900 with mild controls in place.  Dr. Morrison said next steps in modelling are to assess scenarios for modifying public health measures and testing strategies, to control the epidemic without overwhelming our health system. Premier Dennis King said the numbers demonstrate just how serious this pandemic is and why Islanders have been working so hard together to mitigate and contain the spread of COVID-19. Islanders should continue to adhere to public health advice, as we look toward the time when an ease back plan can be implemented. Premier King recognized that although the health needs of Islanders come first, there are other needs to be considered, such as social economic, community and education. “I am proud of the measures we have put in place and the cooperation we have had from Islanders,” said Premier King. “We have been successful to date because we are taking the Island approach of being in this together and we need to continue that approach in the name of reducing illness and saving lives in our province.” For answers to general questions about COVID-19 call 1-833-533-9333 or www.princeedwardisland.ca/covid19.

It includes trout, Atlantic salmon, smelt, striped bass, mackerel, flounder, perch, scallop, softshell clam, bar clam, razor clam and mussels.

321,2020-04-08,Canada,Prince Edward Island,,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/province-highlights-supports-and-awareness-family-violence-prevention,Government Website,Province highlights supports and awareness for family violence prevention,"                 Today, the Province of Prince Edward Island highlighted expanded partnerships and efforts to support safe and healthy families during COVID-19. A Special Cabinet Committee on Family Violence Prevention has been established to ensure parents, children, and individuals at risk of family violence have the proper resources available during this difficult and uncertain time. The committee consists of ministers and staff of the departments of Justice and Public Safety, Social Development and Housing and the Interministerial Women’s Secretariat. Minister of Justice and Public Safety Bloyce Thompson chairs the committee. “There is no doubt that the measures that governments and community are taking to protect the health and safety of Islanders are necessary during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Minister Thompson. “However, the threat of violence remains present in our communities and anyone facing those situations needs to know that we are still here to help. If anyone needs support, reach out.  Now, more than ever, is a time to come together and to look out for our Island family.” Minister Thompson stated that COVID-19 specific resources for individuals and families have been developed to address topics such as co-parenting,  how to support and answer questions from children and youth, and taking care of your mental health.  To help provide parents with techniques and strategies for handling parenting challenges, Minister of Social Development and Housing Ernie Hudson announced that the province has purchased 150 additional licenses for the Positive Parenting Program so more Islanders can access the program free of charge online. The Positive Parenting Program, commonly known as Triple P, is one of the most effective, evidenced-based parenting programs in the world. The program is available in English and French and each online session ranges from 30-60 minutes.  This week, Triple P launched a COVID-19 specific session for parents. Island parents interested in the program should visit www.triplep-parenting.ca/can-en/find-help/triple-p-parenting-in-prince-edward-island. Minister Hudson urged parents who need additional support to reach out to Child and Family Services. The primary goal of Child and Family Services is keeping children secure by offering support to parent and caregivers so that they can provide children with a safe, caring, healthy home.  “Staying apart doesn’t mean going it alone,” said Minister Hudson. “As Islanders, we are here to support one another; to lift up our neighbours and friends and ensure that no person feels unsafe, unvalued or unwanted. It is so very important that those who are in difficult situations know that they are not alone, that there is support available and that there are people who care about them and their well-being.” Minister responsible for the Status of Women Natalie Jameson reminded Islanders experiencing domestic abuse or violence who need to flee their homes that support is available and thanked individuals who continue to provide essential services to keep families safe during this difficult time.  “While people need to stay at home as much as possible, we know that not every home is safe,” said Minister Jameson. “Sometimes women need to leave to protect themselves and their children. It is important to know that during these times that help is available. There are still services for people who are experiencing violence. You are not alone and you will not be alone.”  For information, resources and community support available for family violence prevention, visit www.princeedwardisland.ca/familyviolenceprevention.   If you are in immediate danger, contact 9-1-1. If you suspect a child is being abused or neglected by a parent or guardian, by law you need to report it. Call Child Protection Services at 1-877-341-3101 or after hours 1-800-341-6868.

I could not be more proud to be part of this community, coming together the Island way as that is how we will get through this.”  Drive-thru pick up will be set up at the following locations this Saturday from 10am until 3pm or while supplies last:   Summerside: Credit Union Place parking lot Charlottetown: PEI Government Complex parking lot (on Terry Fox Drive)  To support physical distancing, Islanders are asked to remain in their vehicles while volunteers place the care package in the trunk.  ""ADL is proud to partner with the provincial government and the PEI Potato Board to provide quality PEI dairy products to Islanders that need them the most through this pandemic,” said Jamie MacPhail, ADL Corporate Secretary and Communications Lead. ""By working together and supporting each other Islanders will get through this crisis together and be stronger because of it."" “We are happy to be participating in this special initiative to help fellow Islanders,” said Pownal potato farmer and PEI Potato Board Chairman Jason Hayden. “Potatoes are a nutritious, versatile food that provide great year-round value, while also being a comfort food.  We know many Islanders are making sacrifices to help protect each other and get through the COVID-19 situation as safely and as quickly as possible, and these care packages are a small token of our appreciation this Easter weekend.”   This one-time initiative is intended to help Islanders and families in need; however, it is open to everyone. Islanders interested in making a donation in light of the free care package may do so online to a local charity of their choice.  For more information on the provincial government’s response to COVID-19, including resources, program applications and important public health information, visit: www.princeedwardisland.ca/COVID19.  Media Contact:  	Amanda Hamel 	Executive Director, Communications and Public Affairs 	Office of the Premier 	(902) 368-4400 ahamel@gov.pe.ca       Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

As a province, we are operating under the hope that there will be a spring fishing season. We know that there are many questions about the fishing sector and Islanders are seeking clarity and equity in the federal decision-making process. The final decision must and will must come from the federal government, and we are asking them to show determination on this file, to address our concerns and to find a way for the region to get through this.” -  Premier Dennis King  The Province of Prince Edward Island is working with its regional and federal counterparts, as well as the fisheries, aquaculture, and processing sectors, to address industry concerns and develop supports and programs for all sectors.  Watch the April 7, 2020 update in YouTube “We have been and will continue to call on the federal government to give us an indication of what the future holds so that our industry can be as prepared as possible,” said Minister Fox. “Whatever our path forward looks like, first and foremost, it needs to ensure the safety of Islanders. The Province of Prince Edward Island will do everything we can to support industry once a decision is made.” Minister Fox also announced that the province is extending the deadline for Jobs for Youth to April 30 to allow employers ample time to apply for wage subsidies from this program. Employers can apply by visiting princeedwardisland.ca/jobsforyouth. Approved businesses will be posted to the province’s website and young people will apply directly to the jobs that interest them. The Jobs for Youth Program normally supports 400 students annually. Minister Fox reiterated the province’s commitment to helping Islanders return to work and to help businesses and organizations hire the staff they need and that it will continue to review its programs to ensure that they best serve Islanders when the province moves into a period of recovery.  Minister of Education and Lifelong Learning Brad Trivers provided an update on initiatives through his department to support children, youth, teachers and essential workers during COVID-19 that include emergency child care services, at home learning, and the school food program which all began last week.  “During these unimaginable times, we are reminded of the very important role of our health care professionals, essential service workers and our educators,” said Minister Trivers. “Our schools are at the heart of our communities and they are reaching out to support our children and families in ways that we’ve never experienced before. We also recognize the enormous efforts of other organizations who are providing support and resources to Island children and families.”  Teachers are working closely with staff in the Department of Education and Lifelong Learning, the Public Schools Branch and Commission scolaire de langue française to provide the best home learning supports for Prince Edward Island’s 20,000 students. Home learning materials for students in kindergarten through grade 12 are available online and printed learning materials will be safely delivered to families who have limited or no access to technology or the internet.  Minister Trivers also provided an update on the School Food Team initiative that, in partnership with the Department of Social Development and Housing, PEI Home and School Federation and Breakfast Club of Canada, is now providing nearly 3,000 healthy meals and snacks to Island students across the province this week.

However, wearing a mask in public where social and physical distancing could be difficult may be appropriate to ensure the safety of the people and workers around you, for example public transit.   Health PEI’s Chief Nursing Officer, Marion Dowling, says plans for a virtual care platform to be used by physicians, nurse practitioners, and mental health and addictions will launch this week. This will allow health care providers to offer services, over a secure video platform, to improve access for patients while reducing the need for in-person visits.  Cough and fever clinics and drive thru testing clinics continue to run seven days a week in both Charlottetown and Summerside. This weekend, 148 patients were seen in Charlottetown and 63 patients in Summerside. Appointments to the cough and fever clinics are by referral from family physicians, nurse practitioners or 811.

The Office of the Attorney General filed a notice of application to the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island on March 26, 2020 seeking to suspend the enforcement of eviction orders to protect the health and safety of both Island tenants and sheriffs who are responsible for the enforcement of eviction orders.  On April 1, 2020, the Supreme Court of PEI held a hearing and a decision was made to support this application to suspend enforcement of eviction orders until the courts can resume regular operations. Anyone seeking an order for an eviction must follow the procedures of the Director or the Island Regulatory and Appeals Commission. On March 30, 2020, the Commission advised the public that the Rental Office will not hold hearings for non-payment of rent. It will only hold hearings for urgent matters, such as serious threats to the health and safety of tenants and landlords. “The COVID-19 pandemic has touched the lives of Islanders, Canadians and everyone around the world. During these difficult times, we know that it is filled with many challenges,” said Bloyce Thompson, Minister of Justice and Public Safety and Attorney General of Prince Edward Island. “With so much unknowns, government was looking for a temporary solution that would address the housing concerns of many Islanders.” “We appreciate the Court’s decision today. We recognize that this is not a complete solution but it is one of the many measures we are considering as part of our provincial response. As the situation continues to evolve, government will continue to adapt,” added Minister Thompson. “These decisions are not made lightly and it continues to be a delicate balance between, at times, conflicting interests.” Islanders looking for the latest information on the provincial response to the COVID-19 pandemic can visit www.princeedwardisland.ca/covid19    Media contact: 	Amanda Hamel 	Executive Director, Communications and Public Affairs 	Office of the Premier 	(902) 368-4400ahamel@gov.pe.ca 	       Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

At this time, anyone receiving written warnings or fines for violating the Public Health Order is due to failure to self-isolate following travel.  There have been 870 tests for COVID-19 completed in Prince Edward Island, 665 have been confirmed as negative and three are considered recovered. 48% of the cases have been female, and 52% male. Most common symptoms include: cough, chills and headache.  Dr. Morrison clarified that new construction permits are not being issued at this time. If a construction site is currently operating and work can safely be paused, it should be paused. Emergency construction repair services will continue.  If Islanders are self-isolating, they are not permitted to visit banks. Individuals are encouraged to use online or telephone banking options, or delay their visit. Anyone visiting banks should be doing so for essential transactions only.  Dr. Morrison thanked all essential workers who are working through these uncertain times.  Marion Dowling, Health PEI’s Chief Nursing Officer, announced that Mental Health & Addictions are redirecting patients who may require an acute mental health admission away from the emergency rooms to psychiatric urgent care clinics. Today, the first clinic opened at the Hillsborough Hospital. Those individuals who require emergency medical stabilization will still be seen at the emergency departments as usual.

This fund provides a one-time, taxable payment of $750.  “We have been working diligently, alongside the federal government, to deliver immediate supports to Islanders who have seen their incomes impacted by COVID-19. We are pleased our federal partners have been responsive, have heard our concerns for Islanders who may fall through the cracks, and that they are working with us to deliver supports that meet the specific needs of our communities. We recognize that these programs can take time to roll out and that is why our government continues to look at ways we can quickly support Islanders immediately.” - Premier Dennis King  Islanders who, as of March 13, 2020, have lost their job or have been laid off, have had their Employment Insurance benefits expire and do not yet have a job to return to, or are self-employed and have lost all revenues through self-employment may be eligible.   To qualify, Islanders must: be 18 years of age or older; be a resident of Prince Edward Island as of December 31, 2019; have earned a minimum of $5,000 gross earnings in the last 12 months;  lost their primary source of income because of COVID-19 and have no other income; and  have applied for federal benefits (e.g. Employment Insurance or the Canada Emergency Response Benefit). “Our government continues to listen and work alongside our business community, our workers, and our community leaders to ensure that no Islander is left behind because of the impacts of this pandemic,” said Minister of Economic Growth, Tourism and Culture Matthew MacKay. “Our efforts will continue to put Islanders first and foremost so that we can weather this storm as best as possible.” More information about the COVID-19 Income Support Program is available at www.princeedwardisland.ca/covidforbusiness. The provincial government also announced additional screening and enforcement measures at the Confederation Bridge for travelers arriving in Prince Edward Island. Starting this evening, everyone coming across the bridge will be stopped to determine if their travel to Prince Edward Island is considered essential based on guidelines set out by the Chief Public Health Officer earlier in the week. Non-Islanders traveling unnecessarily to the province for personal reasons will be asked to turn around.  “During a time when we are doing everything we can to flatten the curve and contain the spread of COVID-19 here at home, any unnecessary travel to our province is a concern that we all share,” said Transportation, Infrastructure and Energy Minister Steven Myers. “Islanders should take comfort in knowing that, with the expert guidance of Dr. Morrison and her team, our government is taking action and putting measures in place with the sole intention of keeping Islanders safe as their health and well-being is our primary concern throughout all of this.” Individuals will be screened through if they are:  essential workers commuting for work;  essential workers in the trade and transportation sectors who are moving goods and people across borders (such as truck drivers);  Islanders returning from out-of-province travel, medical appointments or students returning home; and,  Individuals coming on compassionate grounds.  Government confirmed that the liquor store in O’Leary is now providing limited access to address the needs of Islanders at risk of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The liquor store in Souris will be providing limited access starting tomorrow under the same conditions. Both stores will operate on the same limited as the other stores: 11am to 6pm, Monday through Saturday.

Over the past few weeks, the Department of Education and Lifelong Learning has been working with the Public Schools Branch, Commission scolaire de langue française and teachers from across the province to develop at-home learning activities.  “This is a new situation that Islanders have not faced and we are trying to adapt quickly and work together so that all Islanders, but in particular children, have the supports they need to be healthy and safe. We are working to strike the right balance to ensure Island students are supported and that families are not overwhelmed. We will continue to work side by side to create solutions that support our families.” - Premier Dennis King  Starting April 6, teachers will be taking the lead on home learning activities for their students. A variety of online and printed home learning materials will be provided so that regardless of access to the internet, families and students can still practice skills and continue learning. Minister of Education and Lifelong Learning Brad Trivers also announced that as a result of prioritizing the home learning program, a decision was made to cancel all provincial assessments for this year including the DELF French language skills assessment and the Early Years Evaluations which assess readiness for kindergarten.

The recently established Premier’s Economic Recovery Council, a strategic business working group made up of individuals from across business sectors, will leverage the experience, knowledge and ingenuity of the business community to advise the Premier on the issues being faced by the business community and opportunities as the province looks down the road to economic recovery.  “We want to work closely with businesses – those who drive our economy and have been responsible for our recent economic strength as a province – so that we are doing everything we can to minimize the economic impacts of COVID-19 on our province and looking to the future when we can set a course for recovery and return to normal,” said Premier King.   The initial Council held its first virtual meeting on Saturday and will continue to meet as required through the duration of the pandemic. The Council will consult broadly with other businesses and across all business networks as part of the “all-hands-on-deck” model.  As part of government’s efforts to support this initiative, the Premier also launched PEI Sourced Solutions, an online portal to help Island residents and businesses meet the challenges of the pandemic, including the need for medical supplies, virtual care services, or to share ideas on how the province can help businesses and industries weather the impacts of COVID-19.  “Islanders are innovative and resourceful, and we continue to see them stepping up to support each other during this unimaginable time. The new online portal will help connect provincial efforts and community supports so that we are ready and able to respond to the continued needs of our province going forward. It’s by working together that we will get through this,” added Premier King.  PEI Sourced Solutions identifies the province’s potential supply challenges and important services required to support communities. Through the portal, Islanders – individuals and businesses – will be able to identify opportunities for government to procure required goods and services, as well as share creative solutions on how to direct resources and explore new ways of doing business to support COVID-19 specifc needs. The province will review all submissions and work with individuals and businesses to provide solutions.  Islanders can access the online portal at www.princeedwardisland.ca/sourcedsolutions starting March 31 at 8 a.m. For general information and questions relate to COVID-19, please call toll-free 1-833-533-9333 or visit www.princeedwardisland.ca/COVID19.

Contact tracing is now underway.  Dr. Morrison is reminding Islanders that social distancing means physical distancing. Physical distancing means staying home as much as possible. If you need to go out for essential items, you should stay at least six feet away from others. Physical distancing does not mean visiting family and friends, having people over to your home, meeting up in groups outdoors, grocery shopping in groups, or playdates with children. If you do not live with someone, you should not be visiting with them.  Dr. Morrison reiterated that she does expect the situation on PEI to get worse.  Similar to what is being seen across the country, PEI will likely experience community transmission. She reminded Islanders that this is why practicing physical distancing, along with self-isolation upon return from travel, is so crucial in our efforts in slowing the spread of the virus here in PEI.  Screening measures have now been strengthened at the Confederation Bridge and the Charlottetown Airport. Additional information is being gathered from travelers, including where they are travelling from, where they are going, and if they have a support system to deliver supplies to them while they are in self-isolation.  The Chief Public Health Office has received 56 complaints of those failing to self-isolate upon return from travel outside the province. 26 of these resulted in a visit from an officer, 12 resulted in verbal warnings to self-isolate and nine resulted in a written warning for violating the Public Health Order.  	Those issued written warnings have been advised any further failure to comply will result in charges. A number of the 56 complaints received have more than one complaint against an individual.  Islanders experiencing symptoms (cough, fever, or shortness of breath) within 14 days after travelling outside the province should call 8-1-1 to be screened and, if necessary, directed for testing.

The online resource community services and supports available in each of the 27 electoral districts. The directory will continue to grow and any organization wishing to add their services should contact their local MLA. “It is important that we look after one another in times like this while keeping ourselves safe,” said Minister Hudson. “This directory will be an effective tool to connect those wishing to help with those members of our community who are in need. We will draw on our strong community ties and rely on one another to ensure the well-being and inclusion of Islanders, particular those that are most vulnerable.” Minister Hudson also confirmed that the Community Outreach Centre in Charlottetown has temporarily relocated to Birchwood Intermediate School while schools are closed in an effort to follow the directions of the Chief Public Health Office to practice social distancing.

The COVID-19 situation continues to evolve rapidly – hour by hour, and day by day – and we continue to see the emotional and economic impact it is having on Islanders and their families. With the health and safety of Islanders at the forefront, it is vital that we continue to share the latest information with Islanders in real time.  It is my opinion that now is not the time for the CBC to suspend its local news programming, and I will be bringing this up on my scheduled call with Deputy Prime Minister Freeland later today. I will also be reaching out to the Prime Minister to express my concerns.  Prince Edward Island is a largely rural province with varying internet connectivity to access local online news from CBC Prince Edward Island. Many Island seniors do not use the internet, have social media or pay attention to digital news platforms. They are our most vulnerable Islanders and need the most up-to-date information to properly protect themselves from COVID-19.  CBC News: Compass is the only local daily television news program in our province, and it provides a vital public service that keeps Islanders informed. The reach of CBC News: Compass into the living rooms of Island households, community and long-term care homes and seniors’ residences is essential now, more than ever. Our Chief Public Health Officer and government are working together to share important information, recommendations and directions for Islanders as we navigate the current state of public health emergency in our province and CBC News: Compass is a critical partner in helping us do this. As Premier of Prince Edward Island, I am formally requesting the Canadian Heritage Minister Steven Guilbeault, as minister of the crown responsible for the CBC, exercise his authority and reverse the decision to suspend local news broadcasts. We will be contacting the Minister to discuss our concerns and ask him to intervene.  We acknowledge and share the CBC’s concern for the health and safety of their staff. CBC Prince Edward Island staff and journalists are our friends, neighbours and community partners. As a government, we are more than willing to work with local CBC station and national leadership to ensure continuity of the local CBC television news program in our province.  If we are going to get through this pandemic situation, we need to do so together and by leveraging all of the resources we have. Now is not the time to scale back.”        Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

Premier King updated the mayor on provincial efforts to respond to both health and non-health related impacts of COVID-19 and asked for continued partnership to help minimize the short and long-term impact to Islanders. Three task groups have been established to provide rapid response to the potential non-health related impacts of COVID-19. This is in addition to the provincial COVID-19 situation response table which has been in operation for two weeks. The three groups are focused on economic and business support, labour and social supports, and the maintenance of essential services offered across government. A Joint Health Response Team has also been operational the past two weeks and the Emergency Measures Organization is activated. Mayor Brown offered the Premier his best wishes and updated the Premier on the efforts the municipality has taken including closures to recreation and community centres. The two discussed their shared desire to minimize economic disruptions, in particular the effects on the cruise ship industry and primary industries. The Mayor brought up the need to advocate to the federal government to expand Employment Insurance benefits to not only sick-leave benefits but all EI benefits. Premier King agreed this was a priority as well as ensuring those Islanders who are near the end of their EI benefits are not negatively impacted. The health and safety of Islanders is the greatest priority. The Province of Prince Edward Island is working closely with local, provincial, territorial and federal partners to minimize its health, economic and social impacts in Prince Edward Island and across the county. The overall risk to the province remains low at this time. Islanders with questions about COVID-19 should call PEI’s toll-free information line at 1-800-958-6400.

Like many Islanders, my family and I had planned a spring trip several weeks ago. In the days prior to leaving, the details for the First Ministers Meetings in Ottawa were confirmed and arrangements were made for me to travel to Ottawa from Boston where I was located. My family and I drove to Boston early Wednesday morning and I boarded a plane for Ottawa on Thursday morning, having spent less than 24-hours in the United States. While enroute to Ottawa, the decision was made to cancel the in-person meetings with Premiers and the Prime Minister. Much changed over the 24-hour period between Wednesday and Thursday.   Earlier today, PEI’s Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Heather Morrison, issued new travel recommendations and precautions related to COVID-19. I have been in regular contact with Dr. Morrison on our general response to contain the virus and raised my particular circumstance with her as well.  While my risk of exposure to COVID-19 is considered extremely low and my family and I are feeling great – we are not experiencing any symptoms and do not believe that we have been in contact with anyone who is symptomatic – we will be following her expert advice, as all Islanders should, and self-isolating and self-monitoring at home for the next 14 days.  We are facing an unprecedented challenge in COVID-19. The health and safety of Islanders is our biggest concern. As Premier, I will continue to lead our overall government efforts to support our public health professionals in containing the virus and in responding to the community and economic challenges it is raising.

The operation will receive a federal investment of $446,642 under Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada’s Agricultural Clean Technology Program, $271,467 from the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA) Regional Economic Growth through Innovation program, $89,328 from the PEI Department of Agriculture and Land and $85,847 from Atlantic Grown Organics.   Atlantic Grown Organics has been using waste bio-products as fuel for the operation of its greenhouses. Their operation has been able to make use of bio-waste from a local oilseed processing plant but have been required to supplement this system with fuel oil.  Through this support, the farm will test and demonstrate the adaptation of a clean technology boiler system, a first of its kind to be installed in North America. The new boiler system will help turn the greenhouse operation into 100 per cent renewable heating, and promote the adoption of clean technologies in the sector. Quotes “This first of its kind technology to be installed in North America is a terrific example of how producers from coast-to-coast-to-coast are looking to ‘grow greener’. Our Government is committed to supporting research into sustainable agriculture practices. This project showcases how the ingenuity of our farm families in adopting new technologies can help Canada be a leader on sustainable farming and food.” - Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food “Growing the economy can compare to nurturing produce –both take time and require consistent effort and support to thrive. We are here to best equip entrepreneurs like Marc and Krista who are passionate about quality food, the environment and sustainable business practices to remain competitive.” - Mélanie Joly, Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages and Minister responsible for ACOA “Prince Edward Island’s government believes in agriculture that is progressive and dynamic, while being both financially sound and environmentally responsible. Clean, renewable energy projects are part of reducing the ecological footprint of this vital industry.” - Bloyce Thompson, Prince Edward Island Minister of Agriculture and Land “Greenhouses in our Canadian climate need a lot of energy and most greenhouses in Canada use fossil fuels for heat. Being able to grow local organic vegetables in a “green” way is certainly rewarding. There is a lot of risk in testing new technology. The funding from the Agricultural Clean Technology Program, ACOA and Canadian Agricultural Partnership Program was essential to lower the risk involved and realize the positive outcomes of the investment.” - Marc Schurman, owner of Atlantic Grown Organics  Quick Facts The Agricultural Clean Technology Program supports research, development and adoption of clean technologies to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, generate a wide range of positive impacts on the environment from agricultural production, and promote sustainability and clean growth. 	Canada's agriculture and agri-food sector contributes over $114 billion to our gross domestic product.

During the video consultation, nurses and other medical staff are on hand at Western Hospital to take the patient’s vitals, facilitate examination and testing or provide medications as needed.   “The award-winning virtual care model at Western Hospital is an excellent example of using new, innovative technology to reduce wait times and enhance rural health care for Islanders. Given the success we’ve seen so far we’re looking at expanding this model to Kings County Memorial Hospital to improve emergency department access for people and benefit communities in that area of the province as well.” - Health and Wellness Minister James Aylward  This model for ED care at Western Hospital is being offered as a pilot program and was developed collaboratively by Heath PEI and Maple, a Canadian virtual care provider.  “The response from our patients has been incredible and overwhelmingly positive,” said community hospitals west administrator Paul Young. “We are so excited to have partnered with Maple to create this innovative model that can help effectively reduce wait times for our patients, support the workload of our ED physician and help provide more stable, quality services to our patients.” “We count ourselves very lucky to have found a health system whose bold vision for Canadian healthcare matches ours,” said Dr. Brett Belchetz, a practicing emergency department physician and the CEO and Co-founder of Maple. “While Maple has demonstrated the potential of online health care for more than four years now — many days seeing more patients than the three busiest EDs in the country combined — we’ve made some of our most exciting strides alongside the teams at Western Hospital and Health PEI, who have enthusiastically embraced technological solutions that will drive innovation forward for the entire country.”     “I am very pleased to see this efficient approach to ED care at Western Hospital in addition to the other great supports such as the tele-rounding initiative to provide the best care possible to patients, said Minister Aylward. “This model also allows Western Hospital to offer some urgent care services to people even during times when physicians cannot be on-site at the hospital emergency department which is helping to enhance rural health overall.”    About Maple 	Maple is a technology platform that tackles some of the world’s most meaningful issues in healthcare, starting with timely and convenient access to doctors and other healthcare providers. It allows patients to connect directly with doctors for medical care in minutes from their smartphone or computer 24/7, and also provides custom technological solutions for hospitals looking to advance their delivery of care.

""In the 15 years since I immigrated to PEI, the Island I now call home, I have witnessed a lot of change. This year’s theme gives us an opportunity to pause and reflect on the women near and far who have shaped us and inspire us to continue the tradition of strong Island women.

The first International Women’s Day was observed on March 19, 1911, in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland. That day, more than one million people showed their support by participating in public events. In the years that followed, other countries began to observe and celebrate this day. The United Nations recognized 1975 as International Women’s Year and began celebrating International Women’s Day on March 8 of that year.  Today, International Women’s Day is celebrated around the world – in many countries, it is a national holiday. It has grown to become a global day of recognition of women’s achievements and a call to action to support women’s rights and advance gender equality.

Participating communities will directly benefit through energy independence, local economic development, and long-term savings on their energy bills.”  - Transportation, Infrastructure and Energy Minister Steven Myers  Samso is a carbon-neutral island in Denmark. They produce more energy than they use. Samso has reduced their heating costs by 40 per cent and created local energy businesses that don’t rely on imported oil.  In Samso, they have four district heating plants, burning straw or waste wood and using solar or wind power. They buy the straw from local farmers at above market prices.  The heat from straw goes to heat homes for a much lower price than burning fossil fuels. The waste from their district heating plant goes to fertilize crops to complete the sustainable cycle. In Gottingen, Germany, government representatives toured a co-generation power plant that produces electricity and district heat from corn, to fuel two villages. This is one of 9,000 such plants in Germany.  Representatives also visited HAWK University, where scientists are researching ways to turn waste into power through highly efficient district heating systems – making district heating technology more viable than ever. “We need to hear from Islanders on how they want to make community energy generation a reality in their towns, villages and neighborhoods,” said Minister Myers. “Communities will have direct involvement - and direct benefit - from the sustainable infrastructure that will power their homes, businesses and community centres for decades to come.” More information on sustainable communities, including the request for expressions of interest, is available at Sustainable Communities Initiative.  In the coming weeks, there will be community information sessions across the province to begin the dialogue on how communities make energy generation work for them.  Media contact: 	Katie MacDonald 	Department of Transportation, Infrastructure and Energy 	902-314-3996katiemacdonald@gov.pe.ca      Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

Today, the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, Jonathan Wilkinson, and PEI’s Minister of Environment, Water and Climate Change, Brad Trivers, announced that the Government of Canada is providing over $1.4 million to the Government of Prince Edward Island. These funds are being provided through the Target 1 Challenge component of the Canada Nature Fund. This project will help conserve approximately 4,400 hectares of high-priority areas and habitats, including PEI’s forests and wetlands, and will expand upon existing protected areas and establish new conserved areas in the province. Importantly, the project will protect PEI’s old-growth forest and will have numerous benefits for species at risk including the common nighthawk, the Canada warbler, and the rusty blackbird. “Prince Edward Island and its partners are contributing to Canada’s biodiversity by protecting and conserving PEI’s natural heritage. The Government of Canada is proud to be a partner in this effort, which is an important step toward our targets of protecting a quarter of Canada’s lands and a quarter of its oceans by 2025 and working toward 30 percent of each by 2030. Together, we will ensure a healthy, prosperous environment for generations to come.” – The Honourable Jonathan Wilkinson, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Prince Edward Island and other partners including Ducks Unlimited Canada, Island Nature Trust, Nature Conservancy of Canada, and the Mi’kmaq Confederacy of PEI are contributing $3.4 million in cash or in-kind donations to this $4.8 million project.  “Islanders have a deep connection to the land, water, and forests. We need to work together to protect the habitats of our most vulnerable wildlife species.” – The Honourable Brad Trivers, Minister of Environment, Water and Climate Change  Through the $500 million Canada Nature Fund, the Government of Canada supports the efforts of partners across the country to protect nature. Federal investments are matched by philanthropic foundations, corporations, not-for-profits, provinces, territories, and other partners, raising a total of $1 billion for conservation action in Canada.   Media contacts: Leanne Ritchie 	Department of Environment, Water and Climate Change 	902-314-0134lpritchie@gov.pe.ca Moira Kelly 	Press Secretary 	Office of the Minister of Environment and Climate Change 	819-271-6218moira.kelly@canada.ca Media Relations 	Environment and Climate Change Canada 	819-938-3338 or 1-844-836-7799 (toll-free)ec.media.ec@canada.ca   Backgrounder  The Government of Canada is committed to doubling the amount of protected nature in our lands and waters across Canada. Through Budget 2018, the Government invested a historic $1.3-billion to protect Canada’s nature, including the establishment of new protected and conserved areas as well as new Indigenous protected and conserved areas. Globally, Canada has 20 percent of freshwater resources, 24 percent of wetlands, 25 percent of temperate rainforests, and 33 percent of remaining boreal forest. Canada also has almost one third of all land-based carbon storage: a vital element of action on climate change. PEI is the most densely populated province in Canada, and it has the highest percentage of private land. These two factors combine to make land protection in PEI particularly challenging. This investment in the protection of 4,440 hectares on the island is impressive.  PEI’s current protected area stands at 24,848 hectares (4.4 percent of the land base). The province is committed to meeting its stated target of protecting 7 percent of its land, by the end of 2020.  The Government of Canada has also invested in expanding PEI’s protected and conserved areas through the Quick Start component of the Canada Nature Fund.

Last year, there were just over 1,500 housing starts, of which rental units accounted for almost half. The new Residential Tenancy Act would replace the Rental of Residential Properties Act which is now 30 years old. “The Act is intended to provide better protection for both tenants and landlords while addressing the current realities of housing in Prince Edward Island,” said Social Development and Housing Minister Ernie Hudson. “We want to hear from Islanders on how the new legislation would impact them and how it could be improved.” More information on the proposed Act and the consultation process can be found at PrinceEdwardIsland.ca/ResidentialTenancy.

EMO remained active for 13 days to coordinate provincial response and recovery efforts to help Islanders repair damages.  As part of EMO’s process for continual improvement, the Province committed to an independent review of its provincial response, which includes an online survey carried out by Calian Emergency Management Solutions.   “Significant weather events are becoming more and more common and EMO is responsible to coordinate provincial response efforts during times of extraordinary need. Having experts like Calian look into how we did as a province and where we can make things better will only help us better prepare and support Islanders during the next emergency or disaster.” -  Justice and Public Safety Minister Bloyce Thompson  As experts in emergency management solutions, Calian will be engaging Islanders, community partners, municipalities affected by Dorian for the independent review of the provincial response to this past weather event. Outcomes of the final report are expected this summer and it will help identify opportunities for improvement to address future weather and emergency events for the province. Islanders can access the survey in English and French from February 14-28, 2020.  Media contact: 	Vicki Tse 	Department of Justice and Public Safetyvickitse@gov.pe.ca           Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

A 28-bed transitional housing complex will help support the needs of Islanders experiencing homelessness.  The province has entered into a purchase and sale agreement for properties and land in Charlottetown to develop new transitional supports for men, women and families. The properties, currently known collectively as Smith Lodge, will be renovated and ready to open by summer 2020.    “Adding more transitional beds in Charlottetown will help shelters such as Bedford MacDonald House and Blooming House that are seeing increased demand. The provincial government and community partners will work together to support people as they transition to more permanent living arrangements. Smith Lodge will provide safe and supportive housing to Islanders at a vulnerable time in their life and also offer them assistance and encouragement as they get back on their feet.” - Social Development and Housing Minister Ernie Hudson  In November 2019, the province finalized a community needs assessment for emergency shelter and since then announced several actions including continued partnerships with Bedford MacDonald House, Blooming House, and the Salvation Army, setting up a new community outreach centre and partnering with a local landlord to provide 10-transition beds in Charlottetown.  A new 20-bed transitional home for survivors of family violence and children aging out of care is also under construction and expected to be complete this spring.  These efforts and others to address the various housing needs of Islanders are highlighted in an 18-month progress report released today. Additional initiatives include supporting the construction of 372 new affordable housing units, investing in 1150 new mobile rental vouchers and collaborating with more than 20 housing partners. Current housing priorities for government are: creating 100 new government-owned social housing units across the province;  continuing to  partner with communities and developers to create more non-government owned units;  making it easier for people to access home renovation and repair programs;  public consultation and  legislative changes to the Rental of Residential Properties Act to support tenants and landlords; and  considering ways to provide Island students with more housing support.  “Housing is critical for raising healthy families and fostering success in education, jobs and aging in place. It’s not just about buildings. Safe and suitable housing helps to strengthen the economy, build communities and support overall personal well-being,” said Minister Hudson. “Much progress has been made over the past 18 months but there is more work to be done. Through successful partnerships, we will continue to provide timely access to housing that meets the current and future needs of Islanders.”  For more information, visit Home Together Affordable Housing for PEI.  Media contact: 	April Gallant 	Department of Social Development and Housing 	902-620-3409aldgallant@gov.pe.ca       Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

In 2019, the province lost one-third of its substitute drivers. Due to a high number of retirements, many substitute drivers took on full-time driver jobs or other jobs which are becoming more available in a strong economy.  In response, school bus driver training programs were expanded and the number of drivers being trained this year increased from 24 to 48 new drivers. Training was supported by Skills PEI funding of $198,450 under the Labour Market Development Agreement.   “Given the current shortage of school bus drivers in PEI and across the country, we are pleased that so many Islanders have answered the call for training. School bus drivers take their responsibility to safely transport more than 18,000 Island students to and from school each day very seriously, and it is very important that we have an adequate supply of school bus drivers.”  -  Education and Lifelong Learning Minister Brad Trivers.  As a result of job fairs and promotional campaigns, many people are now taking part in the six-week training program which is free to participants.  In addition to the JVI School Bus Driver Program and First Aid Certification, student drivers take on-the-job training which provides them with hands-on-experience on the bus, and classroom sessions to develop working knowledge of common situations. The training programs are coordinated by Rural Community Learning Inc. in Alberton. “It is encouraging to see so many people graduating from the driver training programs,” said Public Schools Branch Director Parker Grimmer. “School bus drivers play a key role in helping students get ready to learn each day. They are often the first adult outside the home that a student will see each morning. They help students begin their day in a positive way which can make them more apt to attend school and be in a positive mindset to learn.”  Anyone interested in becoming a part of the public school bus driver team is asked to contact the Public Schools Branch at or the French Language School Board.  Media contact: 	Jean Doherty     	Department of education and Lifelong Learning 	902 314 5702 jmdoherty@gov.pe.ca      Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

The last time the act was reviewed was in 2006.    “Workplaces have changed over the years so our employment standards need to evolve too. Islanders have asked for a full review and today I’m proud to say that we are committed to doing exactly that, so together we can continue to create healthy and supportive workplaces in Prince Edward Island.” - Economic Growth, Tourism and Culture Minister Matthew MacKay  Calls to complete a comprehensive review of the act have been made by several interest groups and the Employment Standards Board. A review is also included as an action item in the Poverty Reduction Action Plan for Prince Edward Island.  A panel will be set up to carry out the review of the act and its associated regulations. The panel will have a chair and two side panel members. One of the side-panel members will be a representative for employers and the other a representative for employees.  The panel will do two phases of public consultations and write an interim and final report on what they heard from Islanders. The final report will make recommendations on changes to employment standards in the province.  To apply as an employer representative or employee representative on the Employment Standards Comprehensive Review Panel, visit Engage PEI  by March 11, 2020.

We are pleased to collaborate on this innovative project which will reduce costs for students and ensure that they have the materials they need to learn.” - Education and Lifelong Learning Minister Brad Trivers  Textbook and other learning resource costs can contribute significantly to student debt. A proven method to reduce costs and barriers to learning for students is the use of open textbooks and other types of OERs. One of the UPEISU policy priorities for 2018/2019 was an open textbook pilot project to reduce the cost of accessing educational resources. As a result of the student union’s hard work and determined efforts, the OER Development Program at UPEI has been created at the Robertson Library, with support from the provincial government. “What a great collaboration and I’m really looking forward to working with librarians, instructors and students on this initiative – a first in the region,” said Donald Moses, University Librarian at UPEI. “Librarian Kim Mears will be the project lead and manages Pressbooks, the open source OER platform used by the library. OERs generated out of this program will reduce cost and barriers to learning by providing access to content to students in multiple formats.”  ""We are extremely excited about the changes this program will bring to students in terms of affordability,” said Sweta Daboo, vice-president academic and external at the UPEISU. “Rising textbook costs pose a significant barrier to education, and this is a monumental first step in addressing that issue. We thank the province and the university for putting the work and resources into this project and look forward to continued investments and collaboration for students.”  The funding program will run through 2020 and will be administered by the Robertson Library. It provides a variety of funding opportunities including:  an open textbook grant to support the development of a new open textbook on a topic that is currently not covered by an existing open textbook,  an open textbook adaptation grant to support the adaptation of one or more open textbooks to create a new version or edition of an open textbook, a supplementary resources grant to support the creation of ancillary materials for existing open textbooks, including, but not limited to test banks, slide decks, or interactive media, for an open textbook or other open education resource, or an honoraria for open textbook peer reviews to support individuals completing a formal peer review of an existing open textbook.   The funding is available to any instructor of a credit course at UPEI and either an individual or a team can apply.

401,2020-02-10,Canada,Prince Edward Island,,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/prince-edward-island-welcomes-neonatologist,Government Website,Prince Edward Island welcomes Neonatologist,"            Health and Wellness Minister James Aylward and Neonatologist Dr. Beth Ellen Brown           With the addition of a new Neonatologist, more Island babies who are sick or born more prematurely will be able to receive neonatal intensive care services closer to home.  Islander Dr. Beth Ellen Brown has joined the PEI health care team as a Neonatologist which has allowed the establishment of a provincial Neonatology Service. The service is an expansion of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).  Dr. Brown, a native of Charlottetown, completed her medical degree at Memorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador followed by her pediatrics residency at Western University. She is returning to the Island after completion of specialized training in Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine at Dalhousie University.  “For the entirety of my medical training I have been looking forward to the day when I join the QEH as a neonatologist; it has been my long-term aspiration to advance neonatal intensive care on Prince Edward Island,” said Dr. Brown. “Together, we will provide more specialized care to both premature babies and to full-term babies who are significantly unwell. This specialized care will not only include advanced neonatal intensive care services, but also enhanced family-centered care.  In providing such care, families will be able to stay together and be part of the medical team providing care to their babies. This is the tremendous advantage of family-centered care, and it is this type of care that has been shown to improve outcomes for these babies.”  “It is wonderful to have Dr. Brown return home to practice and increase availability of specialized care for Islanders whose babies are born prematurely. For newborns, having their parent(s) and families nearby can positively impact their development, and may even mean they can go home sooner.” - Health and Wellness Minister James Aylward  Once the Neonatology Service becomes fully operational, premature babies born up to 12 weeks early and full-term babies requiring advanced intensive care services will no longer be transferred off Island to receive necessary care.  It will also mean families of these babies will remain together on PEI. Furthermore, while some babies needing surgical and other specialized care will still be transferred off Island, these babies will be transferred back to the Island sooner meaning a reduction in the amount of time babies and families spend out of province.  ""I am happy that Dr. Brown is joining the Health PEI family and that she is bringing added knowledge to the pediatric services at the QEH that will benefit Islanders,"" said Dr. Andre Celliers, Executive Director of Medical Affairs for Health PEI. ""We will be able to repatriate infants sooner to PEI from the IWK and decrease the hardship of new parents that have to travel and be away from home for long periods with premature babies."" In addition to hiring a full-time Neonatologist, government will be hiring several specialized staff including a neonatal nurse practitioner, respiratory therapists, a registered nurse and other supports for the Neonatology Service.

The active transportation fund is a $25 million investment over five years that will support priority active transportation infrastructure throughout the province.  “We want to hear from Islanders on how we can make active transportation easier – whether that’s through new walking and bike paths, installing or widening paved shoulders, or better connecting existing walking and cycling trails. We know Islanders have great ideas and it’s important to get a full picture of their priorities as we work our way through the planning process.” - Transportation, Infrastructure and Energy Minister Steven Myers  Government has received initial feedback on active transportation improvements from community groups and municipalities. Early suggestions include: Shoulder-installation in Mill River, Brackley, North Rustico, Mermaid, Georgetown and Stratford Cycling path expansions at Gairloch and Cardigan Bike racks and shoulder-widening in O’Leary Expanded walking/cycling paths in Charlottetown and Summerside Government will be taking suggestions from Islanders, municipalities, Indigenous communities and community groups over the next five years. Plans will be updated annually and priority projects will be implemented each construction season.  “Sustainable transportation is a priority and we need to begin right away in order to get started during the 2020 construction season,” said Minister Myers.  “Together, we can reduce our transportation emissions, while helping communities build much needed infrastructure and helping Islanders get active.”  To share ideas with the active transportation working group, email ATPEI@gov.pe.ca The active transportation fund is part of the Sustainable Transportation Action Plan to reduce transportation emissions while encouraging more walking, cycling and community transit.

Being open, listening and speaking without judgment, and knowing how to respond can have a huge positive impact on survivors of family violence. Communities across the Island will mark the week by holding Walks in Silence, information presentations and family activities to raise awareness of family violence. The events kick off with a reception at Rodd Charlottetown Hotel on February 10 from 4-6 pm. “This year’s theme will help all of us to better understand how the community can respond when we know someone has experienced family violence,” said Danya O’Malley, executive director of PEI Family Violence Prevention Services. “Being supportive is key to helping survivors move forward.” Islanders can show their support by taking part in the week’s activities. For example, Wednesday February 12 is Wear Purple Day in Prince Edward Island. A full schedule of activities can be found at Premier’s Action Committee on Family Violence Prevention 2020 campaign.  “One of the great things about living on the Island is that we care about our neighbours and supporting survivors is something we can all do. We may not be experiencing violence ourselves, but there are many things that we can do to help others who are.” - Premier Dennis King  Throughout Family Violence Prevention Week, Islanders can follow and share daily images and messages on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.    The Premier’s Action Committee on Family Violence Prevention was established in 1995 to provide education and awareness about family violence prevention and its mandate was recently renewed for 2019-2024.   Media contact: 	Anne Macrae 	(902) 393-4025amacrae@gov.pe.ca Backgrounder  Whether we are a neighbour, co-worker, friend or family member of someone experiencing violence, we all have a role to play in ending family violence. Businesses have a role to play as well. New resources have been created to help businesses respond to family violence that happens in a workplace setting. A new leave was introduced in November 2019 allowing employees to take up to three days paid, and seven days unpaid for issues related to domestic violence. Wednesday, February 12 is Wear Purple Day in Prince Edward Island. Islanders are encouraged to wear purple: To raise awareness of Family Violence Prevention Week To remember victims of violence and their families To show that violence in any relationship is not acceptable.

New classroom libraries are giving Island students more opportunity to develop their literacy and critical thinking skills. Research shows that the more contact children have with books and the more time they spend reading, the better readers they will become. Once the Grade 7 libraries are all set up this month, all grades 7 to 12 students will have daily access to high quality literature in their classrooms.  “Access to books is one of the most powerful indicators of a child’s ability to read and love reading. By giving all students at-the-elbow access to a variety of good books on a daily basis, we are helping them develop as readers, writers and lifelong learners.” - Education and Lifelong Learning Minister Brad Trivers  New language arts curriculum focuses on 50 percent independent reading, 25 percent book club and 25 percent core text. The classroom libraries allow students to choose from hundreds of carefully selected titles which support the curriculum outcomes they are expected to achieve at their grade level.  The books are chosen by teachers, librarians and education partners such as Mi’kmaq Confederacy of PEI and the Human Rights Commission. Students are also involved in the evaluation and selection process. The classroom collections include a range of reading difficulty. Teachers have been trained on how to use the books to support the curriculum and to help students develop a love of reading. The books are used to support themes they are exploring in class. Book clubs allow students to discuss a book with their peers and deepen their understanding of what they are reading. Book Talks enable students to present a summary of a book and based on their recommendations, students keep wish lists of which books or authors they will read next.  Classroom libraries differ from school libraries in that they focus on the curriculum and what students are learning at their grade level. Librarians and teachers work together to help children become lifelong learners. Many librarians report that use of the school library has increased as a result of the reading enjoyment students are gaining in the classroom. The intermediate and high school classroom libraries have been installed and refreshed over the past few years in English and French schools through an investment of $1.2 million.

The Islanders will be part of a 20-person crew from Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Quebec involved in direct suppression work on fire incidents within the state.  “Our hearts go out to those who have been impacted by the fires in Australia. I wish our forest firefighters a safe journey as they help to end these wildfires.” - Brad Trivers, Minister of Environment, Water and Climate Change.  According to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, there are already Canadian firefighters in both states of New South Wales and Victoria as well as in South Australia.  “Firefighters play a critical part in keeping our communities safe,” said Bloyce Thompson, Minister of Justice and Public Safety. “We are grateful to have an incredibly skilled fire response force on the Island.” It has been an unprecedented fire season in Australia with severe fires along the east coast with some starting as early as August. Since late December other large fires have erupted in southern New South Wales and eastern Victoria and more recently in Australian Capital Territory. Fire conditions continue to be challenging. Here in Prince Edward Island, the department of Environment, Water and Climate Change is responsible for wild fire response within the province. Staff deployed to Victoria will gain skills that could be needed if PEI faces serious wildfires in the future. Traditionally, most wildfires on PEI tend to happen in May and early June. The skill of forest fire fighting staff from the Island is recognized nationally. During the extreme fires of 2018, Island wild fire staff provided assistance to British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario and Alberta again in 2019.

For some spouses remaining at home this could mean thousands of extra dollars that they will be able to keep. At least 80 families will benefit right away.   “I’ve heard from a number of Islanders with partners in long-term care who have concerns about the way their income has been allocated. Islanders work their entire lives to build financial security for the future, and they should not have to lose that security when their spouse requires long-term care. This change will help ease those concerns, allow spouses at home to maintain their financial independence, and is in keeping with our commitment to put people first.” - Health and Wellness Minister James Aylward.   Islanders who live in public or private nursing homes are responsible for the cost of their room and board, as well as personal expenses. Subsidies have always been available for those who can’t afford the full cost, and any long-term care resident can apply for the subsidy, which is based on an income-means test. This will not change, but the updates to the long-term care subsidy assessment make it fairer to everyone and will also make the process easier for those applying.  “The regulations were very out-dated and I am pleased that with this change, more Islanders will be able to comfortably stay in their homes in the company of family, friends, neighbours and community while their spouse receives the long-term care support they need,” Minister Aylward said.   For more information about Long-Term Care Subsidization, call 1-888-365-5313.

These changes will allow for more openness with respect to birth records related to adoption but at the same time, they offer balance for those individuals who were promised confidentiality at the time of the adoption.” - Hon. Ernie Hudson, Minister of Social Development and Housing  Adult adoptees and birth parents involved in adoptions finalized before January 31, 2020 can choose whether they want their information shared. This is the way it is done in other Canadian jurisdictions that have open adoption records. Between January 31, 2020 and January 30, 2021, adult adoptees and birth parents can submit a disclosure veto if they do not want their identifying information to be released. For this reason, adoption records for adoptions finalized before January 31, 2020 will not be opened until January 31, 2021. A disclosure veto may still be placed at any time after January 31, 2021, as long as the identifying information has not already been released. All adult adoptees and birth parents have the option to file a contact preference which allows them to indicate how they would like to be contacted if the other party is looking for them. Options may include contact by email or phone, in-person visits, or no contact at all.  A contact preference does not prevent the release of identifying information; it only specifies the type of contact a person would prefer. After January 31, 2021, Government may release identifying information upon request subject to the terms of the contact preference. The person requesting the information must agree to abide by the terms before they receive the information or could face penalties. A disclosure veto or contact preference can be modified or removed at any time by the person who placed it and it expires one year after their death. For more information about the changes and to fill out an application, visit PrinceEdwardIsland.ca/OpenAdoptionRecords, email adoption@gov.pe.ca or call toll-free 1-844-982-0507.

410,2020-01-31,Canada,Prince Edward Island,,https://www.princeedwardisland.ca/en/news/new-resource-gives-island-farming-community-more-mental-health-support,Government Website,New resource gives Island farming community more mental health support  ,"            Hon. Bloyce Thompson, PEI Minister of Agriculture and Land          Prince Edward Island’s farmers and their families have a new resource to help them deal with the mental and emotional stress that can come with farming life. The new website www.farmerstalk.ca encourages farmers, producers and family members to open up about the challenges they face, to support each other and to reach out for help with any mental health struggles they may be dealing with. The site reminds farmers that they are not alone and includes personal messages about mental health, links to support services and advice on how farmers can take care of their mental health before it becomes a crisis. Hog producer Donald MacDonald saw how heavy the emotional burden of farming can be when a friend and colleague who had expressed concern about financial pressures went on to take his own life. “This was a solid, hard working guy, who didn’t talk much about things that were bothering him,” MacDonald said. “I think sometimes people in this industry just feel that there isn’t a way to get out or to improve things. If people can talk about how they are doing and if we can listen to each other maybe that will help.” Agriculture and Land Minister Bloyce Thompson launched the website today at the annual meeting of the PEI Federation of Agriculture.  ""I can tell you from my experience and from the lives of those around me, farming can be a stressful way to make a living. Too many of our friends and colleagues wrestle alone with anxiety, depression and isolation. We want to open up conversations about mental health and farming. There are people who care and services available to help.” - Hon. Bloyce Thompson  Farmers and those that support them are encouraged to visit the FarmersTalk.Ca site, download the talk bubble to spark conversation and post social media messages of support using the hashtag #FarmersTalk. “You can talk about your own experiences, you can offer encouragement – the important thing is that we let each other know that we are there for each other as farmers dealing with stress, depression or anxiety,” Thompson said. “I want my fellow farmers to understand that they are not in this struggle alone.” FarmersTalk.Ca was developed by the Department of Agriculture and Land in cooperation with Island farm organizations, and provincial mental health services. The resource builds on support already being offered through the Farmer Assistance Program, which offers six free sessions to farmers, their families and their employees dealing with mental health issues. “The Prince Edward Island Federation of Agriculture  is proud of the fact we have been offering counseling services through the Farm Assistance Program since 2004” said president David Mol. “Mental health is an incredibly important issue in today’s farming environment and it is crucial that as an industry we stand beside each other and ensure people’s well being is taken care of. The Farmer Assistance Program is there for that reason and we look at Farmers Talk as one more way to shed light on this issue and how we are not alone.” Media contact: 	Ron Ryder 	Department of Agriculture and Land 	902-314-6367rrryder@gov.pe.ca        Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

This program benefits both businesses and the community and I encourage all potential employers to explore their opportunities through Jobs for Youth.” - Fisheries and Communities Minister Jamie Fox  Employers can apply for funding at 2020 Jobs for Youth Program by March 31, 2020.  Students can participate in the program by applying directly to employers. A full list of employers will be available at 2020 Jobs for Youth Program. The following improvements were made to the program based on feedback from the 2019 participants to better serve the needs of students and employers: minimum age of eligibility for students changed from 16 to 15; application deadline for employers is now March 31; employers approved for funding will be posted online in May ; students can now apply directly to employers for positions that interest them;  WorkPEI will assist students and employers with recruitment, application and hiring processes. Last year Jobs for Youth helped employers create summer jobs for 379 Island students to work with businesses, non-profits and public sector employers. “This program helps employers meet their labour needs but it’s also an important boost for our students,” said Minister Fox. “Job experiences, like those afforded by the Jobs for Youth program are invaluable for young people beginning their careers.” Media contact: 	Ron Ryder 	Communications Officer 	902-314-6367rrryder@gov.pe.ca       Share this page:Email this page to a friend   "

Islanders can read the summary report from the public consultations at On The Level.  “The connection with our land, water and air is deeply personal for Islanders. How we regulate and protect our water is important and a responsibility that we all share. We appreciate the hundreds of Islanders and organizations who shared their thoughts and opinions on how we regulate water withdrawals here on Prince Edward Island, and we are incorporating their feedback as we work on drafting a second version of the water withdrawal regulations.” - Environment, Water and Climate Change Minister Brad Trivers  Other themes identified by Islanders in the consultation summary report include: calls for more independent science;  fairness in water access among users; the ability for the Minister to order drought contingency plans if necessary; the need to manage water resources at the watershed level; and, concern about fish and wildlife conservation.  The draft regulations have been available for public comment since the summer of 2019. In the fall, four public consultation meetings were held across the Island to gather public input and feedback on the draft regulations. The meetings were further supported by an online survey for those unable to attend in person.  As part of the interactive consultations, members of the public, industry and non-profit organizations were asked eight questions related to the processes laid out in the draft regulations. People worked in groups to pull out themes with the highest consensus. The feedback is being used to help assess any further amendments required to the draft regulations before bringing the Water Act into effect.  To learn more about water on PEI, visit On The Level. Media contact: 	Leanne Ritchie 	Department of Environment, Water and Climate Change 	902-314-0134lpritchie@gov.pe.ca Backgrounder  The Water Act was tabled during the fall 2017 sitting of the legislature and received Royal Assent on December 20, 2017. It is expected to be brought into force 90 days after the final water withdrawal regulations are presented to the Standing Committee on Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability. The water withdrawal regulations are one of four sets of regulations that need to be in place in order to implement the Water Act.  The water withdrawal regulations will help the Province manage and track who is using what amounts of water. For the first time, permits will be required for those who use more than normal household levels. Other regulations that must be in place to implement the Water Act include: well construction regulations (consultations occurred in spring 2019); water supply and wastewater treatment regulations (consultations occurred in spring 2019); and, sewage disposal systems regulations must be transferred from under the Environmental Protection Act to the Water Act.

Under this Act, Acadians, Francophones and French-speaking Islanders are guaranteed a number of government services in their preferred language.  The other newly designated service also means people will be able to apply to government agencies, boards and commissions in either English or French. Islanders can choose which language they wish to submit their applications online through Engage PEI.   “I am very proud that our civil service continues to improve its capacity to offer more French language services to Islanders.

The program includes up to 16 weeks of residential care and 24 weeks of follow up aftercare using a holistic approach and helping youth transition back into community living.    “The youth who come to our program are ready to make changes and are looking for  support and treatment to do that,” said Jayelee Grady, youth mental health & addiction services program manager. “In many cases they have hit a point where outpatient treatment is not enough, but they are not at a point where they require acute care or hospitalization. We are here to help them improve their mental health, overcome addictions, develop healthy life skills and set new goals.” The Strength Program has supported 700 Island youth over the last ten years. The program’s focus on reintegrating youth into the community is worth celebrating and ties closely to the community-first philosophy supporting the mental health and addiction revitalization planning that is currently underway.    “It is extremely beneficial to help these youth gain the skills, knowledge and confidence to reintegrate into their communities, close to their support systems.
