MARKSTAY-WARREN —The governments of Canada and Ontario recognize the different ways that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted smaller and rural communities across the province. Both governments are making strategic investments in infrastructure to meet the specific needs of rural and northern Ontario municipalities and help them strengthen their local economies.
Today, Marc G. Serré, Member of Parliament for Nickel Belt, on behalf of the Honourable Maryam Monsef, Canada's Minister of Women and Gender Equality and Rural Economic Development; and the Honourable John Yakabuski, Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry, and Member of Provincial Parliament for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, on behalf of the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure, announced funding for eight road and bridge projects in Northern Ontario. They were joined by his Worship, Stephen Salonin, Mayor of the Municipality of Markstay-Warren. These projects will improve various streets, roads, and a bridge. In Markstay-Warren, $4.4 million in federal and provincial funding is being invested in resurfacing, improvements to shoulders and drainage, and the replacement of driveway culverts for approximately 5.5 kilometers of streets. The project will improve road safety and reliability.  In Wasauksing First Nation - Parry Island, the reconstruction of about 16 kilometres of Wawbawzee Road will improve access to the First Nation territory for residents, visitors and emergency vehicles, year-round. In addition, the reconstruction of the Krugerdorf Bridge will replace the current 3-span, 60 metre bridge with a shorter span, improving drainage and the roadway. The new bridge will be safer and more reliable for residents of the Township of Chamberlain. The Government of Canada is investing over $16.7 million in these projects through the Rural and Northern Communities Infrastructure Stream of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Ontario is contributing more than $8.3 million for these important infrastructure projects in these communities, while municipalities are contributing over $2.7 million towards the projects and the Wasauksing First Nation is contributing $330,215 towards its project. The governments of Canada and Ontario are working in collaboration with their partners to support jobs, improve communities and build confidence as we safely and sustainably restore economic growth.

 Province Supports Development of Made-in-Ontario N95 Respirators
Building Homegrown Manufacturing Capacity Vital in Fight against COVID-19

July 14, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


CAMBRIDGE ― The Ontario government is providing Cambridge-based Eclipse Innovations Inc. with $1,408,475 from the Ontario Together Fund to scale up its operations to manufacture made-in-Ontario N95 masks. These masks are an essential piece of personal protective equipment (PPE) used to protect workers in healthcare and industrial settings. This investment is part of the government's plan to increase the capacity of Ontario-made PPE, while supporting local businesses during the safe and gradual reopening of the province.
The announcement was made today at the company's facility by Premier Doug Ford and Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""As part of our government's made-in-Ontario plan for renewal, growth, and recovery, we are actively working with local companies to manufacture the critical PPE we need to protect our frontline workers today and well into the future,"" said Premier Ford. ""We have the most talented and innovative people anywhere to make the highest quality products in the world. Ontario is the manufacturing powerhouse of Canada and we encourage everyone to buy local to help our businesses and factories get back on their feet."" Today also marked the beginning of the Premier's tour to acknowledge and thank strong local businesses and exceptional individuals across the province who have stepped up to help out during the outbreak of COVID-19. Over the coming months, Premier Ford will visit a number of communities to recognize those who have gone above and beyond, hear ideas from the people on how the government can help them succeed in the new environment, and support made-in-Ontario products as a key part of the province's path to recovery. ""As our government continues to move forward with the gradual and safe reopening of our economy, we have been working closely with our business community to mobilize Ontario's manufacturing and innovation might,"" said Minister Fedeli. ""Businesses like Eclipse Innovations have stepped up with solutions to help at a critical time. Together with our entrepreneurs and innovators, we will ensure Ontario has the factories, plants, and assembly lines to respond to any future crisis, should the need ever arise."" With Ontario's support, Eclipse Innovations will create the capacity to manufacture made-in-Ontario N95 respirators, enabling it to bring a qualified, domestically produced N95 respirator to market. N95 respirators filter 95 per cent of airborne particles, making it highly effective in protecting the wearer from airborne pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria that could damage the respiratory tract. By adding this new capacity, Eclipse Innovations will be able to make one million N95 respirators per week, which will help serve domestic market demand to ensure a safe reopening of the economy and combat COVID-19 safely and effectively. Eclipse Innovations Inc. is a Cambridge-based company established in April 2020 as an affiliate of Eclipse Automation Inc., a leading manufacturer of custom automated equipment for the life sciences, energy, transportation, consumer, industrial and electronics industries. Eclipse Automation has 450 Ontario-based employees and this project will include the creation of 17 new permanent full-time jobs at its affiliate company, Eclipse Innovations. ""Eclipse is a company that does not stand still, especially at a critical time like now. We are nimble and ready to take action, and that's exactly what we did when we established Eclipse Innovations,"" said Steve Mai, CEO of Eclipse Innovations Inc. ""We are pleased to work with the Ontario government to begin manufacturing respirators as soon as possible. By working in partnership, we can rapidly create automation systems to support the design, assemble these important medical supplies and pave the way for a domestically produced N95 respirator."" When the outbreak of COVID-19 hit, Eclipse quickly pivoted its business and collaborated with global players IREMA and Harmontronics to create a solution to design, produce and distribute N95 respirators for the domestic market. This investment will also allow Eclipse to develop a range of different mask sizes and styles, such as horizontal and vertical fold, providing multiple options for an optimal fit. This is important because, for a N95 respirator to work effectively, it must properly fit the face of the wearer. Eclipse also has a partnership with Conestoga College for the development of a N95 predictive fit testing software using facial scanning technology.

Quick Facts

The government launched the $50 million Ontario Together Fund to support the development of proposals submitted by businesses and individuals through the Ontario Together web portal and help businesses retool their operations. Since its launch in April, six other companies, in addition to Eclipse, have received support from the Ontario Together Fund: Virox Technologies, Southmedic, SRB Technologies, Sterling Industries, CSA Group Testing & Certification, and Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters.
Since its launch, the Ontario Together web portal has received more than 28,000 submissions. More than 18,000 emergency supplies leads have been converted into $662 million in purchases of critical supplies and equipment to support staff on the front lines, including: 26 million gowns, 177 million gloves, 123 million masks, and over 4 million face shields. Over 6,900 ideas have been submitted through the portal on how to address the COVID-19 outbreak, including offers from businesses to retool their operations to make critical supplies or to deliver needed goods or services.

The Ontario Together web portal is also accepting technology-driven solutions and services to help businesses reopen safely and to strengthen interprovincial trade and supply chains.
The Workplace PPE Supplier Directory provides businesses with information on PPE suppliers.

Province partners with North York General Hospital to give vulnerable patients direct access from hospital to long-term care

July 14, 2020 11:30 A.M.

Ministry of Long-Term Care


TORONTO — Today, the Ontario government announced it is launching a pilot project with North York General Hospital that would give alternate level of care (ALC) hospital patients direct priority access to a long-term care bed to help reduce waitlists and end hallway health care. 
""One of the challenges facing our health care system is the length of time hospital patients wait to be discharged to long-term care homes,"" said Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""The pilot project is an example of how our government, together with our long-term care partners, is using innovative ideas and modern solutions to help end hallway health care and reduce the long-term care waitlist."" ALC patients at North York General Hospital who have been waiting for at least 60 days for a long-term care home placement will be eligible for direct access to one of 18 long-term care beds at the hospital's long-term care facility, Seniors' Health Centre. This 18-month pilot project addresses the wait times for a growing number of ALC patients — people who no longer require hospital services, but who are still in hospital because their health status prevents them from going home and there is no space in long-term care for them. ""Innovative models like North York General Hospital's pilot project with Seniors' Health Centre will directly help reduce wait times by getting more patients in the right care setting faster,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""Supporting collaborative, solution-based projects is part of our government's comprehensive plan to end hallway health care and build a connected and sustainable health care system centred around the needs of the patient."" For the pilot, North York General Hospital patients will be eligible for up to 10 per cent of long-stay beds at Seniors' Health Centre, provided they meet specific criteria: they are occupying a bed at the hospital, they have been designated as an alternate level of care patient, they require immediate admission into a long-term care home, and they have been waiting for placement for at least 60 days as an alternate level of care patient. ""The future of health care rests on developing innovative solutions while working together to provide an integrated system of care,"" said Dr. Joshua Tepper, President and CEO, North York General Hospital. ""Through our long-term care home, Seniors' Health Centre, North York General is uniquely poised to help patients return to the community as quickly as possible while also improving the efficiency of the health care system. We are very pleased to be leading this pilot and see direct benefits for our patients and their families, as well as the entire community."" If the pilot success is seen early, the government will consider expanding this approach to other hospitals and long-term care homes in the province.

Quick Facts

In June 2020, 51 per cent of alternate level of care patients in Ontario hospitals were waiting to be discharged to long-term care.
Often, patients no longer need hospital services, but remain in hospital because their health status prevents them from going home, and there is no space in long-term care for them. These patients are known as alternate level of care, or ALC, patients.

Ontario Eliminating the Practice of Birth Alerts
An important step in creating a child welfare system focused on prevention and early intervention

July 14, 2020 10:30 A.M.

Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services


TORONTO — Today, Jill Dunlop, Associate Minister of Children and Women's Issues, announced the province is eliminating the practice of birth alerts. Birth alerts are notifications sent by children's aid societies to hospitals when they believe a newborn may be in need of protection. This new approach will improve pre- and post-natal services by promoting collaboration between children's aid societies, hospitals, service providers, Indigenous partners and community-based service providers.
""Ending the use of birth alerts is an important step as we shift our focus to prevention, early intervention and improve outcomes for families and their children,"" said Minister Dunlop. ""This change is part of our government's effort to build a child welfare system that is better coordinated and focused on community-based prevention services that are high quality, culturally appropriate and truly responsive to the needs of children, youth and families."" It has been reported the practice of birth alerts disproportionately affects racialized and marginalized mothers and families. Expectant mothers can be deterred from seeking prenatal care or parenting supports while pregnant due to fears of having a birth alert issued. Birth alerts have never been required under provincial legislation and have been used inconsistently by children's aid societies across the province. Going forward, the government is directing children's aid societies to end the practice of using birth alerts by October 15, 2020. This means working with families, community partners and service providers to create a pre- and post-natal plan that supports the parents of newborns, to ensure more families stay together. ""By ending the use of birth alerts and encouraging collaborative alternatives for children's aid societies and other health care providers, expectant parents will be better supported in accessing community resources before the birth of their child,"" said Jamil Jivani, Ontario's Advocate for Community Opportunities. ""This is a step in the right direction in helping racialized and marginalized communities across Ontario.""

Quick Facts

Ending the use of birth alerts was a recommendation from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. 
Alternative approaches to birth alerts include providing counselling services such as birth planning services, pre-natal services and referrals to community resources and agencies that can provide support to expectant parents.
Birth alerts are also referred to as hospital alerts.
The government is undertaking an extensive review of the child welfare system, including the overrepresentation of Black, Indigenous and racialized children and youth.

Government moves to modernize Ontario Energy Board

July 14, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines


TORONTO - The Ontario government is modernizing the Ontario Energy Board (OEB) in order to strengthen trust and transparency of Ontario's energy sector and improve regulatory processes for the benefit of provincial ratepayers. As part of this process, the province is recommending the appointment of a new leadership team which includes Susanna Zagar as the OEB's new Chief Executive Officer and Lynne Anderson as the OEB's new Chief Commissioner. This new governance structure would come into effect upon proclamation of the amendments under Schedule 2 of the Fixing the Hydro Mess Act, 2019 in Fall 2020.
""I look forward to working together with these experienced leaders as we renew and modernize the OEB,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines. ""Strong leadership will help the OEB better serve individuals and families, allow the provincial regulator to operate more effectively and efficiently, and help ensure that Ontario's energy system remains sustainable and reliable, as was envisioned in the OEB Review Panel."" The restructuring of the OEB is a part of the government's ongoing commitment to improve energy sector regulation for the benefit of Ontario ratepayers. This includes pursuing greater efficiencies, reducing regulatory burden, and enhancing transparency and accountability.  Ms. Zagar spent 10 years as the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board's Chief Strategy, Analytics & People Officer. An experienced public servant, Ms. Zagar has also held executive-level roles at the Ontario Ministry of Infrastructure and the Ontario Ministry of Labour. If her appointment as Chief Executive Officer is approved, Ms. Zagar would provide leadership over the OEB's operations and policy work.  Ms. Anderson has extensive experience at the OEB and was most recently a full-time OEB Board Member. She also served as the OEB's Vice President of Applications for nearly seven years. Ms. Anderson previously served as Hydro Ottawa's Chief Regulatory Affairs and Government Relations Officer. If her appointment as Chief Commissioner is approved, Ms. Anderson would be responsible for the OEB's adjudicative function and will establish panels of Commissioners to preside over rate, facility, utility consolidation and other applications and enforcement matters. The government also intends to make the following initial appointments to the OEB under the new governance structure:  John Knubley (Board of Directors) - Current president of InnovAction Advisory Services Inc. and a former Deputy Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada. Gerald Moncrief (Board of Directors) - Previous owner and president/vice president of Moncrief Construction Limited. Glenn O'Farrell (Board of Directors) - Currently the CEO at the Ombudservice for Life & Health Insurance. Previously, he served as CEO at Groupe Média TFO, Canadian Association of Broadcasters and Global Television Network Québec. Marie Oswald (Board of Directors) - Previously served as Director and Chair of the Board at Oakville Enterprises Corporation and Oakville Hydro Electricity Distribution Inc., following a career in legal and compliance leadership in the financial services industry. Allison Duff (Commissioner) - A former OEB Member with previous experience as a business consultant.  Finally, the government has reappointed a number of current OEB Members who will become Commissioners once the new governance structure comes into effect.

Quick Facts

The OEB is the province’s independent energy regulator. Its responsibilities include setting just and reasonable rates for some electricity bill components and setting rules for energy companies operating in Ontario.
Modernizing the OEB was a key commitment under Bill 87, Fixing the Hydro Mess Act, 2019.
Amendments under Schedule 2 of the Fixing the Hydro Mess Act, 2019, once in force, will reform the OEB's governance structure to strengthen the independence of the adjudicative function of the OEB and provide clear accountability within the organization.
On January 31, 2020, the Ontario Government appointed Richard Dicerni to take on the Chair of the OEB under the new governance structure. Mr. Dicerni's appointment was approved by the Lieutenant Governor in Council on February 20, 2020.
Once the new governance structure is in place, the Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines will provide the OEB with a mandate letter outlining the government's vision for a modernized OEB.

Public Gatherings Will Increase in Size as the Province Continues its Path to Economic Recovery

July 13, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government announced nearly all businesses and public spaces will reopen in Stage 3 of the province's reopening framework with public health and workplace safety measures and restrictions in place. As Ontario continues down the path to economic recovery, decisions on which regions will enter Stage 3 and when will be made in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health and other health experts and based on trends of key public health indicators.
Details on the Stage 3 reopening framework were provided by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance, and Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education. ""Our success in reducing the spread of COVID-19 and getting Ontario to a place where we are ready to reopen most of the province is a testament to the hard work of business owners, individuals and families right across the province,"" said Premier Ford. ""So many have stepped up and played by the rules, demonstrating that we can restart our economy safely and responsibly. Small actions can make a big difference. Now more than ever, we must continue to follow the public health advice to preserve the progress we have made together."" As part of the Stage 3 reopening, Ontario will be increasing gathering limits for those regions entering the next stage to the following: Indoor gathering limits will increase to a maximum of 50 people;Outdoor gathering limits will increase to a maximum of 100 people;Gathering limits are subject to physical distancing requirements.Public gathering limits apply to indoor and outdoor events, such as community events or gatherings, concerts, live shows, festivals, conferences, sports and recreational fitness activities, fundraisers, fairs, festivals or open houses. A two metre distance must still be maintained at such events. Regions remaining in Stage 2 will maintain the existing gathering limit of 10. Social circles in all stages at this point will also be kept to a maximum of 10 people province-wide, regardless of stage. The Chief Medical Officer of Health, public health experts and other officials have advised the following, high-risk places and activities are not yet safe to open, even if a region has entered Stage 3, due to the likelihood of large crowds congregating, difficulties with physical distancing, or challenges maintaining the proper cleaning and sanitation required to prevent the spread of COVID‑19: Amusement parks and water parks;Buffet-style food services;Dancing at restaurants and bars, other than by performers hired by the establishment following specific requirements;Overnight stays at camps for children;Private karaoke rooms;Prolonged or deliberate contact while playing sports;Saunas, steam rooms, bath houses and oxygen bars;Table games at casinos and gaming establishments.For more information on the restrictions that will remain in place during Stage 3, as well as the public health guidance necessary to keep the people of Ontario safe, visit Ontario.ca/reopen. The province is committed to working closely and collaboratively with businesses and sectors not yet able to reopen or who are experiencing significant challenges for reopening due to Stage 3 restrictions. These businesses can visit Ontario.ca/reopen to work with the government on a reopening proposal that will enable them to safely resume or increase operations. Government and public health officials will review proposals and contact businesses for feedback or clarifications. ""With almost all businesses and services able to resume operations, Stage 3 is a major step forward in our plan to reopen the province,"" said Minister Phillips. ""We have to keep treating each other with respect and acting responsibly to keep up the progress in our fight against COVID-19. Our government will continue working with our partners across Ontario to rebuild our economy so that our province is a place of economic strength and prosperity for every person and family."" The following public health unit regions will be allowed to move into Stage 3 first, on Friday, July 17, 2020: Algoma Public HealthBrant County Health UnitChatham-Kent Public HealthEastern Ontario Health UnitGrey Bruce Health UnitHaliburton, Kawartha, Pine Ridge District Health UnitHastings Prince Edward Public HealthHuron Perth Public HealthKingston, Frontenac and Lennox & Addington Public HealthLeeds Grenville & Lanark District Health UnitMiddlesex-London Health UnitNorth Bay Parry Sound District Health UnitNorthwestern Health UnitOttawa Public HealthPeterborough Public HealthPorcupine Health UnitPublic Health Sudbury & DistrictsRegion of Waterloo Public Health and Emergency ServicesRenfrew County and District Health UnitSimcoe-Muskoka District Health UnitSouthwestern Public HealthThunder Bay District Health UnitTimiskaming Health UnitWellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public HealthBusinesses and municipalities will be permitted to enter Stage 3 based on their region and, as in the previous stages, may choose to take more time before reopening. For a list of regions that will remain in Stage 2, visit Ontario.ca/reopen. At the beginning of each week, the province will continue to reassess local trends in public health indicators, including rates of transmission, hospital capacity, progress on testing and contact tracing, to determine if additional public health unit regions can progress to Stage 3. The Chief Medical Officer of Health and other public health experts will continue to closely monitor the evolving situation to advise when public health restrictions can be further loosened or if they need to be tightened or reapplied. ""Having seen a decline in the number of new COVID-19 cases as the province safely re-started over 90 per cent of economic activity with Stage 2, we now have the confidence to move certain regions into Stage 3, including expanding the size of gatherings indoors and outdoors,"" said Minister Elliott. ""As we do, it's never been more important for all Ontarians to continue to practise physical distancing and wear a face covering when doing so is a challenge, such as safely visiting a favourite local store. Together, we'll continue to move Ontario forward."" As the province safely and gradually enters Stage 3, child care centres and home child care providers across Ontario will be able to continue to operate with strict safety and operational requirements in place. Beginning on July 27, 2020, child care centres will be permitted to operate with cohorts of 15 children, which is an increase from the current cohort cap of 10. This change will allow parents to return to work, and bring the child care sector to approximately 90 per cent of its operating capacity before the COVID-19 outbreak. ""Providing child care for parents is critical so that, as more Ontarians return to work, they can do so with confidence in knowing that their children are being safely cared for,"" said Minister Lecce. ""Child care is an integral enabler to the continued restart of Ontario's economy, and we remain committed to working to ensure child care remains accessible, affordable and, most importantly, safe as we gradually increase capacity of Ontario's child care sector."" The government, in partnership with health and safety associations, has released over 170 guidance resources at Ontario.ca/COVIDsafety to help employers in multiple sectors ― including fitness, restaurant and food services, and the performing arts ― keep spaces safe for workers and customers. Guidance will be available for all spaces permitted to open in Stage 3. As they prepare to reopen, employers are strongly advised to review and implement appropriate measures to help protect their communities. ""As we enter Stage 3 and continue on the path to economic recovery, it is more important than ever that we support business owners and workers,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""That is why we launched the Workplace PPE Supplier Directory to provide businesses with information on personal protective equipment suppliers so they can keep their employees, customers and clients safe as they resume their operations. By continuing to work together, we will ensure Ontario is prepared and well-supplied for any future challenges.""

BARRIE — The safety and well-being of Canadians are top priorities of the governments of Canada and Ontario. But the COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than Canadians' personal health, it is also having a profound impact on the economy.
That is why governments have been taking decisive action to support families, businesses and communities, and continue to look ahead to see what more can be done. Strategic investments in public transportation infrastructure play a key role in supporting Ontarians getting to work, school and essential services on time, and safely back home at the end of the day. Today, the Honourable Mary Ng, Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade, and Member of Parliament for Markham, on behalf of the Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities; the Honourable Doug Downey, Member of Provincial Parliament for Barrie-Springwater-Oro-Medonte and Ontario's Attorney General, on behalf of the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure; and Jeff Lehman, Mayor of the City of Barrie, announced funding for five projects that will modernize and improve Barrie Transit. Residents who use public transit will benefit from the replacement of the City of Barrie's retiring bus fleet with 30 new, low-floor, accessible buses. In addition, transit users with accessibility needs will benefit from the purchase of 21 new fully accessible, paratransit city buses which will replace the existing fleet over the next seven years. A new transit hub at the Allandale GO Station and a new connection hub downtown will offer transit users a better connected and more integrated public transit system. More bus stops and platforms, as well as additional bicycle parking, will make it easier for residents to access the public transit system.  The Government of Canada is investing more than $16.4 million in these projects through the Public Transit Infrastructure Stream (PTIS) of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Ontario is providing more than $13.6 million, while the City of Barrie's contribution is more than $10.9 million.

Indigenous community to receive $14.1 million settlement

July 13, 2020  9:00 A.M.

Ministry of Indigenous Affairs


THUNDER BAY — The Ontario government announced today the final settlement of a 115 year old land claim that addresses the shortfall of land received by Flying Post First Nation, as part of the James Bay Treaty (Treaty #9) that was originally signed in 1905. The $14.1 million settlement will contribute to the future economic prosperity of the First Nation.
""I'm pleased that Ontario is fulfilling its outstanding obligation to Flying Post First Nation, dating back more than a century,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Indigenous Affairs. ""Settling land claims through co-operative negotiations and respectful dialogue is a key step towards reconciliation with Indigenous people."" The Flying Post First Nation reserve lands are located near Timmins along the Ground Hog River, however, today the majority of its members live near Nipigon. ""This is an important moment,"" said Chief Murray Ray of Flying Post First Nation. ""Flying Post First Nation and the province of Ontario have taken the proper steps to right an historic wrong for a loss that is almost 115 years old. We had a successful ratification on December 2, 2019 and are confident it will contribute to our economic and social development. We are proud of all our members of voting age who cast their ballot in favour of this settlement."" The settlement was approved by the First Nation members in a vote in December 2019, with 100% of those who voted in favour of the agreement.

Province Supports Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters Launch of “Ontario Made” Program

July 10, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


VAUGHAN — As the province safely and gradually reopens, Ontario is starting down the road to growth, renewal and economic recovery. That's why the Ontario government is proud to support the launch of the Ontario Made program from Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters (CME). This new program will promote the many world-class goods that are made across the province by helping consumers easily identify, access and purchase local products.
Details were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, and Dennis Darby, President and CEO of Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters, at Artistic Skylight in Vaughan, Ontario. ""Ontario has always been Canada's workshop, and our products are recognized as the gold standard across the country and around the world,"" said Premier Ford. ""Our government is proud to support Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters' Ontario Made program. Promoting locally made products will be essential to building a strong, self-sufficient province and key to our economic recovery."" Funding for Ontario Made is made possible through the $50 million Ontario Together Fund launched on April 1, 2020. This funding will be used to help retailers and consumers identify local products by: Creating a new Ontario Made logo that manufacturers can use to help consumers identify their made-in-Ontario products. CME will also meet with major retailers to promote Ontario Made products in-store and increase visibility for customers;Launching a new SupportOntarioMade.ca website that will connect consumers and supply chain partners to manufacturers of made-in-Ontario products through one directory;Promoting Ontario Made through a digital newsletter to raise awareness of Ontario goods and products online and through social media.""Over the past few months, plants and factories across the province retooled their operations to provide the front lines with the essential equipment needed in the fight against COVID-19, including PPE,"" said Minister Fedeli. ""As the province reopens and the economy recovers, it is now more important than ever to support and promote Ontario's world-class manufacturing sector and get people back to work. By supporting Ontario manufacturing, consumers are buying quality, locally made products."" In March, the government launched the Ontario Together web portal to encourage companies to submit innovative ideas and ways to provide medical supplies, PPE and other essential equipment. To date, more than 27,000 submissions have been received since the launch of the web portal and 18,000 leads have been converted into more than $658 million in purchases of emergency supplies. In April, the government launched the $50 million Ontario Together Fund to support the development of proposals submitted by businesses and individuals through the Ontario Together web portal and help businesses retool their operations or deliver innovative solutions in response to COVID-19. ""Ontario manufacturers have a long and proud history of making some of the most innovative products in the world. As consumers increasingly want to buy local, it's important that we help them make informed decisions and find local manufacturers,"" said Mr. Darby. ""We want to encourage Ontario manufacturers to proudly wave the flag by labeling their products and buying local where possible. Ontario Made will help raise awareness of what is manufactured right here by our neighbours, friends, and families and support local manufacturing.""

Quick Facts

The Ontario government is investing $500,000 from the Ontario Together Fund into the Ontario Made program.

CME is a national organization with significant membership in Ontario and across Canada, representing over 30 sector manufacturing associations.

Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade


TORONTO - Today, Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, issued the following statement on Statistics Canada's monthly employment release:
""Today's employment numbers are an indication that Ontario's economy is beginning to stabilize as we continue to safely and gradually reopen the province. According to Statistics Canada, employment in Ontario increased by 377,900 in June, including an increase of 66,200 manufacturing jobs. But the job numbers are much more than a statistic, they represent, families, business owners and workers back at work and contributing to Ontario's economic recovery. Earlier this week, we introduced the COVID-19 Economic Recovery Act. This legislation is the first step in our made-in-Ontario plan for growth, renewal and economic recovery. If passed, this bill will help get shovels in the ground faster on key infrastructure projects, lead to the creation of more jobs and investment, and cut red tape to help businesses adapt to the new environment. As we look towards Stage 3 of reopening, we know we have a solid foundation upon which to continue building our future and emerge stronger than ever. Our government is committed to working in partnership with people, businesses and municipalities across Ontario to respond to the challenges they face so we can create jobs and continue to support the economic health and prosperity of every region of the province."" Our government intends to stand shoulder to shoulder with those who are struggling as a result of this global pandemic. That also means supporting and promoting everything local. Made in Ontario means built in Ontario, it means hope for businesses and workers. It means asking consumers to support Ontario manufacturers and businesses by purchasing local products, because you will not only be buying quality, but supporting your friends, neighbours and local communities during one of the darkest periods in our province's history.""

Governments increase support for eligible farmers experiencing labour challenges during COVID-19

July  9, 2020  3:30 P.M.

Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs


WOODSTOCK — The governments of Canada and Ontario are providing the best support possible to help farmers manage challenges beyond their control by enhancing AgriInsurance coverage for the 2020 growing season to include labour shortages due to COVID-19.
Ontario's agriculture industry, specifically farms growing fruits and vegetables like tomatoes, melons and peaches, are labour intensive and highly dependent on seasonal agricultural workers. COVID-19 has interrupted regular flows of worker travel and has resulted in some gaps in labour availability. This could result in some crops being unharvested and financial loss for the agri-food industry. The federal government made a commitment on May 5th to work with the provinces and territories to explore possibilities for expanding the AgriInsurance program to include labour shortages as an eligible risk for the horticulture sector. This work with provincial and territorial partners would insure against lost production due to an insufficient workforce, should producers be unable to find enough labour to harvest. ""During these exceptional times, we fully appreciate just how essential our agri-food workers are to our entire food supply chain,"" said the Honourable Marie-Claude Bibeau, federal Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. ""Our Government has been working hard with the provinces and agri-food businesses to ensure those workers have a safe workplace so they can continue putting food on our tables. I congratulate Ontario for being the first province to take this important step that recognizes the hardships Ontario farmers and food producers have faced because of worker shortages, and gives them the added support they need.""  ""We recognize that this terrible virus has created new business pressures and increased uncertainty for farmers, which is why we are taking action to ensure farmers have the resources they need to address today's challenges,"" said Ernie Hardeman, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. ""By enhancing AgriInsurance coverage to include labour shortages due to COVID-19 for eligible farmers, we are directly responding to their requests for support and protecting Ontario's agri-food sector so it can continue producing the food our province needs."" Ontario farmers already enrolled in an eligible production insurance plan who suffer from crop losses due to labour disruptions during the 2020 growing season will have access to further insurance coverage through Agricorp. The added insurance coverage will include:  Inability to attract sufficient on-farm labour due to COVID-19; andIllness or quarantine of on-farm labour and the producer due to COVID-19. Farmers will be expected to notify Agricorp as soon as possible if they experience COVID-19 related labour disruptions that are having an impact on their crops.  ""This announcement is an important first step towards giving growers assurances that their government will have their backs during the pandemic,"" said Bill George, Chair of the Ontario Fruit and Vegetable Growers' Association. ""We thank Minister Bibeau for making this enhanced coverage possible, and we thank Minister Hardeman and the Ford government for its leadership, and for being the first province in Canada to take this step."" Business Risk Management programs, including AgriInsurance, protect producers against significant risks that threaten the viability of their farm and are beyond their capacity to manage, such as weather, disease and pests. It is a business risk management program under the Canadian Agricultural Partnership, a five-year, $3-billion commitment by Canada's federal, provincial and territorial governments to support Canada's agri-food and agri-products sectors.

Ontario Seeking Input on Modernizing Capital Markets
Taskforce Aims to Help Strengthen Competition and Innovation

July  9, 2020  2:00 P.M.

Ministry of Finance


TORONTO — The Ontario government is continuing to seek advice and input from people and organizations on modernizing Ontario's Capital Markets and supporting economic growth and job creation with the posting of the Capital Markets Modernization Taskforce initial consultation report.
""As we plan for Ontario's economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic, competitive capital markets can play an important role attracting global investment and creating good jobs here in our province,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. ""Despite rapid changes in the global economy, the Ontario Securities Act has not been updated in over 15 years. More than ever, Ontario needs a modern capital markets system that attracts businesses and competes for investment and talent worldwide. I created the Taskforce with this goal in mind. I appreciate that they put forward an ambitious and creative set of initial recommendations for consultation."" Over the last few months, the Taskforce listened to over 110 stakeholders about the challenges they face, including financial institutions, small and large publicly-listed companies, independent investment dealers, industry associations, law firms and investor advocacy groups. The Capital Markets Modernization Taskforce consultation report outlines their findings and more than 47 policy proposals to modernize the province's capital markets. ""Industry members have been asking for a regulatory approach that supplements the policing function with a public policy imperative of capital markets growth to enable Ontario to compete globally. Responding to this feedback, we are now asking for input to help make sure our final recommendations to government support our mandate to make Ontario one of the most attractive capital markets in the world,"" said Walied Soliman, Chair of the Capital Markets Modernization Taskforce. ""On behalf of the Taskforce, I'd like to thank the diverse group of over 100 business leaders, investors, associations, and investor advocacy groups for their thoughtful contributions and participation in this consequential work. I would also like to thank my Taskforce colleagues for their tireless efforts over the past six months."" The Capital Markets Modernization Taskforce will provide recommendations to the Minister of Finance on how to transform the regulatory landscape for capital markets. Following this consultation, a final report will be submitted to the Minister before the end of the year. The consultation will end on September 7, 2020. Read the consultation report and submit your ideas at Ontario.ca/CapitalMarkets.

Ontario Taking Bold Action to Address Racism and Inequity in Schools


July  9, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


The Ontario government is taking bold action to break down systemic barriers in schools and establish discrimination-free classrooms to ensure every student is set up for life-long success. 
Suspensions Through Bill 197, COVID-19 Economic Recovery Act, 2020, the government is proposing to eliminate discretionary suspensions for students from kindergarten up to Grade 3, beginning September 2020. Serious offences will still be subject to mandatory suspensions. The latest suspension data in 2018-19 shows that over 65,000 elementary and secondary students were suspended. Students with special education needs made up almost half of all those suspended that year. About 10 per cent (6,395) of suspended students were among the youngest learners, in kindergarten to Grade 3. In addition, 40 per cent of suspensions in those early years were issued for undefined reasons, meaning it is not known why the youngest learners in schools are suspended. Furthermore, there is over-representation of students from historically underserved and racialized communities in suspension data, including: In Ontario's two largest school boards (Toronto District School Board and Peel District School Board), Black students make up 11 per cent and 10 per cent of the student population but represent over 34 per cent and 22 per cent of students receiving suspensions, respectively.Streaming As of September 2021, the government will begin the process of ending Grade 9 streaming into applied and academic courses. Currently, students enrolled in applied-level courses have multiple negative outcomes and limited opportunities for post-secondary advancement. This includes: Students enrolled in applied courses are over four times more likely to not graduate;33 per cent of students who took the Grade 9 applied  courses transitioned directly into college or university, compared to 73 per cent of students who took the academic courses;Over 13 per cent of students in applied courses live in low-income households, compared to just over seven per cent in academic courses; and,50 per cent of students enrolled in applied courses feel they do not belong at schoolDiscrimination-Free Classroom There is clear research-informed evidence that when schools have staff that reflect the social identities of their students, there are immediate and long-term positive impacts on student achievement. The Ministry of Education is exploring increased opportunities for boards to hire educators that reflect their classrooms and ensure that there is a consistently high standard of merit and diversity in those who are teaching Ontario's students. The government will take immediate action, including working with the Ontario College of Teachers to publish a Professional Advisory for members. This will be accompanied by a Policy/Program Memorandum (PPM) to school boards to reinforce the Professional Advisory, and to provide guidance in dealing with behaviour or remarks of a racist nature. It is expected that, as the government consults with key partners in addressing anti-Black racism and discrimination, this PPM will serve as an interim method of ensuring school boards have clear direction on how to immediately respond to incidences and allegations of racism and discrimination. To further strengthen the expectations of educators, staff, and school boards, the government may  explore amendments to the Ontario College of Teacher's Act to ensure there are clear, transparent, and effective accountability and recourse measures in rapidly responding to instances and allegations of anti-Black racism and discrimination. The ministry has also proposed additional anti-racism and anti-discrimination training before the end of the calendar year. The government is currently consulting with teachers' federations, education workers' unions, and trustees' associations on the implementation of this critical initiative. The ministry will also continue to work with the Anti-Racism Directorate (ARD) to establish additional anti-racism initiatives in the education system that are grounded in evidence and research. Demographic Data While there is existing data that boards and the Ministry rely on for understanding the demographics and achievement of students and staff, boards currently have limited and varying capacity to apply a demographic lens to their data. The collection of this student and staff identity data will be implemented immediately. Boards will have until the beginning of the 2023 calendar year to ensure that they are aligned with province-wide data collection efforts.

New Changes to Advance Equal Opportunity for Black, Indigenous and Racialized Students

July  9, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government announced bold new changes to the education system that will help break down barriers for Black, Indigenous and racialized students and provide all students with an equal opportunity to succeed. As part of this action, the province will move forward with ending Grade 9 streaming into applied and academic courses, proposing to eliminate discretionary suspensions for students, strengthening sanctions for teachers who engage in behaviour of a racist nature, and providing teachers with additional anti-racism and anti-discrimination training.
Details were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education, and Jamil Jivani, Ontario's Advocate for Community Opportunities. ""To help our young people reach their full potential, we have to start earlier to create equal opportunity for them, whether that's reforming suspensions for primary grades or ending the practice of streaming for Grade 9 students,"" said Premier Ford. ""Above all, our government will not tolerate racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, Islamophobia or hate in any form in our schools. Through these initiatives to promote equality in education, we will ensure students from all walks of life are set up for lifelong success."" Through Bill 197, COVID-19 Economic Recovery Act, 2020, the government is proposing to eliminate discretionary suspensions for students from kindergarten up to Grade 3, beginning September 2020. Serious offences will still be subject to mandatory suspensions. The latest suspension data from 2018-19 shows that over 65,000 elementary and secondary students in Ontario were suspended during that school year. Starting in September 2021, the government will begin the process of ending Grade 9 streaming into applied and academic courses. Currently, students enrolled in applied-level courses have multiple negative outcomes and limited opportunities for post-secondary advancement. ""Every student ― irrespective of the colour of their skin, faith, heritage, and orientation ― deserves every opportunity to succeed in the classroom,"" said Minister Lecce. ""The transformational change we are driving forward will embolden a generation of students and unleash their full potential, absent the systemic barriers that hold them back. To racialized students in Ontario: we see you, and we value you. We will stand with all students on this journey to advance respect, dignity, and opportunity."" As part of its plan to end early streaming, the government will introduce a new foundational Grade 9 math course for September 2021 and will work with school boards as they transition students into a de-streamed Grade 9 math program. The de-streaming of the Grade 9 math curriculum is the first step towards further de-streaming in other curriculum areas, which will better support all students in having every opportunity to pursue the pathway of their choice after their K-12 education. ""We must recognize that today's changes are the result of our government and community members working together,"" said Jamil Jivani, Ontario's Advocate for Community Opportunities. ""In particular, parents in Ontario's Black communities have been a powerful voice for change, providing their unique insights in how suspensions and streaming have disadvantaged black students. Thank you to every parent and community leader who engaged with us in this process."" To ensure students feel accepted in a discrimination-free classroom, the government will be strengthening sanctions for teachers who engage in behaviour of a racist nature. Over the last 23 years, the Ontario College of Teachers reports that there have been 32 instances of teacher discipline for racist or homophobic behavior or remarks. The Ministry of Education has also proposed additional anti-racism and anti-discrimination training before the end of the calendar year. The government is currently consulting with teachers' federations, education workers' unions, and trustees' associations on the implementation of this critical initiative.

Quick Facts

Through the Grants for Student Needs program (GSN), the Ministry of Education is providing a projected $40.9 million to help school boards implement suspension policies, including the hiring of professional staff and implementing prevention and intervention activities and programs. School boards will use this record-high allocation to support the implementation of the new suspension policies. 
School boards can use portions of their $10 million in new mental health funding to provide students, educators, and staff with the resources and training needed to implement the new suspension policies.
The government has committed to providing $3.5 million to support the Black and Indigenous grad coach programs, which provide wrap-around supports for students who are at risk of not graduating.
On June 4, 2020, the government launched the Premier’s Council on Equality of Opportunity, a new advisory group that will provide advice on how young people can overcome social and economic barriers and achieve success.

In accordance with the Anti-Racism Act and Anti-Racism Data Standards, all school boards in Ontario will be required to collect race-based data by January 1, 2023.

Application intake for broadband and cellular program opens today

July  9, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Ministry of Infrastructure


The Ontario government is expanding access to reliable broadband and cellular service in underserved and unserved parts of the province. The application intake for the $150 million Improving Connectivity for Ontario program (ICON) opens today. This funding will help drive economic investment and job creation across the province, while allowing more people to work from home more efficiently, engage in online learning, and connect with family and friends.
""The outbreak of COVID-19 reinforced the need to improve access to reliable broadband and cellular service as more people work and learn from home in order to practice physical distancing,"" said Laurie Scott, Minister of Infrastructure. ""By making these investments we will help to ensure every region in the province can participate in the modern digital economy, and contribute to Ontario's economic recovery.""     Any areas across Ontario that do not meet the national standards for broadband speeds would be eligible for provincial funding. Up to 12 per cent of households in the province - mostly in rural, remote or northern areas - don't have adequate broadband service, according to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. Telecommunication service providers, municipalities, Indigenous communities and non-profits are invited to submit innovative proposals and lend their investment, expertise and experience to improve connectivity in communities across Ontario. The preliminary application deadline for the first intake of the ICON program is August 21, 2020. The province's investment of $150 million announced today is part of the $315 million Up to Speed: Ontario's Broadband and Cellular Action Plan. This action plan has the potential to leverage up to $1 billion in partner funding for broadband infrastructure investments. 

Quick Facts

On June 3, 2020, Ontario announced the ICON program, a multi-year plan which aims to support approved projects as early as 2021. 
National standards for adequate broadband service are defined by speeds known as 50/10 (50 megabits per second download, and 10 megabits for upload).
Over the past several months, Ontario has partnered with the Eastern Ontario Regional Network (EORN) to leverage $213 million to improve cellular access in eastern Ontario.
The Province is investing in the $190 million Southwestern Integrated Fibre Technology (SWIFT) project to bring high-speed broadband to 50,000 more homes and businesses across Southwestern Ontario.
Ontario has invested in initiatives to improve connectivity in Northern Ontario, such as a project that will connect five remote Matawa First Nations communities, seven broadband projects that will support rural and Indigenous communities, and the Next Generation Network Program.

Ontario Extends Emergency Orders 
Province Maintains Flexibility to Protect Public Health as Economy Gradually Reopens 

July  9, 2020  7:00 A.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government, in consultation with Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, has extended all emergency orders currently in force that were made under s.7.0.2(4) of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act to July 22, 2020. The extension was made to ensure the province maintains the necessary flexibility to protect public health and safety as more businesses reopen and people go back to work.
The extension of the emergency orders will help protect vulnerable people, such as seniors, by allowing the redeployment of frontline staff in long-term care facilities, retirement homes and other congregate care settings, like women's shelters and residential services. In addition, the extension would allow public health units to redeploy or hire staff to support case management and contact tracing. ""Our government is getting Ontario back on track and more people back to work, but at the same time taking steps to ensure we don't undo the tremendous progress we have made together,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""By keeping these emergency measures in place, we will continue to support our frontline care providers, protect our most vulnerable, and ensure we can rapidly respond to potential outbreaks or surges."" The government intends to extend emergency orders to align with the Reopening Ontario (A Flexible Response to COVID-19) Act, 2020, if passed. This proposed legislation is part of the government's plan to cautiously reopen Ontario in a way that recognizes the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 even after the provincial declaration of emergency has ended. The bill, if passed, would allow Ontario to continue its path to recovery by easing restrictions where appropriate, while maintaining important select tools to address the ongoing threat of this deadly virus and protect Ontarians. A full list of emergency orders can be found on the e-Laws website under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act and at Ontario.ca/alert.

Quick Facts

The Government of Ontario declared a provincial emergency on March 17, 2020 under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act. The declaration of emergency was extended and is currently in effect until July 15, 2020.
The government brought forward a motion in the Ontario legislature that, if passed, would extend the provincial declaration of emergency until July 24, 2020.

Ontario Starting Down the Path to Growth, Renewal and Economic Recovery


July  8, 2020  2:15 P.M.

Office of the Premier


The COVID-19 outbreak has touched all Ontarians. It has created significant hardship for individuals, families and businesses and they need help to bounce back from the serious health and economic impacts. 
In response, Ontario has introduced the COVID-19 Economic Recovery Act, 2020, part of a made-in-Ontario plan to help boost the province's economic recovery, create thousands of jobs, put more opportunities within reach of businesses, get infrastructure projects built faster, and improve the quality of life in every community across the province. Restarting Jobs and Development Building Code Act The Ontario government is making it easier and faster to update the Building Code. The proposed changes will allow the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing to make regulations that will streamline the Building Code development process, align it with National Construction Codes and enable Ontario to respond faster to construction sector needs. This will reduce inter-provincial trade barriers, make Ontario more competitive and support economic growth. Drainage Act The Ontario government is working with the farm and food sector to reduce regulatory burden, while preserving the environmental rules that help to keep Ontarians safe and healthy. Streamlining administrative processes under the Drainage Act would encourage innovation in drainage practices, help to prevent flooding, and reduce costs for farmers, rural landowners and municipalities. Reducing Delays for Environmental Infrastructure Projects The Ontario government is making environmental approvals for wastewater and stormwater infrastructure work better for communities. It is proposing improvements to its Environmental Compliance Approval process providing a single, consolidated approval process for low-impact municipal sewage collection and stormwater management projects. This proposed approach would mean that simple, routine changes by municipalities — including alterations, extensions, enlargements or replacement projects — could be pre-authorized to begin construction without needing separate approvals for each project. The new process would ensure municipalities would be able to build this critical infrastructure faster, eliminating costly construction delays while maintaining strong environmental protections. Environmental Assessment Act The Ontario government is updating the almost 50-year old environmental assessment program to build a modern, practical process that supports strong environmental oversight and a strong economy. Building on our enhancements over the past year, the government is proposing changes to the Environmental Assessment Act that will improve the environmental assessment program. The changes would allow us to focus resources on projects that have the highest impact on the environment, reduce timelines by half from 6 to 3 years for the largest projects, and match the level of assessment requirements with the level of environmental impact so critical infrastructure projects can get off the ground without undue delay. Farm Registration and Farm Organizations Funding Act By introducing an appeal process under the Farm Business Registration Program, The Ontario government can deliver a less expensive, faster and less cumbersome appeal process for Ontario farmers. If passed, applicants could appeal a decision through the Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs Appeal Tribunal, rather than through the courts. We are also clarifying the renewal process for eligibility for funding to provide greater consistency and fairness in the treatment of farm organizations. Planning Act Proposed updates will reduce red tape and speed up transitconstruction, the development of affordable housing and construction projects that are not in the Greenbelt. When making a zoning order, the proposed changes will give the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing additional authority to apply inclusionary zoning (so that new developments may include affordable housing) and address site plan matters, such as the exterior design of buildings, landscaping and pedestrian and vehicle access. Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing Act The Ontario government is proposing changes to permanently establish the Office of the Provincial Land and Development Facilitator and give the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing the authority to appoint the Facilitator. The Facilitator will continue to provide advice and make recommendations to the Minister on growth and land-use planning matters - helping to ensure that complicated and long-standing land-use planning disputes are resolved quickly across the province. Occupational Health and Safety Act As part of the government's commitment to keeping workers safe, an amendment to the Occupational Health and Safety Act will allow nationally and internationally recognized standards to be updated more regularly. These standards set workplace safety expectations for everything from protective clothing to equipment, and they are established by organizations such as Canadian Standards Association Group (CSA). Updating standards without requiring regulatory amendments will allow employers and workers access to more current information on workplace standards. Invest Ontario As the province continues to reopen and the economy recovers, it's more critical than ever to position Ontario as a top tier destination for investment, domestic growth, and job creation. A key measure to support this objective is the creation of a new investment attraction agency, Invest Ontario. Invest Ontario will promote the province as a key investment destination, making Ontario more competitive while sending a strong signal to investors that the province is open for business. It will be a ""one stop shop"" for businesses and investors. It will move at the speed of business and drive greater economic growth, support strategic domestic firms and attract business from around the world to create good jobs in Ontario. It will initially focus on three important sectors for COVID-19 recovery where Ontario has a globally competitive advantage: advanced manufacturing, life sciences, and technology. Invest Ontario will include greater business development and deal structuring expertise and build on the many benefits of investing in Ontario, including: a good quality of life, a highly skilled talent pool, a strong and growing innovation sector, and a pro-job creation jurisdiction that can help businesses thrive. Reducing Regulatory Costs to Business Act, Burden Reduction Reporting Act and Modernizing Ontario for People and Businesses Act The Ontario government is committed to business recovery and job creation, which is why it is taking urgent action to modernize how it operates. The province is proposing to merge the Reducing Regulatory Costs for Business Act, 2017 with the Burden Reduction Reporting Act so that all burden reduction requirements would now be in a single law - the Modernizing Ontario for People and Businesses Act. This new act would enshrine the government's seven burden reduction principles into legislation, so that businesses can count on clear, focused and effective rules that maintain or enhance protections for people's health, safety, and the environment. These proposed changes will broaden the reach of burden reduction requirements to encompass legislation, regulation, policies and forms - and to include additional stakeholder groups like for-profit and not-for-profit businesses. This will ensure the government is doing everything it can to communicate clearly, ensure digital rather than paper pathways where possible, and deliver on the province's commitment to be a modern regulator. Transit-Oriented Communities Act and Ministry of Infrastructure Act The Ontario government is advancing the Transit-Oriented Communities (TOC) Program, which will help connect people to places by building communities that are centred around transit stations along the four priority subway projects. The TOC approach provides real opportunities to build complete, mixed-use communities that are connected to transit, building not only subway stations but vibrant communities. By partnering with third-parties, TOCs will make it easier and faster for commuters to get to the places that matter most - bringing housing, including affordable housing, and jobs closer to transit. Transit-Oriented Communities are part of the government's plan to build new, sustainable transit faster so people can get where they want to go, when they want to get there. Public Transportation and Highway Improvement Act Investment in infrastructure is a key component of economic recovery. Construction puts local people to work, and provides the province with assets that allow people and goods to move more efficiently. The Ontario government is looking at ways to accelerate key provincial highway construction projects by identifying and proposing changes that would remove potential ""bottlenecks"", allowing construction to start earlier and finish sooner. Strengthening Communities Environmental Assessment Act The Ontario government is committed to giving local municipalities more say in landfill approvals, as committed to in our Made-in-Ontario Environment Plan. We are proposing a change that will require new, large landfill applicants to ensure there is local support from host municipalities, and certain neighbouring adjacent municipalities within 3.5km that meet certain criteria as part of the approvals process. This is a balanced approach that puts communities at the center of decision-making and provides more certainty for landfill applicants, while ensuring enough landfill capacity in the province. Municipal Act and City of Toronto Act The Ontario government is proposing changes that will enable municipalities and local boards to hold virtual meetings, at their discretion, and to allow municipal councils the option to permit their members to vote by proxy when absent. Planning Act and Development Charges Act The Ontario government has a housing shortage, which is driving up costs and making it unaffordable to rent or buy a home. Now, more than ever, builders need certainty about costs in order to build more housing and support economic recovery. Based on consultations, Ontario is proposing changes that will give municipalities flexibility to fund community services for new developments through modified development charges and a new community benefits charge. The modified development charges will allow municipalities to recover 100 per cent of the cost to build critical community services like long-term care, child care, public health facilities, playgrounds, libraries and affordable housing. A separate community benefits charge will enable municipalities to fund growth-related capital costs of services due to higher density developments that aren't funded by other tools. Municipalities will continue to fund parkland with the existing mechanisms and added accountability. Development charges and the community benefits charge will work together to ensure municipalities can pay for the infrastructure and services growing communities need. The proposed changes will increase the supply of housing, ensure growth pays for growth, support municipalities in building complete communities, and make municipal revenues and costs for builders clearer from the start. Focusing on the Environment and Health The Ontario government is committed to holding polluters accountable, while reducing the burden on responsible businesses. The province is reviewing the province's compliance policy to ensure it can quickly and effectively address noise and odour incidents with known or potential environmental and/or health impacts. This review will allow the government to focus more of its resources on incidents and complaints that pose a higher risk to the environment and/or human health. Creating Opportunity for People Education Act The Ontario government is proposing multiple amendments to the Education Act: Ontario is listening to parents, caregivers and students impacted by the closures of the province's demonstration schools due to the COVID-19 outbreak and proposing amendments that would provide the capacity for a second-year option for all first-year demonstration school students during the 2020-21 school year.The government is also proposing to broaden the qualification requirements for Director of Education positions that would allow school boards to select the best candidate for their respective communities. The requirement that only qualified teachers can be Directors of Education has not been updated since 1997, and this overdue amendment would allow school communities to choose from a wider pool of candidates with a wider skill set, and who are representative of Ontario's diverse population.The Ontario government is committed to supporting school boards in building and sustaining a positive school climate that is safe, equitable, inclusive, and accepting for all students to support their education and well-being. A proposed amendment would allow regulations to remove the discretionary powers of principals to suspend kindergarten to grade 3 students for minor infractions.The Reciprocal Education Approach (REA) is a successful initiative created in collaboration with First Nation partners, school board associations and the Ministry of Education. The government is proposing an amendment that reflects feedback collected through those collaborative partnerships and is responsive to the emerging considerations identified during REA's inaugural year.Justices of the Peace Act As part of the government's plan to press forward boldly towards a more accessible, responsive and resilient justice system, the province is proposing changes to fill justice of the peace vacancies faster. The current process to appoint justices of the peace is outdated and slow. This has created obstacles to filling vacancies, resulting in delays for people waiting for their day in court. The proposed changes would ensure greater transparency and encourage more diversity throughout the recruitment and appointment process. They would require the committee to publish diversity statistics at every step of the process in their annual reports (the disclosure of this information would be voluntary). Proposed changes will also change the composition of the committee to increase efficiency while ensuring the participation and representation of local representatives and non-lawyers. Marriage Act The Ontario government is taking decisive action to stop the spread of COVID-19 and some of the necessary measures have delayed some marriage and wedding plans. To ensure couples can use marriage licences purchased between December 1, 2019 and the last day of the province-wide emergency, the government is proposing legislative amendments to the Marriage Act that extend the validity period of most marriage licences that were not used due to the provincial emergency. If the proposed amendments to the Marriage Act receive Royal Assent, Ontario will waive the provincial fee for licences if a couple requires a new licence because critical information on the licence purchased during that timeframe is no longer accurate, or the original unused licence has been lost or destroyed. Ontario Educational Communications Authority Act and Ontario French-language Communications Authority Act To give secondary students more choice in high-quality online learning courses - no matter where they live or go to school - The Ontario government is proposing amendments that would broaden the mandates of both TVO and TFO to position them to provide centralized administration, coordination and support for teacher-led online learning in the English-language and French-language publicly-funded education systems. Payday Loans Act The Ontario government is taking necessary action to protect the province's most vulnerable consumers by proposing amendments that would limit the interest rate that may be charged on payday loans in default to 2.5 per cent per month (non-compounded). The government is also proposing to set $25 as the maximum fee that payday lenders could charge for dishonoured payments. These proposed changes would provide relief for payday loan borrowers who may be unable to repay their loans on time. Provincial Offences Act Provincial offences courts are the busiest courts in Ontario's justice system. Fifty-nine municipal partners administer court operations for Provincial Offences Act matters heard by the Ontario Court of Justice. Due to COVID-19, provincial offences matters scheduled between March 16, 2020 and September 11, 2020 have been adjourned and rescheduled to a later date. As part of our commitment to keeping people safe and maintaining access to justice throughout the public health emergency, the Ontario government is amending the Provincial Offences Act so that municipally-run courts can make greater use of technology to deliver justice services remotely and reduce in-person court appearances.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government is taking the first step in a made-in-Ontario plan for growth, renewal and economic recovery. Today, the province introduced the COVID-19 Economic Recovery Act, proposed legislation that lays the foundation to restart jobs and development, strengthen communities, and create opportunity for people in every region of the province. 
Details of the legislation were provided by Premier Doug Ford, Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, Prabmeet Sarkaria, Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. ""The COVID-19 pandemic has touched all Ontarians and created significant hardship for individuals, families and businesses,"" said Premier Ford. ""People are relying on our government to help rebuild the province and get people back to work ― and that's exactly what we're doing, starting with this new legislation."" If passed, the COVID-19 Economic Recovery Act will: Restart jobs and development to get Ontario's economic engine roaring again by getting key infrastructure projects built faster, attracting more jobs and investment, and cutting red tape to help businesses adapt to the new environment.Strengthen communities by ensuring municipalities are equipped with the tools they need to continue to provide the critical services people rely on every day, including allowing municipalities and their local boards to continue to choose to hold meetings electronically at any time and putting in place a new community benefits charge to help municipalities pay for the infrastructure and services needed for growing communities.Create opportunity for people as they recover their lives and livelihoods by protecting consumers, modernizing services, improving the education system and removing the social and economic barriers that stand in the way of success for young people.""We are working hand in hand with our municipal partners so they can emerge stronger and better able to meet the needs of local residents,"" said Minister Clark. ""Ontario will continue to be a champion for communities and work closely with the federal government to help every community chart a path to a strong economic recovery."" ""Making Ontario a modern regulator — one that communicates clearly and operates effectively — will free up our people and businesses to focus on what's important: recovering and re-emerging stronger than before,"" said Minister Sarkaria. ""By improving digital access to government and incorporating best practices, we're empowering businesses to rebuild, rehire, and return to a period where their success fuels our economic growth. A modern Ontario is better for people and smarter for business."" The government is committed to working in partnership with people, businesses and municipalities to respond to the challenges they face and support the long-term health and prosperity of Ontario's economy.

Quick Facts

Ontario’s COVID-19: Tackling the Barriers website was created to help businesses overcome the unique challenges created by this pandemic.
Through almost 1,300 submissions the government is actively investigating nearly 400 as identified roadblocks.

To assist municipalities, the province announced several supports in Ontario’s Action Plan: Responding to COVID 19 (March 2020 Economic and Fiscal Update). This lays the groundwork for nearly $450 million of direct support to assist municipalities in their efforts to support vulnerable people, deferring the June municipal remittance of education property tax to school boards by 90 days, and postponing the property tax reassessment for 2021 to ensure that municipal governments can focus their attention on critical public health initiatives.
The $450 million in support includes: $350 million through the Social Services Relief Fund, most of which allows local service managers and Indigenous program administrators to expand supports for our vulnerable people across the province; an additional $100 million to support public health units and Public Health Ontario for the extraordinary costs incurred in meeting this public health threat and in protecting Ontarians.

The government is investing $2.6 billion this year to rehabilitate Ontario’s highways and bridges in every corner of Ontario. To get shovels in the ground faster and get more people back to work, the government is making it easier to build this critical transportation infrastructure, which will reduce delays and save taxpayers money.

WILMOT—The governments of Canada and Ontario recognize the different ways that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected smaller communities across the province. While moving towards recovery, investments in infrastructure in rural and northern Ontario are vital to successful, sustainable communities and their economies.
Today, Tim Louis, Member of Parliament for Kitchener-Conestoga, on behalf of the Honourable Maryam Monsef, Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Rural Economic Development; the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure; and His Worship Les Armstrong, Mayor of the Township of Wilmot, announced funding for the improvement of road and bridge infrastructure in Western Ontario. Several communities in Western Ontario will benefit from 11 road and bridge projects which will increase road safety and reliability, improve the flow of traffic, and help prevent future flooding in rural communities. Investing in these projects will not only increase safety for drivers, but also for cyclists and pedestrians. In Wilmot, for example, a one-lane bridge will be replaced with a two-lane concrete bridge which will remove height and weight restrictions, reduce risk of flooding, and increase traffic circulation. The project will include building a new foundation, abutments, and superstructure with a reinforced concrete deck and barrier walls; reconstructing roadway approaches; and applying erosion and sediment control measures. Of the 11 projects, one project in Chippewas of Nawash Unceded First Nation, will replace several culverts, preventing road washouts and increasing the service life of the connected roadway. This project will include cleaning and regrading ditches, relocating utilities, and applying measures to prevent erosion. The Government of Canada is investing more than $13.2 million in these 11 projects through the Rural and Northern Communities Infrastructure Stream (RNIS) of the Investing in Canada plan. The Government of Ontario is contributing over $7.5 million; while municipalities and a First Nation community are contributing over $4.3 million.

Quick Facts

Through the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities.
$2 billion of this funding is supporting infrastructure projects that meet the unique needs of rural and northern communities like facilities to support food security, local access roads and enhanced broadband connectivity.
Ontario is investing $10.2 billion under the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program to improve public transit; community, culture and recreation; green, and rural and northern community infrastructure.
The Rural Economic Development Strategy leverages ongoing federal investments and provides a vision for the future, identifying practical steps to take in the short term, and serving as a foundation to guide further work.
Central to Canada’s Connectivity Strategy are historic new investments that are mobilizing up to $6 billion toward universal connectivity. They include a top-up to the Connect to Innovate Program, a new Universal Broadband Fund, and investments from the Canada Infrastructure Bank.
Across Ontario, the Government of Canada has invested more than $2.5 billion in infrastructure under the Investing in Canada Plan.
On June 3, 2020, Ontario announced it was investing $150 million to launch the Improving Connectivity in Ontario program to fund broadband infrastructure projects in rural, remote and underserved regions of Ontario. This is part of the province's $315 million initiative Up to Speed: Ontario's Broadband and Cellular Action Plan.

BRANTFORD — The health and well-being of Canadians are the top priorities of the governments of Canada and Ontario. But the COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than Canadians' personal health. It is having a profound effect on the economy.
That is why governments have been taking decisive action to support families, businesses and communities, and continue to look ahead to see what more can be done. Strategic investments in modern public transit infrastructure support a healthy environment and play a key role in ensuring Ontarians can get to work and essential services on time, then safely back home at the end of the day. Today, the Honourable Filomena Tassi, Minister of Labour and Member of Parliament for Hamilton West-Ancaster-Dundas, on behalf of the Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities; Will Bouma, Member of Provincial Parliament for Brantford-Brant on behalf of the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure; and his Worship Kevin Davis, Mayor of Brantford, announced funding for four public transit projects in Brantford. The purchase of 21 new buses, 13 conventional and eight para-transit buses, will replace the retiring fleet and offer passengers better service and reduce maintenance costs. In addition, the installation of 31 new fareboxes with smart card technology on buses will allow the city to better monitor ridership of existing routes. New bus pads and shelters will provide riders with safer, fully accessible waiting areas and important upgrades will be made to the transit maintenance facility to ensure the new fleet remains well-maintained and reliable. By upgrading and expanding public transit systems in the city and connecting residents to the essential services they require, residents can get around their communities safely while protecting the environment. The Government of Canada is investing over $5.5 million in these projects through the Public Transit Infrastructure Stream (PTIS) of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Ontario is providing more than $4.6 million to the projects, while the municipality is contributing more than $3.7 million.

TORONTO - The Ontario government is piloting a new system that will make it easier for truck drivers to access COVID-19 testing through a partnership with DriverCheck. This is part of the government's efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19 and protect public health across the province.
""Expanding access to testing will help keep our truck drivers safe as they move essential goods throughout Ontario and across the border,"" said Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation. ""We thank Ontario's truck drivers for everything they do to keep goods moving so that families have access to the goods they rely on every day.""  The pilot program will allow truck drivers to access voluntary testing on a first-come, first-served basis at locations where there is high volume truck traffic, including Kitchener and Ayr, as well as a mobile option. DriverCheck will roll out the project in phases beginning July 8 until September 8, 2020. DriverCheck is private sector company that currently administers drug and alcohol testing for the trucking industry.  ""With this pilot project for truck drivers, we will be able to find cases faster, intervene earlier, reduce the spread and save lives,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""As the province carefully reopens, it is critical that we all continue to follow public health advice such as practicing physical distancing, wearing a face covering when physical distancing is a challenge, and washing your hands thoroughly and frequently.""

Quick Facts

Testing will be available at a DriverCheck clinic in Kitchener beginning July 8, 2020, at a truck stop in Ayr beginning July 14, 2020, and at a mobile option at select locations throughout the pilot period.
Ontario has also released a 511 app that provides up-to-date information for truck drivers during COVID-19. The app is available for free on the App Store and Google Play.
Every year, $1.26 trillion worth of goods are moved by trucks on Ontario’s roads.

Ontario Introduces Legislation to Protect Public Health as Economy Reopens 
Proposed Bill Would Provide Flexibility to Address the Ongoing Threat of COVID-19

July  7, 2020  2:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Today, the Ontario government introduced proposed legislation that, if passed, would give the province the necessary flexibility to address the ongoing risks and effects of the COVID-19 outbreak. The proposed legislation is part of the government's plan for the continued safe and gradual reopening of the province once the declaration of emergency ends.
Details about the proposed legislation were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Solicitor General Sylvia Jones. ""If passed, the proposed legislation would allow us to chart a responsible path to economic reopening and recovery without putting all the progress we've made in fighting this virus at risk,"" said Premier Ford. ""Even as we continue certain emergency orders under the proposed legislation to protect public health, we will always be a government accountable to the people of Ontario. That's why I will ensure ongoing updates are provided and that a report is tabled within four months of the anniversary of this proposed Act coming into force."" ""While the declaration of emergency may come to an end shortly, the risk posed by COVID-19 is likely to be with us for some time to come,"" said Solicitor General Sylvia Jones. ""This new legislation would provide the government with the necessary flexibility to ensure select tools remain in place to protect vulnerable populations, such as seniors, and respond to this deadly virus."" The Reopening Ontario (A Flexible Response to COVID-19) Act, 2020 would, if passed, ensure important measures remain in place to address the threat of COVID-19 once the provincial declaration of emergency has ended. Specifically, the legislation would: Continue emergency orders in effect under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act (EMCPA) under the new legislation for an initial 30 days.Allow the Lieutenant Governor in Council to further extend these orders for up to 30 days at a time, as required to keep Ontarians safe.Allow the Lieutenant Governor in Council to amend certain emergency orders continued under the EMCPA if the amendment relates to:labour redeployment or workplace and management rules;closure of places and spaces or regulation of how businesses and establishments can be open to provide goods or services in a safe manner;compliance with public health advice; orrules related to gatherings and organized public events.Not allow new emergency orders to be created.Allow emergency orders to be rescinded when it is safe to do so.The ability to extend and amend orders under the new legislation would be limited to one year, unless extended by the Ontario legislature. Appropriate oversight and transparency would be ensured through regular, mandated reporting that provides the rationale for the extension of any emergency order. The legislation would include the same types of provisions on offences and penalties as set out under the EMCPA to address non-compliance with orders.

Quick Facts

The termination of the provincial emergency declaration under the EMCPA, or the passage of the proposed Act, would not preclude a head of council of a municipality from declaring under the EMCPA that an emergency exists in any part of the municipality or from continuing such a declaration.
The termination of the provincial emergency declaration under the EMCPA, or the passage of the proposed Act, would not preclude the exercise of the powers under the Health Protection and Promotion Act by Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health or local medical officers of health.

The Government of Ontario declared a provincial declaration of emergency under s.7.0.1 of the EMCPA on March 17, 2020. The declaration has been extended under s.7.0.7 of the EMCPA and is in place until July 15, 2020, allowing the province to continue to make new emergency orders or amend existing orders under the EMCPA until that date.
On June 26, 2020, emergency orders then in effect that were made under section 7.0.2 of the EMCPA were extended to July 10.
A full list of current emergency orders in effect under the EMCPA can be found on the e-Laws website under the EMCPA and at Ontario.ca/alert.

Canada and Ontario invest in public transit and active transportation infrastructure for Windsor and Tecumseh residents


July  7, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Ministry of Infrastructure


WINDSOR—The health and well-being of Canadians are the top priorities of the Governments of Canada and Ontario. But the COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than Canadians' personal health. It is having a profound effect on the economy.
That is why governments have been taking decisive action to support families, businesses and communities, and continue to look ahead to see what more can be done. Strategic investments in public transportation infrastructure play a key role in supporting affordable and sustainable transportation services that allow Ontarians to get to work, school and essential services on time, and safely back home at the end of the day. Today, Irek Kusmierczyk, Member of Parliament for Windsor─Tecumseh and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, on behalf of the Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities; Rick Nicholls, Member of Provincial Parliament for Chatham-Kent-Leamington on behalf of the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure; and his Worship Drew Dilkens, Mayor of Windsor, announced funding for nine projects that will better connect Windsor residents to public transit, encourage active transportation, and improve the quality of the public transit system overall, as well as one multi-purpose pathway project in Tecumseh. In Windsor, the purchase of 19 buses will allow the city to replace 16 buses that have exceeded their useful life, while expanding the fleet's capacity by 3 buses to meet system needs. Additionally, the construction and rehabilitation of sidewalks, pathways and bike lanes throughout the city will make it safer and easier for pedestrians and cyclists to commute to their destinations or to directly access public transit. In Tecumseh, the construction of a new 3 kilometre multi-purpose pathway will link the Tecumseh Hamlet to the Tecumseh Transit Service, providing residents with easier access to public transit. Together, these investments will make it easier for residents to get around their community safely while facilitating active transportation. The Government of Canada is investing more than $12.6 million through the Public Transit Infrastructure stream of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Ontario is providing over $10.5 million, while the City of Windsor is contributing more than $25.1 million and the City of Tecumseh is contributing $580,314.

Quick Facts

Through the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities.
$28.7 billion of this funding is supporting public transit projects, including $5 billion available for investment through the Canada Infrastructure Bank. 
Across the province, Ontario is investing more than $7.3 billion in public transit infrastructure over 10 years through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program.

 Ontario Passes Legislation to Deliver Subways Faster
Building Transit Faster Act Will Accelerate Delivery of Priority Transit Projects, Support Economic Recovery

July  7, 2020 12:30 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO ― Ontario is building a modern, reliable and sustainable transit system for the 21st century that will get people moving, reduce congestion, and drive economic growth and job creation. Today, Bill 171, the Building Transit Faster Act, 2020, was passed by the Ontario legislature.
The legislation, once in force, enables the province to expedite the process of building Ontario's four priority transit projects, which will get people to where they want to go, reduce congestion, and drive economic growth and job creation. The projects include the all-new Ontario Line, the Yonge North Subway Extension to Markham and Richmond Hill, the improved three-stop Scarborough Subway Extension, and the Eglinton Crosstown West Extension to Pearson airport. ""Getting more transit built faster will help reduce gridlock, deliver a modern rapid transit system for the province and become a major contributor to our economic recovery,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""These four priority transit projects will create thousands of jobs, provide more housing options for people, and open up countless opportunities for businesses throughout the Greater Toronto Area and beyond."" ""During consultations and throughout debate, we heard a common theme from a wide range of people who reinforced how important it is to not only build transit quickly, but to also get it right,"" said Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation. ""That is why we've focused solely on eliminating the roadblocks that cause unnecessary delays, so we can deliver these major transit projects as quickly and cost effectively as possible."" This legislation supports Premier Ford's ""New Subway Transit Plan for the GTA"" ― representing the largest subway expansion in Canadian history. The legislation, once in force, will expedite the planning, design and construction process for the four priority subway projects by: Enabling relocation of utilities more efficiently, while treating businesses fairly, and ensuring costs are not passed on to consumers;Better enabling the assembly of land required to construct stations, conduct tunneling and prepare sites, while treating property owners fairly;Ensuring timely access to municipal services and rights-of-way;Allowing the province to conduct due diligence work and remove physical barriers with appropriate notification to property owners; and,Ensuring nearby developments or construction projects are coordinated so they do not cause delays.""Now that legislation has passed, we continue to call on the federal government to come to the table and fund at least 40 per cent of these nationally-significant subway projects that will provide a modern, efficient rapid transit system, benefiting all transit riders and taxpayers,"" said Kinga Surma, Associate Minister of Transportation (GTA). ""With the passage of this bill, we can get shovels in the ground sooner and get skilled people back to work as we restart the economy and recover from COVID-19."" ""The passage of this legislation gets us closer to building much-needed transit infrastructure to reduce congestion and contribute to the economic recovery and renewal of our province,"" said Laurie Scott, Minister of Infrastructure. ""We are committed to fulfilling our promise to get people where they want to go when they want to get there."" Working together with its municipal and federal partners on priority transit projects, the government is building a world-class rapid transit system and developing transit-oriented communities with a greater variety of affordable housing options.

Quick Facts

Ontario signed preliminary agreements with the City of Toronto and the Region of York, laying the foundation for continued collaboration towards the shared goal of the accelerated delivery of the four priority transit projects.
The Business Cases for the four priority transit projects, published by Metrolinx, demonstrate how, once complete, the subway plan will provide improved connections with other transit systems across the network, congestion relief on roadways, and better connections to jobs.
For example, the 15.5 km Ontario Line will provide 154,000 more people with walking distance access to rapid transit and see 389,000 daily boardings, with 53,000 more jobs accessible within a 45-minute transit commute for Toronto residents.

The Scarborough Subway Extension, an approximately 8 km long extension of the Toronto Transit Commission’s Bloor Danforth Line 2 from the existing terminus Kennedy Station, will provide 38,000 more people with walking distance access to rapid transit and see 105,000 daily boardings.
The Eglinton Crosstown West Extension will extend the Eglinton Crosstown Light Rail Transit (LRT) project by 9.2 km from Mount Dennis Station to Renforth Drive, and will see a 23 per cent increase in weekday boardings on the Mississauga Transitway and eastward section of the Crosstown LRT, with 31,000 more jobs within a 10-minute walk to a station and a total of 37,000 daily boardings expected.
Ontario is using a P3 model to deliver these projects, to achieve greater efficiency and cost effectiveness.

 Building Transit Faster Act: Removing Unnecessary Delays


July  7, 2020 12:30 P.M.

Office of the Premier


Bill 171, the Building Transit Faster Act, 2020 targets steps in the planning, design and construction process that have unnecessarily delayed major projects in the past. The legislation, once in force, will remove roadblocks and give the province the tools needed for Metrolinx and Infrastructure Ontario to deliver the following four priority transit projects faster:
Ontario Line Subway with 15 stations. The 15.5 km Ontario Line will run between Exhibition/Ontario Place through downtown Toronto to the Ontario Science Centre, bringing rapid transit to neighbourhoods such as Liberty Village and Flemingdon Park. It will help address overcrowding and provide needed relief on the TTC's Line 1 and Bloor-Yonge station.Scarborough Subway Extension with three stations. The nearly 8 km extension of TTC's Line 2 (Bloor-Danforth), from the existing Kennedy Station northeast to McCowan Road/Sheppard Avenue, will improve transit access to the residents of Scarborough.Yonge North Subway Extension with five stations. The 7.4 km extension of TTC's Line 1 (Yonge-University) will connect north from Finch Station to Highway 7. The line will pass through the City of Toronto into York Region, passing along the boundary of Markham and Vaughan into Richmond Hill.Eglinton Crosstown West Extension with multiple stops along the Eglinton West corridor. The western extension of the Eglinton Crosstown LRT (future Line 5) will increase connectivity along Eglinton Avenue from the future Mount Dennis station to Renforth Drive. Ultimately, through future phases of this project, the province is committed to establishing connectivity with Pearson International Airport.The legislation, once in force, will help get transit built faster by Enabling relocation of utilities more efficiently while treating businesses fairly, and ensuring costs are not passed on to consumers.Allow for Metrolinx to require a utility company to relocate its infrastructure within a prescribed timeframe. Introduce a clear process for managing disputes and allow Metrolinx to seek compensation from a utility company if timelines are not met.This is similar to the process used for highway projects.Amendments to the Ontario Energy Board Act, 1998 will prohibit the Ontario Energy Board from allowing provincially regulated utilities (electricity and natural gas) to pass compensation costs incurred from delays on to ratepayers.Better enabling the assembly of land required to construct transit projects, while still treating property owners fairly.Currently, redundant steps require the province to repeatedly demonstrate the need for land related to infrastructure projects one at a time.This will remove Hearings of Necessity for any property required to deliver the four priority transit projects and avoid unnecessary delays.The province will continue to treat people fairly and compensate people whose properties are required.The legislation would include provisions to allow the Minister of Transportation to establish an alternate streamlined process for receiving and considering comments from landowners about the proposed land assembly.For municipal properties needed, municipalities will be given reasonable time limits for internal review to help keep the process on schedule.Ensuring timely access to municipal services and rights-of-way.The government will continue to work closely with municipalities, including the City of Toronto, to negotiate and secure permits.In cases where an agreement cannot be reached, the Minister of Transportation can use a new legislative provision to issue an order that outlines the terms and conditions under which Metrolinx could use or modify a municipal road or service, if needed.The government will remain committed to working in partnership with municipalities and reducing the disruption to local communities as much as possible throughout the construction process.As outlined in Provincial Statements of Intent with the City of Toronto and York Region, the government intends to work in collaboration with municipalities to develop and facilitate streamlined processes to get the necessary permits and approvals to build transit faster.  Further details of how all parties commit to engage and collaborate will be outlined in future downstream agreements under the transit partnerships. Agreements with the City of Toronto, York Region and the province, will ensure the partners continue to collaborate and work effectively together to delivery Ontario's historic 'New Subway Transit Plan for the GTA.' Allowing the province to conduct due diligence work and remove physical barriers, such as trees, with appropriate notification to property owners.Anyone entering private property will be required to provide notice, abide by time of day restrictions and show identification.Similar provisions exist for highway projects.Ensuring nearby developments or construction projects do not interfere with or delay the four priority subway projects.A permit will be required to construct or change any building, structure, road or underground utility infrastructure. A permit will also be required to perform any dewatering or excavation near a subway corridor, in addition to existing requirements.This will apply to new and some existing developments. For existing approved developments that are identified as potential conflicts, there will be at least six months of negotiation before a permit will be required.This will give the province the ability to coordinate activities in and around the subway corridors and stations and manage the timing of construction activities to prioritize the subway projects.The province will continue to work with partners to implement these measures.

Government Proposes Made-in-Ontario Plan for Growth, Renewal and Economic Recovery
Measures Would Help Deliver Critical Infrastructure Projects Faster

July  6, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Government of Ontario has developed a made-in-Ontario plan for growth, renewal and economic recovery. This plan includes measures that would make it easier and faster to build provincial highways, major transit infrastructure projects and quality, affordable housing, while ensuring there are meaningful opportunities for community consultation and input.
Details were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation, and Kinga Surma, Associate Minister of Transportation (GTA). ""The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant hardship for individuals, families, and businesses throughout the province. We're going to need everyone's help to rebuild the province and get people back to work,"" said Premier Ford. ""Through these proposed initiatives, we will start Ontario down the road to recovery by getting critical infrastructure projects built faster, creating jobs in communities across the province."" As part of the government's plan, the province is proposing to accelerate key provincial highway construction and priority transit projects by establishing an exemption from the Hearing of Necessity process. Provincial Hearings of Necessity occur approximately 5-10 times per year on average for provincial highway projects. Each hearing adds months of red tape and construction delays for critical provincial infrastructure, costing up to five months for transit projects and up to 12 months for provincial highway projects. ""Communities need reliable transit, transportation and housing as a strong foundation for future economic growth,"" said Minister Mulroney. ""These initiatives would create tens of thousands of new well-paying jobs, make our roads safer, reduce gridlock, and put home ownership within reach of many people across the province."" As part of this plan, the government would also enter into new commercial agreements with partners to build transit-oriented communities. This would allow for the development of more housing around transit in an integrated manner and put more job opportunities within the reach of more people. The measures would also save taxpayers money by having the development industry make direct, significant contributions to the cost of building transit for the benefit of communities, all transit riders, and Ontario taxpayers. ""Instead of building stations in isolation, we will build fully integrated communities,"" said Associate Minister Surma. ""Transit-oriented communities will benefit the Greater Toronto Area by increasing ridership, reducing congestion, providing a mix of housing ― including affordable housing ― and providing critical local services and amenities like daycares and recreational spaces."" These measures would allow the province to more quickly undertake important technical investigations and prepare construction sites, while ensuring meaningful consultation with landowners.

Quick Facts

The province is investing $2.6 billion to expand and repair Ontario’s highways and bridges.

Ontario will continue to collaborate with the City of Toronto and York Region under the historic joint transit partnership agreements and Transit-Oriented Communities Memorandums of Understanding.

WELLAND — The governments of Canada and Ontario recognize the different ways that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected smaller and rural communities across the province. Both governments are making strategic investments in roads and bridges to meet the specific needs of Ontario communities and help them strengthen their local economies.
Today, Vance Badawey Member of Parliament for Niagara Centre, on behalf of the Honourable Maryam Monsef, Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Rural Economic Development; Sam Oosterhoff, Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Education and Member of Provincial Parliament for Niagara West, on behalf of the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure; his Worship Jim Diodati, Mayor of Niagara Falls; his Worship Frank Campion, Mayor of Welland; his Worship Dave Bylsma, Mayor of West Lincoln; and her Worship Kristal Chopp, Mayor of Norfolk County, announced funding for four road and bridge improvement projects in Southern Ontario. The City of Welland will see the construction of a bridge over the Welland Canal at the site of the former Forks Road lift bridge, which was demolished in 2019. The construction of this new bridge will reopen a key transportation link that was used by and estimated 3,500 vehicles daily to access Welland and other parts of the Niagara Region. Other projects include the reconstruction of parts of Drummond Road, Gallinger Street, and Portage Road in the City of Niagara Falls, the replacement of Big Creek Bridge to include a new two-lane structure in Norfolk County, and the reconstruction and rehabilitation of St. Ann's Road and bridge in the Township of West Lincoln.

Real-Time Courses Make It Easier for People to Get Essential Qualifications

July  3, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO ― As the province safely and gradually reopens, the Ontario government is investing $3 million to provide free online health and safety training for the first time. These virtual courses will make it easier for job seekers and workers to get essential qualifications, while practising physical distancing and preventing the spread of COVID-19.
The announcement was made today by Premier Doug Ford and Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""In this new environment, we need to look for new and innovative ways to deliver services, while keeping people safe and healthy,"" said Premier Ford. ""This virtual approach to safety training will ensure employers and employees have access to the latest information without the need to physically interact with others. In this way, we also reduce the risk of spreading this deadly virus."" Up to 100,000 job seekers can now take free online workplace health and safety training through Employment Ontario. There are 10 courses on offer, which include topics such as infection control, conducting health and safety incident investigations, ladder safety, slips, trips and falls prevention, and preventing workplace violence and harassment. Job seekers should contact an Employment Ontario service provider in their area to enroll. ""This is the first time this type of online safety training has been made available at no cost to people who have lost their jobs and I am confident it will be an effective way to prepare people to rejoin the workforce safely,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""The training is free and accessible from anywhere, so people can learn from their own homes."" In addition, worker and employer members of Joint Health and Safety Committees can now use video conferencing to take training in real-time with qualified instructors from training providers approved by Ontario's Chief Prevention Officer. The training includes sessions on how to establish a Health and Safety Committee, resolving health and safety issues, workplace inspections, and accident investigations. Ontario's Chief Prevention Officer is extending the time for completion of refresher training for more than 8,000 certified committee members whose certification would have expired between February 28 and August 31, 2020. They have until November 30, 2020 to renew their training, which will be easier thanks to new online options.

Quick Facts

Employment Ontario serves more than one million clients per year and has more than 700 service locations across Ontario.
A Joint Health and Safety Committee’s primary role is to identify workplace health and safety issues and bring them to the attention of the employers.

Over the last three years, an average of 37,000 people per year took Joint Health and Safety Committee certification training.

Ontario Salutes the Military for its Critical Work in the Fight Against COVID-19

July  3, 2020 10:30 A.M.

Ministry of Long-Term Care


TORONTO — The Ontario government expressed its gratitude to members of the Canadian Armed Forces who went above and beyond the call of duty to temporarily support high-priority long-term care homes during the height of the COVID-19 outbreak. The final team concludes its work today.  
Under Operation LASER, the Canadian Armed Forces deployed teams consisting of nurses, medical technicians and additional personnel. They have been working in Ontario long-term care homes since April providing staffing support and helping with infection prevention and control, and other duties such as cleaning and food preparation. ""We owe our brave men and women in the Canadian Armed Forces, and the military families who support them, a debt of gratitude for their service to our province during this crisis,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""From providing relief to our frontline workers, to taking care of our loved ones in long-term care homes, they have been there for their fellow Canadians when we needed them most. We hope to find ways in the near future to properly show our thanks for their contributions and for the contributions of all Ontarians who have gone above and beyond these past few months."" Over the course of their mission, the Canadian Armed Forces teams supported the following homes: Orchard Villa, Holland Christian Homes Grace Manor, Altamont Care Community, Eatonville Care Centre, Hawthorne Place Care Centre, Downsview Long Term Care, and Woodbridge Vista Care Community. ""In this time of exceptional need, we are grateful for the support we received from the Canadian Armed Forces teams in our long-term care homes,"" said Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""Their experience and expertise in emergency situations have been crucial in fighting this virus and helping to protect our residents and staff in long-term care homes."" ""The Canadian Armed Forces have been tremendous partners in helping support some of the most vulnerable Ontarians during this unprecedented time,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""We are grateful for the support and protection they provided to our long-term care home residents in the midst of our fight against COVID-19."" In May, the Ontario government responded immediately to the findings of the Canadian Armed Forces report. The Ministry of Long-Term Care has been addressing issues around infection control, standards of practice/quality of care, supplies, local practices, communication, staffing and inappropriate behaviour. To-date, the following action has been taken:   Each home identified at that time as high-risk has been inspected or has an inspection underway. Inspections at all the Canadian Armed Forces-supported homes have been completed and have since been expanded with inspectors remaining onsite. Temporary management has been appointed at Altamont Care Community, Camilla Care Community, Orchard Villa, Extendicare Guildwood, River Glen Haven, Downsview Long Term Care, Woodbridge Vista Care Community, Forest Heights and Hawthorne Place Care Centre. Each home identified as high-risk has been required to submit a plan to the ministry that details how they are improving care standards.  Additional measures taken to support staff and residents in long-term care homes include emergency funding, regulatory flexibility, staffing support, expanded testing, direction and guidance on outbreak management, infection prevention, and assistance provided by public hospitals to homes in outbreak. The government recently announced the launch of an independent, non-partisan commission into Ontario's long-term care system beginning in July 2020. Details of the commission are now being finalized, including the terms of reference, membership, leadership of the commission and reporting timelines.

Quick Facts

The number of long-term care homes experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak has decreased from 150 homes (May 25) to 44 (as of July 2), out of a total of 626 homes. This means that more than 90 per cent of homes (582) have no resident cases. 
The number of homes identified as high-risk has decreased from 23 (May 27) to five (as of June 30). 
The number of active resident cases has decreased from 1,855 (May 25) to 167 and the volume of active staff cases has decreased from 1,335 (May 25) to 287 (as of July 2).
The number of homes identified as having critical staffing shortages has decreased from 20 (May 25) to zero (as of July 2).
The number of homes identified as having critical PPE shortages has decreased from four (May 25) to zero (as of July 2).

Investment will create six new jobs as province gradually restarts the economy

Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines


SAULT STE. MARIE - The Ontario government is investing $185,425 to help a natural products manufacturer expand operations, meet growing demand for products that will help in the fight against COVID-19, and create six new jobs as the province gradually restarts the economy.
OC Hair Bath & Body Co. will use the funding to purchase new equipment and renovate and expand its facility where it manufactures natural products such as hand sanitizer, soap, shampoo, insect repellent and makeup. The company also provides custom products, labelling and packaging for hospitals, not-for-profits, and businesses, including salons, spas, resorts and health clubs. The funding is delivered through the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation (NOHFC). ""As the province reopens and the economy recovers, small businesses in the north like OC Hair Bath & Body Co. need our assistance,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines. ""Supporting small businesses is an important part of our government's plan to create more jobs and attract new and expanded investment so northern communities can grow and thrive."" The NOHFC promotes economic development across Northern Ontario by providing financial assistance to projects - big and small, rural and urban - that stimulate growth, job creation and develop a skilled workforce. Since June 2018, the NOHFC has invested more than $176 million in 1,224 projects in Northern Ontario. This has leveraged more than $650 million in investment and created or retained 3,559 jobs. ""OC Hair Bath & Body Co. has grown steadily since its inception,"" said Ross Romano, MPP for Sault Ste. Marie. ""And now, with our investment, we are helping the company further expand operations and increase revenues, creating employment and prosperity for the people of Sault Ste. Marie."" The Ontario government is getting more people back to work and more recreational activities open by moving forward with a regional approach to Stage 2 of reopening the province.

Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development


GEORGINA - The Ontario government is helping more people find a career in the trades and getting shovels in the ground faster on affordable housing projects by investing more than $4 million to support a local construction training program.
The program will be run through Skills Advance Ontario, which connects job seekers with the sector-specific employment and training, and employers with the services they need to recruit the right workers. Led by Georgina Trades Training Inc. (GTTI), the project will prepare up to 100 job seekers for construction-related professions and use the skills learned to help build new modular housing units. The training facility will be located in the Town of Georgina. ""This project shows how our government is partnering with local communities to address economic challenges and help more people find work in the trades,"" said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""Many communities have been hit hard by the pandemic, and as we continue to reopen Ontario's economy, effective training initiatives will be an essential part of our efforts to get everyone back on the job. ""By providing funding for this project in Georgina, we're giving young people a chance to learn new skills and start careers in the skilled trades,"" said Caroline Mulroney, York-Simcoe MPP and Minister of Transportation and Francophone Affairs. ""This project will provide good jobs, spur economic development and provide affordable housing in our region."" ""As a founding partner of GTTI, The Town looks forward to continuing this partnership with the development of the Skilled Trades Institute,"" said Margaret Quirk, Mayor of Georgina. ""This is a great opportunity with far-reaching economic and social benefits in providing post-secondary opportunities closer to home for residents, addressing skilled trades shortages while creating affordable housing for those who need it."" ""Acute shortages in the skilled trades have become a serious problem for Ontario's economy that requires bold, creative thinking to come up with solutions,"" said John De Faveri, Chair of GTTI. ""Not only are we attracting and training post-secondary school graduates as well as multi-barrier candidates to consider a career in skilled trades, we are at the same time creating a unique model for municipalities that clearly speaks to affordable housing."" Over the coming weeks and months, Georgina Trades Training Inc. will begin hiring staff for the project and finalize the training curriculum. The start of training is projected for January 2021.

Quick Facts

The Town of Georgina is supporting the project with $2.6 million in funding and is leasing the land that the housing units will be built on as part of the training project.
The new project is one of 50 current SkillsAdvance Ontario projects across the province. Five of these projects are dedicated to skills training in the construction sector.
The Employment Ontario network offers a range of services and supports that help businesses find talent and connect job seekers to training and job opportunities.

Ontario Supporting Restaurants as Province Safely Reopens
New and Amended Emergency Orders Will Help Establishments Expand Patios Faster

July  3, 2020  7:00 A.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government is helping restaurant and bar owners reopen and safely serve more customers by issuing a new emergency order and amending another under s.7.0.2 (4) of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, which will allow municipalities to quickly pass temporary bylaws for the creation and extension of patios and allow covered outdoor dining areas to serve customers.
This decision was made in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health to keep the people of Ontario safe as the province continues to recover and resume activities as part of Ontario's Framework for Reopening the Province. ""Businesses across the province are demonstrating that we can still enjoy our beautiful Ontario summer while protecting the health and safety of their patrons,"" said Premier Ford. ""Restaurants and bars are an important part of our economy, and a great driver of employment. I am proud to say that we will continue to support them as our province reopens and recovers."" Under the Planning Act, the process to pass temporary use bylaws to create or extend a patio could take several weeks or more. As restaurants are currently only permitted to host dine-in guests on outdoor patios under Stage 2, this exemption under the emergency order will cut red tape and reduce the process time for passing these bylaws to a matter of days. Municipalities would still be responsible for compliance activities and ensuring proper health and safety practices, like proper physical distancing. The government also amended an emergency order to clarify that outdoor dining areas can open if they have a roof, canopy, tent, awning or other covering. At least two full sides of the outdoor dining area must be open to the outdoors and must not be substantially blocked in any way. If the outdoor dining area has a retractable roof, the roof must be fully open and at least one full side must be open to the outdoors and must not be substantially blocked in any way. Most of Ontario has moved into Stage 2 recovery, except for the Municipality of Leamington and the Town of Kingsville, which remain in Stage 1. On June 24, Ontario announced the extension of the Declaration of Emergency to July 15, allowing the province to continue to make or amend emergency orders under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act. The government continues to review all these emergency orders to determine when and if it is safe to amend or lift them as restrictions are eased and more places in the province reopen in a safe and measured way. A full list of emergency orders can be found on the e-Laws website under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act and at Ontario.ca/alert.

Ontario Provides Additional Funding to Support Municipalities and Urban Indigenous Community Partners 
New Investment Will Be Used to Develop Long-Term, Innovative Housing Solutions

July  2, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government is providing municipalities and urban Indigenous community partners with an additional $150 million to continue to protect vulnerable people from COVID-19 by improving homeless shelters and creating opportunities for longer-term housing. This investment more than doubles the funding currently flowing to local municipal service managers and urban Indigenous program administrators through the Social Services Relief Fund.
Details were provided today by Premier Doug Ford and Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. ""We are standing shoulder to shoulder with our municipal and Indigenous community partners to ensure our most vulnerable citizens are protected during these difficult times,"" said Premier Ford. ""Today's investment builds on our collective efforts to help people get back on their feet quickly and recover from this global crisis. We will continue to be a champion for our municipal partners with the federal government to ensure a strong recovery for communities across the province."" Municipalities and urban Indigenous community partners will be able to use this funding for long-term, innovative housing solutions resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak. They can renovate shelters or purchase new facilities that will help with physical distancing in the short term and support longer-term, more sustainable solutions to homelessness. In addition, this funding could also be used to provide vulnerable people with food, shelter and supplies. The funding is another way that Ontario is coming to the table to support municipalities as it continues to work with provincial partners and the federal government on municipal supports through the federal government's proposed Safe Restart Framework. ""We know that municipal and Indigenous partners are facing extraordinary challenges due to this global pandemic,"" said Minister Clark. ""That's why we continue to step up to provide financial support and other measures to help our local partners. This investment is another step our government is taking to protect our most vulnerable, but we know more needs to be done. We continue to work closely with our federal and municipal partners to ensure communities across Ontario have the support they need."" With this additional funding, the government is providing municipal service managers and urban Indigenous program administrators with $350 million through the Social Services Relief Fund. This builds on the support being delivered as part of the COVID-19 Action Plan to Protect Vulnerable Ontarians. The action plan provides enhanced screening and testing in high-risk settings such as shelters and homes, including for those with developmental disabilities, and provides personal protective equipment and training so staff will know what to do in the event of an outbreak. ""The Government's Social Services Relief Fund was an immediate response to COVID-19 related municipal costs when it was announced in March. The initial $148 million literally saved lives in communities across Ontario,"" said Jamie McGarvey, President of the Association of Municipalities of Ontario. ""The additional $150 million announced today will help offset the added costs of addressing homelessness and protecting the most vulnerable from COVID-19.""

Quick Facts

In March, Ontario announced an initial investment of $148 million to support municipalities, food banks, homeless shelters and individuals. This funding is already helping individuals and families in financial crisis. 
Another $52 million expanded the Emergency Assistance program administered through Ontario Works for people in emergency situations and made more support available to vulnerable social assistance recipients to meet a broad range of needs.

Ministry of Infrastructure


THE NATION — The governments of Canada and Ontario recognize the different ways that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted smaller and rural communities across the province. Both governments are making strategic investments in infrastructure to meet the specific needs of rural and northern Ontario municipalities and help them strengthen their local economies.
Today, the Honourable Francis Drouin, Member of Parliament for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, on behalf of the Honourable Maryam Monsef, Canada's Minister of Women and Gender Equality and Rural Economic Development; and the Honourable Steve Clark, Ontario's Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing and Member of Provincial Parliament for Leeds-Grenville-Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes on behalf of Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure, announced funding for five road and bridge projects in Eastern Ontario. They were joined by Mayor François St-Amour, The Nation Municipality; Mayor Nancy Peckford, Municipality of North Grenville; and Frank Prevost, Warden, United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry. In The Nation, the Touchette Bridge will be rehabilitated, replacing the majority of its parts, including the floor beams, the deck, and the steel stringers. These upgrades will extend the lifespan of the bridge while increasing the flow of traffic, allowing motorists to get where they need to go faster. In addition, Mississippi Mills will see its Levi Bridge replaced, upgrading from a one-lane to a new two-lane bridge with new railings and guardrails, making it safer for drivers and pedestrians. The remaining projects will see upgrades to major roads in each community. North Grenville will expand approximately 1.15 kilometers of County Road 43 from two to four lanes, adding new bike lanes and crosswalks in support of active transportation. Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry will rehabilitate nearly 1.25 kilometers of County Road 2 leading to Morrison, improving the sidewalk entrances to local businesses to support economic growth. Finally, Cornwall's reconstruction of a portion of Lemay Street, which includes new bike lanes, sidewalks and a roundabout, will increase the safety of pedestrians and will improve the city's active transportation routes.  The Government of Canada is investing over $9 million in these projects through the Rural and Northern Communities Infrastructure Stream of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Ontario is contributing more than $6.5 million for these important infrastructure projects in these communities while municipalities are contributing over $3 million in total towards the projects. The governments of Canada and Ontario are working in collaboration with their partners to support jobs, improve communities and build confidence as we safely and sustainably restore economic growth.

Quick Facts

Through the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities.
$2 billion of this funding is supporting infrastructure projects that meet the unique needs of rural and northern communities like facilities to support food security, local access roads and enhanced broadband connectivity.
Ontario is investing $10.2 billion under the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program to improve public transit; community, culture and recreation; green, and rural and northern community infrastructure.
The Rural Economic Development Strategy leverages ongoing federal investments and provides a vision for the future, identifying practical steps to take in the short term, and serving as a foundation to guide further work.
Central to Canada’s Connectivity Strategy are historic new investments that are mobilizing up to $6 billion toward universal connectivity. They include a top-up to the Connect to Innovate Program, a new Universal Broadband Fund, and investments from the Canada Infrastructure Bank.
On June 3, 2020, Ontario announced it was investing $150 million to launch the Improving Connectivity in Ontario program to fund broadband infrastructure projects in rural, remote and underserved regions of Ontario. This is part of the province's $315 million initiative Up to Speed: Ontario’s Broadband and Cellular Action Plan.

Government Seeks Input to Help Improve Elevator Safety and Availability

July  2, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Ministry of Government and Consumer Services


TORONTO - The Ontario government is launching consultations in an effort to improve elevator safety, performance, and availability in multi-storey buildings. The province is seeking input on proposed regulatory changes under the Technical Standards and Safety Act, 2000. These new rules would help to ensure that elevators are well-maintained and meet updated safety requirements.
""Ontarians living and working in high-rises want elevators to be better maintained with fewer breakdowns and less downtime, and they want more information about elevator disruptions,"" said Lisa Thompson, Minister of Government and Consumer Services. ""Long wait times and elevator outages have been a long-standing and frustrating issue for people, particularly those with accessibility needs. We are responding to the concerns of the Auditor General of Ontario and, at the same time, we want to assure all Ontarians that they have a voice in helping us create stronger rules to protect them."" The government is working with the TSSA to enhance elevator safety and availability, and help consumers, including those with accessibility needs to make more informed choices as homebuyers and renters. As part of these enhancements, the TSSA would be required to publish elevator outage data for residential buildings online, providing valuable information that will help consumers make better-informed decisions about their future homes. Ontarians can share their input online until August 4, 2020.

Quick Facts

Elevators are among the safest modes of transportation. The TSSA’s annual safety data shows the number of elevator incidents in Ontario is consistently low each year, with an average of 9.41 injuries/million people/year (2008-2019).
There are approximately 58,700 elevators in Ontario, of which almost 20,000 are located in residential buildings. 
The Auditor General of Ontario’s 2018 Value for Money Audit and the TSSA Elevator Availability Study in Ontario authored by former Superior Court Justice Douglas Cunningham, both stated that better enforcement of elevator maintenance requirements may lead to improved safety outcomes.
The TSSA is an independent administrative authority that administers and enforces the Technical Standards and Safety Act, including its regulations related to elevating devices and the certification and training of elevating device mechanics. The TSSA licenses and inspects Ontario’s elevating devices (e.g., elevators, escalators, and lifts).

Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade


TORONTO — Today, Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade issued the following statement on the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA):
""The Ontario government welcomes the implementation of this important trade agreement and looks forward to the greater certainty it provides to help businesses grow and protect jobs across the continent. Nearly one in five Ontario jobs depend on trade, and approximately $400 billion CAD in two-way trade in goods travels across the U.S. and Canadian border in Ontario every year. We know that ensuring strong trade ties is vital to businesses and the communities they support on both sides of the border. Our government's top priority during the negotiations was to protect jobs for the hard-working people of Ontario. I want to thank the leaders and negotiators from all three countries who worked long hours and reached across party lines to secure this critical deal. The economic impact of COVID-19 has demonstrated the need to continue forging mutually beneficial partnerships and ensure Ontario businesses have access to the world's markets. The joint relationship between Ontario and the U.S. has always been strong, and as we proceed on our path to economic recovery it has never been more important to strengthen this relationship for the benefit of businesses, workers, and consumers in both jurisdictions. Our government will continue to support Ontario businesses and Ontario workers, including our aluminum and steel industry, farmers and our vital agri-food sector. The strength of our trading relationship will be integral for these industries over the coming months, and we will continue to take decisive action to put us in a position to reduce risks and provide the fiscal certainty that will see our economies recover faster. Strengthening our unique trading partnership will only ensure that everyday consumers, workers, and businesses can emerge from this period of economic uncertainty in a position of strength. Ontario's commitment to building bridges and not barriers remains unchanged. Today marks an important step that will ensure a prosperous way forward together.""

TORONTO — Today, Premier Doug Ford issued the following statement to mark Canada Day:
""As we celebrate Canada's 153rd birthday, I want to reflect on a year that has been unlike any other, one of the darkest periods in Ontario's history. The COVID-19 pandemic touched everyone in the province, creating personal and financial hardship and resulting in losses far greater than anyone could have imagined. As a country, as a province and as a people, Canadians have always come together in the face of adversity and worked together to defeat the threats we faced. The past few months have been no exception. We have had each other's backs and stepped up in thousands of ways to combat this threat, support our frontline health care workers, protect our most vulnerable, and do our part to stay home and stop the spread. Hundreds of Ontario businesses retooled their operations, turning Ontario's manufacturing might to make the critical personal protective equipment and medical supplies we need to fight this deadly virus. Ontario's best and brightest minds are leading the country in clinical trials and research for vaccines, treatments, and rapid testing methods to help save lives. Today, we celebrate not only our great country, but all those people who have worked tirelessly to protect us and our families, keep food on our tables, and get us through tough times. Their compassion, generosity, grit, and determination in the face of a global pandemic should make us all proud to be Canadian. In the months ahead, the Ontario spirit will continue to inspire us as we rebuild and ensure our province comes back stronger and more prosperous than ever before. Whether you're celebrating at the cottage, in a park, on a patio or at home this Canada Day, please remember to stay safe and act responsibly by following public health advice. Avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people, stay two metres apart from anyone not in your social circle, wear a mask when physical distancing is a challenge, and wash your hands frequently. Being considerate of others is the Canadian way. From my family to yours, wishing everyone a safe and happy Canada Day!""

Changes Come into Force on Canada Day

June 30, 2020  9:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


The following legislation and regulation changes will come into effect on July 1, 2020. They are listed by responsible ministry:
Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs To ensure the continued protection of animal health, a regulatory amendment to the Livestock Medicines Act will extend outlet licences for an additional year so they can continue to supply medicines to the farm community. This will ensure uninterrupted licencing of Outlets until a new regulatory regime is put in place. There will be no cost associated with the extension of permanent Class 1 licences to July 31, 2021 for all currently licensed Livestock Medicines Outlets. The licence extension amendment does not apply to Class 2 licences or new Class 1 applicants. In these cases, existing licencing requirements and fees would still apply. Ministry of the Attorney General and Treasury Board Secretariat An amendment to a regulation under the Adjudicative Tribunals Accountability, Governance and Appointments Act will create ""Ontario Land Tribunals."" This new organization will combine the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal, Board of Negotiation, Conservation Review Board, Environmental Review Tribunal and Mining and Lands Tribunal. It will help ensure Ontario's land tribunals have the dedicated support and resources to resolve disputes fairly and faster. Ministry of Colleges and Universities An amendment to the Ontario College of Art & Design University Act would provide the university with full degree-granting authority, including honorary degrees. It would allow the university to award degrees, certificates and diplomas in any and all branches of learning provided they are consistent with the objective of providing advanced education in art and design and supporting teaching, research and professional practice in these fields. Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines As part of its commitment to reducing regulatory burden and red tape for Ontario's electricity sector, the government will repeal the Ontario Clean Energy Benefit Act (OCEBA), revoke two regulations made under the OCEBA and amend the Definitions and Exemptions regulation under the Ontario Energy Board Act to remove reference to the OCEBA. The OCEBA and the associated Ontario Clean Energy Benefit program were established in 2010 to help lower electricity costs for Ontarians through a 10 per cent rebate on the total cost of electricity charges related to electricity consumption on eligible bills. The Ontario Clean Energy Benefit program ended on December 31, 2015 and was replaced by the Ontario Electricity Support Program, which helps reduce electricity costs for low-income households. An amendment to the Energy and Water Efficiency — Appliances and Products regulation (Ontario Regulation 509/18) under the Electricity Act will set or increase minimum energy-performance standards for 10 energy products by: Updating eight products to higher efficiency levels in order to harmonize with current Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) standards. These products include commercial gas storage water heaters; residential gas instantaneous water heaters; commercial gas instantaneous water heaters; residential gas furnaces; commercial gas boilers; commercial oil boilers; residential gas boilers; and gas fireplacesAdding commercial oil-fired storage water heaters, which are currently regulated by NRCan and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to Ontario's regulation, and harmonizing with NRCan and DOE standardsHarmonizing Ontario's efficiency standards for residential windows with Ontario Building Code minimum requirements.Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks In order to provide added flexibility in transit planning — reducing the risk of delays while still providing environmental oversight and consultation with the public and Indigenous communities — the current environmental assessment process will be modified so that construction on the Ontario Line subway project can proceed as quickly as possible and so any significant design changes to the Scarborough and Yonge North subway extensions and the Eglinton Crosstown West extension proceed as efficiently as possible. As part of the government's efforts to encourage brownfield redevelopment and put vacant lands back to good use, regulatory amendments under the Environmental Protection Act will clarify rules for developing sites where groundwater is not to be used for drinking water. The government is bringing forward smart, sensible solutions to keep our communities healthier and safer, while creating an open-for-business environment, by supporting the waste management sector through a regulatory amendment to the Environmental Protection Act. This amendment clarifies that waste transportation systems, which are already exempt under Ontario Regulation 101/94, are not required to use the Environment Activity and Sector Registry. The government is modernizing programs and services and lowering costs for the people of Ontario by allowing producers to find new and innovative ways to reduce costs, manage their products and packaging more efficiently and reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills. The Batteries regulation (Ontario Regulation 30/20) under the Resource Recovery and Circular Economy Act makes battery producers fully responsible for managing their products. This new regulation will give them more control over how they manage their waste and dispose of batteries safely. As part of our commitment to support a healthy environment and a healthy economy, these changes will ensure we are maintaining strong enforcement and environmental compliance while making Ontario open for business.  The government is updating the almost 50-year-old environmental assessment program to support building safer and stronger communities. As part of these efforts, the ministry will remove the duplicative requirements for forestry activities in the Declaration Order under the Environmental Assessment Act. Forestry activities will continue under the Crown Forest Sustainability Act, which will help ensure the government is able to protect the environment while allowing the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry to be the primary source of direction for forest management in Ontario. The temporary approach for forestry operations on Crown land under the Endangered Species Act has been extended for an additional year. This will maintain the current requirements for the forestry sector by helping to avoid additional regulatory burden and economic strain while a long-term approach is being considered. Ministry of Finance Regulation amendments under the Investment Management Corporation of Ontario Act will enable the Investment Management Corporation of Ontario (IMCO) to continue to manage the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board's (WSIB) pension assets when the WSIB plan becomes a jointly sponsored pension plan (JSPP). It will also enable certain other broader public sector JSPPs to use IMCO to manage their pension assets in the future. Further amendments to the Pensions Benefits Act, Regulation 909 (General) will help facilitate an efficient and effective pension regulatory system in Canada. Ontario has recently signed the 2020 Agreement Respecting Multi-Jurisdictional Pension Plans (MJPPA) along with the federal government and other provinces. As of July 1, 2020, this new agreement will replace a prior agreement from 2016 and will simplify and clarify the supervision of pension plans with members in more than one jurisdiction. Ministry of Health The government is expanding Ontario's newborn screening program to include screening tests for Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Hurler Disease and its variants — becoming the first province in Canada to offer screening for these serious diseases. A regulatory amendment to the Laboratory and Specimen Collection Centre Licensing Act will add mucopolysaccharidosis type 1 and spinal muscular atrophy to the list of Newborn Screening Tests and permit midwives to order them. A complementary amendment to the Health Insurance Act will add the Newborn Screening Tests for mucopolysaccharidosis type 1 and spinal muscular atrophy as an insured service to the Schedule of Benefits for Laboratory Services. Babies across the province will be able to receive earlier diagnosis and interventions for these diseases so they can be as healthy as possible. The government continues its comprehensive approach to protecting youth from vaping. As part of the Smoke-Free Ontario Act, certain provisions coming into force on July 1 will: Restrict the retail sale of flavoured vapour products to Specialty Vape Stores and Cannabis Retail Stores, except for menthol, mint and tobacco flavoursRequire Specialty Vape Stores to ensure that indoor vapour product displays and promotions are not visible from outside their storesRestrict the retail sale of vapour products with high nicotine concentrations (>20 mg/ml) to Specialty Vape Stores.Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development As part of the government's commitment to keeping workers safe, an amendment to the Occupational Health and Safety Act will add or revise occupational exposure limits or listings for 36 substances, including warfarin, furfural and ethylene glycol. As of July 1, regulations under the Ontario Immigration Act have been amended. More eligible occupations in the manufacturing sector will be added to the In-Demand Stream of the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program's Employer Job Offer Category. Also, applicants to this stream will no longer have to demonstrate they have settlement funds. Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing Ontario's Community Housing Renewal Strategy outlines the government's plan to transform a fragmented and inefficient system into one that is more streamlined, sustainable and ready to help those who need it most. One of the early steps in the strategy was to make rent more predictable by simplifying rent calculations. A new regulation and regulation amendment under the Housing Services Act will make calculating rent-geared-to-income (RGI) faster for housing providers and easier for social housing tenants to predict and understand. This includes: Moving to an annual calculation based on 30 per cent of adjusted family net incomeSimplified deductions on employment incomeExempting income earned by full-time studentsMinimum rent amountsSetting effective dates of rent increases and decreases.Under the new rules, a household will remain eligible for RGI assistance for a longer period of time while paying market rent and household members will generally be required to file an income tax return. Changes were also made to align the province's Portable Housing Benefit Framework with changes to the calculation of RGI assistance. In spring 2019, the government launched the More Homes, More Choice plan with changes to make it faster and easier to build housing, including rental housing, and to build the right types of homes in the right places. A regulatory amendment under the Residential Tenancies Act will modernize outdated practices, such as the need to submit CD-ROMs with certain Landlord and Tenant Board applications, making it easier to be a landlord. Five Planning Act regulations are being revoked to remove the need for provincial approvals of highly technical local planning matters in unincorporated areas of northeastern and northwestern Ontario. Amendments to regulations under the Planning Act will enable 16 northern communities to move forward with local planning decisions faster.

Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry Changes to the Independent Forest Audit regulation will improve transparency and provide time and cost savings for industry and government. These changes include: Allowing final audit reports and action plans to be posted online instead of requiring them to be reported to the Legislative AssemblyEstablishing a 10-year audit period with the possibility of a two-year extension and providing greater flexibility to schedule audits.The Nurseries regulation under the Forestry Act has been identified as outdated and no longer in use. Tree seedlings for forest renewal on Crown land have been produced exclusively by private growers for many years, so this unnecessary regulation will be revoked.  A number of changes to the four Forest Manuals regulated under the Crown Forest Sustainability Act will allow for more effective consultation and reduce workload, time and costs in the preparation and implementation of forest management plans, while maintaining rigorous oversight and sustainable management of Ontario's Crown forests. A regulation under the Aggregate Resources Act will be amended to continue to outline requirements for forestry aggregate pits in the proposed revised Forest Manuals. This will simplify how the requirements are identified for forestry aggregate pits to support people engaged in forest operations. Ministry of Transportation Ontario is committed to making life more affordable for people and families in response to COVID-19. That is why there will be no increase to driver and commercial vehicle fees that would have taken effect July 1, 2020. The government is making historic investments in our provincial highways in order to reduce congestion and make our roads safer. Following a successful eight-year pilot, single-occupant use of provincial High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes by licenced taxicabs and airport limousines will be made permanent by removing the sunset provision through an amendment to the Highway Traffic Act, Ontario Regulation 620/05 — High Occupancy Vehicle Lanes. Making the exemption permanent will encourage more efficient use of the HOV transportation network by allowing taxis and limousines to reach their next passenger more quickly and support accessibility for people who cannot or choose not to drive. Various changes to regulations under the Highway Traffic Act will: Expand the type of off-road vehicles permitted on roads to include off-road motorcycles, dirt bikes and extreme-terrain vehicles, commonly known as ARGOs. This will allow users to access more trail networks across the province by lifting some of the existing restrictions. These new off-road vehicles will be required to follow most of the same operating rules as existing off-road vehicles permitted on roads, including:G2/M2 licencing minimumRegistration and insuranceSpeed under 50km/h for roadsAlways riding on the shoulder in the same direction as traffic or, when unavailable, right-most portion of the roadwayThese changes will provide for increased regulatory flexibility, allow greater municipal choice over operation on municipal roads and transfer regulation-making authority from the Lieutenant Governor in Council to the MinisterMoving forward with annual inspections for mobile cranes and concrete pumps. An inspection must be completed at a licenced Motor Vehicle Inspection Station by January 1, 2021 and July 1, 2021 dependent on vehicle category. The Ministry of Transportation will continue to work with industry and ministerial partners on long-term solutions to address concerns related to qualified technicians and appropriate inspection frequencyImplement an additional licensing option for full Class G licence holders or higher (Class A, B, C, D, E, F) wishing to operate a three-wheeled motorcycle. This option would allow full Class G licence holders or higher to attend a ministry-approved school in the Driver Certification Program, pay the associated fee and complete an approved one-day safety course, including in-class and on-road testing, and receive a restricted three-wheeled motorcycle licence."

Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade


TORONTO — The Ontario Government is celebrating International Small Business Week with the launch of the ""Shop Local! Shop Safe! Shop with Confidence!"" campaign, encouraging Ontarians to support their local small businesses and to shop safely while doing so.
""The countless stories of success from our diverse small business community is living proof that Ontario is a place to grow and achieve big dreams,"" said Prabmeet Sarkaria, Associate Minister of Small Business. ""All of our small businesses supported the fight against COVID-19, many by closing their doors for several months—now it's our turn to help support their recovery. When Ontarians Shop Local, Shop Safe and Shop with Confidence, we're doing our  part to ensure the future vitality of our main streets, our communities and our province."" The province's campaign asks for mayors, local leaders and groups to support our small businesses by committing on social media to ""Shop Local, Shop Safe, Shop with Confidence,"" while highlighting the best practices put in place by businesses to help keep shoppers safe while ensuring that the reopening of Ontario continues to be a success. For example, the principles of the People Outside Safely Together (POST) Promise encourage small businesses to strictly follow health guidelines and reopen with appropriate measures in place, so consumers can shop safely and with confidence, including:  Washing and sanitizing handsMaintaining physical distancingStaying home if unwellPracticing respiratory etiquetteCleaning and disinfecting regularly   ""The Retail Council of Canada is strengthened by the contributions of our diverse membership, and we're delighted join the Government of Ontario in supporting our main street retail businesses and indeed all retailers across the province,"" said Diane J.

Provincial Task Force to Look at Improving Safety, Consumer Protections and Industry Standards

June 29, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO ― The Ontario government is establishing a task force to improve provincial oversight of the towing industry. The task force will help develop a regulatory model that will increase safety and enforcement, clarify protections for consumers, improve industry standards and consider tougher penalties for violators. The government is taking this action in response to concerns raised about incidents of criminal activity and violence in the towing industry.
Details were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation, and Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General. ""The party's over for the bad actors who are engaged in violence and criminal activity in the towing industry. We're going to keep working with our police partners to bring these criminals to justice,"" said Premier Ford. ""Setting up this task force will help us bring together experts to develop ways to better protect drivers, operators and inspectors."" The task force will review a number of topics related to the towing industry, which could include provincial oversight of safety, consumer protection, improved industry standards, training and background checks. As part of the review, the task force may consider opportunities for increased protections for consumers against the first-to-scene unethical business practices, insurance savings through a crackdown on insurance fraud rings or improved consumer choice for payments and repairs. The province is also reviewing ways to improve our transportation system by clearing accidents more quickly which would minimize lane reductions and reduce congestion on our highways. ""Most tow truck operators in Ontario are responsible and play a critical role in keeping our roadways safe. However, like all people of Ontario, our government is concerned about the recent reported incidents of violence in the towing industry,"" said Minister Mulroney. ""We are committed to ensuring a higher standard for the tow truck industry and are looking at ways to provide greater oversight of the industry to keep our roads and highways among the safest in North America."" ""When Ontarians are stranded on the side of the road, they need to know their calls will be answered by towing service providers who act safely, ethically and within the law,"" said Solicitor General Jones. ""The task force will help us determine tougher standards for the industry as part of our government's commitment to build safer communities."" Membership of the task force will include representatives from the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of the Solicitor General, the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, the Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development, the Ministry of Finance and the Ontario Provincial Police. Once the task force has developed proposals for discussion and comment, it will be consulting with industry, municipalities, and public safety experts. ""Since I first tabled a Private Members' Bill over five years ago calling for better oversight on our roads, the violence and extortion within the towing industry has rapidly escalated,"" said Gila Martow, MPP for Thornhill. ""I look forward to the seeing strengthened provincial oversight of the tow truck industry so we can keep everyone safe.""

Quick Facts

There are approximately 1,600 tow truck companies registered in the Ministry of Transportation’s Commercial Vehicle Operator’s Registration (CVOR) program. A valid CVOR certificate is required to operate a tow truck.

The Consumer Protection Act contains specific tow and storage services rules to help protect consumers who need a tow or roadside assistance in Ontario. The Ontario government is currently reviewing the Act and consumers can provide input through a survey until July 17, 2020, on a number of issues, including towing.

Canada and Ontario invest in a more sustainable Belleville with improved active transportation and public transit infrastructure

Ministry of Infrastructure


BELLEVILLE — The health and well-being of Canadians are the top priorities of the Governments of Canada and Ontario. But the COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than Canadians' personal health. It is having a profound effect on the economy.
That is why governments have been taking decisive action to support families, businesses and communities, and continue to look ahead to see what more can be done. Strategic investments in public transit and active transportation infrastructure are important to building sustainable communities. These investments support a healthy environment and help Ontarians get to work, school, and essential services. Today, Neil Ellis, Member of Parliament for Bay of Quinte, on behalf of the Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities; the Honourable Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services and Member of Provincial Parliament for Bay of Quinte, on behalf of the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure; and His Worship Mitch Panciuk, Mayor of the City of Belleville announced funding for two projects that will increase the size of Belleville's public transit fleet while making it easier for residents and visitors to use. The first project involves the expansion of public transit and active transportation infrastructure in Belleville's North East Industrial Park. The construction of three kilometers of new sidewalk and a one kilometre accessible multi-use path will provide commuters with direct access to the city's public transit system. The addition of new bus stops and transit shelters, all fully accessible, will help meet the growing needs of transit users in this busy commercial area. The second project consists of the purchase of four new buses which will be added to the existing bus fleet. The new buses will lead to increased service levels on the busiest bus routes and also expand transit service to underserved areas of the city. Together, these investments will make it easier for pedestrians and cyclists to safely access the public transit system. The Government of Canada is investing more than $1.3 million in the North East Industrial Park active transportation and transit shelters project, and contributing over $1.3 million to the purchase of four buses through the Public Transit Infrastructure stream of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Ontario is also contributing over $2.2 million to improve public transit in the community, with nearly $1.1 million towards the North East Industrial Park and more than $1.1 million towards new bus purchases and overall transit expansion. The City of Belleville's contribution is nearly $2 million.

Quick Facts

Through the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities.
$28.7 billion of this funding is supporting public transit projects, including $5 billion available for investment through the Canada Infrastructure Bank.
Across the province, Ontario is investing more than $7.3 billion in public transit infrastructure over 10 years through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program.

“Connecting active transportation networks to modern public transit systems is essential to building healthy, sustainable communities. These investments will improve the accessibility and reliability of the transit system that many Belleville residents rely on each day to access local services and get around the city. We are working with our partners to build better public transit that contributes to liveable communities for generations to come.”

											Neil Ellis
									

										Member of Parliament for Bay of Quinte on behalf of the Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities
									




“Public transportation provides a vital link to necessities like education, employment, health care and recreation within our Bay of Quinte communities. Ontario’s over $2.2 million investment to improve transit access to Belleville's North East Industrial Park and upgrade its bus fleet will provide strong connections and opportunities for the city's residents and businesses.”

											The Honourable Todd Smith
									

										Minister of Children, Community and Social Services and Member of Provincial Parliament for Bay of Quinte, on behalf of the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario’s Minister of Infrastructure
									




“We are so very pleased to have federal and provincial support to help us make these positive changes in our public transit infrastructure and active transportation. This investment will benefit residents going to and from work, and also ease employer concerns regarding their employees getting to work safely. Our local economy will be strengthened by these improvements as they support workers and employers alike.”

And during this unprecedented time, we are grateful for these brave individuals who confront the unique challenges of their jobs with the added stress of exposure to COVID-19. Today, on PTSD Awareness Day, we recognize the effects post-traumatic stress can have on the lives of those affected by it and reaffirm our commitment to protecting the health and well-being of our frontline heroes.""  — Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General  ""PTSD can have a significant impact on all of us, especially those who have dedicated their lives to serving others. This year, our health care heroes have demonstrated incredible strength and dedication in our fight against COVID-19. That's why our government has expanded online mental health resources like internet-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy to ensure our health care frontline heroes have fast and easy access to services they need during this unprecedented time."" - Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health ""Every day, PTSD touches the lives of people and their families across Ontario, including our frontline heroes. Earlier this year, our government unveiled Roadmap to Wellness: A Plan to Build Ontario's Mental Health and Addictions System. Through our plan, we will address the unique needs of those impacted by work-related stress or trauma. We look forward to engaging with all first responders, so we can ensure they have access to the highest quality services and supports, where and when they need them."" - Michael Tibollo, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions  ""PTSD is a significant risk to the health and well-being of our frontline workers, especially now during the COVID-19 outbreak. These brave individuals are there for us when we need them, and it is our duty to return that support. That is why, last year, I was proud to table the PTSD Awareness Act and demonstrate our government's commitment to making mental health a priority. Now more than ever, we must acknowledge the threat of PTSD and its impacts on Ontarians."" — Will Bouma, MPP for Brantford-Brant   Where to Find Help  For Ontarians currently receiving mental health and addictions services and supports, please contact your current service provider to learn about potential virtual care options. Ontarians interested in public addictions services and mental health services for those over 18, can contact ConnexOntario, Ontario's mental health, addictions and problem gambling help line at 1-866-531-2600. Children and youth under 18 can locate mental health services through the Ontario.ca and Kids Help Phone websites, or contact Kids Help Phone (1-800-668-6868) for 24/7 telephone support if they need someone to talk to. Good2Talk is a free, confidential mental health support service providing professional counselling and information and referrals for mental health, addictions and well-being to postsecondary students in Ontario, 24/7/365.

Ontario Extends Emergency Orders to July 10 
As more communities enter Stage 2, maintaining health and safety protocols remains a top priority 

June 27, 2020  7:00 A.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government has extended all emergency orders currently in force that were made under s.7.0.2 (4) of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act until July 10, 2020, while removing restrictions that were limiting access to certain sport training facilities. This decision was made in consultation with Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health to ensure the safe and gradual reopening of the province on a regional basis can continue as part of Ontario's Framework for Reopening the Province.
The extension of the emergency orders will allow key measures needed in the fight against COVID-19 to continue, including allowing frontline health care providers and public health units to redeploy staff where they are needed most, while providing the government with the tools it needs to successfully steer the province through the next stage of reopening and beyond. ""While we have made truly incredible progress in our fight against COVID-19, thanks to the collective efforts of our frontline heroes and the people of Ontario, we know that we must remain vigilant,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""These emergency orders will allow us to take action, if necessary, to ensure our continued success as we reopen our province and get more people back to work."" In addition, the government has removed certain restrictions for Stage 2 indoor sports and recreational fitness activities facilities. This will enable the facilities to be used by more businesses and organizations to train amateur or professional athletes, or to run certain non-contact amateur or professional athletic competitions. In all cases, facility owners would only be able to permit activities to occur in a way that meets public health requirements. These changes will also enable many sports and recreational organizations around the province to again offer  sport training programming, helping more people return to sport in Ontario. On June 24, Ontario announced the extension of the Declaration of Emergency to July 15, allowing the province to continue to make or amend emergency orders under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act. The government continues to review all these emergency orders to determine when and if it is safe to amend or lift them as restrictions are eased and more places in the province reopen in a safe and measured way. A full list of emergency orders can be found on the e-Laws website under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act and at Ontario.ca/alert.

Ontario Provides Stable Electricity Pricing for Industrial and Commercial Companies 
Province provides predictable electricity rates for two years

June 26, 2020  3:30 P.M.

Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines


TORONTO - The Ontario government is helping large industrial and commercial companies return to full levels of operation without the fear of electricity costs spiking by providing more stable electricity pricing for two years. Effective immediately, companies that participate in the Industrial Conservation Initiative (ICI) will not be required to reduce their electricity usage during peak hours, as their proportion of Global Adjustment (GA) charges for these companies will be frozen.
""Ontario's industrial and commercial electricity consumers continue to experience unprecedented economic challenges during COVID-19,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines. ""Today's announcement will allow large industrial employers to focus on getting their operations up and running and employees back to work, instead of adjusting operations in response to peak electricity demand hours."" Due to COVID-19, electricity consumption in Ontario has been below average and the province is forecast to have a reliable supply of electricity to accommodate increased usage. Peak hours generally occur during the summer when the weather is hot and electricity demand from cooling systems is high. ""Today's action will reduce the burden of anticipating and responding to peak hours for more than 1,300 ICI participants with 2,000 primarily industrial facilities in Ontario,"" said Bill Walker, Associate Minister of Energy. ""Now these large employers can focus on getting their operations back up and running at full tilt."" The government previously announced it was providing temporary relief for industrial and commercial electricity consumers that do not participate in the Regulated Price Plan (RPP) by deferring a portion of GA charges for April, May and June 2020.

Quick Facts

ICI provides an incentive for eligible electricity consumers to reduce their consumption during peak hours to reduce their costs.
New ICI participants for the 2021-22 program year will not be affected; they will be assessed on their electricity consumption during peak hours in 2020-21.

Ontario Providing Additional Support for Seniors 
Provincewide Grant Program Will Promote Safety, Community Engagement and Financial Security

June 26, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government is providing up to $4 million for the Seniors Community Grant Program, a significant increase over last year. This funding will help non-profit organizations, local services boards, or Indigenous groups develop programs for seniors that focus on combatting social isolation, promoting seniors' safety and well-being, improving financial security and making communities age-friendly.
The announcement was made today by Premier Doug Ford and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""It's incredibly important to ensure our seniors have the supports they need to live full, rich and socially active lives, especially during this pandemic,"" said Premier Ford. ""Many have been staying home to help stop the spread of COVID-19. As the province gradually reopens, this funding will go towards establishing virtual seniors' tours, offering programs to combat elder abuse and developing age-friendly communities through initiatives like making outdoor spaces more accessible for seniors."" This year's grants will range from $1,000 to $100,000 and will fund projects that will: Help older individuals and couples receive the support they need in their community;Ensure seniors are less at risk for neglect, abuse and fraud, and that their rights and dignity are protected​;Ensure more older adults are connected and engaged, reducing social isolation;​​ and,Provide more opportunities for older adults in employment and volunteering, achieving greater financial security and engagement within the community.""The past several months have been difficult for seniors, as many have stayed home in self isolation to help prevent the virus from spreading,"" said Minister Elliott. ""Through the Seniors Community Grant Program, our older adults will be getting out more to take part in various activities. When going out, seniors must continue to follow public health advice and practise physical distancing, wear a face covering when physical distancing is a challenge, wash hands frequently, and stay home when ill. This is the best way to keep everyone safe."" In the past, the Seniors Community Grant Program has supported community-based activities like seniors' fitness classes, lawn bowling, brain fitness activities, multicultural dance, along with a public education and awareness campaign that challenges the myths and stereotypes that portray older adults as frail, out-of-touch, technologically illiterate, and no longer employable. ""Although many seniors have been socially isolated to stay safe from COVID-19, our government is committed to ensure they stay connected and physically active, especially now when the province is gradually starting to reopen,"" said Raymond Cho, Minister for Seniors and Accessibility. ""We want to help them maintain their autonomy and independence, while supporting their physical, mental and social well-being."" The application period for the Seniors Community Grant Program is now open and will close on August 7, 2020. Unincorporated and incorporated not-for-profit organizations, local services boards, or Indigenous groups must submit applications to Transfer Payment Ontario (formerly Grants Ontario) online at Ontario.ca/GetFunding. ""Each year, the Seniors Community Grant program makes a difference in the lives of many older Ontarians by creating meaningful opportunities for them to connect with their communities,"" said Sue Hesjedahl, Executive Director of the Older Adult Centres' Association of Ontario. ""This year, supporting that connection is even more important and the SCG program will ensure seniors across the province can still engage with what matters most to them while staying safe and healthy.""

Quick Facts

Since the Seniors Community Grant Program was established in 2014, nearly 1,900 grants have been provided, which have positively impacted the lives of more than half a million seniors.

By 2023, there will be three million Ontarians over the age of 65. Older adults are the province’s fastest growing demographic.

Annual Rabies Bait Drop To Begin
Province Committed to Eliminating the Threat of Rabies in Ontario’s Wildlife

June 26, 2020  9:00 A.M.

Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry


The Ontario government is continuing to protect people and animals against rabies with an annual bait drop.
The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry will distribute rabies vaccine baits for wildlife throughout southern Ontario, by aircraft in rural areas and by hand in urban centres. Baits help to immunize most raccoons, skunks and foxes that eat them. Hand baiting in urban areas will begin June 29 in Toronto, Peel, Wellington, Halton, Waterloo, Dufferin, Perth, Middlesex, Oxford, Elgin, Haldimand-Norfolk, Niagara, Hamilton, Six Nations (Ohsweken) in Brant, Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry counties. It will also occur in the city of Cornwall in mid-August. Hand baiting targets urban skunk and raccoon habitat where the use of aircraft would not be feasible. Staff distribute the baits by hand in urban areas, focusing on raccoon and skunk habitat, such as bushes, green spaces and ravines where animals may forage, or along fence lines, hedges and large culverts. Baits are not distributed near schools, playgrounds, or in yards with toys where children are likely to be present. Baiting by aircraft will happen on August 6 in Frontenac and Leeds and Grenville counties. Baiting by aircraft will start August 17 in Brant, Bruce, Dufferin, Elgin, Grey, Haldimand, Halton, Hamilton, Huron, Middlesex, Metro Toronto, Niagara, Norfolk, Oxford, Peel, Perth, Simcoe, Waterloo, and Wellington. All baiting dates are subject to change depending on weather conditions. The khaki-green coloured bait is made of wax-fat and smells like marshmallow to attract animals. A label with a toll-free telephone number (1-888-574-6656) and the message ""Do not eat"" are printed on the exterior of the bait and a plastic package containing the liquid rabies vaccine is embedded in the centre. If found, the bait should not be touched, but left for raccoons, skunks and foxes to consume. For further information about rabies in Ontario, please visit Ontario.ca/rabies or contact the ministry's rabies information line at 1-888-574-6656.

Quick Facts

Wildlife Technicians will be following all public health guidelines during the bait drop, including physical distancing, wearing appropriate protective equipment (masks and gloves), and hand washing/sanitizing. 
It is not harmful to a pet or person if a bait is consumed by mistake. However, contacting a doctor or veterinarian as a precaution is recommended. 
Ontario’s bait drop program is one of the most successful rabies control programs in North America. 
Since the start of a rabies outbreak in 2015 – the first of its kind in over a decade – the ministry has taken action to protect communities by distributing over five million vaccine baits, focusing on a 50-km area around where all the rabies cases were discovered.
Since 2016, rabies cases have declined in Ontario by approximately 50 per cent each year.
If a person contracts rabies and does not receive treatment, the disease is fatal.

Ministry of Infrastructure


CORNWALL — The health and well-being of Canadians are the top priorities of the governments of Canada and Ontario. But the COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than Canadians' personal health. It is having a profound effect on the economy.
That is why governments have been taking decisive action to support families, businesses and communities, and continue to look ahead to see what more can be done. Strategic investments in public transit infrastructure play a key role in ensuring Ontarians can get to work, school and essential services on time, and safely back home at the end of the day. Mark Gerretsen, Member of Parliament for Kingston and the Islands, on behalf of the Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities; the Honourable Steve Clark, Ontario's Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing and Member of Provincial Parliament for Leeds─Grenville─Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes, on behalf of the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure; Jim McDonell, Member of Provincial Parliament for Stormont-Dundas─South Glengarry; her Worship Bernadette Clement, Mayor of Cornwall; and his Worship Jason Baker, Mayor of Brockville, today announced funding for six public transit and accessible transportation projects in Cornwall and Brockville, Ontario. The five Cornwall projects involve the installation of 10 new bus shelters and 60 fully accessible bus stops, and the replacement of 12 conventional buses and eight para transit buses. The installation of 90 surveillance cameras, 15 new passenger counters and 26 electronic fare-boxes will enhance the passenger experience and provide better security to the public. These investments will encourage more residents to choose public transit by providing them with greater accessibility and safer public transit in Cornwall. Brockville will see the replacement of five buses for Brockville Transit to the existing fleet, from 2021 to 2027. The buses are commercial minibuses equipped with an accessible lift. All buses in the replacement fleet will have automated stop announcement systems, fare counting aids and improved rider metric collection devices, allowing for better safety, accessibility and route planning. The Government of Canada is investing over $5.1 million in these projects through the Public Transit Infrastructure Stream (PTIS) of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Ontario is contributing more than $4.1 million while the City of Cornwall is contributing over $3.0 million and the City of Brockville is contributing $210,076 in their respective projects

Quick Facts

Through the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities.
$28.7 billion of this funding is supporting public transit projects, including $5 billion available for investment through the Canada Infrastructure Bank.
Across the province, Ontario is investing more than $7.3 billion in public transit infrastructure over 10 years through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program.

The 2020 Youth Opportunities Fund will provide financial support to 43 community organizations that will benefit youth aged 12 to 25, and their families. Projects receiving funding this year include: Black Moms Connection ― focusing on economic empowerment for Black mothers across the Greater Toronto Area (GTA).Immigrants francophones d'Afrique pour l'intégration et le développement (IFAPID)― to support newcomers from Francophone African nations to navigate financial systems in Canada.Earthling Art Collective ― to provide development and mentorship opportunities for youth leaving care and the justice system in Thunder Bay.Miziwe Biik Aboriginal Employment & Training ― to help Indigenous youth in the GTA access employment and training opportunities in the skilled trades.     ""The Youth Opportunities Fund is a way for our government to form partnerships with grassroots projects and community leaders who are creating change.

Niagara Falls, Ontario, June 25, 2020—The health and well-being of Canadians are the top priorities of the Governments of Canada and Ontario. But the COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than Canadians' personal health. It is having a profound effect on the economy.
That is why governments have been taking decisive action to support families, businesses and communities, and continue to look ahead to see what more can be done. Strategic investments in public transit and active transportation infrastructure play a key role in ensuring Ontarians can get to work and essential services on time then safely back home at the end of the day.

New fare payment technology will enable customers to use one method of contactless payment to access all of the transit systems across Niagara Region. In Niagara Falls, the construction of a multi-modal hub on Bridge Street will increase access to local transit and transportation alternatives for residents using the GO regional transit system and help keep pedestrians safe in a traffic-centric location. In St. Catharines, 21 new buses and four new paratransit vehicles will add capacity to the existing bus fleet, encouraging more residents to choose public transit by providing them with more frequent and accessible bus service.  The projects announced today support a regional approach to public transit throughout Niagara, St. Catharines, Fort Erie, Port Colborne, and Welland to help build inclusive and resilient communities. By modernizing and expanding public transit systems in the region and connecting residents to active transportation alternatives, Ontarians can get around their communities safely while protecting the environment. The Government of Canada is investing over $31 million in these projects through the Public Transit Infrastructure Stream (PTIS) of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan.

Ontario Holds Back Leamington and Kingsville due to Higher Rates of COVID-19

June 24, 2020  7:30 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO —The Ontario government is allowing Windsor-Essex to move into Stage 2 of reopening on Thursday, June 25, 2020 at 12:01 a.m., with the exception of the Municipality of Leamington and the Town of Kingsville. These areas are being held back due to the higher transmission rates in the local agriculture and agri-food sector. This decision was made in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health and the local Medical Officer of Health of Windsor-Essex County Health Unit.
The announcement was made today by Premier Doug Ford, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health Christine Elliott and Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development Monte McNaughton. ""Our government is doing everything in our power to reopen every region of Ontario safely and gradually, and with today's announcement, the province is nearly all in Stage 2,"" said Premier Ford. ""Right now, we need to redouble our efforts to support the people in the Leamington and Kingsville areas, so that we can stop the spread of COVID-19 and get those remaining businesses and services open."" The majority of Windsor-Essex can reopen and move into Stage 2 as local data and information indicates there is lower transmission of COVID-19 in these areas. There is also sufficient hospital capacity, public health capacity to do rapid case and contact management, and a significant increase in testing. Outbreaks in agriculture and agri-food sectors pose unique challenges that require a targeted and collaborative response. Working with federal and local authorities, Ontario is implementing a three-point plan to support Leamington and Kingsville to move into Stage 2 as soon as it is safe to do so. Work is already underway to expand and provide ongoing on-site testing on work sites. The Chief Medical Officer of Health is also issuing public health guidance allowing positive asymptomatic workers to continue working as long as they follow the public health measures in their workplace to minimize the risk of transmission to others. This guidance will provide clarity and assurance that local public health officials will assist with interpreting test results and developing a plan that, first and foremost, ensures essential workers in the sector are able to return to work safely. ""We are able to open most of Windsor-Essex because of our collective efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19 in these communities,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""We will continue to provide the necessary support to Kingsville and Leamington so that they can safely move into Stage 2 as well when they are ready. Now more than ever, it remains critical to continue to follow public health advice, including physical distancing with those outside our social circle or household.""

Quick Facts

The three-point plan to support Windsor-Essex to move into Stage 2 includes ongoing and expanded on-site testing, access for workers to employment benefits and supports, and new public health guidance for positive asymptomatic workers for all workplaces.

There are two general assessment centres at Windsor Regional Hospital (Ouellette Campus) and Erie Shores Healthcare in Leamington. One additional assessment centre at the Nature Fresh Centre is ready to reopen should demand increase or to schedule specific times to accommodate testing for smaller farms.

Ontario Takes Immediate Action to Stop COVID-19 Outbreaks in Windsor-Essex 
Province Unveils Plan to Reduce Transmission on Farms and in the Community

June 24, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — In consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health and local public health officials, the Ontario government is implementing a three-point plan to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 on farms and throughout the community. Recent outbreaks, especially those in the agriculture and agri-food sectors, pose unique challenges that require a targeted response. By taking immediate action, health officials hope to stop the spread of the virus and move the region into Stage 2 as soon as it is safe to do so.
Details of the plan were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""We are doing everything we can to help Windsor-Essex contain this virus and get back on track, so we can allow local businesses to reopen and get more people back to work,"" said Premier Ford. ""Clearly, our agricultural sector in this part of the province is being hit particularly hard. Our three-point plan will give farmers the support they need to protect essential workers and ensure they can keep putting food safely on our tables."" The three-point plan builds on the work already underway by the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit and enhances the coordinated efforts of the province, federal and local authorities. The plan's three points are as follows: Ongoing and expanded on-site testingOntario is continuing to facilitate on-site testing at agri-food businesses and community assessment centres to make proactive testing more timely and accessible. About 350 asymptomatic workers have been tested at their work site since on-site testing launched this past weekend. Ontario is currently engaging employers to schedule more mobile testing on farms. Early identification of workers who are not showing symptoms, but who may be infected with COVID-19, will help reduce the potential spread of the virus in the workplace and the community. Access to Employment Benefits and SupportsTemporary foreign workers are entitled to the same benefits and protections as any other worker in Ontario. That includes workers' compensation benefits, which are administered by the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB). It also includes protections afforded by the Employment Standards Act. Under Ontario's new infectious disease emergency leave provisions, a worker's job is protected while they take unpaid leave due to COVID-19. In certain cases, temporary foreign workers may also be eligible to apply for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB). To access the federal benefit, workers must have earned $5,000 in the last 12 months or in the previous year. New Public Health GuidanceThe Chief Medical Officer of Health will issue new public health guidance allowing positive asymptomatic workers to continue working as long as they follow the public health measures in their workplace to minimize the risk of transmission to others. This guidance will provide clarity and assurance that local public health officials will assist with interpreting test results and developing a plan that, first and foremost, ensures essential workers in the sector are able to return to work safely and meet the business-critical operational needs on a case-by-case basis. ""By providing both farmers and employees with economic certainty, this three-point plan will allow the rapid scaling up of testing in agri-food sector workplaces across the region,"" said Minister Elliott. ""These targeted actions build on the collaborative and comprehensive response already in progress and will allow us to better identify and isolate cases so we can move this region into Stage 2 and safely reopen."" ""The safety of workers on farms and in greenhouses across the province is critically important as we work to overcome COVID-19,"" said Ernie Hardeman, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. ""They work incredibly hard to support our farmers as they plant, harvest and process the good things that grow here in Ontario. It is critical that we step up our efforts at this challenging time to protect these essential workers and ensure our local produce gets to market."" ""A worker's passport does not determine how they are treated in our system,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""That's not the Ontario way. If you're working in this province, I want you to know that your health and safety is a priority for our government."" The Chief Medical Officer of Health and health experts will continue to closely monitor the evolving situation in all regions of the province to advise when public health restrictions can be gradually loosened or adjusted if necessary. Although restrictions are being gradually relaxed in Stage 2, the government is strongly recommending that everyone in Ontario continue to follow public health advice, including physical distancing, wearing a face covering if physical distancing is a challenge, washing hands frequently and thoroughly, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth. If you think you have COVID-19 or have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19, get tested.

Quick Facts

More than 170 workplace health and safety resources, including guidelines, tip sheets are available at Ontario.ca/covidsafety. They include resources translated into French and Spanish specifically for the agricultural sector.

If an individual contracted COVID-19 while at work, they should tell their employer about their illness and any medical treatment received right away and file a claim to determine eligibility for WSIB benefits and services. Employers should report the case immediately to local public health officials and the Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development.
Local mobile teams comprised of staff from local hospitals, Ontario Health West Region, Erie St. Clair Local Health Integration Network home and community care services, emergency medical services, and interpreters are being deployed each day and are completing regular health check assessments on-site at farms for all referred who are positive and symptomatic.
There are two general assessment centres at Windsor Regional Hospital (Ouellette Campus) and Erie Shores Healthcare in Leamington. One additional assessment centre at the Nature Fresh Centre is ready to reopen should demand increase or to schedule specific times to accommodate testing for smaller farms.
Ontario has taken action to safeguard farm workers and protect the food supply, including providing up to $15 million in the Enhanced Agri-Food Workforce Protection program.
Stage 3 will focus on reopening more workplaces and community spaces, while carefully and gradually relaxing restrictions, and sustaining and expanding workplace health and safety guidance.
The province has developed a practical step-by-step guide to help Ontarians as they safely develop and join a social circle.

Canada and Ontario invest in public transit infrastructure for Peterborough residents 


June 24, 2020 11:30 A.M.

Ministry of Infrastructure


Peterborough — The health and well-being of Canadians are the top priorities of the governments of Canada and Ontario. But, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than Canadians' personal health. It is having a profound effect on the economy.
That is why governments have been taking decisive action to support families, businesses and communities and continue to look ahead to see what more can be done. Strategic investments in public transit infrastructure play a key role in ensuring Ontarians can get to work, school, and essential services on time and safely back home at the end of the day. The Honourable Maryam Monsef, Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Rural Economic Development and Member of Parliament for Peterborough-Kawartha; along with the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure; Dave Smith, Member of Provincial Parliament for Peterborough-Kawartha: and Her Worship Diane Therrien, Mayor of Peterborough, today announced funding for five public transit projects in the City of Peterborough and one project in the County of Peterborough. Public transit users will benefit from new buses and vans, as well as refurbished buses. These upgrades will increase the capacity and reliability of the fleet. They will also improve the quality of service for passengers. Four of the six projects include new or upgraded accessible vehicles, such as buses and special access vans. This will open up opportunities and improve the quality of life for people living with limited mobility in Peterborough, including Canadians who require specialized care. The Government of Canada is investing over $5.8 million in these projects through the Public Transit Infrastructure Stream (PTIS) of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Ontario is providing more than $4.76 million to the projects, while the City of Peterborough is contributing more than $3.67 million and the County of Peterborough is contributing over $18,000. This is one in a series of important project announcements that will be made across the province over the coming weeks. The governments of Canada and Ontario are working cooperatively to support jobs, improve communities, and build confidence, while safely and sustainably restoring economic growth.

Quick Facts

Through the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities.
$28.7 billion of this funding is supporting public transit projects, including $5 billion available for investment through the Canada Infrastructure Bank. 
Across the province, Ontario is investing more than $7.3 billion in public transit infrastructure over 10 years through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program.

Ontario Extends Declaration of Emergency to July 15
Province Focuses on Safe, Gradual Reopening of Regions 

June 24, 2020 11:15 A.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO ― In consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health, the Ontario government has extended the provincial Declaration of Emergency under s.7.0.7 of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act to July 15, 2020. This extension, approved by the Ontario Legislature earlier today, provides Ontario with the additional time, flexibility, and the necessary tools to safely and gradually allow more places to reopen, while continuing to support frontline health care providers in the fight against COVID-19.
""As we gradually and safely reopen our economy, our frontline care providers can continue to rely on these emergency orders to better protect our seniors and most vulnerable citizens and provide the flexibility to put resources where they're needed most,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""We are hopeful that another extension of the Declaration of Emergency will not be needed as we see improvements in the public health trends and as people and businesses continue to act responsibly and adapt to the new environment."" The provincial Declaration of Emergency enables the government to make, and as needed amend, emergency orders that protect the health and safety of all Ontarians. Emergency orders in force under the Declaration of Emergency include those allowing frontline care providers to redeploy staff to areas most in need, limiting long-term care and retirement home employees to working at one home, and enabling public health units to redeploy or hire staff to support the province's enhanced case management and contact tracing strategy. These measures continue to be needed to protect seniors and other vulnerable populations from the threat of COVID-19. The extension of the Declaration of Emergency will allow the province to make or amend emergency orders as needed as it continues to ease restrictions in support of its phased reopening.   In consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health, the government will continue to monitor public health trends related to COVID-19 and assess on an ongoing basis whether the provincial Declaration of Emergency needs to be extended further. The government will also continue to review emergency orders currently in place to determine when and if it is safe to amend or lift them as more places in the province are allowed to reopen in a safe and measured way. As of June 24, 33 public health unit regions have entered Stage 2 of the Framework for Reopening our Province, allowing more businesses and services to open and getting more people back to work. The Windsor-Essex County public health unit region remains in Stage 1 and the situation in the region will continue to be assessed on an ongoing basis. A full list of emergency orders can be found on the e-Laws website under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act and at Ontario.ca/alert.

Francophone Community Grants Program will continue supporting the vitality of Ontario’s francophone organizations and businesses

June 24, 2020  8:30 A.M.

Ministry of Francophone Affairs


TORONTO — As the province begins its economic recovery, the government is launching the 2020-21 edition of the Francophone Community Grants Program to support Ontario's francophone businesses and community organizations, as well as those that serve French-speaking Ontarians.
""Our government is committed to supporting Ontario's Francophone community through the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond,"" said Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Francophone Affairs. ""This year's investment in the Francophone Community Grants Program will help Francophone organizations and businesses implement new projects and initiatives and contribute to our recovery."" The Francophone Community Grants Program is a two-stream, application-based funding program. Funding provided under the Economic Development stream helps francophone entrepreneurs and businesses improve front-line services and better serve their French-speaking clients and partners. Under the Cultural and Community stream, the Program invests in local cultural and community initiatives, demonstrating the government's ongoing commitment to protecting and promoting the French language and culture. The Program supports projects which strengthen the capacity of organizations to provide products and services in French, promote the recruitment and training of bilingual staff, or provide opportunities to celebrate and foster understanding of Ontario's Francophonie. This year, the Economic Development stream has been extended to include not-for-profit organizations, in addition to for-profit organizations. ""This is an important step in building the capacity of Francophone organizations across Ontario to support our communities and bring Ontario on the path to recovery,"" added Minister Mulroney. ""By investing in new projects, our government will leverage the economic strengths of Ontario's Francophonie and help francophone organizations and businesses across the province face these unprecedented times.""

Quick Facts

Ministry of Infrastructure


BELLEVILLE — The governments of Canada and Ontario recognize the different ways that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected smaller communities across the province. While moving towards recovery, investments in infrastructure in rural and northern Ontario are vital to successful, thriving communities and their economies.
Today, Neil Ellis, Member of Parliament for Bay of Quinte, on behalf of the Honourable Maryam Monsef, Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Rural Economic Development; the Honourable Todd Smith, Ontario's Minister of Children, Community and Social Services and Member of Provincial Parliament for Bay of Quinte, on behalf of the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure; His Worship Mitch Panciuk, Mayor of the City of Belleville; and his Worship Jim Harrison, Mayor of the City of Quinte West, announced funding for the improvement of road and active transportation infrastructure in the two neighbouring cities. Belleville residents will benefit from the reconstruction and widening of approximately 1.5 km of Bell Boulevard. The boulevard will be widened from two to four lanes west of Sidney Street, new signalized intersections will be installed, and auxiliary and turning lanes, street lighting, and paved shoulders will be added to support active transportation, such as cycling and walking. Traffic congestion will be eased by accommodating higher traffic volumes, supporting commercial and industrial development along the boulevard, and improving the safety and reliability of the road. In Quinte West, King Street, Division Street, Catherine Street and Dufferin Avenue will be reconstructed and upgraded to include wheelchair-accessible sidewalks, bike lanes and asphalt resurfacing. These enhancements will support safer and more reliable infrastructure for drivers, cyclists and pedestrians. The Government of Canada is investing more than $4.9 million in these projects through the Rural and Northern Communities Infrastructure Stream (RNIS) of the Investing in Canada plan. The Government of Ontario is contributing over $3.3 million; the City of Belleville is contributing more than $5.9 million; and Quinte West is contributing $7.8 million.

Quick Facts

Through the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities.
$2 billion of this funding is supporting infrastructure projects that meet the unique needs of rural and northern communities like facilities to support food security, local access roads and enhanced broadband connectivity.
Ontario is investing $10.2 billion under the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program to improve public transit; community, culture and recreation; green, and rural and northern community infrastructure.
The Rural Economic Development Strategy leverages ongoing federal investments and provides a vision for the future, identifying practical steps to take in the short term, and serving as a foundation to guide further work.
Central to Canada’s Connectivity Strategy are historic new investments that are mobilizing up to $6 billion toward universal connectivity. They include a top-up to the Connect to Innovate Program, a new Universal Broadband Fund, and investments from the Canada Infrastructure Bank.
On June 3, 2020, Ontario announced it was investing $150 million to launch the Improving Connectivity in Ontario program to fund broadband infrastructure projects in rural, remote and underserved regions of Ontario. This is part of the province's $315 million initiative Up to Speed: Ontario's Broadband and Cellular Action Plan.

Office of the Premier


A modern elementary math curriculum
To better support students in Ontario, the government has released a new math curriculum for Grades 1 to 8. The new curriculum is part of the government's four-year math strategy designed to improve student math grades, help students solve everyday math problems and better prepare students' for the jobs of tomorrow. The Ontario Curriculum: Mathematics, Grades 1 to 8 was last updated in 2005. Today, there have been advances in education on: how students learn and engage in math;the role financial literacy and coding plays in a student's life today and in the future;how technology can enhance learning; andhow to access and interact with information.How the new math curriculum was informed In the Fall of 2018, parents, educators, organizations and the general public provided feedback during the Ministry of Education's provincewide consultations. More than 70 per cent of respondents identified the following areas that were needed to improve academic achievement in math: focus on fundamental math concepts and skills;include practical examples of math;enhance teacher training and resources; andgive elementary students more opportunities to learn about science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines.The new curriculum was also informed by expert knowledge and research, best practices from other jurisdictions across Canada and around the world, and input from stakeholders, academics and math education and industry experts. For the first time, the curriculum was placed under a market sounding lens, to ensure private and non-profit sector leaders could inform the development of the curriculum. The feedback played an invaluable role in ensuring the curriculum aligns with the job market and the skill set required to succeed in today's competitive marketplace. Further teaching resources and supports will be available, including providing classroom-ready resources for each grade, as well as in-depth virtual training for teachers, principals and board staff. Changes and key learning Changes to the curriculum include: focusing on fundamental math concepts and skills, such as learning and recalling number facts - including multiplication fact tables from 0 to 12 (0×0 to 12×12); andusing current examples that help students see math in their everyday lives.Key learning to ensure students are future-ready includes: teaching coding skills starting in Grade 1 to improve students' ability to become problem solvers and develop fluency with technology;developing an understanding of the value and use of money over time and consumer awareness through learning about financial literacy; andcreating and reading infographics and collecting and analyzing data to make arguments, and inform decisions and predictionsSocial-Emotional Learning Skills The development of social-emotional learning (SEL) skills supports students' overall health and well-being. SEL skills help students develop confidence, cope with challenges, learn from mistakes, build perseverance, and think critically. Throughout the curriculum, students learn to apply these skills to help them deepen their understanding of math concepts and apply them in their everyday lives. During their education, students will acquire social-emotional learning skills as well as transferable skills such as critical thinking and problem solving, self-directed learning, collaboration, communication, and digital literacy. Students apply these everyday skills as part of their learning across the other five parts of the curriculum, and in their experiences at school, at home and in the community. These interconnected skills help foster overall health and well-being, and the ability to learn, build resilience and thrive.

Ontario Introduces New Math Curriculum for Elementary Students 
Focus on the Fundamentals will Better Prepare Students for Jobs of the Future 

June 23, 2020  1:10 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government released the province's new elementary math curriculum to better prepare students for work in a rapidly changing world, strengthen math competence and improve grades. The curriculum was developed over two years in consultation with parents, math educators, academics and math education experts, and is designed to reverse a decade of declining math scores. It will be available to students across the province beginning in September 2020.
Details were released today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education. ""I made a promise to parents that we would fix the broken education system we inherited, get back to basics, and teach our children the math fundamentals they need for lifelong success,"" said Premier Ford. ""Today, our government is delivering on that promise with the first-ever math curriculum in Canada for Grades 1-8 that includes the teaching of coding and financial literacy, both critical skills that will help our students prepare for and succeed in the modern world and in the modern workforce."" The new math curriculum for Grades 1-8 will: Build understanding of the value and use of money through mandatory financial literacy concepts;For the first time, teach coding or computer programming skills starting in Grade 1 to improve problem solving and fluency with technology, to prepare students for jobs of the future;Use relevant, current, and practical examples so students can connect math to everyday life;Put a focus on fundamental math concepts and skills, such as learning and recalling number facts.""For over a decade, too many students were lacking everyday math, financial literacy, and numeracy skills,"" said Minister Lecce. ""The new curriculum will help students solve everyday math problems, enshrine financial literacy in the early grades, and better prepare students for the jobs of tomorrow by ensuring every student learns how to code."" The Ministry of Education is also changing how it makes curriculum available to better reflect how Ontarians consume information. The new math curriculum will be the first uploaded to the new Curriculum and Resources website, a digital space where anyone can access curriculum and learning resources. This platform will help parents, students, and teachers see connections between learning in different grades and subjects. ""Our research team provided an extensive background research report giving the Ministry of Education the most up-to-date research and analysis of other curricula,"" said Dr. Christine Suurtamm, Vice Dean Research, and Professor of Mathematics Education, Faculty of Education, University of Ottawa. ""Ontario's new mathematics curriculum builds on what we know about student learning and how students develop an understanding of mathematics. It supports all students to be math learners with opportunities to learn foundational mathematics and engage in current topics. The goal is to support how students use math in the world today, and how they will use math to make informed decisions in the world ahead of them.""

Quick Facts

The last update to Ontario’s elementary math curriculum was in 2005.
The new elementary math curriculum is part of the government’s four-year math strategy to ensure that students can build the confidence and skills they need to excel in math.
The elementary report card will be updated to align with the new curriculum and provide an overall mark in math, along with comments on the different strands of the curriculum to give parents a better overall assessment of how their child is doing.
Grade 3 and 6 students will not participate in Education Quality and Accountability Office (EQAO) assessments during the 2020-21 school year, as the ministry works to align the assessments with the new curriculum. Students in Grade 9 and Grade 10 will continue to take the mathematics assessment and Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test (OSSLT), respectively.
The Ontario Government is committed to supporting educators in effectively implementing the new elementary math curriculum. This includes providing classroom-ready resources for each grade, as well as in-depth virtual training for teachers, principals and board staff.
Educators will also continue to benefit from investments in professional development and math supports, including $10 million for board-based math learning leads, $15 million for school-based math learning facilitators, and $15 million to support release time for educators to become expertly familiar with the curriculum.

Ministry of Infrastructure


GUELPH —The health and well-being of Canadians are the top priorities of the Governments of Canada and Ontario. But the COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than Canadians' personal health. It is having a profound effect on the economy.
That is why governments have been taking decisive action to support families, businesses and communities, and continue to look ahead to see what more can be done. Strategic investments in public transportation infrastructure play a key role in supporting affordable and sustainable transportation services that allow Ontarians to get to work, school and essential services on time, and safely back home at the end of the day. Today, Lloyd Longfield, Member of Parliament for Guelph, on behalf of the Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities; Stephen Crawford, Member of Provincial Parliament for Oakville and Parliamentary Assistant to the Ontario Minister of Infrastructure and on behalf of the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure; and His Worship Cam Guthrie, Mayor of the City of Guelph announced funding for two projects that will expand Guelph's public transit fleet while supporting its transition to clean energy transportation. The first project involves the expansion and enhancement of the cycling network in Guelph. Construction of new accessible bike paths and improvements to bike path intersections will improve safety for cyclists and provide direct access to the city's public transit system. The second project consists of the construction of a new Guelph Transit terminal building at Guelph Central Station that meets accessibility and energy efficiency standards. The new building will include passenger waiting areas and public washrooms, as well as amenities for transit employees. Together, these investments will make it easier for cyclists and public transit users to get around their community safely while protecting the environment. The Government of Canada is investing more than $1.8 million to the cycling network expansion and $2.7 million to the Guelph Central Station project through the Public Transit Infrastructure stream of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Ontario is providing over $3 million, while the City of Guelph's contribution is more than $11 million to both projects.

Quick Facts

Through the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities.
$28.7 billion of this funding is supporting public transit projects, including $5 billion available for investment through the Canada Infrastructure Bank. 
Across the province, Ontario is investing more than $7.3 billion in public transit infrastructure over 10 years through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program.

Keep Pets Safe this Summer, Do Not Leave Them in Hot Vehicles
Ontario has toughest penalties in Canada for violations

June 22, 2020  2:30 P.M.

Ministry of the Solicitor General


The Ontario government is strongly urging everyone to ensure their pet is not left unattended in a vehicle during the hot summer weather. Temperatures inside a vehicle can quickly become much hotter than the temperature outside even if the windows are opened slightly. This can put pets at risk of serious illness and possibly death. If your pet can't be with you at your destination, leave them at home where they will be safe, cool and comfortable.
""It is critically important to ensure all pets are protected from the potential fatal effects of the hot summer sun,"" said Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General. ""Leaving pets to suffer in a sweltering vehicle will not be tolerated and we have adopted tough new laws to deter this type of reckless behaviour in the province."" Ontario is the first jurisdiction in Canada to implement a full provincial government-based animal welfare enforcement system. The Provincial Animal Welfare Services (PAWS) Act came into effect January 1, 2020 and allows police, First Nations constables and provincial animal welfare inspectors to enter motor vehicles to help pets in distress. The legislation also has the strongest penalties in the country for people who violate animal welfare laws, including causing distress to animals. If you see an animal in a hot car and are concerned the animal's life is in immediate danger, dial 911. Members of the public should not attempt to enter a vehicle in these situations.  

Quick Facts

Unlike humans, dogs have a very limited ability to sweat. Even a short period in a hot environment can cause suffering and distress, which could result in brain damage or death.
Excessive panting, drooling, listlessness, collapsing or seizures are all examples of visible signs of heat stress in animals. If you witness these signs in your pet, move the animal to a cool area and seek veterinary attention immediately. 
Cruelty to any animal is not tolerated in Ontario. If you think an animal is in distress or being abused, call 1-833-9-ANIMAL (264625).

Ontario Moving Toronto and Peel Region into Stage 2
More People Can Return to Work as Key Public Health Trends Improve

June 22, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government is allowing more businesses and services to open and getting more people back to work by moving the City of Toronto and Peel Region into Stage 2 on Wednesday. This decision was made in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health and the local medical officers of health. It is based on positive local trends of key public health indicators, including lower transmission of COVID-19, ongoing hospital capacity, public health capacity to do rapid case and contact management, and a significant increase in testing.
""Today's announcement is another sign that we continue to make steady progress,"" said Premier Ford. ""We have been working hand-in-hand with our municipal partners and local public health units to safely and gradually reopen the province. We will do everything we can to get our final region, Windsor-Essex, into Stage 2 as soon as possible. That's why we are ramping up testing and inspections on Ontario's farms to protect workers and keep our food supply chains strong and healthy."" Toronto Public Health and Peel Public Health will enter Stage 2 on Wednesday, June 24, 2020 at 12:01 a.m. They will join the 31 other public health regions that entered Stage 2 on June 12 and 19, 2020. ""Because of our collective efforts, we continue to make real and significant progress in stopping the spread of COVID-19,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""As a result, more regions have met the public health criteria to move into Stage 2 and reopen more services for the communities to enjoy. Just as importantly, these efforts to stop the spread have ensured that we aren't seeing spikes in cases in those regions that have been open for well over a week now."" Windsor-Essex will remain in Stage 1 and the situation in the region will continue to be assessed on an ongoing basis. To ensure the region is able to move forward as soon as it is safe to do so, the province is building on the work completed by Windsor-Essex County Health Unit to date and collaborating with federal and local authorities to support the implementation of a targeted and collaborative response that includes:  Continuing with proactive targeted testing for agri-food workers, including enhanced on-farm testing; Conducting more than 200 Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development on-farm inspections and investigations; Starting new joint inspections of farms with federal authorities to review current working and living conditions of temporary foreign workers with the Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development and local public health officials; Providing $15 million through the Enhanced Agri-food Workplace Protection program, which provides cost-share funding to improve employee and workplace health and safety on farms and in processing facilities. The funding can be used to purchase personal protective equipment (PPE), put up physical barriers, make housing modifications, or provide alternate housing or other measures; Translating COVID-19 health and safety guidance documents into Spanish and posting them on Ontario.ca/covidsafety. Additional resources, including webinars and helpful posters, are also available, and will help farmers and other agri-food employers provide safe and healthy workplaces; Providing specific funding to Workplace Safety and Prevention Services to deliver resources and consulting services to help farmers and other agri-food businesses provide safe workplaces; and Continuing to press the federal government to provide new funding to support priority sectors impacted by COVID-19, including the agricultural sector, as the province reopens and charts a path to economic recovery.  ""Our government is committed to protecting our agri-food workers who continue to produce the safe and healthy foods Ontarians rely on,"" said Ernie Hardeman, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. ""Expanded on-farm proactive testing, more workplace inspections and additional resources like our $15-million Enhanced Agri-food Workplace Protection Program are part of our coordinated effort to safeguard our farm workers."" The Chief Medical Officer of Health has also strongly recommended that local medical officers of health use their authority under section 22 of the Health Protection and Promotion Act to issue class orders to ensure that employers of temporary workers take actions to decrease the risk of transmission of COVID-19 on farms. These actions will ensure:  All foreign workers self-isolate for 14 days from the date of their arrival, with the resources and supports they need to avoid any contacts with others and notification to public health unit if they have any COVID-19 symptoms; All workers coming from any area where there is community transmission have tested negative for COVID-19 within 48 hours prior to beginning work; Daily active screening; Accurate and updated contact information of permanent, temporary and contract employees available to the public health unit within 24 hours and ensuring employees are assigned to the same group to support effective case management and contact tracing; Physical distancing maintained between workers as best as possible and personal protective equipment to be provided based on risk assessment; and All legislative requirements to protect worker health and safety are followed. ""COVID-19 has changed the way people work and interact with each other ― both on and off the farm,"" said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training, and Skills Development. ""Our ministry, together with its health and safety partners, has worked hard to get important information to employers and workers in the agricultural sector. I encourage you to access these documents at Ontario.ca/covidsafety."" With this enhanced response, and continued support from the entire Windsor-Essex community, the government is confident Windsor-Essex County Health Unit region will proceed to Stage 2 soon. The Chief Medical Officer of Health and health experts will continue to closely monitor the evolving situation in all regions of the province to advise when public health restrictions can be gradually loosened or if they need to be tightened. Although restrictions are being gradually relaxed in Stage 2, the government is strongly recommending that everyone in Ontario follow public health advice, including physical distancing, wearing a face covering if physical distancing is a challenge, washing hands frequently and thoroughly, and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.

Quick Facts

Every Monday, the government is providing an update on the ongoing assessment of the different regions, and whether they are ready to move into Stage 2.
To get tested, people should visit Ontario's website to find their local assessment centre and whether they need to call ahead to make an appointment.
Stage 3 will focus on reopening more workplaces and community spaces, while carefully and gradually relaxing restrictions, and sustaining and expanding workplace health and safety guidance.
The province has developed a practical step-by-step guide to help Ontarians as they safely develop and join a social circle.

Supervisor Appointed to Peel District School Board
Minister Takes Immediate Action to Confront Racism and Ensure Schools are Safe and Inclusive

June 22, 2020 11:20 A.M.

Ministry of Education


TORONTO — Today, Minister of Education, Stephen Lecce issued the following statement on the appointment of Bruce Rodrigues to supervise the Peel District School Board (PDSB):
""We expect all schools and classrooms in the province to be safe and inclusive. For far too long, this has not been the case at the Peel District School Board. From day one, I said that if the PDSB does not act swiftly and completely to counter racism and positively change the culture within our schools, then the government will act. For a generation, students have felt ignored, powerless, and disrespected. This ends starting today. The appointment of a Supervisor will allow the PDSB to get back on track and undertake the necessary actions to eliminate the practices and policies underpinning discrimination and inequities.  Mr. Rodrigues brings a wealth of experience to this appointment, including leading systemic change as Director of Education of the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB) and as Chief Executive Officer of the Education Quality and Accountability Office (EQAO). Mr. Rodrigues has an outstanding track record in Ontario's publicly funded education system with commitment and passion to drive change, confront discrimination, and advance equity, inclusion and opportunity for all students. He has put students of all abilities at the heart of his work and public service. With the assistance of Mr. Rodrigues' supervision, I know that the Peel District School Board will have the leadership and necessary management structure in place to ensure the learning and working environments are welcoming, inclusive, and respectful for students and staff. We know there is more to do - provincewide - which is why we will continue to work to confront racism, including anti-Black racism, in all Ontario schools across our province. Ontario's children deserve nothing less."" "

Ontario Announces Members of New Indigenous Women's Advisory Council
Members will help address issues of violence affecting their communities

June 21, 2020  1:30 P.M.

Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services


Toronto — Today, the Ontario government announced members of the new Indigenous Women's Advisory Council. The Council includes First Nations, Métis, Inuit, and LGBTQ2S leaders on violence prevention who will provide input on issues impacting their communities such as human trafficking and child, youth and family well-being. Today's announcement is being made on National Indigenous Peoples Day.
“For culturally relevant and effective changes to occur in Ontario, Indigenous women must lead the development of our policies so we can truly support their communities,” said Jill Dunlop, Associate Minister of Children and Women's Issues. “The Council will be key to ensuring Indigenous women's voices guide Ontario's priorities on a range of critical issues.” The Council will be co-chaired by Cora-lee McGuire-Cyrette, Executive Director of the Ontario Native Women's Association. The other co-chair will be selected at the Council's first meeting in early July 2020. Other members of the Indigenous Women's Advisory Council include:   Sylvia Maracle, Ontario Federation of Indigenous Friendship Centres Sandra Montour, Six Nations of the Grand River Lyndia Jones, Independent First Nations Jennifer St. Germain, Métis Nation of Ontario Teresa Sutherland, Nishnawbe Aski Nation Amanda Kilabuk, Tungasuvvingat Inuit Marina Plain, Union of Ontario Indians/Anishinabek Nation Tracy Antone, Chiefs of Ontario  “I'm honoured to accept this position and work with our Indigenous partners and the Ontario government. It will take everyone working together to address issues of gender-based violence and systemic racism,” said Cora-lee McGuire-Cyrette, Council Co- Chair and Executive Director of the Ontario Native Women's Association. “I want to thank Associate Minister Jill Dunlop for this opportunity and her leadership in making this space possible. The Indigenous Women's Advisory Council is building on the foundational work the province has been leading and the work of the Council is critical to ensuring the issues Indigenous Women face daily will be a priority.” “I'm pleased Cora-lee McGuire-Cyrette has agreed to provide her leadership and expertise and I look forward to hearing the voices of these incredible individuals on how we can work together to prevent violence in all its forms,” said Minister Dunlop. “Indigenous women, communities and organizations have been working tirelessly to address violence against Indigenous women, and the knowledge and expertise of the Council will be instrumental in ensuring our province's continued response is effective and collaborative,” said Greg Rickford, Minister of Indigenous Affairs.

Quick Facts

Indigenous women in Canada between the ages of 15-24 are more than three times likely to experience violence than non-Indigenous women.
Indigenous women in Canada are two-and-a-half times more likely to experience spousal violence.
Currently, there is no dedicated provincial forum for Indigenous women and LGBTQ2S leaders and experts to engage on violence prevention issues.

We also invite everyone to take a moment and reflect on the Indigenous experience, as well as the systemic barriers that continue to impact Indigenous peoples in our society today. We all have a role to play in building a more inclusive Ontario, and we must continue to work together to eliminate hate, racism and discrimination in all its forms.  Today and every day, let each and every one of us do our part to respect and help preserve Indigenous cultures, while building a more inclusive society and stronger Ontario.""

Ministry of Indigenous Affairs


TORONTO —The government of Ontario is providing up to $10 million to Indigenous-owned small and medium sized businesses to help them with much needed capital as the province begins to safely and gradually reopen the economy. 
Loans of up to $50,000 will be available to businesses that are either ineligible for, or unable to access, existing federal and provincial COVID-19 response initiatives for small businesses. The funding is being delivered through the Support for People and Jobs Fund. ""Indigenous businesses are experiencing revenue shortfalls at this time, as many are located in rural or remote areas and operate in hard-hit service sectors such as tourism, hospitality and retail,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Indigenous Affairs. ""This funding responds to their unique challenges and will help them get back up and running so they can contribute to the rebuilding of the provincial economy.""  Loans will be available through Aboriginal Financial Institutions. Up to 50% of each loan will be in the form of a non-repayable grant, with no interest due on the loan portion until December 31, 2022. Businesses may use these funds to cover general expenses such as payroll, rent, utilities and taxes. They may also be used towards increasing production capacity, developing new products, moving to online marketing, or to make improvements to accommodate social distancing requirements, such as the installation of plexiglass barriers.  ""Ontario's small businesses are the backbone of our economy and their recovery is critical to Ontario's recovery,"" said Prabmeet Sarkaria, Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction. ""As many Indigenous small businesses across the province closed their doors and halted business during the COVID-19 outbreak, many struggled to keep the lights on. Today, we are providing these businesses with the support they need to recover and adapt to the challenges of this unprecedented time.""

Quick Facts

Aboriginal Financial Institutions (AFIs) are autonomous, Indigenous-controlled, community based financial organizations providing developmental lending, business financing and support services to First Nations, Métis and Inuit businesses in Ontario.

Convicted - Port Weller Marine Terminal Inc.
Court Location - St. Catharines Court Description of Offence - The conviction relates to the discharge of cement dust that migrated off-site affecting local residential properties.  Date of Offence - On or about July 28, 2016 and ending on or about August 3, 2016 Date of Conviction - June 4, 2020  Penalty Imposed - Port Weller Marine Terminal Inc. was convicted of one violation under the Environmental Protection Act and was fined $50,000 plus a victim surcharge of $12,500 and was given six months to pay the fine.  Background:  Port Weller Marine Terminal Inc. is in Port Colborne and operates a terminal on the Welland Canal which is part of the St. Lawrence Seaway. At the time of the violation, the company was under contract to unload vessels carrying cement clinker, which had been imported by a Port Weller Marine client.  Clinker is a component of cement and is used in cement manufacturing and can become caustic when wet, potentially causing burns to eyes and skin.  The St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation (SLSMC) is the agent of the federal Crown charged with administering the St. Lawrence Seaway. The terminal is also located on lands owned by the federal Crown.  On July 28, 2016, the ministry was notified that clinker dust had migrated off the terminal site and an investigation indicated that despite Port Weller Marine's efforts to contain the dust, a quantity was carried off-site and fell onto residential properties in the area. The company was unaware of the discharge at the time.   An investigation resulted in charges being laid, which resulted in one conviction.   "

Ontario Invests in Invasive Species Centre
Province Supports Scientific Research to Protect Environment from Invasive Species

June 19, 2020  2:00 P.M.

Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry


SAULT STE. MARIE — The Ontario government is protecting the province from the harmful ecological, social and economic effects of invasive species by investing in management and prevention.   
Today, Ross Romano, MPP for Sault Ste. Marie, announced the province is investing $850,000 in the Invasive Species Centre to support important ongoing research into prevention, early detection, control and eradication of invasive species across the province.   ""Investing in the Invasive Species Centre is an investment in prevention, which is the most effective approach for managing invasive species and vital to the preservation of Ontario's natural resources in the long-term,"" said MPP Romano. ""The Centre does vital work, and we are pleased to be working together with them."" Invasive species can cause significant harm to biodiversity and can affect recreational activities and tourism. Once invasive species become established, it is extremely difficult to remove them, potentially causing long-lasting damage to the environment. Since 2011, the Invasive Species Centre, based in Sault Ste. Marie has collaborated with government, academic, industry and Indigenous communities and organizations to play a significant role in research, response planning, management and habitat restoration. ""Our province is home to an abundance of natural beauty and resources, and our government is committed to protecting the environment for future generations,"" said John Yakabuski, Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry. ""This means that we have to act now to prevent the spread of invasive species that can harm the great outdoors we love and enjoy."" ""Thanks to this provincial investment, the Invasive Species Centre will work with partners to develop new measures to prevent and manage invasive species,"" said Bob Lambe, Chair of the Board of Directors of the Invasive Species Centre. ""Invasive species are among the largest challenges to conservation, and we are committed to working together in the fight against this serious threat."" The ministry will continue to work with conservation partners to coordinate prevention, management, and research activities while promoting public education on the negative impacts of invasive species.

Quick Facts

In 2020-2021, Ontario is investing over $2 million to support ongoing research, monitoring, and management of invasive species across the province.
Ontario is the only jurisdiction in Canada that has standalone invasive species legislation. The Invasive Species Act provides legislative tools to prohibit and restrict certain invasive species and carriers that facilitate the movement of invasive species.

Province Releases School Safety Plan for the 2020-21 School Year

June 19, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Today, the Ontario government released its safety plan for the resumption of class for the 2020-21 school year, outlining scenarios for how students, teachers and staff can safely return to classrooms in September. The plan also provides choice to parents, enhanced online learning, and additional funding. While the decision to return to the normal school day routine will continue to be based on medical advice, boards and schools are being asked to plan for alternative scenarios that may need to be implemented in September depending on the province's COVID-19 situation.
""Nothing is more important than protecting our kids in this province. Parents expect us to take every precaution to keep their children safe when they go back to school in September - and that's exactly what we're delivering today,"" said Premier Ford. ""This plan takes the best medical advice available from our public heath experts to ensure every school board and every school is ready to ensure students continue learning in the safest way possible."" Ontario's plan to safely reopen schools will provide options for parents - to send their children in-class or to enter online learning - with health, safety and well-being at its core. Boards will be asked to plan for the following three scenarios to be implemented in September, depending on the public health situation at the time: Normal school day routine with enhanced public health protocols - Students going to school every day, in classes that reflect standard class size regulations.Modified school day routine - Based on public health advice, an adapted delivery model has been designed to allow for physical distancing and cohorts of students. Under this model, school boards are asked to maintain a limit of 15 students in a typical classroom at one time and adopt timetabling that would allow for students to remain in contact only with their classmates and a single teacher for as much of the school day as possible. This model would require alternate day or alternate week delivery to a segment of the class at one time.At home learning - Should the school closure be extended, or some parents choose not to send their child back to school, school boards need to be prepared to offer remote education. Remote education should be delivered online to the greatest extent possible, including the establishment of minimum expectations for students to have direct contact with their teacher at the same time on a regular basis, also known as synchronous learning. Synchronous learning can be used as part of whole class instruction, in smaller groups of students, and/or in a one-on-one context.The government is instructing school boards to be prepared with a plan, should it be required, that includes an adapted delivery model, which could include alternate day or alternate week attendance, staggered bell times and recess, and different transportation arrangements, among a variety of other considerations to ensure the safety of students and staff. The government's safety plan for schools was created following extensive consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health, health experts on the COVID-19 Command Table, medical experts at The Hospital for Sick Children, education sector partners, frontline workers, parents and students. While this plan reflects the best medical and scientific advice and recommendations available, parents who do not feel comfortable having their children physically return to school will have a choice to pursue online remote learning. ""We are taking every precaution, investing more, and listening to the best medical advice in the country to keep students, staff, and families safe,"" said Minister Lecce. ""I want to assure parents safety is our guiding principle and the right supports are being put in place to ensure our students are set up for success. I am grateful to Ontario students, education staff, and communities for stepping up during this difficult period."" ""Having careful plans in place to reopen schools in September is of the utmost importance for the mental and developmental health of children and youth, as well as their academic success,"" says Dr. Ronald Cohn, President and CEO of SickKids. ""The risk posed by COVID-19 cannot be completely eliminated, however, there are significant steps that can be taken to mitigate risk and protect the health and well-being of students, staff and their families."" Key elements of the safety plan include: guidance for developing health and safety protocols, including the use of personal protective equipment;expectations of an in-class school environment;professional development training for teachers on the new protocols and directions;supports for students with special education needs;enhanced mental health and well-being supports;proposals on how educators and students can move fluidly between in-class and remote learning;guidelines to help schools and boards in their communications with students and parents;guidelines for student transportation systems;expectations for the delivery of curriculum and assessment across subjects and grades;guidance for working with First Nations students, parents and communities;regional options for reopening based on the advice of local public health authorities; anda checklist to help boards in their reopening planning.Moreover, the government announced $4 million in net new funding for cleaning, cleaning protocols, and financial support to hire additional custodial staff in September to ensure schools are safe. School boards have been asked to prepare their own safety plans for the upcoming school year and submit them to the ministry by August 4, 2020. The ministry will be providing all boards with an opportunity to share their draft plans and seek feedback from a formalized table of medical experts that the ministry will be convening. School boards will also be required to communicate with parents and students prior to the start of the 2020-21 school year, outlining the safety plan, guidance on health and safety measures and protocols, and any other changes that will be implemented when schools open in September.

NIAGARA FALLS - The Ontario government is supporting the Niagara Region's vital tourism sector by providing a $25-million loan to the Niagara Parks Commission to redevelop the historic Canadian Niagara Power Generating Station into a one-of-a-kind, made-in-Ontario attraction.
Today, Lisa MacLeod, Minister of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries, was in Niagara Falls to announce the province's support for the project, which will transform the 1905 heritage building into a thriving tourist attraction, offering visitors an educational experience about Ontario's power generating history, and a unique new perspective on the Falls through a new viewing platform. The minister was joined by Jim Diodati, Mayor of Niagara Falls, Sandie Bellows, Chair of Niagara Parks Commission, Joel Noden, Chair of Niagara Falls Tourism and Rebecca Mackenzie, President and CEO of Culinary Tourism Alliance, for a ribbon-cutting ceremony to officially welcome people back to the Niagara Region as part of Stage 2 of the province's reopening plan. ""This has been a very challenging time for the tourism sector, but today the Niagara Region will begin to reopen its world-class attractions and start down the road to recovery,"" said Minister MacLeod. ""I am proud that our government is supporting the new Canadian Niagara Power Generating Station project. It will be another terrific reason for people to come and visit one of the most attractive destinations in Ontario."" The first phase of the redevelopment of the Canadian Niagara Power Generating Station is scheduled for completion in July 2021, just in time for Niagara Region to welcome athletes, coaches and families from across Canada for the 2021 Canada Summer Games next August. The Ontario government loan will be repaid over 10 years, with the first payment expected in January 2024 after the attraction is fully operational and generating revenue. The government recently announced $1 million in tourism support for Niagara Region through a new $13-million funding partnership between Destination Ontario and Destination Canada. This funding will help to deliver locally driven marketing programs to bolster the local tourism economy. As part of this partnership, the Culinary Tourism Alliance - a not-for-profit food tourism development organization - will receive $100,000. ""As our government moves forward with the safe and gradual reopening of the province, we are encouraging people to travel safely and rediscover the spectacular tourist attractions that Ontario has to offer,"" said Minister MacLeod. In April 2020, Ontario released sector-specific safety guidelines for the tourism and hospitality sectors to help businesses operate and reopen safely in this current environment. The guidelines include enhanced hygiene procedures, physical distancing measures and screening of both workers and guests for health issues. These guidelines can be viewed at www.ontario.ca/covidsafety.

Legislation to curb on-farm trespass, while preserving the right for lawful protests

June 18, 2020  4:30 P.M.

Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs


WOODSTOCK - The Ontario government is taking action to balance the safety and security of farmers, their families and the provincial food supply with protecting the right for people to participate in lawful protests on public property. Today, Bill 156, the Security from Trespass and Protecting Food Safety Act, 2020, received Royal Assent. Once proclaimed into force, the Act will further protect against the health and safety risks of on-farm trespassing.
""If there's one thing the COVID-19 outbreak has demonstrated, it's the importance of a steady and reliable food supply and the safety of those who feed us,"" said Ernie Hardeman, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. ""I am more committed than ever to supporting our farmers, food processors and transport sector — the agri-food heroes who have worked so hard to keep food on our grocery store shelves and our kitchen tables throughout this crisis."" In recent years, farmers have faced increased levels of trespass and theft of livestock from their farms as well as mental heath stress due to these threats. Bill 156 will increase protections for those farmers while simultaneously protecting the right for people to participate in lawful protests on public property. The Security from Trespass and Protecting Food Safety Act, 2020 helps deter trespassers by:  Escalating fines of up to $15,000 for a first offence and $25,000 for subsequent offences, compared to a maximum of $10,000 under the Trespass to Property Act;Prescribing aggravating factors that would allow the court to consider factors that might justify an increased fine;Allowing the court to order restitution for damage in prescribed circumstances which could include damage to a farmer's livestock or from theft;Increasing protection for farmers against civil liability from people who were hurt while trespassing or contravening the act, provided the farmer did not directly cause the harm;Removing consent to enter a farm property when it was given under duress or false pretenses. ""Our government will always protect the right for people to participate in lawful protests. The Security from Trespass and Protecting Food Safety Act, 2020 does not change that. However, that right has never included trespassing onto private property and harassing farmers and their families,"" said Minister Hardeman. ""We need to do more to help our agri-food workers focus on contributing to a strong and safe food supply, instead of fearing for their and their family's safety from unlawful trespassing and harassment activity."" Prior to the bill's introduction, the Ontario government consulted with stakeholders across the province to ensure the right balance of protecting Ontario's farmers and the rights of people to participate in lawful protests. Over the coming months, the ministry will continue consulting with stakeholders to develop the regulations that must be put in place before the Act can be proclaimed into force. ""The Ontario Federation of Agriculture and its members appreciate the support of the Ontario government in taking the concerns of Ontario livestock and poultry farmers seriously and acting swiftly to address them by passing Bill 156,"" said Keith Currie, President of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture. ""On-farm trespass causes serious threats to the mental health and well-being of Ontario farmers and significant stress and harm to our animals. The intent of this act is to protect farms, our families and the safety of our food supply chain by addressing the ongoing threat of unwanted trespassing."" Last year, the government passed the Provincial Animal Welfare Services Act, 2019, giving Ontario the strongest penalties in Canada for people who are convicted of animal abuse. The province now has the first fully provincial government-based animal welfare enforcement system in Canada. If anybody in Ontario believes that an animal is being mistreated, they should call 1-833-9ANIMAL or 1-833-926-4625 and have a trained inspector investigate the allegation. ""Dairy farmers in Ontario take the welfare of the animals in our care and the quality of the milk we produce very seriously. The act goes a long way to keeping the integrity of the biosecurity measures we have in place for food safety, and to keeping our animals, families and homes safe from unauthorized visitors,"" said Murray Sherk, Board Chair of Dairy Farmers of Ontario. ""We appreciate the time and attention this government has dedicated to hearing first-hand from dairy farmers across the province and look forward to engaging further as the regulations for the act are considered.""

Quick Facts

The act received broad support from many organizations, including: Rural Ontario Municipal Association, Association of Municipalities Ontario, Ontario Federation of Agriculture, Chicken Farmers of Ontario, Ontario Pork, the Ontario Livestock Transporters’ Alliance, Dairy Farmers of Ontario, Food and Beverage Ontario and the Ontario Mutual Insurance Association.
Nearly 130 municipalities have passed or supported council resolutions calling on the government to strengthen protections for farm families, employees and animals.
Minister Hardeman first introduced Bill 156 on December 2, 2019.

Government Consults on Enhancements to its Water Quantity Management Program

June 18, 2020  3:05 P.M.

Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks


TORONTO — The Ontario government is seeking public input on its water quantity management proposal. The proposal aims to protect the long-term sustainability of surface water and groundwater and ensure these important resources are responsibly managed and safeguarded now and into the future, as committed in the province's Made-in-Ontario Environment Plan. The proposal would also give municipalities a greater say in allowing companies to withdraw groundwater in their communities for bottled water. 
""We can't take our water for granted - it is a vital resource for our health and well-being, and to the way of life we all enjoy,"" said Jeff Yurek, Minister of the Environment, Conservation and Parks. ""Ontarians can be confident our water resources are protected by good policy based on solid science and evidence, but we must always be prepared to adapt. Based on initial input from our stakeholders and Indigenous communities, we have put forward proposed enhancements to our water taking rules that will create a more flexible and robust program.""   The proposed changes include:  Requiring water bottling companies to have the support of their host municipalities for new and increasing bottled water takings, with an exemption for small businesses. Establishing priorities of water use in the province that can guide water taking decisions.  Assessing and managing multiple water takings together in areas of the province where water sustainability is a concern. Making water taking data available to the public to increase transparency of how Ontario manages water resources.   The Government encourages the public to provide their feedback on the water quantity management proposal, which is open for public comment on the Environmental Registry until August 2, 2020. These comments will help inform the updates to further protect water resources in Ontario.  The review of water resources in Ontario, which is supported by independent experts, found that the government's current approach to managing water takings is effective. The review also identified opportunities to build on our current framework to ensure that we can manage water takings sustainably in situations when water supplies may be limited. 

Quick Facts

In December 2019, the province extended the moratorium on new or expanded groundwater takings by water bottling companies to October 1, 2020. 
To ensure Ontario’s review of water taking resources was comprehensive, the ministry retained an expert water resources consulting firm, BluMetric Environmental Inc., to assess water resources in select areas of the province. 
The ministry’s findings on water bottling were independently validated by a panel from Professional Geoscientists Ontario.
In Ontario, water bottling companies are charged an additional $500 per million litres of groundwater taken to produce bottled water.
Water bottling is significantly less than 1 per cent of the total permitted water taken in Ontario.
Lakes and rivers in Ontario, including the Great Lakes, contain about one fifth of the world’s fresh water. 
Ontario’s drinking water continues to be among the best protected in the world.

Spring 2020 P3 Market Update Signals Government’s Commitment to Build

June 18, 2020  2:00 P.M.

Ministry of Infrastructure


TORONTO - The Ontario government continues to move forward with 37 major infrastructure projects across the province using the public-private partnership (P3) model. The projects were listed in the Spring 2020 P3 Market Update (known in the market as updates to the ""P3 Pipeline""), which was released today by Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure.
""The message today is clear, our government is moving from shovel ready to shovels in the ground,"" said Minister Scott. ""The P3 Market Update signals to the infrastructure sector that Ontario remains committed to major infrastructure projects including subways, highways, health care and community safety projects. This is stimulus that will create jobs and contribute to the economic recovery of our province."" The P3 Market Update is a list of public projects in the pre-procurement and procurement stages for which Ontario has committed funding. The list helps potential local and global private sector partners organize their time and resources to make sure Ontario gets robust, innovative and competitive bids for its P3 infrastructure projects. ""Ontario's unique P3 model is a proven, internationally-recognized approach that gets projects done on time and on budget,"" said Minister Scott. ""We look forward to continuing to work with our private sector partners to build these significant projects for the benefit of people today and for generations to come.""  Ontario's P3 model is part of the government's plan to build new infrastructure including transit, highways, schools and hospitals faster, improve productivity, help businesses get goods to markets, and create jobs. ""This spring's update is an important reassurance to industry and the people of Ontario,"" said Ehren Cory, Infrastructure Ontario President and Chief Executive Officer. ""It is important to provide as much certainty as possible to our industry partners regarding the Province's commitment to the many P3 projects in planning and procurement."" The government committed to providing four infrastructure updates annually, with the next update planned for this summer, and a more comprehensive update planned for the fall."

Ontario Enhancing COVID-19 Case and Contact Management
Province’s Exposure Notification App Important Pillar of Plan

June 18, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — As the province safely and gradually reopens, the Ontario government is enhancing case and contact management to quickly test, trace and isolate cases of COVID-19 to stop the spread of the virus and prepare for any potential future waves. These additional measures include a comprehensive case and contact management strategy, Protecting Ontarians through Enhanced Case and Contact Management, and, in partnership with the federal government, a new made-in-Ontario national app called COVID Alert.
Details were provided today by Premier Doug Ford and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Dr. David Williams, Chief Medical Officer of Health. The government's enhanced strategy focuses on strengthening and standardizing case and contact management by: Ensuring that all new cases and their close contacts are identified early, contacted quickly, investigated thoroughly and are followed up with daily for up to 14 days;Supporting public health units with up to 1,700 additional staff from Statistics Canada;Improving technology tools by modernizing the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS) through the implementation of a new custom-built COVID-19 case and contact management system; andLaunching a privacy-first exposure notification app to alert Ontarians when they may have been exposed to COVID-19.""You can't manage what you can't measure. That's why our government has been relentless in building our testing and contact tracing capacity to track, trace, and contain the invisible enemy we face,"" said Premier Ford. ""As we take our contact tracing strategy to the next level today, I want to thank the federal government for providing more boots on the ground and supporting a privacy-first app that will protect both Ontarians and Canadians alike."" ""Along with the early detection of new cases through the ongoing implementation of our enhanced testing strategy, more effective and efficient case and contact management will ensure that we are able to stop the spread of COVID-19 as we gradually reopen the province,"" said Minister Elliott. ""To support these efforts, we are dramatically expanding staffing levels and getting on with the long-overdue work of replacing outdated systems that no longer meet the needs of public health units."" Ontario is providing updated case and contact management guidance for all public health units to ensure consistency across the province. To continue to ensure cases and their contacts are reached in a timely and effective way to prevent the spread of COVID-19, public health units will: Connect with cases, and with all individuals who have had close contact with a positive case, within 24 hours of being identified;Direct all close contacts to self-isolate for up to 14 days;Follow up with close contacts every day for the duration of their self-isolation; andAdvise testing of all appropriate close contacts.To augment the current provincial capacity of approximately 2,000 case managers and contact tracers, Ontario is providing additional contact tracing staff. New and expanded capacity will be provided through Statistics Canada with access to up to 1,700 additional staff, available to all provinces, for contact tracing. Public Health Ontario will continue overseeing the training and coordination of these additional resources. Over the summer and into the fall, Ontario will continue to build a supplementary pool of contact tracers from the Ontario Public Service and the broader public sector for additional surge capacity, as required. This will allow public health units to perform their other critical functions, including inspections of food premises and water in recreational facilities, and vaccinations. To help Ontarians stay safe as the province reopens and social interactions increase, Ontario will be partnering with the federal government to launch COVID Alert, a new privacy-first exposure notification app, within the next two weeks. The made-in-Ontario app was developed by the Ontario Digital Service (ODS) and a group of volunteers from Shopify. One of the overarching principles is ensuring the privacy and security for all users, which is why the government will leverage BlackBerry volunteer expertise to audit the security and privacy of the application, in addition to the province's internal security reviews. Users will be able to voluntarily download the app and be notified anonymously if they have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 14 days. In Ontario, the app will also provide users with quick access to Ontario's public health advice and resources, and recommend any necessary actions, such as monitoring for symptoms, self-isolation or appropriate next steps on getting tested. Using a national application will help ensure that Ontarians are notified, regardless of which province they are in, helping us towards the goal of ensuring we can all move more freely and safely. Ontario is also implementing a new user-friendly case and contact management system that will integrate with COVID-19 laboratory results from the Ontario Laboratory Information System (OLIS) data, making current processes significantly more efficient and reducing the administrative burden for public health unit staff. A single central system will enable the province to identify provincewide regional trends and hotspots, while protecting personal health information. Custom-built on the Salesforce platform, the new system will also allow for a remote workforce, enabling contact tracing to be quickly ramped up when required. Everyone should continue to follow public health guidelines to stay safe, including physical distancing with people not in your social circle, wearing a face covering if physical distancing is a challenge, washing your hands thoroughly and frequently, and, if you think you have COVID-19 or have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19, getting tested.

Quick Facts

iPHIS was implemented in phases starting on April 1, 2005, with full implementation across the province by the end of that year.

Approximately 97 per cent of new COVID-19 cases are currently being reached by local public health officials within one day, with guidance and direction to contain community spread.

The exposure notification app will not collect personal or location data. It uses Bluetooth technology to send out encrypted, anonymized codes to other nearby phones that have the app. The app was built using the Apple/Google framework for exposure notification to ensure that it leverages global best practices to protect privacy.

No Ontarian will be declined a test at an assessment centre (either through appointment or walk-in, per the processes of each individual assessment centre), especially those who are symptomatic or who are concerned they have been exposed to COVID-19. Visit Ontario’s website to find your local assessment centre and whether you need to call ahead to make an appointment.

Ontario Makes Major Investment in Mental Health and Technology to Support Students 
New resources will help students return to school with the tools they need to succeed

June 18, 2020 11:50 A.M.

Ministry of Education


VAUGHAN - The Ontario Minister of Education, Stephen Lecce, announced $15 million to purchase thousands of classroom computers, and $10 million to hire additional mental health workers. These new resources will help ensure students can return to school with the confidence and the tools they need to succeed. This funding represents the highest amount the Ministry of Education has ever dedicated to these two areas through the Grants for Student Needs (GSN).
Through consultations with Public Health Ontario, the Hospital for Sick Children and front-line workers, the government heard about the need for enhanced mental health supports to respond to COVID-19. This new $10 million investment will provide students with unprecedented direct access to regulated mental health professionals and significantly reduce wait times. ""We know that the COVID-19 outbreak has impacted student mental health and well-being,"" said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education. ""That is why our government is significantly increasing investments in supporting the mental health of students as we prepare for the reopening of schools. This investment represents a considerable increase in mental health funding that will help ensure critical front-line and wrap-around supports are helping those Ontario students who need it most."" Today's announced funding of $10 million is in addition to the government's commitment of $25 million in permanent funding to hire approximately 180 front-line mental health workers in secondary schools across Ontario. ""There is nothing more important than ensuring the health and safety of our children and youth, and that includes mental health,"" said Michael Tibollo, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. ""Today's announcement will bring much-needed resources to support the mental health of Ontario's students, and moves us one step closer to creating a mental health and addictions system that works for all Ontarians.""  The province also recognizes that access to technology is more important now than ever as students prepare for a new environment which could include both learning at home and in-person learning. That is why the government is providing $15 million to secure up to 35,000 classroom computers. This new technology will help ensure students who face difficulty accessing technology are able to leverage these tools to succeed in the 2020-21 school year. ""COVID-19 is forcing the world around us to change, to adapt, and to embrace the digital landscape,"" said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education. ""We will invest more in student computers, technology, and internet than any government in Ontario history because we want our youth to retain a competitive advantage. By delivering this funding, we are sending a signal to the country: Ontario is investing in our kids, closing the digital divide, and taking action to ensure all students have the best opportunity to learn when returning to school in the fall."" Access to digital learning resources, as well as internet connectivity and access to devices, have all been identified by school boards and other stakeholders as urgent needs during the current school closure period. The Government is proceeding with internet connectivity at all schools in Ontario, including all high schools by September 2020 and all elementary schools by September 2021. QUOTES: ""School Mental Health Ontario is proud to work together with Ontario school boards to advance student mental health through evidence-based mental health promotion, prevention, and early intervention services.  We welcome this significant new investment in the mental health of students. It will help schools to reach more students with needed supports, and enhances the power of prevention and wellness promotion. Overall, this commitment contributes to a stronger system of mental health support for children, youth, and families in our province."" - Kathy Short, Executive Director, School Mental Health Ontario ""Big Brothers Big Sisters Ontario is honoured to be a part of the provincial government's efforts and investment into the mental health and well-being of all students in Ontario. We are committed to supporting over 20,000 and counting vulnerable youth across our province. We are dedicated to being present for the families, children and youth who need our assistance and are proud to be part of Ontario's recovery efforts."" - Susan Ingram, Executive Director, Big Brothers Big Sisters of Ottawa  ""Technology in education fails when it diminishes the role of the teacher in the learning process. The Ontario Government is committed to solutions that maximize the role of teachers in improving student outcomes for important STEM subjects like math. Knowledgehook, trusted by teachers in 69 of the 72 school districts across Ontario, is used by over 150,000 math teachers globally. Today's announcement by Minister Lecce shows a commitment to help close the digital divide and prepare the next generation of Canadian problem solvers for the global economy by putting educators first."" - Travis Ratnam, CEO, Knowledgehook ""In the last few months, the Ontario government, school boards, teachers, administrators and parents have all worked together and gone to extraordinary lengths to help Ontario students transition to distance, remote or fully online learning. While there is no substitute for teacher-directed learning in the classroom, here at home in Ontario and around the world, we've seen what technology can do to help keep our education system resilient, and to make a real, positive impact in the way students learn."" - John Baker, President and CEO, D2L ""The necessary emergency measures have posed significant risks to the mental health of kids who have been away from their support networks at school. It is to be expected that returning to school will also present unique challenges after a prolonged period of closures. Improving access to mental health professionals and other resources is good news for children and their families."" - Dr. Ronald Cohn, President and CEO of The Hospital for Sick Children

Quick Facts

Ontario launched Learn at Home and Apprendre à la maison, a new online portal that provides resources for families so students can continue their education while schools are closed due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation.
The Ministry of Education provides operating funding to Ontario’s 72 district school boards through the annual GSN education funding model. Funding to school boards is provided on a combination of per student, per school, and per board basis.

Government protecting small businesses as the province safely and gradually reopens 

June 17, 2020  9:35 P.M.

Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing


TORONTO — Today, the Ontario government passed the Protecting Small Business Act, temporarily halting or reversing evictions of commercial tenants and protecting them from being locked out or having their assets seized during COVID-19. The legislation applies to businesses that are eligible for federal/provincial rent assistance for evictions from May 1, 2020 until August 31, 2020.
""We know COVID-19 has had a significant impact on small businesses, which are the backbone of our economy,"" said Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. ""This Legislation will allow us to protect small businesses and help them get back on their feet so they can continue to create jobs and participate in the rebuilding of the provincial economy."" Landlords and tenants are encouraged to participate in the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) for small businesses. The pause on evictions does not apply to those participating in CECRA for small businesses, as the program requires landlords to enter into a rent reduction agreement with their impacted small business tenants and commits them to a moratorium on evictions for three months. ""Pausing evictions of commercial tenants is another way we are supporting small businesses and providing much needed relief as we work to reopen the economy,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance and Chair of the Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee. ""Working with the federal government, we are providing more than $900 million in relief to tenants and landlords in Ontario through the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance for small businesses.""

Quick Facts

In partnership with the federal government, Ontario is committing $241 million to CECRA for small businesses, which will provide more than $900 million in support for small businesses and their landlords. 
CECRA for small businesses provides forgivable loans to eligible commercial landlords for the months of April, May, and June 2020. Small business landlords would be asked to forgive at least 25 per cent of the tenant's total rent, tenants would be asked to pay up to 25 per cent of rent and the provincial and federal governments would share the cost of the remaining 50 per cent. 
Tenants and landlords can learn who is eligible and how to apply at Ontario.ca/rentassistance. The application deadline is August 31, 2020.

Buy Local to Celebrate Ontario Craft Beer Week and Ontario Wine Week

June 17, 2020  4:00 P.M.

Ministry of Finance


TORONTO — The Ontario government is encouraging consumers to mark Ontario Craft Beer Week and Ontario Wine Week by supporting local beverage alcohol producers as the province takes additional steps to help the sector recover from the impacts of COVID-19.
The government is increasing choice and convenience for consumers by working to expand made-in-Ontario options at the LCBO. This includes increased marketing, converting available shelf space to profile Ontario products, and making more products available for sale, including bag-in-box wine and those made in the province. The supports are effective June 21 until October 2020.  ""Buying local not only supports Ontario's wineries, breweries, cideries, distilleries and other local producers, but it also means getting a quality product to enjoy responsibly,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. ""Our alcohol sector told us they are being negatively impacted by the measures that have been necessary to contain COVID-19. That's why our government is taking steps to help these local businesses continue providing good jobs for people in Ontario and producing the products consumers enjoy."" This initiative is part of a number of ways the government is supporting Ontario's beverage alcohol sector, including:   Pausing increases to beer and wine taxes, previously scheduled to take effect in spring 2020;Temporarily allowing licensed restaurants and bars to sell alcohol with food takeout and delivery orders between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m.;Temporarily allowing licensed restaurants and bars to sell spirits at a lower price with food takeout and delivery orders;Allowing restaurants and bars to temporarily create or extend outdoor patio spaces to safely accommodate patrons and staff once licensed establishments are permitted to reopen for business;Making it easier for cideries to sell directly to consumers by temporarily removing the requirement for cideries to have five acres of planted fruit to qualify for an on-site store;Extending the Ontario Wine and Grape Strategy to 2021-22, providing $7.5 million annually for VQA Support, $4.8 million annually for marketing and promotion, $250,000 for research and $250,000 for benchmarking; and Extending the Small Cidery and Small Distillery Support Program to 2021-22, providing $2.6 million annually to help eligible businesses grow and scale up their operations. ""Our province is home to some of the best breweries and wineries in the world who produce top quality craft beers and world-class wines. Now more than ever, I encourage you to support Ontario's many great craft producers by choosing and responsibly enjoying local,"" said Ernie Hardeman, Ontario's Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. With most of the province in stage two of Ontario's Framework to Reopen Our Province, many people can now enjoy Ontario-made beverage alcohol on patios of their local bars and restaurants. ""People and businesses in Ontario have been significantly affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, including the beverage alcohol industry and workers,"" said Attorney General Doug Downey. ""These Made-in-Ontario businesses play an essential role in the success of our local economies and the vibrancy of communities in our province. Our government will keep working to support this important sector through these challenges.""

Quick Facts

This year, Ontario Craft Beer Week and Ontario Wine Week runs from June 14-20.
On Wednesday June 3, Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance, held a beverage alcohol sector industry roundtable to meet with stakeholders and listen to how COVID-19 is impacting their businesses. This meeting was part the Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee’s ongoing consultations to ensure a strong economic recovery. 
The government is committed to upholding the highest standards for social responsibility, including the strong regulatory framework that is in place for alcohol sales, which includes a minimum age to purchase alcohol, mandatory staff training and minimum retail prices.

Ontario Takes Steps to Resolve Land Disputes Faster
Move will help increase housing supply in the province

June 17, 2020  3:00 P.M.

Ministry of the Attorney General


TORONTO - The Ontario government is creating the new Ontario Land Tribunals to make it faster to resolve land use planning disputes and increase housing supply across the province. Leading the organization will be Marie Hubbard, associate chairperson of the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal, and a former municipal councillor, regional councillor and mayor, as well as chair of planning for the Durham Region.
Ms. Hubbard was appointed Executive Chair of the new organization and will assume the position effective July 1, 2020.  ""Our government is committed to creating a justice system for the 21st century, one that is more accessible, responsive and resilient,"" said Attorney General Doug Downey. ""More efficient services at tribunals is a key element of our plan as they will drive innovation in the justice sector and move more services online. Ms. Hubbard's experience reducing the backlog at the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal will help ensure land disputes continue to be resolved quickly, and more housing is built across the province."" The Ontario Land Tribunals will bring together the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal, Environmental Review Tribunal, Board of Negotiation, Conservation Review Board and Mining and Lands Tribunal. The new organization will help ensure Ontario's land tribunals have the dedicated support and resources to resolve disputes fairly and faster. Existing or new cases will not be delayed as a result of the change. The Ontario Land Tribunals will focus on more efficient land and environmental disputes resolution to help increase the housing supply, which helps support More Homes, More Choice: Ontario's Housing Supply Action Plan.  As the Attorney General works with partners to advance Ontario's outdated justice system, people and businesses in Ontario can expect further announcements supporting the efficient resolution of disputes at land tribunals.

Quick Facts

The Ontario Land Tribunals will build on changes that have helped to reduce delays when there is a dispute in the land use planning process. The backlog of Ontario Municipal Board legacy cases at the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal has been reduced from 1,200 cases in June 2019 to 736 cases as of May 25, 2020.
In February 2020, Marie Hubbard was the successful candidate in the competition for Associate Chair, Local Planning Appeal Tribunal.

Province Enters Stage 2 of Reopening Amidst Extraordinary Progress in Stopping the Spread of COVID-19 and Protecting Public Health and Safety

June 17, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Today, Premier Doug Ford issued the following statement reflecting on the province's response to an unprecedented international public health crisis:
""Three months ago, our government made the difficult, but necessary decision to enact a provincial Declaration of Emergency in response to the outbreak of COVID-19, closing down non-essential businesses and limiting organized public events and social gatherings. It marked the beginning of one of the darkest periods in our province's history. Our government, joined by thousands of frontline health care workers, volunteers, businesses, and the 14.5 million people who call this province home, rallied immediately to stop the spread of COVID-19. The collective call to action was inspiring, but as we all know, it has been a long and difficult road with losses far greater than anyone could have imagined. I am proud and grateful for how everyone from every corner of the province has gone above and beyond in the face of this global crisis. Since the first sign of the outbreak, we have been laser-focused on supporting our frontline workers and building the capacity that our health care system needed to respond to this threat. Thanks to the diligent work of our hospitals and their top-notch staff, Ontario now has a total of 21,425 acute care beds and 3,276 critical care beds, 2,583 of which are equipped with ventilators. During the peak of the outbreak, the system freed up between 5,000 and 6,000 acute care beds, and had preparedness plans in place to go up to 11,000 acute care beds if needed. Within weeks, we built a network of over 30 laboratories to ramp up our testing capacity, starting at about 3,000 per day in March to reaching over 20,000 a day in recent weeks. Ontario now leads the country in testing capacity. Public health units have also increased their capacity to conduct rapid case and contact tracing, respond to outbreaks, and support local response efforts. We have been tireless in our efforts to ensure frontline workers have the personal protective equipment (PPE) they need to carry out their heroic work in hospitals, long-term care homes and other care settings. We mobilized the manufacturing might of Ontario to make the PPE we need here at home and to showcase ""Ontario Made"" as the gold standard worldwide for quality medical supplies and equipment. Through the Ontario Together portal, thousands of leads on emergency supplies have resulted in more than $610 million in purchases of critical equipment, including 10,040 ventilators, 123 million masks, four million face shields, 173 million surgical gloves, and 21 million gowns. To fortify the iron ring of protection around our seniors, we have provided our long-term care homes with $243 million in emergency funding to hire staff, purchase supplies, and increase capacity. Thanks to our hospital partners, rapid response teams are working with 150 of our long-term care homes across the province to support infection protection and control and staffing needs. We are also incredibly grateful to our brave men and women in the Canadian Armed Forces who have been deployed to provide critical support in seven of our long-term care homes. Above all, the people of this province have shown the true Ontario spirit with countless individuals volunteering in their communities and caring for those in need. Thanks to our partnership with Spark Ontario, over 4,300 volunteers have signed up to help people affected by COVID-19. Thousands of volunteers, including retired nurses and medical students, put up their hand to manage the phone lines at Telehealth Ontario and assist with case management and contact tracing. Through Ontario's Health Workforce Matching Portal, over 24,400 volunteers have asked to be matched with organizations in need of help, including our long-term care homes. As we work to find a treatment or vaccine for COVID-19, we must remain ready for any scenario. I will continue to press the federal government to provide the necessary long-term and sustained funding commitment that will ensure Ontario has the strong health care system and the strong economic recovery it deserves. Our province alone faces up to $23 billion in additional cost pressures related to health care, protecting our most vulnerable seniors, and supporting our municipal partners in delivering critical services. Ottawa must come to the table with serious commitments to funding support. I want to thank each and every person in Ontario for their collective efforts during this unprecedented time. As we gradually reopen our economy, we will continue to support Ontario families and businesses, so they can get back on their feet quickly and get back to work safely. These are the challenges that define a province and its people. While tough times still lie ahead of us, if we stick together and keep looking out for each other, we will come back stronger than ever before.""

Canada and Ontario Support Beef and Hog Farmers During COVID-19
Funding will cover increased costs, while redirecting surplus pork to those in need

June 17, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs


WOODSTOCK — The governments of Canada and Ontario are investing up to $10 million in emergency assistance for beef and hog farmers. The funding will help cover the increased costs of feeding market ready cattle and hogs due to COVID-19 related processing delays, while redirecting surplus pork products to help those in need. This program will help ensure the country's food supply chain will remain strong and ready to recover as the economy gradually and safely reopens.
The beef cattle set-aside program will provide beef farmers with up to $5 million in support. Farmers can claim $2 per head of cattle per day to help pay for additional maintenance costs should they have to keep their market-ready animals on their farms for extended periods of time. The hog sector support program will also provide hog farmers with up to $5 million to help cover additional maintenance costs. Ontario is also providing up to $1.5 million to process and package surplus pork for food banks, to provide those in need with fresh, locally produced pork products. This will assist the pork processing industry with managing capacity while helping those in need. ""We are grateful to our hardworking farmers who are providing Canadians with safe and healthy meat products,"" said the Honourable Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. ""This investment is another way we are supporting the agricultural sector to ensure a stable meat supply and keep high-quality and affordable Canadian meat products on our grocery store shelves and kitchen tables."" ""During consultations with the pork and beef sectors, the need for emergency support to help them maintain their operations during COVID-19 was clear,"" said Ernie Hardeman, Ontario Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. ""We understand the challenges that our farmers are facing and we are working with our commodity organizations to address their priorities and help our farmers manage through these unprecedented times."" Both the beef cattle set-aside and hog sector support programs are being offered through AgriRecovery initiatives, under the Canadian Agricultural Partnership. The provincial contributions are part of Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19. ""Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19 provided $17 billion in relief, including additional resources for the health care system and direct support for people and jobs,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance and Chair of Ontario's Jobs and Recovery Committee.

Ontario Extends Emergency Orders
Province Focuses on Safe, Gradual Approach as Reopening Continues

June 17, 2020  7:00 A.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government has extended all emergency orders currently in force under s.7.0.2 (4) of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act. This extension will be in effect until June 30, 2020 to ensure the government continues to have the necessary tools to safely and gradually reopen the province, while continuing to support frontline health care workers and protect vulnerable populations from COVID-19.
""Extending these emergency orders gives our frontline health care providers the necessary flexibility to rapidly respond to urgent needs and protect our most vulnerable,"" said Premier Ford. ""Even though we're seeing decreasing infection rates with increased testing levels, we can't let our guard down just yet. We need to keep these emergency measures in place to support our frontline heroes and we must all continue following the public health advice, so we can reopen more of the province safely and gradually."" While current emergency orders will remain in place until the end of the month, the government will continue to review each one on an ongoing, case-by-case basis to determine when and if they can safely be adjusted or lifted, as part of the province's framework to safely reopen the province. Over the past week, the government announced 31 public health unit regions across the province may proceed to Stage 2 of its Framework for Reopening the Province. This will allow additional businesses and services to reopen and more people to return to work. In addition, larger social gatherings of up to 10 people are now allowed in all parts of the province, and people are encouraged to create or join a social circle. Social circles are different from social gatherings. Social gatherings of people from outside your household are limited to 10 people. A social circle is voluntary, but if adopted should include all household members, and can include family and friends outside the household up to a maximum of 10 people in the social circle, who can interact and come into close contact with one another without physical distancing. To learn how to create a social circle, please see the step-by-step guide. To help stop the spread, people should continue to follow public health guidelines, including practising physical distancing, wearing a face covering where physical distancing is a challenge and washing their hands thoroughly and frequently. Anyone who is worried they may have COVID-19, or who may have been exposed to the virus, is encouraged to go for testing. A full list of emergency orders can be found on the e-Laws website under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act and at Ontario.ca/alert.

Quick Facts

The Government of Ontario declared a provincial emergency on March 17, 2020 under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act. The declaration of emergency was extended and is currently in effect until June 30, 2020.

Ministry of Transportation


COCHRANE - Today, Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation, announced that the Government of Ontario is connecting Northeastern Ontario with a long-awaited highway bypass project in the Town of Cochrane. This project will improve safety and reduce travel times for families and truck drivers, while creating jobs in local communities as the province reopens the economy.
The project will connect Highway 652 to Highway 11, providing an alternate route for travellers and trucks moving goods and reducing traffic on municipal roads. It is anticipated that the bypass could divert approximately 960 vehicles and 195 trucks per day away from municipal roads. ""This is a critical project as it will make it easier and safer for both travellers and truck drivers by reducing traffic on local municipal roads,"" said Minister Mulroney. ""We understand the unique transportation challenges of the North and are committed to ensuring everyone has access to a safe transportation network that supports northern businesses, communities and families. This also includes optimizing bus services and options for passenger rail service."" The province is proceeding with the planning, preliminary design and environmental assessment for the extension of Highway 652 to Highway 11 at Cochrane. This is part of the government's plan to build safer and better highways, while improving and modernizing transportation for families and businesses in Northern Ontario. ""Our government recognizes the need to improve transportation options for the people and businesses of Northern Ontario,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines. ""Today, we are taking the next step in this important project that will better connect Northeastern Ontario and help grow the local economy.""

Quick Facts

Ontario is developing regional transportation plans that will help build a better transportation system to keep people and goods moving across the province, including Northern Ontario. This project is part of the province’s plan to get people where they need to go and support economic opportunities in the North. 
The bypass would provide a connection for travellers on Highway 652 to access Highways 11, 574 and 579. 
This is the first phase of the project, which is expected to take up to 2.5 years. Work is anticipated to begin in 2020. 
The bypass is expected to be 2-lanes wide and between 3 and 6 kilometres in length.
The planning, preliminary design and environmental assessment will review the connection to the Rockshield, Tembec and ONR industrial facilities.

It also includes information on what personal protective equipment may be needed for workers. The government's first general workplace guide is accompanied by a template that employers can fill in to develop their own unique COVID-19 safety plan. The materials will help employers: Identify the risks for transmitting the virus through person-to-person contact and actions such as touching faces with hands that have been contaminated by contact with surfaces and objects;Determine what controls are needed to help mitigate risk, such as engineering controls like the installation of plexiglass to separate workers from customers, administrative controls limiting the number of workers in a space at one time, and personal protective equipment including face and eye protection;Create a workplace safety plan based on the identified risks and appropriate controls specific to the employer's workplace;Implement the plan in the workplace, and review and update it as the situation evolves; andCommunicate the actions being taken to workers and other people entering the workplace.The new guide is supported by 121 workplace resources available at Ontario.ca/covidsafety to help protect workers from the virus. They include safety guidelines and helpful posters with tips for 28 distinct sectors such as construction, food, agriculture, manufacturing and long-term care. These materials were developed by the Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development in consultation with provincial health and safety associations. ""Nothing is more important than protecting the health and safety of workers and others during these unprecedented times,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""I strongly encourage all employers in the province to visit our website at Ontario.ca/covidsafety. The tools are there. The resources are there. The most up to date information is there.

Funding for Broadband Infrastructure Across the North

June 16, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines


KENORA - The Ontario government is investing more than $2.3 million in seven broadband projects that will support rural and Indigenous communities in Northern Ontario. This funding will connect northerners to reliable broadband infrastructure that will allow people to stay in touch with family and friends, access public services and work and run a business from anywhere.
Broadband investments made through the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation (NOHFC) include:  $1,036,772 for the Corporation du Développement Économique et Communautaire (CDEC) de Dubreuilville to install fibre optic infrastructure from Wawa to Dubreuilville, as well as to plan and secure partnerships with telecommunications companies for future broadband improvement projects $461,971 for Ontario Research and Innovation Optical Network (ORION) to upgrade its fibre optic network and install 11 in-line amplifier sites between Sudbury and Thunder Bay $240,804 for Tbaytel to deliver internet services in the rural areas surrounding Thunder Bay, including the municipalities of Shuniah, Oliver-Paipoonge, Neebing and Fort William First Nation $232,500 for North Eastern Ontario Communications Network (NEOnet) Inc. to launch and administer its Broadband for Remote Areas program, which will provide grants to small- and medium-sized enterprises located in Northern Ontario to assist with the purchase and installation of specialized equipment that will provide two-way, high-speed internet service $173,000 for Mitaanjigamiing First Nation to upgrade broadband fibre optic cable and infrastructure in the community $139,130 for Keewaytinook Okimakanak to secure an 18-month contract for extended satellite bandwidth for the remote First Nations of Fort Hope, Martin Falls, Neskantaga and Webequie until permanent fibre optic cable is installed $110,942 for Keewaytinook Okimakanak to upgrade broadband fibre optic cable and infrastructure in the Ojibway Nation of Saugeen community.  ""Now more than ever, there is a need to improve broadband services in Northern Ontario. For too long, the north has lacked access to high-speed internet with limited connectivity in many remote communities,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines. ""Broadband is a key driver for economic growth, innovation and job creation and keeps our northern communities connected to their families and businesses. Our government is proud to support these critical infrastructure projects."" This NOHFC investment follows a recent investment of $150 million for the new Improving Connectivity in Ontario program that funds broadband infrastructure projects in rural, remote and underserved regions of Ontario. This is part of the province's $315 million initiative called Up to Speed: Ontario's Broadband and Cellular Action Plan. ""COVID-19 is increasing demand for reliable broadband service to connect Ontarians to their work, education and their businesses,"" said Laurie Scott, Minister of Infrastructure. ""It is clear functioning remotely will continue to be a regular way of life and fast and reliable internet will be critical to bridge the digital divide in Northern Ontario.""  Promoting and stimulating economic development initiatives is an important part of the government's plan to create more good-paying jobs and opportunities in the north and attract new and expanded investment so northern communities can grow and thrive.

Quick Facts

Through Up to Speed: Ontario’s Broadband and Cellular Action Plan, the Province is investing $315 million over five years to focus on expanded broadband access for unserved and underserved communities. These investments will leverage funding from the private sector and other levels of government to directly generate up to $1 billion in total investment over five years. This will lead to community and economic benefits well beyond this investment.
The NOHFC promotes and supports economic development across Northern Ontario by providing financial assistance to projects – big and small, rural and urban – that stimulate growth, job creation and develop a skilled workforce.
Since June 2018, the NOHFC has invested more than $176 million in 1,224 projects in Northern Ontario. This has leveraged more than $650 million in investment and created or retained 3,559 jobs.
The Ontario government is getting more people back to work and more recreational activities open by moving forward with a regional approach to Stage 2 of reopening the province. For a full list of spaces and services allowed to open in regions entering Stage 2, please visit ontario.ca/reopen.

Ontario Expanding Data Collection to Help Stop Spread of COVID-19 
Additional Information will provide a More Complete Picture of the Outbreak

June 15, 2020  3:30 P.M.

Ministry of Health


TORONTO — In response to requests by community leaders and public health experts, the Ontario government is proposing a regulatory change to mandate the reporting of data on race, income, language and household size for individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19. This will help ensure the province has a more complete picture of the outbreak. This change will allow for the collection of data in a consistent way across the province, while ensuring the privacy of Ontarians is protected.
""As the COVID-19 outbreak has evolved locally, Ontario's public health system has demonstrated remarkable responsiveness,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""As has been requested by community leaders, we are taking action to support and expand the work needed to help protect our communities all across the province."" Under these proposed changes, individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19 infection will be asked additional questions about their race, income, languages spoken, and household size. Individuals can choose not to answer any or all of these questions. Individuals' privacy is protected as it is for all information currently collected on other diseases. ""We recognize that some Ontarians may be at greater risk of COVID-19 infection. This includes racialized Ontarians and individuals with lower incomes,"" said Elliott. ""Collecting these data will help guide decisions as work continues to stop the spread of the virus and protect some of our most vulnerable people."" Collecting data province-wide, and in a standardized way, will ensure a more complete picture of the outbreak is captured. The province will continue to work with local public health units and other health care partners to implement effective policies to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Quick Facts

To help implement this data collection effort, the province is engaging with health equity stakeholders and experts, including the Ontario Anti-Racism Directorate and Indigenous partners. 
Anonymized data will be made available to recognized researchers through the Ontario Health Data Platform, but protecting individuals’ privacy protection is the priority. 
The province recently implemented the new phase of its COVID-19 testing plan to detect and quickly stop the spread of the virus. The significant expansion of testing will go hand-in-hand with local public health units’ ongoing case and contact tracing efforts. 
Ontario has increased public health funding by $160 million to support COVID-19 monitoring, surveillance and laboratory and home testing.

Increased funding will support community-based and Indigenous-led programs

June 15, 2020  2:30 P.M.

Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services


TORONTO — The Ontario Government is investing up to $46 million over the next five years to increase community-based and Indigenous-specific supports for child and youth victims of sex trafficking. The Anti-Human Trafficking Community Supports Fund and the Indigenous-led Initiatives Fund will prioritize early intervention and increased protection for victims of sexual exploitation and dedicated survivor supports.
“Over the last year, we heard from our frontline agencies, survivors and Indigenous communities and organizations that there is a critical need to increase available supports for children and youth affected by sex trafficking,” said Jill Dunlop, Associate Minister of Children and Women’s Issues. “Our goal is to build a more comprehensive network of anti-human trafficking services across Ontario, so more victims have access to the supports they need.” Funding will be available to partners and agencies and focus on areas such as:  Trauma-informed programming developed and delivered by survivor-led organizations,  Dedicated services for victims under age 18, including residential placements and treatment, peer mentoring, as well as education and employment training programs; Culturally-appropriate, Indigenous-designed supports for First Nations, Inuit and Métis victims, families and communities;  Targeted supports for sexually exploited boys, individuals with developmental disabilities, LGBTQ2S individuals, and racialized and newcomer populations; Specialized programs for children and youth involved in or transitioning out of child welfare or the youth justice system.  “Human trafficking isn’t just an enforcement issue — it’s a vicious and violent crime that preys on our most vulnerable, robbing them of their health, safety and dignity,” said Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General.  “By investing in intervention and specialized services for young people, we can reduce the threat of exploitation and protect those most at risk. These programs are vital components of Ontario’s comprehensive plan to combat human trafficking, bring traffickers to justice and end this heinous crime.” Announced in March 2020, Ontario’s Anti-Human Trafficking Strategy will invest $307 million over the next five years on a comprehensive plan to raise awareness of the issue, protect victims and intervene early, support survivors and hold offenders accountable. The strategy reflects valuable input from survivors of human trafficking, Indigenous communities and organizations, law enforcement and frontline service providers. Applications to the Community Supports Fund and Indigenous-led Initiatives Fund will be accepted until 5 p.m. on July 30, 2020.

Quick Facts

Approximately two-thirds of police-reported human trafficking violations in Canada occur in Ontario.
Over 70 per cent of known human trafficking victims identified by police are under the age of 25 and 26 per cent are under 18.
The average age of recruitment into sex trafficking is 13 years old.
Young women and girls are particularly at risk, especially those from Indigenous communities and children and youth in care, though boys, men and people who are LGBTQ2S are also targeted.

June 15, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — More people will be able to get back to work as additional businesses and services in certain regions across Ontario can begin reopening this Friday. The Ontario government, in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health and local medical officers of health, is enabling more regions of the province to enter Stage 2 of the government's reopening framework. These regions are able to reopen due to positive trends of key public health indicators at the local level, including lower transmission of COVID-19, sufficient hospital health system capacity, local public health capacity to assist with rapid case and contact management, and a significant increase in testing provincially.
The details were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance, Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation, and Trade, and Lisa MacLeod, Minister of Heritage, Tourism, Culture, and Sport Industries. Informed by public health advice and workplace safety guidance, and supported by the collective efforts of businesses, workers and families to limit the potential spread of the virus, the latest public health unit regions allowed to move into Stage 2 on Friday, June 19, 2020 at 12:01 a.m. are: Durham Region Health Department;Haldimand-Norfolk Health Unit;Halton Region Health Department;Hamilton Public Health Services;Lambton Health Unit;Niagara Region Public Health Department; andYork Region Public Health Services.These regions are in addition to the 24 public health regions that entered Stage 2 on June 12, 2020. Before opening, business owners need to review the workplace safety guidelines and public health  advice. ""Thanks to the collective efforts of our frontline health care workers and the people in these regions to stop the spread of COVID-19, more businesses will be able to open their doors and thousands of people will be able to go back to work and put food on the table,"" said Premier Ford. ""With the public health trends improving day by day across the province, I am hopeful all regions of Ontario will enter Stage 2 very soon. But we must remain on our guard to prevent any potential surge or secondary wave by continuing to follow the sound advice of our public health officials."" The following regions will remain in Stage 1 under ongoing assessment until trends of key public health indicators demonstrate readiness to move into Stage 2: Peel Public Health;Toronto Public Health; andWindsor-Essex County Health Unit.""Opening more regions of Ontario is another positive sign that we are making steady progress in our collective efforts to contain this deadly virus,"" said Minister Elliott. ""As many more Ontarians begin to work, shop and interact with others, it's never been more important that we continue to follow public health advice, especially physical distancing with anyone outside of our social circle, so we can soon successfully and safely move into Stage 3."" Public health remains the government's top priority. All Ontarians must continue to follow public health advice, including practising physical distancing, wearing a face covering if physical distancing is a challenge, washing hands frequently and thoroughly, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth. If you think you have COVID-19 or have been in contact with someone who has COVID‑19, get tested. The Chief Medical Officer of Health and health experts will continue to closely monitor the evolving situation to advise when public health restrictions can be gradually loosened or if they need to be tightened.

Quick Facts

At the beginning of each week, the government is providing an update on the ongoing assessment of Ontario’s regions, and whether they are ready to move into Stage 2 at the end of the week.

To get tested, people should visit Ontario's website to find their local assessment centre and whether they need to call ahead to make an appointment.
The province has developed a practical step-by-step guide to help Ontarians as they safely develop and join a social circle.

Ministry for Seniors and Accessibility


TORONTO — Today, Raymond Cho, Minister for Seniors and Accessibility, issued the following statement to mark World Elder Abuse Awareness Day:
""As we pause to observe World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, I encourage everyone to reflect on what we can do together to protect Ontario's seniors from physical and emotional abuse. The health, safety and well-being of Ontario's seniors is of the utmost importance to our government, especially during the COVID-19 outbreak. Our seniors are highly susceptible to this deadly virus and we are doing everything we can to protect them and ensure they get the support they need while self-isolating. This includes: investing $11 million to implement the Ontario Community Support Program to help fund the deliveries of meals, medicine, and other necessities to seniors and people with disabilities in need, a pandemic partnership with SparkOntario to match volunteers with seniors who need help in communities across the province, and providing guidance and supports on how to reduce social isolation and conduct wellness check-ins for seniors. In order to eradicate elder abuse, seniors and their loved ones can take comfort in knowing that our government is investing in prevention programs.  We are providing support through public education for our youth and training for frontline staff to help recognize the signs of, and raise awareness about, the prevalence of elder abuse. The government is partnering with Elder Abuse Prevention Ontario to offer remote and virtual training, as well as community outreach. It is incumbent on all of us to support and protect older Ontarians so they can enjoy good health and stay active in their communities. We are also funding coordinated community resources to support seniors who are in need by investing in the province-wide Seniors Safety Line: a 24/7, confidential and free resource in over 200 languages which offers safety planning and counselling to older adults experiencing abuse, or those at-risk of abuse, and educating seniors about changes to Power of Attorney and other legal and financial matters to lower the risk of domestic or financial abuse. Together, we can create a network of caring and connected communities that keep seniors safe across our great province. Together, we can ensure that older Ontarians receive the respect, and support, they deserve.""

Ministry of Health


TORONTO ― The Ontario government is providing more flexibility on the number of attendees permitted at indoor and outdoor wedding and funeral ceremonies, in recognition of the importance of being with loved ones during the moments that matter most.

For both indoor and outdoor ceremonies, those attending must follow proper health and safety advice, including practising physical distancing from people who are not from the same household or their established 10-person social circle. ""With recent progress to reduce the spread of COVID-19, we are able to ease restrictions on these special ceremonies,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health.

Ontarians Encouraged to Establish Social Circles
Creating a Close Group of up to 10 People Will Help Reduce Social Isolation

June 12, 2020  1:30 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — People throughout Ontario are being encouraged to establish a social ""circle"" of no more than 10 people who can interact and come into close contact with one another without physical distancing. Dr. David Williams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, updated public health advice to come into effect immediately province-wide to allow social circles of up to 10 members, including those outside the immediate household. Social circles will support the mental health and well-being of Ontarians and help reduce social isolation.
Details on how to establish a social circle were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Dr. Williams. ""At the outset of the pandemic, we had to make the necessary, but difficult decision to ban large public gatherings and strongly advise physical distancing with everyone except immediate household members"" said Premier Ford. ""As the public health trends improve and our collective efforts start to pay off, we're now able to take another step forward today by allowing families and their loved ones to reunite and spend time with one another safely through social circles."" Ontarians who wish to form a safe social circle should follow these five simple steps: Start with your current circle: the people you live with or who regularly come into your household;If your current circle is under 10 people, you can add members to your circle, including those from another household, family members or friends;Get agreement from everyone that they will join the circle;Keep your social circle safe. Maintain physical distancing with anyone outside of your circle; andBe true to your circle. No one should be part of more than one circle.The province has developed a practical step-by-step guide to help Ontarians as they safely develop and join a social circle. ""Ontarians should think of their circles as the people they can touch, hug and come into close contact as we continue our shared fight against COVID-19,"" said Minister Elliott. ""While this is an exciting step forward, every Ontarian should follow the advice provided by our public health experts to ensure they do so safely and in a way that limits the spread of this virus, including and especially by only being part of one circle. We all owe it to each other to act responsibly."" The rules for social circles are different from the proposed expansion of social gatherings from five to 10 people. Social gatherings can be any 10 people from outside your household, but where physical distancing of at least two metres should be maintained. For example, the expansion of social gatherings enables individuals and families to enjoy the company of others at backyard barbeques and picnics in neighbourhood parks, while respecting physical distancing advice. On the other hand, social circles will enable Ontarians to enjoy close contact with members of their circle. This could include hugging, carpooling, enjoying a patio and sharing a meal without staying two metres apart. Ontarians should avoid close-contact activities with anyone outside of their circle if they are unable to maintain physical distancing. Social circles will also bring back supports from people outside of their household who can now help with children, seniors or those in need. ""Not only will social circles help to improve people's mental health and reduce social isolation, they will support rapid case and contact tracing by limiting the number of close contacts, in the event of a case of COVID-19 in that circle,"" said Dr. Williams. While physical distancing does not need to be practised between members of the same social circle, other public health advice, including frequent hand washing, should be maintained. Anyone who is ill or feeling sick should immediately limit their contact with anyone in their circle, inform the other members of the circle, self-isolate, and seek testing if they have COVID-19 symptoms, by visiting one of the 145 assessment centres across Ontario. They should also seek testing if they are concerned that they might have been exposed to COVID-19 or be at risk.

Quick Facts

Anyone who is ill or feeling sick should immediately stop contact with anyone in their social circle, seek assistance from a health care professional or consider being tested for COVID-19. 
The number of COVID-19 assessment centres is changing regularly. People are encouraged to check the ministry website (https://covid-19.ontario.ca/assessment-centre-locations) or their local public health unit.
Individuals at higher risk, including those over 70 and individuals with compromised immune systems and/or underlying medical conditions, may choose not to participate in a social circle depending on their unique circumstances.

While physical distancing does not need to be practised inside the social circle, other public health advice, including frequent hand washing, respiratory etiquette, and not touching your eyes, nose or mouth should be maintained.

Additional funding will provide food and snacks while schools are closed

June 12, 2020 11:00 A.M.

Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services


TORONTO — The Ontario government is investing $1 million to improve access to healthy meals and snacks for school-age children and youth during the COVID-19 outbreak. As a result of the province-wide school closures, the Student Nutrition Program has had to find new ways to support families experiencing increased food insecurity.
""The well-being of children and families is a top priority for our government,"" said Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services. ""Proper nutrition is a foundation for success and we need to do everything we can to ensure students get access to healthy food. I want to thank our many community partners and volunteers working with us to provide students with nutritious meals and snacks during this difficult period."" The Student Nutrition Program is delivered in partnership with local agencies, school boards and community partner organizations and supported by countless volunteers. Over the past few months, the program has been adapted to include new local approaches to meal delivery, including distributing grocery gift cards or farm vouchers, delivering food boxes, meal kits or frozen meals and supporting food banks to provide nutritious items to families with school-age children. ""We said we would do whatever it takes to keep our students safe and healthy as we respond to this unprecedented challenge,"" said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education.

Ontario Protecting Agri-Food Workers during COVID-19
Government investing $15 million into health and safety measures for farm operations

June 12, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs


WOODSTOCK — The Government of Ontario is taking additional steps to better protect workers in the agri-food sector during the COVID-19 outbreak. The province is significantly expanding the Agri-food Workplace Protection Program and committing up to $15 million to enhance health and safety measures on farms and in food processing facilities.
""Agri-food businesses and their hardworking employees play a critical role in keeping our food supply chain strong, providing us with fresh, high-quality and nutritious food all year round,"" said Ernie Hardeman, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. ""Today's investment will allow farmers to adapt to this new environment and implement additional health and safety measures during the COVID-19 outbreak."" The Enhanced Agri-food Workplace Protection Program provides cost-share funding for farmers to purchase Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and implement workplace modifications and other measures. By significantly expanding the program, farmers can take additional steps to improve health and safety for their workers and ensure the continued supply of locally grown food during the COVID-19 outbreak. Today's announcement more than triples the previous investment through this program by the governments of Canada and Ontario. Both levels of government had committed a total of up to $4.5 million for farmers and provincially licensed meat processors to enhance worker safety under the Canadian Agricultural Partnership program. Some of the measures already approved through this program include purchases of PPE, temporary housing for ill workers, building physical barriers for worker separation, enhanced hand washing facilities and a tent rental to expand lunch room space. The Ontario government is also supporting producers and other operations that experience unexpected costs for short-term accommodation and transportation as a result of the impacts of COVID-19.

Quick Facts

The Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) will deliver cost-share funding for the Enhanced Agri-food Workplace Protection Program.
OMAFRA has also partnered with the Workplace Safety & Prevention Services (WSPS) to provide agri-food businesses, organizations and associations with educational resources, tools and consulting services to help them implement COVID-19 health and safety protocols. Additional details about businesses that may qualify can be found on the WSPS website. 
The Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development recently released safety guidelines for employers to help protect workers, customers, and the general public from COVID-19. 
Health and safety inspectors are now working with employers in the agri-food sector to help ensure the safety of employees, including temporary foreign workers.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency provides information on COVID-19 for industry.
Today’s announcement is part of Ontario’s Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19. This $17 billion immediate response to the global pandemic provides urgent and direct support to help businesses, workers, seniors, families, students, Indigenous peoples and communities, and vulnerable populations during COVID-19.
The action plan includes $3.3 billion of additional resources for health care, $3.7 billion to support people and jobs, and it makes available $10 billion in support for people and businesses through tax and other deferrals to improve their cash flow, protecting jobs and household budgets.

Ontario Lifting 30-Day Supply Limit on Prescriptions
Everyone encouraged to buy medications in reasonable quantities

June 11, 2020  7:40 P.M.

Ministry of Health


TORONTO — With the supply of many drugs and medications having stabilized in the province, the Ontario government is lifting the recommended 30-day supply limit for dispensing Ontario Drug Benefit program medications. Effective June 15, 2020, program recipients can return to filling up to 100-day supply at a time from their pharmacy or dispensing physician, when appropriate.
 ""The restriction on the supply of medications was critical to prevent drug shortages due to increased demand and stockpiling at the outset of the COVID-19 outbreak,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""With the supply of medications stabilizing, people can safely go back to getting their regular prescriptions filled. This will be much more convenient for people, especially for our seniors and vulnerable citizens.""  Ontario Drug Benefit recipients' co-payments will return to their previous amounts. People are encouraged to buy the medications they need in reasonable quantities. This will help ensure that everyone can get their prescriptions filled as we continue to try to stop the spread of COVID-19. The province will continue to monitor the situation to ensure there are no disruptions to the drug supply chain in the future.

Quick Facts

In March 2020, to ensure there was an adequate supply of medications in the province during COVID-19, pharmacists and physicians were asked to dispense 30-days or less of medication at a time for Ontario Drug Benefit recipients, with some exceptions.
By taking this action, the government helped ensure Ontarians were able to access the medications they need during this unprecedented time.

Ontario Opens New Modern Provincial Police Detachment in Clinton 
Leading edge facility will ensure OPP have resources to better serve and protect Huron County

June 11, 2020  2:00 P.M.

Ministry of the Solicitor General


CLINTON - The Ontario government is opening a new, leading edge Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) detachment in Clinton. The $20 million facility will ensure the local OPP have access to the equipment, space and technology they need to provide Huron County residents with modern, cost-efficient and high-quality police services.
""Whether it is escalating the fight against organized crime or enforcing the law during the COVID-19 outbreak, our provincial police always step up to the challenge,"" said Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General. ""The detachment we're opening today in Clinton is one of nine we're building across the province to ensure OPP officers and staff have a healthy and secure workplace along with the technology and tools they need to continue to keep the people of Ontario safe.""  The Huron County detachment provides 25,000 square feet of space, modern infrastructure designed to support ever-changing technology requirements, six holding cells, and leading edge facilities to secure evidence, as well as closed-circuit television (CCTV) and other advanced security features.  The Huron County detachment is part of the OPP Modernization - Phase 2 project, a $182-million initiative announced in 2018 to replace nine aging OPP facilities across the province that are at the end of their useful lifespan and no longer meet the requirements of today's police operations.  ""This modern detachment places the OPP in the optimal position to serve the communities in Huron County,"" said OPP Commissioner Thomas Carrique. ""This new, improved workspace demonstrates our collective commitment to supporting our members who are dedicated to protecting our citizens, upholding the law and preserving public safety.""  ""Huron County residents as well as OPP officers and staff now have a centralized facility equipped to provide the most up-to-date services and supports,"" said Huron-Bruce MPP Lisa Thompson. ""The new detachment underscores our government's commitment to the OPP and rural infrastructure.""  ""The Huron County OPP detachment is a great example of how our government is investing in infrastructure that puts people's safety first,"" said Laurie Scott, Minister of Infrastructure. ""We are committed to modernizing public infrastructure using our renowned public-private partnership model to best meet the needs of the people in Ontario.""

Quick Facts

The new Huron County detachment is located at 325 Albert St. in Clinton.
The new facility is accessible and designed to meet the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Silver Standard – the standard that recognizes buildings with reduced environmental impacts.
This project has been delivered by Infrastructure Ontario through its public-private partnership (P3) model. 
All nine new detachments are being built by a team led by Bird Capital OMP Project Co Inc.
Construction for this project began in fall 2018.

Strict Health and Safety Guidelines Will Be Required to Protect Residents, Visitors and Staff

June 11, 2020  1:15 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — In consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health, the Ontario government announced the gradual resumption of visits to long-term care homes, retirement homes, and other residential care settings. 
Family and friends will be allowed access to these settings beginning June 18, 2020. Long-term care homes will allow outdoor visits of one person per resident each week at a minimum. Retirement homes will resume indoor and outdoor visits in designated areas or resident suites when physical distancing can be maintained. Other residential care settings will be able to allow outdoor visits of two people at time. Physical distancing will be required for all visits. This approach will ensure the health and safety of residents, staff and visitors. Details were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care, and Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services. ""Thanks to the hard work of our frontline workers and the collective efforts of everyone in stopping the spread, we can now allow families to reunite with their loved ones safely and in person with strict public health measures to protect residents, visitors and staff,"" said Premier Ford. ""But I ask everyone to be cautious and act responsibly as the battle to contain COVID-19 is not over and the risk to our loved ones still remains."" Visits will resume next Thursday, one week after the release of visitor guidelines. They will be subject to strict health and safety protocols, including requiring visitors to pass active screening every time they visit, confirming with staff that they have tested negative for COVID-19 within the previous two weeks, and complying with the infection prevention and control protocols. This includes bringing and wearing a face covering during visits. Additionally, long-term care and retirement homes, as well as other residential care settings, must meet the following conditions before they welcome visitors: Homes must not be in outbreak;Homes must have an established process for communicating visitor protocol and the associated safety procedures; andHomes must maintain the highest infection prevention and control standards.For retirement homes, visitor admissions will vary from home to home depending upon their individual circumstances. ""We know the visitor restrictions have been tough on residents, as families and loved ones play an important role in providing care and emotional support to residents. We are confident these visits can occur safely,"" said Minister Fullerton. ""With the possible spread of COVID-19 in our long-term care homes still being a real threat, people will need to follow strict health and safety protocols in order to protect our most vulnerable."" ""Seniors living in retirement homes have been doing their part to stop the spread of COVID-19,"" said Raymond Cho, Minister for Seniors and Accessibility. ""Our government appreciates their cooperation and we are happy they will soon be able to enjoy visits with family and friends while continuing to stay safe."" Other residential care settings will also be allowed visitors under similar rules. These residential care settings include homes serving people with developmental disabilities, shelters for survivors of gender-based violence, and children's residential settings. ""We are all looking forward to the day when we can once again see family and friends, and spend time together,"" said Minister Smith. ""Today is an important first step in reconnecting loved ones who have been separated all spring."" As the COVID-19 outbreak evolves in Ontario, the direction on visits at long-term care homes, retirement homes and residential settings will continually be updated keeping the safety and emotional wellbeing of residents and staff at the forefront. Visits have been restricted since mid-March, with only essential visitors permitted to enter long-term care and retirement homes.

Quick Facts

In the event of an outbreak at an individual home or residential care setting, non-essential visits will again be restricted. If a second wave of COVID-19 occurs, the government will revert to restricting visitors at all homes and residential care settings to protect residents and staff.

These public health restrictions for long-term care homes, retirement homes, and residential settings are meant to provide meaningful and equitable access to visits for all residents, while considering the staffing and space capacity available to the home to maintain safety of residents, staff and visitors.
The government recently announced the launch of an independent, non-partisan commission into Ontario's long-term care system beginning in July 2020. Details of the commission are now being finalized, including the terms of reference, membership, leadership of the commission and reporting timelines.
Testing of long-term care and retirement home residents and staff for COVID-19 has been completed, or is in the process of being completed, with additional rounds of testing currently underway.

$57 Million Investment in Digital Main Street Will Help Businesses Reopen, Recover and Grow Long after COVID-19

June 11, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade


TORONTO — The Ontario government, in partnership with the federal government, is helping small businesses reach more customers through the Digital Main Street platform. It is a $57-million program which will help up to 22,900 Ontario businesses create and enhance their online presence and generate jobs for more than 1,400 students.
The new program was unveiled today by Prabmeet Sarkaria, Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction, joined by Mélanie Joly, Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages and Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario. ""Ontario's small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and their recovery is critical to Ontario's recovery,"" said Minister Sarkaria. ""As thousands of small businesses across the province closed their doors and halted business during the COVID-19 outbreak, many struggled to shift sales or services online. I am very pleased, that together with Minister Joly and our federal partners, we are providing small businesses with the tools they need to recover, and flourish, as Ontario reopens."" Through the $57-million contribution to the Digital Main Street platform, businesses will be able to take advantage of three new programs to support their digital transformation: shopHERE powered by Google will leverage Ontario's strengths by hiring highly skilled and trained students to build and support the launch of online stores for businesses that previously did not have the capacity to do so themselves. The core goal will be to help small businesses compete and grow, in a world that is increasingly online, and help them recover as quickly as possible following COVID-19.Digital Main Street Grant will help main street small businesses be digitally more effective. Through a $2,500 grant administered by the Ontario BIA Association, small businesses will be able to adopt new technologies and embrace digital marketing. Municipalities, Chambers of Commerce, and Business Improvement Areas (BIAs) can apply for a Digital Service Squad grant, which will allow them to establish teams to provide personalized, one-on-one support.Future-Proofing Main Street will provide specialized and in-depth digital transformation services and support that helps existing main-street firms adapt to changes in their sector and thrive in the new economy. By leveraging teams of digital marketing professionals and talented students, these firms will be able to create new online business models, develop and implement digital and e-commerce marketing strategies, and maximize digital tools, platforms and content.In addition, the Recovery Activation Program, operated through the Toronto Region Board of Trade, will help businesses grow and digitize their operations with custom consulting sessions, online resource sharing, learning webcasts and business planning. As a result of the investment announced today, the program will be offered province-wide and at no cost to businesses.   ""As local economies across Ontario reopen, we're focused on ensuring that our main streets don't just survive, but thrive,"" said Mélanie Joly, Canada's Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages and Minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario.""These businesses are the backbone of our economy, a source of local jobs - and local pride. Thanks to the expanded Digital Main Street platform, they'll be able to expand their offerings and take advantage of more and more people shopping online. Our message to Ontario's small businesses and those whose livelihoods rely on them is clear: we're working with you to support good jobs and help our economy come back stronger than ever."" ""The global marketplace is rapidly changing, and in order to compete and succeed Ontario must adapt,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""By using innovative tools and technologies, Digital Main Street will help our businesses in expanding their reach to meet new markets and adjust to the new realities of doing business during the pandemic and into the next phase of economic recovery."" About 60 percent of Ontario's small enterprises have a website, and only seven percent have an online payment solution. Digitally, Canadian businesses are estimated to be two years behind their U.S. counterparts. In response, the Ontario government is providing significant support to small business. Along with the Digital Main Street platform, the province is investing an additional $150 million in rural broadband which will help open the digital road for many Ontario small businesses. In addition, the province has proposed a ban on commercial evictions to help businesses that have been impacted by restrictions due to COVID-19.

Quick Facts

The Ontario Government reduced the small business Corporate Income Tax rate by 8.7 percent starting January 1, 2020. This will deliver up to $1,500 in annual savings to more than 275,000 businesses.
Ontario’s Small Business Success Strategy, launched prior to COVID-19, identified the need for small businesses across the province to build or enhance their online presence to remain competitive and expand their markets. The 2020 pandemic has further reinforced the need for Ontario small businesses to embrace digital tools, including having online storefronts and expanding them.
To further support small businesses with physical storefronts impacted by COVID-19 restrictions, Ontario is Proposing a Temporary Ban on Commercial Evictions.
The planned expansion of these Digital Main Street programs, including ShopHERE powered by Google and the Future-Proofing Main Street program, are the next evolution in efforts to help businesses embrace digital tools that began with the City of Toronto. Through the leadership of Mayor John Tory and the City of Toronto, the Toronto Association of Business Improvement Areas (TABIA) pioneered the creation of Digital Main Street and laid the foundation for it to be expanded and scaled-up to serve businesses across the province. 
The expansion of the Toronto Association of Business Improvement Areas’ (TABIA) Digital Main Street platform and program is delivered by the Ontario Business Improvement Area Association (OBIAA) with the financial support of the provincial and federal governments.
shopHERE is a Digital Main Street program operated by TABIA. TABIA will also support the delivery of the Future-Proofing Main Street program, along with Communitech and Invest Ottawa.
The Recovery Activation Program is operated by the Toronto Region Board of Trade.

Ontario Introduces Public Transit Safety Guidance
Measures designed to keep passengers and employees safe as more people go back to work during COVID-19 

June 11, 2020  9:00 A.M.

Ministry of Transportation


TORONTO - Today, Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation and Kinga Surma, Associate Minister of Transportation, released comprehensive safety guidance for public transit agencies as the province reopens and more people return to work. This guidance, developed in consultation with health and transit officials, provides transit agencies with the information they need to help protect employees and passengers during the COVID-19 outbreak.
""Although we are making steady progress to contain the virus, it still poses a serious health threat for everyone, especially our most vulnerable citizens,"" said Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation. ""This guidance for transit agencies will provide consistent, clear and practical information that transit agencies can use to help stop the spread of COVID-19 and keep Ontarians moving safely."" The guidance document provides transit agencies with best practices and tips to help stop the spread of COVID-19, such as maintaining physical distance between people whenever possible, highly recommending that passengers wear face coverings or non-medical masks when taking transit, practicing proper hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, installing physical barriers between drivers and passengers, using physical markers between seats and cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces and objects. The provincial transit agency, Metrolinx, has identified over 40 actions to help keep staff and passengers safe when riding GO trains, GO buses and the UP Express. These strategies include:  Piloting health and safety kiosks that provide customers with tools and advice on how to stay safe.Enhanced deep-cleaning processes for vehicles and in stations.Providing hand sanitizer on every GO bus and in every station, so passengers can apply during their trip.Installing dividers for safety on GO trains and buses. ""As the province gradually reopens, we know that more people will be going back to work,"" said Kinga Surma, Associate Minister of Transportation. ""In addition to the guidance document for transit agencies, the Ministry of Transportation and Metrolinx have been working diligently to implement new protocols to keep transit workers and passengers safe and healthy."" Metrolinx has also developed a comprehensive educational campaign called ""Safety Never Stops"" to inform passengers of safety tips on vehicles, platforms and in stations. ""People must continue to exercise caution when on public transit because physical distancing will be a challenge,"" said Christine Elliott, Minister of Health. ""I urge everyone to follow our public health guidelines. They may seem simple, but they are effective in helping to prevent the spread of COVID-19. And if you are worried you have the virus or have been in contact with someone who has the virus, please get tested."" This guidance is part of the work that Ontario and public health experts are doing to carefully monitor the key public health indicators, as outlined in A Framework to Reopening our Province.

Agricultural projects to support the Northwest

June 10, 2020  5:00 P.M.

Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines


FORT FRANCES - The Ontario government is investing more than $1 million through the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation (NOHFC) in two Rainy River agricultural projects, creating three jobs.
Rainy River Future Development Corporation is receiving $1 million to begin a two-year tile drainage program in the Rainy River district. Tile drainage is a common land-improvement practice that creates more consistent crop yields by helping water flow more freely through the soil, which reduces plant stress and wear and tear on farming equipment. Brielmann Agriculture Ltd. is receiving $96,758 to build new storage facilities and purchase new equipment. This project will bring more revenue to the region by making it easier to export food products such as soybeans, canola, oats and wheat from Northern Ontario. ""The agricultural industry is a key economic driver and significant job creator in many northern communities,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines. ""Our investments in the agri-food sector are helping businesses expand operations and increase revenues."" Promoting and stimulating economic development initiatives is an important part of the government's plan to create more good-paying jobs and opportunities in the north and attract new and expanded investment so northern communities can grow and thrive.

Quick Facts

The NOHFC promotes and supports economic development across Northern Ontario by providing financial assistance to projects – big and small, rural and urban – that stimulate growth, job creation and develop a skilled workforce.
Since June 2018, the NOHFC has invested more than $176 million in 1,224 projects in Northern Ontario. This has leveraged more than $650 million in investment and created or retained 3,559 jobs.
The Ontario government is getting more people back to work and more recreational activities open by moving forward with a regional approach to Stage 2 of reopening the province. For a full list of spaces and services allowed to open in regions entering Stage 2, please visit Ontario.ca/reopen.

People encouraged to enjoy the outdoors responsibly during COVID-19

June 10, 2020  2:00 P.M.

Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks


TORONTO — As part of the Ontario government's Stage 2 reopening plan, more facilities and services will be available at provincial parks in certain regions beginning on June 12, 2020. Gradually over the next several weeks, Ontario Parks will start opening campgrounds, providing more washrooms and drinking water, along with roofed accommodations, park store and rental operations, visitor centres, and sports fields. It's important to check what facilities and services are available before visiting a provincial park. 
""Due to the tremendous progress we have made to contain the spread of COVID-19, more services and activities will soon be available at our provincial parks,"" said Jeff Yurek, Minister of the Environment, Conservation and Parks. ""While this is encouraging, it is not business as usual. I encourage everyone to be responsible and continue to follow public health advice, including physical distancing, when enjoying our outdoor amenities.""  The following is a list of recreational activities and facilities that will be opening soon at provincial parks in regions entering Stage 2:   On June 12, beaches at Ontario Parks will begin opening to the public as maintenance and water testing are completed.  On June 15, campers enrolled in this year's Ontario Parks' Seasonal Campsite Program will now have access to their campsites at the majority of participating provincial parks. Those who were preselected in 2019 for the program will be contacted by Ontario Parks directly regarding the status of their reservation. Beginning the week of June 22, all other campgrounds in regions entering Stage 2 will gradually open at provincial parks, along with washrooms, water taps and trailer sanitation stations.  Roofed accommodations (e.g., yurts, cabins and lodges, where available), park store and rental operations, visitor centers, and sports fields will be phased in over the next several weeks.     Facilities such as showers, laundry, group camping, picnic shelter rentals and swimming pools will remain closed for the rest of the 2020 season.   Visitors should check OntarioParks.com to see what facilities and services are available before visiting a provincial park.  To help protect visitors and staff, Ontario Parks will be implementing measures to address overcrowding and promote physical distancing in park spaces and buildings during busy visitation times, by limiting occupancy for day-use and camping in select provincial parks. This may include limiting the number of daily vehicle permits sold or the number of campsites available for reservations.    Ministry officers will be present in provincial parks to provide information, assist with emergencies and enforce provincial park rules and regulations. Additionally, these areas may be patrolled by local police or other enforcement agencies. 

Quick Facts

Any reservations for campgrounds (and select backcountry campsites that currently remain closed) up to and into the week of June 22 will be automatically cancelled and you will receive a full refund with no penalty.
To ensure the safety of visitors and staff, Ontario Parks will continue to be guided by public health advice and will continually assess and adjust operational and safety protocols as required.
Ontario Parks manages 340 provincial parks and 295 conservation reserves, covering over nine million hectares of land in the province. 
Ontario Parks operates almost 19,000 campground campsites throughout the province.

Phased Approach Prioritizes the Health and Safety of Students and Staff

June 10, 2020  1:30 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government has developed a plan for the gradual and safe resumption of in-person instruction at postsecondary institutions across the province for the summer term. The plan was developed in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health.
Starting in July 2020, limited in-person education and training may restart for students who were not able to graduate due to COVID-19 closures. This first phase will allow institutions to reopen to provide in-person instruction to students in essential, frontline, and high labour market demand areas, such as nursing, personal support workers, engineering, and other critical professions. Thousands of students across the province could benefit from this summer's reopening. In September, all students will have the opportunity to attend postsecondary education through virtual learning, in-class instruction, or hybrid formats. ""Whether it's donating PPE, researching a vaccine or treatment, or helping with contact tracing, our students, researchers and postsecondary community in Ontario have stepped up in a big way to support our frontline health care workers in response to COVID-19,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""Now, we have to have their backs and make sure our students can keep learning, in class or virtually, and become the next generation of frontline heroes, innovators and community builders."" The limited summer reopening will help individual institutions prepare for the fall term by ensuring proper health and safety protocols are in place. The province is developing a framework to be released to the sector in the coming days, which will provide guidance on the summer reopening and on health and safety measures. Publicly assisted colleges and universities, Indigenous Institutes, private career colleges and other postsecondary education institutions may participate in this voluntary reopening. Institutions that choose to participate will be responsible for establishing their own plans for this limited reopening in accordance with public health advice and any ministry guidance. ""It's critical that we allow students to complete their studies and graduate so they can join the workforce in high-demand, frontline roles and help put the province back on the path to prosperity,"" said Ross Romano, Minister of Colleges and Universities. ""I will continue to collaborate with the postsecondary sector to determine how best to move forward on reopening our campuses in the fall and beyond in a way that is responsible and safe for our students and staff."" In order to maintain Ontario's position as a global leader in higher education and research, the government will also begin working on a digital and academic modernization framework this summer. Through this exercise, it will look at unlocking the potential of virtual learning, adapting postsecondary education and training to meet the needs of a rapidly changing job market and economy, increasing the accountability of postsecondary education, developing the necessary physical and digital infrastructure, and fully realizing the value of research, innovation, and intellectual property licensing in the domestic and global marketplace.

Quick Facts

In 2018-19, more than 800,000 students enrolled in Ontario’s colleges, universities, Indigenous Institutes and private career colleges located in every region of the province.

Led by the work of the Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee, and in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health and health experts, the government is planning a measured and phased approach outlined in A Framework for Reopening our Province.

Office of the Premier


Priority in-person limited summer reopening Working together with postsecondary education partners and on the advice of the Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health, Ontario is beginning the gradual and safe return to campuses starting with priority in-person education this summer.
The limited reopening, scheduled to begin in July 2020 will focus on allowing students in areas of high labour market demand to graduate through completion of lab or practicum course components that required on-campus or in-person attendance at their postsecondary institution.  Examples of high labour market demand areas include welding, nursing, personal support worker, engineering and trucking. This priority summer session will be limited in scale with strict limits on the number of students per campus. It is estimated more than 6,000 college students and 2,000 university students would be eligible to participate in this priority academic session. Led by the Chief Medical Officer of Health and the work of the Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee, the government is planning a measured and phased approach to reopening the economy as outlined in A Framework for Reopening our Province. Ontario will closely monitor the limited summer session working on the advice of public health authorities and postsecondary partners to guide the development of the next stage of reopening in the fall and beyond. Consultations on the future of postsecondary education Ontario Since the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, the government has been in close communication with postsecondary education sector partners through a series of consultations and weekly dialogue. This feedback has helped inform the proposed plan for reopening and recovery. The government will continue to consult on a modernization framework to help support local communities, that will address current gaps in the sector and cultivate a higher education system that is more responsive to student and labour market needs. Virtual learning The COVID-19 outbreak has accelerated the need for Ontario's postsecondary education sector to accommodate students and develop innovative ways of teaching and learning. A virtual learning strategy will provide a framework for more responsive and adaptive learning to ensure the postsecondary education sector is positioned to weather future disruptions, to address the challenges exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Micro-credentials The postsecondary education landscape includes short-term training provided for in-demand skills, known as micro-credentials. A greater focus on micro-credentials will allow increased flexibility and responsiveness to student and employer needs. Micro-credentials will allow Ontarians to upgrade their employment-related skills quickly and efficiently and remain competitive in the workforce, while at the same time accommodate the demands of work and family. Intellectual property and commercialization strategy Research and commercialization across all sectors is more important than ever as a driver of economic recovery post-COVID-19 and beyond. The postsecondary education, research and innovation sectors will take a leading role in Ontario's economic recovery and future prosperity. The road ahead As the province continues to address the immediate needs of the sector, the government will work closely with Ontario's institutions to maintain Ontario's position as a global leader in higher education and ensure students continue to receive the education and training they need for rewarding careers.

TORONTO - The Ontario government is bringing a delegation of 35 companies to the first-ever, fully digital Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) international conference, BIO Digital, where Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade will highlight the top reasons investors in the life sciences should choose Ontario.
Minister Fedeli, joined by Nina Tangri, Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister, will lead the province's delegation and promote Ontario as the premier destination for investment and trade in life sciences to a global audience. ""This delegation of 35 companies is our largest to BIO to-date, which speaks volumes to what an incredible opportunity this is for Ontario to showcase our thriving life sciences sector,"" said Minister Fedeli. ""More than ever, creative thinking in the life sciences sector will help us address the economic challenges we are facing today, and help lead to greater economic growth and prosperity in the future."" Ontario's life sciences sector is the largest in Canada, with about 1,900 firms including Sanofi, Roche, Apotex, BlueRock Therapeutics, Johnson & Johnson, and GSK.  It provides 66,000 high-value jobs in the province, with a yearly payroll of about $5 billion. In 2018, Ontario's life sciences sector exported about $9.7 billion in goods, including essential vaccines, critical medicines and medical devices.  Ontario's life sciences and digital strengths are converging, resulting in leading edge technology and services, such as Cyclica's proprietary AI-augmented drug discovery platform, currently being applied to identify compounds for infectious diseases, including COVID-19. The conference's digital format presents a unique opportunity for Ontario's 35 participating companies to meet with potential partners, industry leaders and deal makers from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies around the world. Last year, Ontario led a delegation of 14 companies to the conference in Philadelphia.   ""We are proud to promote Ontario's deep talent pool, cutting edge innovation ecosystem, competitive business costs, welcoming immigration system and unparalleled access to global markets,"" said PA Tangri. ""These advantages make our province an ideal partner for trade and investment and a destination for new ideas and technologies.""

Province Reopening Child Care with Strict Protocols to Keep Kids and Staff Safe

June  9, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Today, the Ontario government announced its plan to reopen child care centres across the province to support the next stage of the province's reopening framework. Developed in consultation with Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health and medical leaders at The Hospital for Sick Children, the plan will require child care operators to follow strict health protocols to ensure the safety of child care staff and children.
Details of the plan were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education. ""As we prepare to reopen more businesses and services, it is critical that we ensure supports are in place so people can return to work knowing their children will be cared for in a safe and healthy environment,"" said Premier Ford. ""Our child care plan sets out strict protocols that must be followed to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We have made great progress to contain the virus, but we must be mindful that there is still a public health risk."" As the province continues to implement its Framework for Reopening the Province, child care centres and home care providers across Ontario will be able to reopen with strict safety and operational requirements in place, similar to the safety guidelines required for emergency child care centres. Centres will be required to adopt specific rules, including: Cohorting ― putting children and staff in groups of 10 or less day over day;COVID-19 response plan ― all child care settings will be required to have a plan in place if a child, parent or staff member/provider is exposed to COVID-19;Screening ― all staff and children must be screened prior to entry to the child care setting.  Anyone feeling unwell must stay home;Daily attendance records ― child care settings must keep daily records of all attendees in order to support contact tracing;Cleaning ― child care settings must be thoroughly cleaned before opening and frequently thereafter;No visitors ― only essential visitors are permitted entry into the child care setting;Implementing drop-off and pick-up protocols in a way that facilitates physical distancing.Effectively immediately, staff can re-enter child care facilities and begin preparation for reopening. When these operators have met all the strict and stringent guidelines for reopening, they will be permitted to reopen. ""We know the integral role child care plays in the restart of Ontario's economy, especially when it comes to enabling parents to return to work,"" said Minister Lecce. ""But parents must have confidence in the child care system at this very difficult time. By imposing specific public health requirements, we are signaling our firm commitment to keeping our children, staff, and our families safe."" The Ministry of Education has been working with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development to develop these health and safety protocols. They will enable the safe reopening of child care centres across the province and enhance safety through effective contact tracing. This plan imposes strict requirements on operators, including mandatory training and reporting and support from the local medical officer of health before reopening. ""Having children safely re-engage in learning, play and social activities with other children is of great benefit to their mental, emotional and behavioural development,"" says Dr. Ronald Cohn, President and CEO of The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids). ""Children thrive when they are able to interact with other children. The reopening of child care centres is an important step forward for allowing children to be with their peers and enjoy activities outside of their home environment."" Based on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health and with strict health and safety protocols in place, the government is now enabling summer day camp programs across the province to reopen this summer. Strict health and safety guidelines were developed by the Ministry of Health in partnership with public health, the Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development, and municipalities, and distributed to local public health teams earlier this month. At this time, overnight camps are not permitted to operate in the summer of 2020.

Quick Facts

As the province continues to move forward with its reopening plan, emergency child care will wind down effective June 26, 2020 as all licensed child care centres are permitted to open province-wide. Families served through emergency child care will be supported by service system managers to return to their previous arrangement or finding new space during the transition back to regular childcare.
As child care reopens across the province, if families are not offered access to their previous child care arrangement, operators will continue to be prevented from charging fees for these spaces.
Ontario is also helping parents pay for the extra costs associated with school and child care closures during the COVID-19 outbreak with the Support for Families program, by providing a one-time payment of $200 per child up to 12 years of age, and $250 for those with special needs up to 21 years of age, including children enrolled in private schools.

To date, over 1.5 million families have benefited from the Support for Families program.

The existing child care funding formula will be leveraged to support enhanced cleaning costs and the health and safety requirements set out to support the reopening of child care centres, as well as the continued stabilization of the sector.
As required by legislation, the Ministry will be seeking input from families and the sector on the Child Care and Early Years Act (CCEYA) over the summer, which will inform child care planning for the province.
There are over 5,500 child care centres and 124 licensed home child care agencies across Ontario.

High-tech facility will equip OPP with new tools to better serve and protect communities

June  9, 2020  9:00 A.M.

Ministry of the Solicitor General


LONDON - The Ontario government is opening a new leading edge Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) Communications Centre in London. This new high-tech facility will provide officers and civilian staff with the modern communications technology needed to better serve and protect communities in Ontario.
""Our government recognizes that provincial police officers continually encounter new challenges on the job, whether it's enforcing the law during the COVID-19 outbreak or combatting new online criminal activity,"" said Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General. ""This new facility will help ensure our provincial officers and staff have the state-of-the-art facilities, equipment and technology they need to fight crime and keep people safe."" The new 35,000 square-foot communications centre will house 135 civilian members and officers who handle emergency and non-emergency calls for service. Equipped with advanced technology, the facility will serve an assigned area of more than 170,000 square kilometres and a population that reaches approximately 850,000 people during the summer months. The new centre will also support other OPP jurisdictions as needed and provide the space OPP officers and civilian members need to conduct their work in an improved workplace environment. ""The new Provincial Communications Centre will allow the OPP to enhance their services and ensure frontline officers can meet the demands of modern police operations"" said Laurie Scott, Minister of Infrastructure. ""We are committed to investing in infrastructure that puts people's safety first."" ""The new London Provincial Communications Centre is a critical component of the OPP's delivery of emergency services to our communities and the support we provide to our dedicated officers on the front line and in our speciality units,"" said OPP Commissioner Thomas Carrique. ""This modern facility will provide a workplace that is safe, healthy and properly equipped for the civilian and sworn OPP members who work in this high-stress environment."" ""I am very proud London is now home to this impressive facility,"" said Elgin-Middlesex-London MPP and Minister of the Environment, Conservation and Parks, Jeff Yurek. ""I am especially proud that the building meets the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Silver Standard, which recognizes buildings with reduced environmental impacts. This will be of great benefit to both the community and the environment and reflects our government's commitment to delivering modern, efficient infrastructure across Ontario.""

Quick Facts

The London PCC is one of five OPP PCCs across the province that operate 24/7, answering emergency and non-emergency calls for service. 
The new facility is accessible and designed to meet the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Silver Standard – the standard that recognizes buildings with reduced environmental impacts.
This project has been delivered through Infrastructure Ontario's Design-Bid-Build (DBB) model. The DBB model is used in the delivery of capital projects between $10 million and $100 million and makes use of the standardized CCDC-2 stipulated sum contract.

Government to introduce changes to the Commercial Tenancies Act to protect small businesses

June  8, 2020  2:00 P.M.

Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing


TORONTO — The Ontario government announced today that it intends to take action to protect commercial tenants from being locked out or having their assets seized by their landlords due to the negative impacts of COVID-19. 
The proposed changes to the Commercial Tenancies Act would, if passed, temporarily halt evictions of businesses that are eligible for federal/provincial rent assistance. If passed, the legislation would reverse evictions that occurred on or after June 3, 2020. The government intends to bring this legislation forward as soon as possible. In partnership with the federal government, Ontario is committing $241 million to the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) for small businesses which is providing more than $900 million in support. CECRA for small businesses provides forgivable loans to eligible commercial landlords to help cover 50 per cent of commercial rent for tenants for the months of April, May and June 2020. The tenant will be responsible for covering up to 25 per cent of rent, so that up to 75 per cent of the rent is covered. Tenants and landlords can learn how much they may be eligible for by visiting Ontario.ca/rentassistance. ""We need everyone working together to overcome COVID-19,"" said Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. ""Commercial tenants who can pay their rent, must do so. Landlords should work with their tenants to come to an agreement and use this joint program. Ontario's small businesses are the backbone of our economy and we need them to flourish."" If passed, the proposed legislation would make it illegal to evict a commercial tenant until August 31, 2020.   ""Working with the federal government, we are providing more than $900 million in relief to tenants and landlords,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. ""We've been clear we would support small businesses and today's action does just that."" ""Ensuring the immediate future of our small businesses is critical to helping our economy recover and rebound,"" said Prabmeet Sarkaria, Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction. ""A moratorium on commercial evictions will bring stability to our small businesses and the employees and families they support. Their success is Ontario's success.""

""Entering Stage 2 means parts of the province will see more people back on the job and an opportunity to get back together with friends and family. Although this is extremely encouraging, I urge everyone to exercise caution and continue to follow public health advice as we are not out of the woods yet.""

""The people and employers of Ontario have demonstrated responsible behaviour throughout the global pandemic. I'm confident that will continue in Stage 2 and beyond. Our collective health and the economic recovery of the province depend on it."" At the beginning of each week, the government will provide an update on the ongoing assessment of these regions, and whether they are ready to move into Stage 2 at the end of the week. Everyone, regardless of where they live in the province, must continue to follow public health advice, including to practise physical distancing, wear a face covering if physical distancing is a challenge, wash hands frequently and thoroughly, and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.

""As a result of efforts of all Ontarians to stop the spread of COVID-19, many regions have met the criteria to move into the next stage of our reopening plan, including a decrease in new daily cases and sufficient hospital capacity in the event of any spikes in cases or outbreaks,"" said Minister Elliott. ""Our regional approach recognizes that different regions in the province are experiencing COVID-19 differently and can safely and gradually ease restrictions and reopen local businesses. We will continue to monitor any shifts in the spread and take decisive action to contain any outbreaks.""

""That includes safety guidelines, posters and tip sheets to promote safe workplaces and help stop the spread of COVID-19. I strongly advise everyone to visit Ontario.ca/COVIDsafety to read, download, print and post them, for your sake and the sake of those around you.""

Minister Calls for Immediate Action to Confront Racism 

June  8, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Ministry of Education


TORONTO — Today, Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education, issued the following statement regarding Ms. Arleen Huggins' investigation report on the Peel District School Board (PDSB): 
""We are determined to confront all forms of racism, discrimination, and hate, against all minority communities in our province.  For too long, too many kids have been left behind due to systemic frameworks that perpetuate racism. This is unacceptable and must change.  That is why in November of 2019, I swiftly ordered an investigation into the PDSB, following serious allegations of racism. To ensure compliance with my direction, on April 27, I appointed Arleen Huggins - a lawyer and human rights advocate - to investigate the PDSB's capacity to comply with my directions. I have now received Ms. Huggins' report and would like to thank her for her effective and principled work. Her report reveals the need for real change within this board and provides a necessary component to ensuring these issues are addressed immediately and effectively. Most troubling, her report finds that certain directions have not been complied with, and moreover, that the PDSB lacks the capacity to provide good governance in the interests of all students of the board and to effectively carry out its responsibilities to oversee and ensure proper compliance with my directions. As outlined in the Education Act, I am required to provide a final opportunity for compliance from the Board. My expectation is clear: the Board must change, or I will take further action. We cannot and will not sit idle, while families and students continue to feel isolated, victimized, and targeted. It is clear that we must continue our work to confront racism - specifically anti-Black racism - within our schools across the province. Our Government will continue to drive change, demand improvement, and stand-up for students who face hate and racism.""

Quick Facts

On November 27, 2019, the Minister of Education directed an expedited review of the PDSB to address serious concerns about anti-Black racism and systemic inequities, leadership and governance dysfunction; and unfair human resources practices within the board. 
The Review Team conducted an extensive consultation between December 2019 and February 2020 which included interviews, community and student consultation sessions, and written submissions.  
Based on the Reviewers' Report and Recommendations, the Minister issued 27 binding Directions to the PDSB on March 13, 2020.
On April 27, 2020 the Minister of Education appointed Arleen Huggins to conduct an investigation of the PDSB to examine the Board's compliance with the Minister's binding Directions issued on March 13, 2020. 
Ms. Huggins submitted her report to the Minister on May 18, 2020. 
Under the Education Act the Minister may give directions to the PDSB to address any evidence of non-compliance or potential non-compliance disclosed in the Investigator’s report.
On June 8, 2020, the Minister provided a direction to the PDSB in response to the Investigator’s report. The Board is required to demonstrate to the Minister’s satisfaction that the members of the Board can sustainably work together, and with the senior management team, to provide good governance in the interests of all students of the PDSB. This direction requires that the Board provide the Minister with a with a plan to address the key findings in Ms. Huggins’ report. This direction must be met by June 22, 2020.

Ontario Extends Emergency Orders to Support Its Reopening Efforts
Province Extends the Suspension of Limitation Periods and Time Periods for Legal Proceedings until September

June  6, 2020  7:00 A.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government, after consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health, has extended all emergency orders currently in force under s.7.0.2 (4) of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act until June 19, 2020. Extending these emergency orders will give employers of frontline care providers the necessary flexibility to respond to COVID-19 and protect vulnerable people and the public as the province gradually and safely reopens.
Current emergency orders that have been extended include those that enable frontline care providers to redeploy staff where they are needed most, allow public health units to redeploy or hire staff to support case management and contact tracing, and prohibits long-term care and retirement home employees from working at more than one home or for another health service provider. ""It is critical that we keep these emergency orders in place so we can continue to reopen the province gradually and safely,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""We are not out of the woods yet, and this deadly virus still poses a serious risk. We encourage businesses to begin preparing to reopen, so when the time comes, they will be able to protect employees, consumers and the general public."" Additionally, due to COVID-19's unprecedented impact on the justice system, the province is extending the suspension of limitation periods and time periods in proceedings until September 11, 2020 under s.7.1 of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act. This will ensure people will not experience legal consequences if the original time requirements of their case are not met while this order is in effect. The province is working closely with the courts to ensure operations can resume as soon as it is safely possible. Anyone who suspects they may have COVID-19, or may have been exposed to the virus, is encouraged to visit an assessment centre to be tested. To help stop the spread, people should practise physical distancing by staying at least two metres apart from anyone outside their immediate household, wash hands thoroughly and frequently, and, if physical distancing is a challenge, wear a face covering. The following emergency orders under s.7.0.2 (4) of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act have been extended until June 19, 2020: Closure of EstablishmentsProhibiting Organized Public Events, Certain GatheringsWork Deployment Measures for Health Care WorkersDrinking Water Systems and Sewage WorksElectronic ServiceWork Deployment Measures in Long-Term Care HomesClosure of Places of Non-Essential BusinessesTraffic ManagementStreamlining Requirements for Long-Term Care HomesProhibition on Certain Persons Charging Unconscionable Prices for Necessary Goods Closure of Outdoor Recreational AmenitiesEnforcement of OrdersWork Deployment Measures for Boards of HealthWork Deployment Measures in Retirement HomesAccess to COVID-19 Status Information by Specified PersonsService Agencies Providing Services and Supports to Adults with Developmental DisabilitiesPickup and Delivery of CannabisSignatures in Wills and Powers of AttorneyUse of Force and Firearms in Policing ServicesChild Care FeesAgreements Between Health Service Providers and Retirement HomesTemporary Health or Residential FacilitiesWork Deployment Measures for Service Agencies Providing Violence Against Women Residential Services and Crisis Line ServicesLimiting Work to a Single Long-Term Care HomeWork Deployment Measures for District Social Services Administration BoardsDeployment of Employees of Service Provider OrganizationsWork Deployment Measures for MunicipalitiesLimiting Work to a Single Retirement HomeWork Deployment Measures for Mental Health and Addictions AgenciesCongregate Care SettingsAccess to Personal Health Information by Means of the Electronic Health RecordCertain Persons Enabled to Issue Medical Certificates of DeathHospital Credentialing ProcessesEducation SectorManagement of Long-term Care Homes in OutbreakManagement of Retirement Homes in an OutbreakSpecial Rules re: Temporary Pandemic PayElectricity Price for RPP Consumers"

New Council to Advise Government on Challenges Facing Youth, Especially during COVID-19

June  4, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Today, the Ontario government announced the Premier's Council on Equality of Opportunity, a new advisory group that will provide advice on how young people can overcome social and economic barriers and achieve success. The council will also advise government on long-term actions that can be taken to support youth during the COVID-19 outbreak.
Details were provided by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services, and Jamil Jivani, Ontario's Advocate for Community Opportunities. ""At a time when the world is facing some of its most difficult challenges, we have to do everything we can to help our next generation of leaders overcome the social and economic barriers before them,"" said Premier Ford. ""Our young people are the future of this province and I truly believe this council will be a strong advocate that will set them down the path to even greater success."" The council will have up to 20 members, including a chair and a vice-chair. Membership will be intergenerational and cross-sector, and will include youth between the ages of 18 to 29 and adults with expertise from community organizations, not-for-profit businesses, education, and government services. The council will focus on the challenges facing young people today, such as completing an education, skills training, and employment. As an immediate priority, the council will identify strategies to support vulnerable and marginalized youth to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak. Jamil Jivani, Ontario's Advocate for Community Opportunities, will serve as chair of the council for the first year. He will work to engage directly with young people and communities across the province to identify strategies to remove barriers for youth at risk to help ensure they are not left behind. ""For decades, youth from disadvantaged communities have faced barriers to succeeding in our economy. COVID-19 has made these issues worse. As the first chair of the Premier's Council on Equality of Opportunity, I will work with a diverse group of leaders to help the government give young workers, especially disadvantaged youth, a fair chance to succeed in Ontario's workforce,"" said Jamil Jivani. The Ontario government is further supporting Black communities to address the disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 by allocating $1.5 million in funding to organizations that support Black families and youth. This funding will be used to provide urgent COVID-19 supports and address the immediate needs of children, youth and families. ""The Premier's Council on Equality of Opportunity will allow our government to hear directly from those who have faced economic challenges in our province,"" said Minister Smith. ""The council's knowledge, combined with the insight gained from engaging with communities and youth across Ontario, will help our government as we work to remove the key barriers that prevent young people from achieving their economic goals."" Those interested in joining the council are invited to apply to the Public Appointments Secretariat by Thursday, June 18, 2020. Eligible candidates should have expertise in areas such as community service, business, education, and government services such as youth justice and child welfare.

Ministry of Long-Term Care


TORONTO — The Ministry of Long-Term Care is appointing William Osler Health System as interim manager at Woodbridge Vista Care Community long-term care home in Vaughan, Ontario.
Despite receiving hospital support, Woodbridge Vista Care Community has been unable to contain the spread of COVID-19. These steps will enable a rigorous management structure to help contain the spread of the disease and assist in returning their home to normal operations. ""During these unprecedented times, it's important to use every tool available to keep Ontarians safe,"" said Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""I am pleased to see the dedicated staff at William Osler Health System and Woodbridge Vista Care Community working together to contain COVID-19 and keep residents and staff safe."" The Ministry of Long-Term Care will continue to make decisions on which long-term care homes may require additional management support on a case-by-case basis. The province is working with its health partners in addressing challenges in the long-term care sector by involving hospitals in deploying Infection Prevention and Control teams to homes, continued staff and resident testing, addressing personal protective equipment supply issues, and redeploying hospital staff to help with critical staffing shortages in long-term care homes.

Quick Facts

The government recently announced the launch of an independent, non-partisan commission into Ontario's long-term care system beginning in July 2020. Details of the commission are now being finalized, including the terms of reference, membership, leadership of the commission and reporting timelines.
Testing of long-term care residents and staff for COVID-19 has been completed with additional rounds of testing underway.

Ministry of Indigenous Affairs


TORONTO — Greg Rickford, Minister of Indigenous Affairs, and Jill Dunlop, Associate Minister of Children and Women's Issues, issued the following statement on this important date:
""As we mark the one-year anniversary of the Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, Ontario continues to address the root causes of violence against First Nation, Métis, and Inuit women, girls, and LGBTQ2S people. To help with Ontario's response to the Final Report, our government established an Indigenous Women's Advisory Council. Its members will provide much-needed advice to address human trafficking as well as child, youth and family well-being for Indigenous people. In partnership with the Ontario Native Women's Association, Ontario also held engagement sessions on the National Inquiry's Calls for Justice with Indigenous communities, organizations, leaders, and experts in violence prevention. This will ensure our approach is informed by a wide variety of Indigenous voices. As part of our government's overall response to the report's Calls for Justice, in March we launched a new, comprehensive strategy to combat the problem of human trafficking. Indigenous-specific initiatives are integrated throughout the strategy to help protect vulnerable women, children and youth and address the needs of First Nations, Métis and Inuit communities, organizations, and frontline workers. We know the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of violence for some Indigenous women and children and made access to support more challenging. That's why our government is investing $10 million in emergency funding to support organizations delivering social services to vulnerable First Nations individuals and families. Further funding to support victims of gender-based violence and human trafficking during the pandemic will ensure a range of critical supports remain available to those who need them most. The National Inquiry and its final report have brought the issues of violence against First Nation, Métis, and Inuit women, girls, and LGBTQ2S people to the forefront, and together we must continue the momentum for change. Our government will continue to respond to the report's Calls for Justice by working in partnership with Indigenous leaders, justice partners, community groups, service providers and others to enhance violence prevention and access to services. By working together, we can support Indigenous women and girls' empowerment and help secure a future free from violence.""

Ontario Improving Broadband and Cell Service for Rural Communities 
Connecting Residents and Businesses to the 21st Century Digital Economy Essential for Recovery after COVID-19

June  3, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO ― As Ontario safely and gradually begins to reopen, the provincial government is investing $150 million in reliable broadband and cellular service. This funding will help create even more economic and educational opportunities in rural, remote and underserved areas of the province. This is part of the province's $315 million initiative called Up to Speed: Ontario's Broadband and Cellular Action Plan.
Today's announcement was made by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, Laurie Scott, Minister of Infrastructure, and Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education. ""As we carefully restart the economic engine of Canada, every region and every community will play a role in bringing jobs and prosperity back to our province,"" said Premier Ford. ""By investing in reliable broadband and cellular service, we are helping to create greater opportunity for our families, farmers and small business owners in rural and remote areas of this great province."" The new Improving Connectivity in Ontario, or ICON, program, when leveraged, has the potential to result in an investment of up to $500 million in total partner funding to improve connectivity in underserved and unserved areas. Applicants, including telecom companies, municipal governments, First Nation communities, and non-profits, will be invited to submit innovative proposals and lend their investment, expertise and experience to improve connectivity in communities across Ontario. The province will fund a portion of each approved project. ""By doing their part and staying home to help stop the spread of COVID-19, the people of Ontario have demonstrated the need to be connected to learn, work, and run their businesses,"" said Minister Scott. ""It appears that functioning remotely will continue to be a regular way of life for many in this new environment, and fast reliable Internet will be critical. The ICON program is an important step towards bridging the digital divide in Ontario."" Access to broadband is a core component of the province's Learn at Home plan. Reliable Internet, particularly in rural and regional areas, is essential to supporting students' success in school. The provincial government recently called on the federal government to take immediate action to improve Internet connectivity for Ontario students. As many as 12 per cent of households in Ontario ― mostly in rural, remote or Northern areas ― are underserved or unserved, according to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. ""Access to high-speed Internet is foundational to our young people's success in learning, working, and innovating, today and into the future,"" said Minister Lecce. ""Our government is taking action by connecting all schools to broadband, starting with high schools this September 2020 and elementary schools by September 2021. It is also why we are calling on the federal government to step up their investment to connect the next generation of thinkers and workers to the modern and digital economy."" The ICON program is one of several important initiatives underway to expand access to mobile broadband and high-speed Internet services. Over the past several months, Ontario has partnered with the Eastern Ontario Regional Network (EORN) to leverage $213 million to improve access in Eastern Ontario. As part of a $190 million project to bring high-speed Internet to thousands of homes and businesses throughout Southwestern Ontario, the Southwestern Integrated Fibre Technology (SWIFT) has awarded contracts in Lambton, Wellington and Norfolk counties. Ontario has also invested in initiatives to improve connectivity in Northern Ontario, such as a project that will connect five remote Matawa-member First Nation communities, and investments in broadband projects through the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation and the Next Generation Network Program.

Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs


TORONTO - The Ontario government is celebrating local agri-food heroes who have stepped up to ensure the province's food supply chain remains strong during the COVID-19 outbreak. Individuals, businesses and organizations are highlighted in 2020 Local Food Report: Ontario Spirit - A Celebration of Local Food Collaboration.
""Ontario's agri-food supply chain is one of the strongest in the world and COVID-19 has just reinforced that fact,"" said Ernie Hardeman, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. ""The commitment shown by our farmers, food processors, grocery store workers, truck drivers, restaurateurs, and everyone across the agri-food sector during the COVID-19 outbreak is inspiring."" The 2020 Local Food Report demonstrates the importance of local food for Ontario consumers and communities, while recognizing farmers and those who keep food on our plates. Highlights include:  Breweries and distilleries adapting their production facilities so they can produce hand sanitizer to help address the supply shortage;Organizations promoting local food literacy through online resources, virtual experiences and recipes that focus on locally-sourced ingredients;Food banks, industry partners and local communities working together to create and distribute emergency food boxes to those in need;Local public health units and agencies, along with industry and community food organizations, collaborating to offer weekly meal packages to families in place of school food programs that aren't currently operating. ""Over the last two months, we have heard stories of hard-working and dedicated people that have adapted to these challenging times and gone above and beyond to ensure access to local Ontario food, and we are pleased to have an opportunity to celebrate them,"" said Hardeman. Ontario is home to nearly 49,600 farms and 4,400 food processing facilities that contribute over $47 billion to the provincial GDP, making the agri-food sector a key economic driver of Ontario's economy. Now more than ever, buying and supporting local food creates jobs and economic growth in communities across the province.

Ontario Extends Declaration of Emergency until June 30
Extension Key to Protecting Ontarians as Province Safely Reopens 

June  2, 2020  8:15 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO ― In consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health, Ontario is extending the provincial Declaration of Emergency to June 30. The decision supports the government's efforts to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak and protect the health and safety of Ontarians as the province reopens in a measured and responsible way. The extension, under s.7.0.7 of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, was approved by the Ontario legislature earlier today.
""Extending the provincial Declaration of Emergency will allow us to safely and gradually reopen the province, while we continue to use every resource at our disposal to battle this deadly virus,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""We are not out of the woods yet, so it is critical that we exercise caution to keep everyone safe, including protecting our most vulnerable citizens in long-term care homes, retirement homes and group homes."" As Ontario charts a path to recovery, the Declaration will support the continued enforcement of emergency orders that give hospitals and long-term care homes the necessary flexibility to respond to COVID-19 and protect vulnerable populations and the public as the province reopens. Current emergency orders include allowing frontline care providers to redeploy staff where they are needed most, enabling public health units to redeploy or hire staff to support case management and contact tracing, limiting long-term care and retirement home staff to working at one home, and preventing unfair pricing of necessary goods. The Declaration of Emergency may be further extended with the approval of the legislature, as set out in the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act. A full list of emergency orders can be found on the e-Laws website under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act and at Ontario.ca/alert.

Ontario Helps Manufacturers Ramp Up Production of Personal Protective Equipment
Initiatives Will Benefit Frontline Workers during COVID-19

June  2, 2020  2:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO ― The Ontario government continues investing in local manufacturers in order to keep frontline workers and communities safe during the COVID-19 outbreak. More innovative businesses are receiving financial support today through the Ontario Together Fund to re-tool their processes and increase their capacity to make personal protective equipment (PPE).
Today's update was provided by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""Our entrepreneurs, businesses and workers are stepping up and unleashing the full strength of Ontario's manufacturing might ― sometimes doubling or tripling their output and working modern-day miracles in the fight against COVID-19,"" said Premier Ford. ""Our government is proud to partner with our champions in the business community to establish 'made-in-Ontario' as the gold-standard for medical supplies and equipment here in Canada and around the world."" The three new companies receiving support are: Southmedic — Southmedic is a Barrie, Ontario based medical device manufacturer that distributes to more than 60 countries around the world. The province is providing $1.8 million to help the company reengineer and retool its current production, and purchase new moulding equipment. With this new equipment, the company will double its output of oxygen masks, triple its output of ETCO2 masks, which are specialty masks used to monitor breathing prior to ventilator use, and quadruple its output of eye and face shields to help meet the province's need for PPE. The funding will also allow the company to reorganize its production facility to allow for physical distancing. Sterling Industries — Sterling Industries is a Concord, Ontario based contract manufacturer and assembler of medical devices and sub-components. The province is providing $1,023,325, which will allow the company to increase its output of face shields from 200,000 per week to more than a million per week. This increased capacity will help Sterling Industries deliver 10 million face shields to Ontario Health more quickly. SRB Technologies — SRB Technologies is a Pembroke, Ontario based producer of self-powered emergency lighting and self-powered exit signs. The province is providing $59,889 to help the company convert a portion of its production from emergency lighting solutions for the nuclear, aerospace, construction and defence sectors to manufacturing medical-grade face shields, which will be supplied to regional hospitals and long-term care facilities. ""Ever since the COVID-19 outbreak began, Ontario businesses have shown incredible collaboration, resilience and determination to tackle this crisis,"" said Minister Fedeli. ""Many of our innovators have stepped up to help produce much needed medical supplies. Now that we're in the first stage of restarting our economy, I encourage all businesses to keep innovating and review our provincial safety guidelines in order to protect their employees in this new environment."" On April 1, 2020, the government launched the $50 million Ontario Together Fund to support the development of proposals submitted by businesses and individuals through the Ontario Together web portal and help businesses retool their operations. All submissions received through the portal are being reviewed and prioritized to focus on solutions that can respond to where the need is greatest and what can be implemented quickly. In March, the government launched the Ontario Together web portal, appealing to Ontario's manufacturers, entrepreneurs and innovators to provide essential supplies and equipment to support frontline workers in their fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

New Management Appointed at Kitchener Long-Term Care Home 
Temporary measures required to help contain COVID-19 outbreak

June  2, 2020 12:15 P.M.

Ministry of Long-Term Care


TORONTO —The Ministry of Long-Term Care has issued a Mandatory Management Order appointing St. Mary's General Hospital, a member of St. Joseph's Health System, in Kitchener to temporarily manage Forest Heights long-term care home for 90 days. The order may be extended beyond the 90 days, if necessary.
Despite receiving hospital support for weeks, Forest Heights has been unable to contain the spread of COVID-19. By taking these steps, the Ministry of Long-Term Care is putting in place a rigorous management structure to help contain the spread of the disease and assist in returning the home to normal operations. ""The safety and well-being of residents and staff in long-term care have always been and will continue to be our number one priority,"" said Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""I am confident that the talented staff at St. Mary's General Hospital and Forest Heights will work together to contain COVID-19 and stabilize the home."" The Ministry of Long-Term Care will continue to make decisions on which long-term care homes may require additional management support on a case-by-case basis. The province is working with its health partners in addressing challenges in the long-term care sector by deploying hospital Infection Prevention and Control teams to homes, testing all staff and residents, providing personal protective equipment, and redeploying hospital staff to help support frontline workers in long-term care homes.

Quick Facts

An emergency order was issued on May 12, 2020 allowing the Ministry of Long-Term Care to appoint alternative management to temporarily manage a long-term care home where at least one resident or staff member has tested positive for COVID-19. A mandatory management order helps to address the outbreak and effectively protects vulnerable Ontarians from COVID-19.
The government recently announced the launch of an independent, non-partisan commission into Ontario's long-term care system beginning in July 2020. Details of the commission are now being finalized, including the terms of reference, membership, leadership of the commission and reporting timelines.
Testing of long-term care residents and staff for COVID-19 has been completed with additional rounds of testing currently underway.

Ontario Moves Forward with Signature Subway Project
Ontario Line will help reduce congestion, drive economic growth and job creation

June  2, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Ministry of Transportation


TORONTO - Today, Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation, and Kinga Surma, Associate Minister of Transportation (GTA), announced the Ontario government is moving forward with the next step in building the Ontario Line, the signature project in the largest subway expansion in the province's history. The government is issuing the first two public-private partnership (P3) Requests for Qualifications (RFQs) to identify and qualify those who will design, build and maintain the subway line. The Ontario Line is being built under three separate P3 contracts.
""Under the leadership of Premier Ford, our government is taking historic steps to expand subway service and reduce traffic congestion across the GTA,"" said Minister Mulroney. ""By issuing these first RFQs we are one step closer to realizing our transit vision and helping to generate economic activity and create tens of thousands of jobs as the province recovers from COVID-19."" The 15.5 kilometre Ontario Line will extend from Exhibition/Ontario Place to the Ontario Science Centre. Current plans include 15 potential stations, including 17 new multi-modal connections to GO Transit, existing TTC subway stations and streetcar lines, and the Eglinton Crosstown Light Rail Transit line. These first two RFQs being issued will include rolling stock systems, an operations and maintenance contract for the entire line and a design-build-finance contract for the southern portion of the Ontario Line. The RFQ for the northern civil package will be released once the successful proponent for the southern civil package is identified. ""Investments in infrastructure projects, like the Ontario Line, will be essential for getting people back to work and improving the quality of life for people throughout the GTA,"" said Kinga Surma, Associate Minister of Transportation (GTA). ""To build projects of this magnitude, however, we need everyone at the table. We are calling on the federal government to commit to paying their fair share, at least 40 per cent of the four nationally-significant subway projects."" Companies interested in bidding on these contracts must register with www.merx.com to download the respective RFQs. Infrastructure Ontario and Metrolinx will evaluate RFQ submissions and shortlist teams to be invited to respond to a Request for Proposals in fall 2020. ""The Ontario Line is one of the most significant transit infrastructure projects for Ontario in a generation,"" said Laurie Scott, Minister of Infrastructure. ""Moving forward with these procurement contracts signals the government remains committed to building much needed transit infrastructure to reduce congestion and contribute to the economic recovery and renewal of our province."" In April 2019, the province announced its historic new transportation vision, with a preliminary estimated cost of $28.5 billion. This includes four priority transit projects: the all-new Ontario Line; a three-stop Scarborough Subway Extension; the Yonge North Subway Extension; and the Eglinton Crosstown West Extension.

Quick Facts

In addition to the three P3 contracts, some segments of the Ontario Line, where the alignment joins GO Transit rail corridors, will be procured separately. Work on these sections is expected to start before construction commences on the three major work packages.
The TTC will be responsible for day to day operations, including in respect of labour relations. Maintenance that the project company could be responsible for includes re-establishing Ontario Line operations, restoring power, coordinating with utility companies or others depending on the source of failure to restore operations.
On February 18, Minister Mulroney introduced the Building Transit Faster Act, which, if passed, would provide the province with the tools to expedite the planning, design and construction process of the four priority transit projects.

New Indigenous Women’s Advisory Council to Include Leaders and Experts in Violence Prevention

June  1, 2020  2:30 P.M.

Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services


Toronto, ON — The Ontario government is establishing a new Indigenous Women’s Advisory Council that will provide culturally-relevant advice on violence prevention. The Council will help confront and eliminate the root causes of violence so that Indigenous women and girls today, and for generations to come, will be able to live their lives feeling safe and secure. Today’s announcement is being made on the first day of National Indigenous History Month in Canada.
The Council will be co-chaired by Jill Dunlop, Associate Minister of Children and Women’s Issues, and a future member of the Council. It will focus on serious issues like human trafficking, child, youth and family healing and well-being, and Ontario’s response to the Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. “The high rate of violence against Indigenous women and girls is unacceptable and must be addressed as quickly as possible,” said Jill Dunlop, Associate Minister of Children and Women’s Issues, “Indigenous women deserve to feel safe and secure. By establishing this Council, we can actively work in partnership with Indigenous leaders and community partners to deal with violence in a culturally-relevant way.” Ontario will benefit from the expertise of approximately 11 First Nations, Métis, Inuit and LGBTQ2S leaders and experts in violence prevention who will make up the Council, which will meet twice annually. An Elder/Traditional Knowledge Keeper will also be invited to guide and support the Council. “I’m proud that today, on the first day of National Indigenous History Month, our province is taking important steps to address the systemic causes that put Indigenous women and girls at a disproportionate risk of violence,” said Greg Rickford, Minister of Indigenous Affairs, “Indigenous women, communities and organizations have been working tirelessly to address these issues, and the knowledge and expertise of the Council will be instrumental in ensuring our province’s continued response is effective and collaborative.” Currently, there is no dedicated provincial forum for Indigenous women and LGBTQ2S leaders and experts to engage on violence prevention issues. The Council will be key to ensuring Indigenous women’s voices guide Ontario’s priorities on a range of critical issues.

Quick Facts

Indigenous women in Canada between the ages of 15-24 are over three times more likely to experience violence than non-Indigenous women.
Indigenous women in Canada are two-and-a-half times more likely to experience spousal violence.

New Initiatives Help Keep Rates Stable and Affordable, while Offering Greater Choice

June  1, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government announced that it will continue to support provincial electricity consumers by providing stability and greater customer choice, while helping those struggling to pay their energy bills as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.
Details of the new programs were provided by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines, and Bill Walker, Associate Minister of Energy. Initiatives include: $9 million for the COVID-19 Energy Assistance Program (CEAP) to support consumers struggling to pay their energy bills during the pandemic. CEAP will provide one-time payments to consumers to help pay down any electricity bill debt incurred over the COVID‑19 period. Applications will be available through local utilities in the upcoming months;$8 million for the COVID-19 Energy Assistance Program for Small Business (CEAP-SB) to provide support to businesses struggling with bill payments as a result of the outbreak; andAn extension of the Ontario Energy Board's winter disconnection ban until July 31, 2020 to ensure no one is disconnected from their natural gas or electricity service during these uncertain times.In addition, the government recently announced that it will continue the suspension of time-of-use (TOU) electricity rates and, starting on June 1, 2020, customers will be billed based on a new fixed COVID-19 Recovery Rate of 12.8 cents per kilowatt hour. ""While we make progress to contain this deadly virus, we know people will need to stay home when possible and businesses will need ongoing support as we gradually and safely reopen the economy,"" said Premier Ford. ""Providing additional rate relief, flexibility and customer choice will help ensure everyone can recover from this extraordinary crisis and get back to a life that is as normal as possible."" Starting June 1, 2020, the new COVID-19 Recovery Rate comes into effect for electricity customers who pay TOU rates. This fixed rate will apply to TOU customer bills 24 hours a day, seven days a week, providing stability and certainty for consumers as the government restarts the economy and supports individuals and families who continue to spend more time at home. The COVID-19 Recovery Rate will be in place until October 31, 2020, followed by a new customer choice initiative. Starting November 1, 2020, customers will be able to choose a plan that best suits their household and lifestyle with the option of either TOU electricity rates or tiered pricing, which will provide a set rate for electricity up to a certain level of consumption. ""We recognize that businesses and families are living with a great deal of uncertainty, and they need to know what they can expect when they open their electricity bills every month,"" said Minister Rickford. ""The new COVID-19 Recovery Rate will provide stability for Ontario electricity consumers, while we work to re-open our province and restart our economy."" The government will continue to subsidize electricity bills by 31.8 per cent through the Ontario Electricity Rebate. The government is providing approximately $5.6 billion in 2020-21 as part of its existing electricity cost relief programs, to help ensure more affordable electricity bills for eligible residential, farm and small business consumers. ""With the financial hardships faced by so many in our province as a result of COVID-19, those struggling to pay their electricity bills need support,"" said Minister Walker. ""This program, in partnership with the Ontario Energy Board and local distribution companies, will support electricity consumers by keeping rates stable and affordable.""

Quick Facts

The new COVID-19 Recovery Rate is the Ontario Energy Board (OEB)’s Average Regulated Price Plan (RPP) Rate, which is based on the forecast average electricity supply cost for RPP consumers as of November 1, 2019, as published in the OEB’s most recent RPP Price Report.
Time-of-use (TOU) electricity rates vary by time of day and are comprised of three different rate periods of off-peak, mid-peak and on-peak pricing.
Tiered electricity rates provide customers with a set rate for electricity up to a certain level of consumption. The rate increases for all electricity use that exceeds this threshold.
The OEB sets both tiered and TOU rates as part of the RPP.
There are approximately five million residential consumers, farms and some small businesses billed using TOU electricity prices under the RPP.

Ministry for Seniors and Accessibility


TORONTO — Today, Raymond Cho, Minister for Seniors and Accessibility, released the following statement:
""As we take this opportunity to mark Seniors' Month, we recognize that these are very challenging times for seniors as they continue to self-isolate due to the risk of COVID-19. Now more than ever, it is important that we come together to support our seniors and recognize and honour the knowledge, experience and the contributions that seniors have made to build the province that we enjoy today - and that they continue to make every day in communities across Ontario. This year's theme, Stay Safe, Stay in Touch focuses on keeping our older adults safe, connected and engaged at home. If you have a friend or neighbor who is an older adult or a person with a disability, please take some time to reach out to them to ensure they have what they need during this difficult period. Please give them a call just to chat or offer to pick up some groceries or a prescription. Our government has the highest regard for our seniors, and we are committed to protecting and supporting them. We are continuing our investment in almost 300 Seniors Active Living Centres which help seniors remain active and engaged in age-friendly communities. I am pleased to highlight that 175 of these programs are currently being offered remotely through teleconferences, online videos, and one on one phone calls. These have been critical in helping seniors stay connected from home during these challenging times. Last month, we invested $11 million to implement the Ontario Community Support Program which helps coordinate deliveries of meals, medicine, and other necessities to seniors. We have also invested $20 million to support retirement homes with infection control and active screening procedures. Our government is also developing a comprehensive Seniors' Strategy which will help ensure older adults remain healthy, active and socially engaged, are safe and secure, have the opportunity to age at home and in their communities, and participate in the labour market and economy as they wish. We will have more details to share later in the year. I encourage all Ontarians across this province to join me in recognizing June as Seniors' Month. Let's all do our part and Stay Safe, Stay in Touch with our older adults each and every day of the year.""

Ontario Extending Infectious Disease Emergency Leave for Workers during COVID-19
New Regulation will protect employees from permanent layoffs and businesses from potential closures 

June  1, 2020  8:52 A.M.

Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development


TORONTO - The Ontario government is taking steps to help ensure that as the economy gradually and safely reopens workers will have jobs to return to and businesses will be protected from incurring unsustainable termination costs. Today, the government announced that it has enacted a new regulatory amendment that will put non-unionized employees on Infectious Disease Emergency Leave during the COVID-19 outbreak any time their hours of work are temporarily reduced by their employer due to COVID-19. This will ensure businesses aren't forced to terminate employees after their ESA temporary layoff periods have expired.
Terminations triggered when temporary layoffs exceed the permitted length under the Employment Standards Act can result in costly payouts which, for many businesses, could be the difference between survival and closure. Under the new regulatory change to the Employment Standards Act, non-unionized employees who have had their hours reduced or eliminated because of the pandemic will be deemed to be on Infectious Disease Emergency Leave. Workers will remain employed with legal protections and be eligible for federal emergency income support programs. ""As we take the necessary steps to safely and gradually restart the economy, we need to make sure business owners can reopen their doors and workers have jobs to go back to,"" said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training & Skills Development. ""This regulatory change will protect businesses from being forced to permanently lay off their employees due to COVID-19 and suffer a financial loss that could shutter their operations for good."" Many businesses had to close or reduce operations to comply with emergency orders necessary to stop the spread of COVID-19. According to Statistics Canada, 379,000 Ontario workers were temporarily laid off in April 2020, an increase of 2,496 per cent compared with one year earlier. The regulatory amendment applies retroactively to March 1, 2020 and will expire six weeks after the declared emergency ends. The regulatory amendments do not include employees represented by a trade union. The government is also supporting people and businesses by providing billions of dollars in deferrals and relief. That includes deferring $1.9 billion in Workplace Safety and Insurance Board premium payments until August 31, 2020, $10 billion in interest and penalty relief, and other deferrals to improve cash flow, protect jobs and help household budgets. In addition, the province is partnering with the federal government to provide commercial rent relief for commercial tenants and landlords through the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) program.

Quick Facts

The Financial Accountability Office of Ontario estimates that about 2.2 million Ontario employees were directly affected by pandemic-related shutdowns, through either job losses (1.1 million), temporary layoffs or sharply reduced hours (1.1 million) in 2020.
Termination and severance obligations create a significant financial burden for businesses. For example, a restaurant with 30 staff could be liable for termination payments as high as $100,000.

Creating an Ontario that is Accessible and Inclusive for Everyone 


May 31, 2020  9:00 A.M.

Ministry for Seniors and Accessibility


TORONTO — The Minister for Seniors and Accessibility, Raymond Cho, issued the following statement to recognize National AccessAbility Week:
""Our government is proud to work towards creating a society and economy that is accessible and inclusive for all Ontarians. I would like to thank all of the individuals, groups and partners who have been working towards creating a barrier-free Ontario. This year, National AccessAbility Week comes during a particularly challenging time. COVID-19 has forced many people to stay home and practice physical distancing. This can be stressful and lonely. Please take advantage of the many supports being offered during this difficult period by visiting COVID-19: Support for people.  More than ever, we must pay close attention to ensuring accessibility remains a priority and always be mindful of potential barriers in our communities for people with disabilities. Ontario has a long history as a Canadian leader in accessibility, and we are working within and beyond government to help support people with disabilities so they can fully participate in everyday life in our communities. This includes our recent partnership with SPARK Ontario - an online hub that connects volunteers to community organizations that support seniors and people with disabilities.  Our government is also investing $11 million to help the Ontario Community Support Program to help deliver hot meals, medicine and other essentials to low-income seniors and people with disabilities. Another key area of focus is breaking down barriers to accessibility in the built environment. To do this, we're working with partners in architecture, design and construction and have invested $1.3 million over two years for the Rick Hansen Foundation to launch a certification program in Ontario to help remove barriers in buildings. From May 31 - June 6, I ask everyone to take this time to recognize the importance of accessibility and inclusion in our communities and workplaces, as well as acknowledge the contributions of Canadians with disabilities. This is an opportunity for all of us to redouble our efforts to remove barriers so that people with disabilities can fully take part in all aspects of everyday life. By working together today we can make an Ontario that is open to everyone.""

Ontario Provides Consumers with Greater Stability and Predictability with Their Electricity Bills


May 30, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines


TORONTO - Today, Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines, issued the following statement on electricity rate relief measures during the COVID-19 outbreak.
""Our government is committed to supporting families and business-owners as we plan for the safe and gradual reopening of the province.   Since March 24, 2020, we have invested just over $175 million to deliver emergency rate relief to residential, farm and small business electricity consumers by suspending time-of-use (TOU) electricity pricing. This investment was made to protect the people of Ontario from a marked increase in electricity rates as they did their part by staying home to prevent the further spread of the virus.  As Ontarians continue to work and learn from home, we are extending the suspension of time-of-use price to provide consumers with greater stability and predictability with their electricity bills. To extend this support responsibly, we will introduce a fixed electricity price, known as the COVID-19 Recovery Rate, of 12.8 cents per kWh, which will be automatically applied to all time-of-use customers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This fixed electricity price will be in place from June 1 - October 31, 2020.  The COVID-19 Recovery Rate of 12.8¢/kWh is based on the average cost of electricity, set by the Ontario Energy Board. This fixed rate will continue to suspend time-of-use prices in a fiscally responsible manner. By introducing this new fixed rate, consumers will have greater flexibility to use electricity when they need it without paying on-peak and mid-peak prices. Thank you to the millions of Ontarians who are helping us stop the spread. More information on the COVID-19 Recovery Rate, and government's plan to build an electricity system that works for the people of this province, will be announced at the Premier's daily briefing on Monday, June 1, 2020 at 1:00 p.m. EST.""

Quick Facts

The new COVID-19 Recovery Rate is the Ontario Energy Board's (OEB’s) average Regulated Price Plan (RPP) Rate, which is based on the forecast average electricity supply cost for RPP consumers as of November 1, 2019, as published in the OEB’s most recent RPP Price Report. 
Time-of-use (TOU) electricity rates vary by time of day, comprised of three different rate periods of off-peak, mid-peak and on-peak pricing.
The OEB sets both tiered and time-of-use (TOU) rates as part of the RPP.
There are approximately five million residential consumers, farms and some small businesses billed using TOU electricity prices under the RPP.

Province providing more activities to help people get outside and enjoy nature while physical distancing

May 30, 2020  9:00 A.M.

Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks


TORONTO — The Ontario government is gradually reintroducing camping in Ontario Parks and recreational camping on Crown land, starting June 1, 2020, to give people more opportunities to enjoy the outdoors, while staying safe and practicing physical distancing. 
As of June 1, backcountry camping will be available at Ontario Parks, including access points, paddle and portage routes and hiking trails. Ontario Parks will also be expanding day-use activities to include picnicking and off-leash pet areas.  ""We are all eager to get outside this time of year, and backcountry camping will give people a low-risk way to enjoy the benefits of being outdoors while following physical distancing rules,"" said Jeff Yurek, Minister of the Environment, Conservation and Parks. ""We're counting on people to be responsible when enjoying our parks and continue to follow all of the public health measures to help stop the spread of COVID-19.""  Following current provincial restrictions, no more than five people will be allowed to occupy a backcountry campsite during their stay, unless they live in the same household.  The closure of all other overnight camping and some day-use activities at provincial parks and conservation reserves has been extended to June 14 and will continue to be reassessed. All buildings and facilities including campgrounds, roofed accommodations, visitor centers, park stores, playgrounds, and beaches remain closed. Some washroom facilities may be available. In addition, Ontario is reopening recreational camping on Crown land while reminding visitors to continue to adhere to public health advice as the best defense against COVID-19, such as practicing physical distancing, wearing a face covering when physical distancing is a challenge, and frequent hand washing. Camping on Crown land does not include the use of shared facilities and is a low-risk way for people to enjoy the outdoors.    ""Even as we begin to reopen camping so that Ontarians can enjoy our beautiful outdoors, people's health and well-being remain our top priority,"" said John Yakabuski, Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry. ""We have to work together to ensure we open our province in a responsible, cautious manner. We are starting to contain the virus, but we cannot risk undoing all of the progress that we have made by reopening the province too quickly.""    Ontario Parks will begin collecting fees for day-use and backcountry camping access as of June 1. Please visit Ontario parks and click on the ""Fees"" tab to find out more. Advanced reservations or registrations will be required at most of the 20 operating provincial parks that are offering backcountry camping. Ontario Parks has been conducting critical maintenance and other park start-up procedures and ensuring operational and safety protocols are in place so that more recreational activities and facilities can open when it is safe to do so.

Quick Facts

Backcountry camping involves hiking or paddling through park lands and setting up camp in remote areas. These campers are typically in small groups, fully equipped with supplies, and do not normally require the use of any facilities, such as washrooms, showers or other amenities.
People can also continue to access Crown land for recreational activities such as hiking, fishing and hunting.
Ontario Parks manages 340 provincial parks and 295 conservation reserves, covering over 9.8 million hectares of land in the province.
Crown land, managed by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, represents approximately 77 per cent of the province.

Ontario Takes Additional Steps to Protect Seniors in Retirement Homes during COVID-19
Province Makes Regulatory Amendments in Response to Pandemic 

May 30, 2020  7:00 A.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Today, the Ontario government made amendments to the Retirement Homes Act, 2010 regulation, enabling the Retirement Homes Regulatory Authority (RHRA) to better support seniors living in retirement homes during the COVID-19 outbreak. The regulation change increases the emergency payment the RHRA can pay to eligible retirement home residents from $2,000 to $3,500. In the event of an emergency, such as an outbreak, this funding can be used to support residents to cover costs for transportation, alternative accommodation or temporary care. The regulation change also requires retirement homes to report infectious disease outbreaks to the RHRA during COVID-19 and beyond.  
""These regulatory amendments build on the decisive action our government has taken in recent days to make sure our seniors receive the support and the protection that they deserve,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""We are making sure seniors have the financial resources they need in the event of an emergency, and are making it easier for the retirement home regulator to work with local public health authorities."" In addition, the government has: Issued an emergency order eliminating barriers to eligible frontline workers receiving pandemic pay. It will allow employers with unionized workforces to provide pandemic pay to eligible employees without the need to negotiate separate terms or conditions with their bargaining agents.Extended an emergency order to provide electricity bill relief for industrial and commercial consumers during COVID-19. The order was first introduced on May 1, 2020 to defer a portion of the Global Adjustment charges from April and May 2020. Through the extended emergency order and a related regulatory amendment, this support is now being extended through to the end of June 2020.Amended an emergency order to allow drive-in movie theatres that were in existence before May 29, 2020  to reopen with restrictions in order to help support communities and local businesses recover from the devastating economic impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak. The government is also allowing batting cages to open so that people can start to enjoy outdoor seasonal activities at safe physical distances. These changes will be effective on May 31, 2020."

Ontario Opens Up COVID-19 Testing Across the Province
Strategy Expands Testing for General Public, Frontline Workers, First Responders and Workplaces

May 29, 2020  1:15 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — As the province carefully and gradually reopens the economy, the Ontario government is implementing the next phase of its COVID-19 testing strategy to detect and quickly stop the spread of the virus. Testing will now be available to more people in more locations across the province.
Today, Premier Doug Ford and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, released the next phase of the province's COVID-19 testing plan, Protecting Ontarians Through Enhanced Testing, which includes three branches of testing: Assessment Centre Testing: expanding who gets tested to now include asymptomatic individuals concerned about exposure and continued routine symptomatic testing at assessment centres.Targeted Campaigns: detecting and containing cases by expanding asymptomatic surveillance for vulnerable populations, including in long-term care homes and other shared living spaces like shelters and group homes, as well as targeted testing of workplaces in priority sectors which work with priority populations and where it may be difficult to physically distance.Outbreak Management: testing to ensure rapid and agile response capacity for outbreak management, including in specific neighbourhoods and regions or at hospitals, institutions and workplaces.""Ontario now has the most open and robust testing criteria in the entire country. In fact, anyone who feels they need a test will be able to get a test,"" said Premier Ford. ""We can't manage what we can't measure, and our newly expanded testing strategy is our best defence against stopping the spread of COVID-19 as we gradually and safely reopen the province. More proactive testing will give employers and their employees confidence as they return to work and will fortify our alert system for any potential surge in new cases."" Together, these branches of testing will support Ontario regions' extensive efforts to reduce the rate of transmission, also known as instantaneous reproduction number, or Rt. To help enable increased access to routine symptomatic testing, people will no longer need a referral to go to any of the more than 130 assessment centres across Ontario. Information about the assessment centres is now easily accessible on Ontario's dedicated COVID-19 website. ""The significant expansion of testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals will go hand in hand with public health units' ongoing contact tracing and case management efforts to stop the spread of the virus and keep our families and our communities safe,"" said Minister Elliott. ""I just want to caution people, although your test may be negative, you must continue to practise physical distancing, wear a face covering when physical distancing is a challenge, and wash your hands regularly. These simple actions will help keep everyone safe and healthy."" Ontario will also expand proactive surveillance testing to detect outbreaks and more actively monitor any spread among our most vulnerable populations in hospitals, long-term care homes, group homes, shelters, emergency child care centres, correctional facilities and other shared living spaces. This will include testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic residents and frontline staff in long-term care and retirement homes, as well as those working with priority populations, including first responders, essential workers and other workplaces as the economy gradually reopens. Moving forward, the province expects that private-sector workplace testing will leverage private and public resources as the government works with private-sector employers to develop the appropriate models for each sector and workplace. Further proactive surveillance testing will also be conducted in rural, remote and Indigenous communities. In response to a declaration of an outbreak in a specific neighbourhood, region, institution or workplace, the province is also developing agile testing resources, such as mobile testing teams, that can be rapidly deployed to communities across Ontario to enhance existing outbreak management. Ontario will also soon release a renewed strategy to support public health units with case management and contact tracing, including launching a new exposure notification app that will alert Ontarians when they may have been exposed to COVID-19 and would recommend appropriate actions, such as monitoring for symptoms, self-isolation and/or appropriate next steps on getting tested.

Quick Facts

On May 14, 2020, the province expanded its testing guidance to include a broader range of symptoms for all populations and to help guide decision-making on testing of priority population groups.
To get tested, people should visit Ontario's website to find their local assessment centre and whether they need to call ahead to make an appointment.
No Ontarian will be declined a test at an assessment centre (either through appointment or walk-in, per the processes of each individual assessment centre), especially those who are symptomatic or who are concerned they have been exposed to COVID-19.

Ontario continues to lead large Canadian provinces in daily testing volumes, and to date, has completed 680,687 tests, with 69,318 tests completed since May 24, 2020.

Ontario has a provincewide network of more than 20 laboratory sites working in coordination to further increase capacity and test turn-around times for COVID-19 testing.

Ontario commercial landlords can apply for urgent rent assistance through Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance for small businesses

May 29, 2020  9:30 A.M.

Ministry of Finance


TORONTO — All commercial landlords in Ontario can now apply for rental assistance to help their small business tenants impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This initiative will keep more small businesses in operation and more people employed as the province gradually and safely restarts the economy.
The Ontario government, in partnership with the federal government, has launched the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) for small businesses. The province is committing $241 million to the program, which will provide more than $900 million in support for small businesses across Ontario during this difficult time.  To find out how much rent support you may be eligible for, visit Ontario.ca/rentassistance. ""We know that some of the necessary measures put in place to stop the spread of COVID-19 have created significant financial hardships for small businesses,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. ""That's why we've partnered with the federal government to deliver urgent rent assistance and help both small businesses and commercial landlords make ends meet. I encourage all commercial landlords to take advantage of this benefit as soon as possible in order to provide some certainty for our small businesses.""  The CECRA for small businesses, administered by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), provides forgivable loans to eligible commercial landlords to help cover 50 per cent of commercial rent for tenants for the months of April, May and June 2020. The tenant will be responsible for covering up to 25 per cent of rent, so that up to 75 per cent of the rent is covered. To receive the forgivable loan, eligible commercial landlords will be required to enter into a rent reduction agreement with their impacted small business tenants for April to June 2020, which includes committing to a moratorium on evictions for three months.  ""As Ontario's economy gradually reopens, we will continue to work with our federal partners to ensure people and businesses across the province get the support they desperately need. We want to do everything we can to ensure our small businesses are able and ready to reopen their doors when the time is right,"" said Phillips.  To learn more and apply for the CECRA for small businesses, visit the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation's (CMHC) application portal. "

Mandate of Incident Management System Long-Term Care Table Extended

May 28, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — To further protect seniors and staff in long-term care homes, the Ontario government announced today that it is extending the mandate of the Incident Management System Long-Term Care Table. This table is composed of health care professionals who make immediate decisions to deal with issues related to staffing levels, infection management and resources during the COVID-19 outbreak.
""As Premier, it's my job to push the system. Fixing what we inherited starts with strong leadership through this crisis and beyond to protect and care for our long-term care residents,"" said Premier Ford. ""Today's announcement demonstrates that we are making progress in fighting this terrible virus in our long-term care homes and we will continue to do everything in our power to fortify the iron ring of protection around our most vulnerable seniors."" In April, an Incident Management System (IMS) structure was established to coordinate operational support to long-term care homes. The IMS table meets daily to organize efforts across multiple providers and government to make rapid decisions that support long-term care homes in need. Homes identified for support are those struggling to control outbreaks, complete infection prevention and control assessments, ensure appropriate staffing levels, have access to personal protective equipment (PPE), and complete the testing of all long-term care home residents and staff. ""The Incident Management System Long-Term Care Table has been able to drive immediate decisions and resource deployment for urgent issues facing the sector, at a time when clear direction and communication is critical."" said Minister Fullerton. ""I am incredibly grateful to know the government and our long-term care homes can continue to rely on their steady leadership and health system expertise."" Under IMS leadership, Ontario has seen the following improvements to long-term care homes affected by COVID-19 outbreaks: Since May 1, increased the number of low-risk green homes from 356 to 547 homes, representing 87.4% of all long-term care homes.Since May 1, reduced the number of high-risk red homes from 35 to 19, a 54.3% improvement.As of May 27, 37 hospitals had deployed teams into 59 yellow homes and 19 red homes.Completed testing of long-term care resident and staff, with a second round of testing already underway.Number of COVID-19 positive tests in long-term care homes decreased from 12.5% to 7.5%.As of May 28, 129 out of 626 long-term care homes are in active outbreak, from a high of 190 on May 18.164 outbreaks have been resolved.The IMS table also facilitated assistance from the Canadian Armed Forces into five homes and deployed 150 hospital teams to support staff in other long-term care homes. Under their leadership, standard infection prevention and control guidelines were issued to all homes and a regular data reporting structure was set in place for long-term care home assessment and testing. Leadership of the IMS includes: Deputy Minister Richard Steele, Ministry of Long-Term CareDeputy Minister Helen Angus, Ministry of HealthDr. Kevin Smith, President and CEO, University Health NetworkMatthew Anderson, President and CEO, Ontario HealthMichelle DiEmanuele, President and CEO, Trillium Health PartnersDr. Jack Kitts, President and CEO, The Ottawa HospitalJames Schlegel, President and CEO, Schlegel Health CareDr. Tom Stewart, President and CEO, St. Joseph's Health System, and CEO, Niagara HealthDr. David Williams, Chief Medical Officer of OntarioDr. Dirk Huyer, Chief Coroner of Ontario"

Ontario-York Region Sign Landmark Transit Agreement


May 28, 2020 11:00 A.M.

Ministry of Transportation


TORONTO - Following the signing of the ""Ontario-York Region Transit Partnership Preliminary Agreement"" with the Regional Municipality of York, Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation and Kinga Surma, Associate Minister of Transportation (GTA) issued the following joint statement:
""Our government is one step closer to delivering on its plan for more rapid, reliable and seamlessly-connected transit in the GTA. As part of our commitment to build transit infrastructure quickly and efficiently, today we signed a landmark Preliminary Agreement with York Region that will help significantly expand the subway network through the delivery of the Yonge North Subway Extension - one of the four priority projects included in Ontario's ""New Subway Plan for the GTA."" This plan represents the largest subway expansion in Canadian history. Since fall 2019, the Province has been engaging with York Region to formalize the Ontario-York Region Transit Partnership. For York Region, this preliminary agreement continues to move the Yonge North Subway Extension closer to implementation, which will significantly extend the existing Yonge Subway (Line 1) north from Finch Station to serve people, communities, and jobs in major employment centres, such as Markham and Richmond Hill. It will set the framework of roles, responsibilities and potential funding mechanisms for the Province and York Region regarding the Yonge North Subway Project. Throughout the engagement process, the Province adopted a similar approach to the productive negotiations undertaken with the City of Toronto on shared transit priorities, which yielded the landmark Ontario-Toronto Transit Partnership Preliminary Agreement in February 2020. These two arrangements with our key municipal partners will ensure that the Province, the City of Toronto and York Region continue to collaborate to successfully deliver on Premier Ford's historic ""New Subway Transit Plan for the GTA"", which also includes the all-new Ontario Line, the improved three-stop Scarborough Subway Extension and Eglinton Crosstown West Extension with planned connection to Pearson International Airport. With the Province and municipal governments now firmly aligned in support for Ontario's plan, we continue to jointly call on the federal government to provide its fair share - funding at least 40 per cent of our four nationally-significant subway projects. We call on the federal government to contribute the additional funding, beyond what has already been allocated, to bridge the gap and provide the stable, predictable funding they committed to provide during the election campaign last fall. Formalizing this funding partnership with the federal government remains a top priority, given the significant benefits to the local, regional, provincial and national economy that Ontario's plan will generate over the next 10 years and beyond. Our government remains committed to building much-needed infrastructure, reducing congestion, developing transit-oriented communities with a greater variety of housing options, and connecting people to places and jobs as we responsibly lead Ontario's economy back to a strong position.""

Ontario Taking Action at High Risk Long-Term Care Homes
Government deploying inspection teams to long-term care homes, starting process for alternative management to take over five long-term care homes 

May 27, 2020  3:45 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Today, the Ontario government is taking additional immediate action at high-risk long-term care homes, following the disturbing allegations outlined by the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF). 
The Ministry of Long-Term Care has deployed long-term care inspection teams to conduct comprehensive, detailed inspections at high-risk long-term care homes over the next 21 days. At the same time, the Ministry of Long-Term Care has started the process of appointing temporary management at Eatonville Care Centre, Hawthorne Place Care Centre, Altamont Care Community, Orchard Villa, and Camilla Care Community. Further, the recently announced independent commission into Ontario's long-term care system will now begin its work in July 2020. ""Today, we are taking further steps to protect our most vulnerable seniors across the province and fix the broken system we inherited. We will do whatever it takes to get the job done because as Premier, the buck stops with me,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""I made a commitment to our long-term care residents and their families that there would be accountability and justice after receiving the military's heart-breaking report on the state of five of our homes."" Starting tomorrow, long-term care inspectors will be assessing six homes including those captured in the CAF reports and any reports previously filed regarding critical incidents in those homes. Six teams of two long-term care inspectors will go into each of the homes to do an expanded, stringent inspection process over a two-week period. The six homes being inspected include Eatonville Care Centre, Hawthorne Place Care Centre, Orchard Villa, Altamont Care Community, Camilla Care Community, and Holland Christian Homes Inc. The teams will develop a customized inspection plan based on the details outlined in the CAF report. Their inspections will include record and chart reviews; in-depth interviews with staff and residents; and observations in order to determine the extent of the issues. The inspectors will follow a rigorous and consistent inspection methodology for all inspections. After an inspection is completed in a high-risk home, the ministry will set up regular status calls, monitoring, as well as regular unannounced in-person follow up inspections with the home. Results of these and all other inspections will be posted publicly on the ministry website. The government is also inspecting other long-term care homes that are currently considered high-risk over the next 21 days. Additionally, working with hospital and other partners, each of these homes will be required to submit a plan for the ministry that details how they intend to return to acceptable levels of care immediately. ""What we saw in the reports from the Canadian Armed Forces was gut-wrenching and appalling,"" said Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""Our inspectors are professionals like nurses, dieticians and physiotherapists and they will stop at nothing to ensure all high-risk homes are quickly returned to places of safety and stability."" Allegations such as the ones contained in the CAF report triggers the Ministry of Long-Term Care to share its findings with other agencies which may result in: Police investigations and potential criminal chargesMinistry of Labour inspections into worker health and safety, given the lack of training observedPublic health inspections into food preparation, etc.Referrals to professional colleges for practice standard violations, given medication management and care observationsDuring this unprecedented time, inspectors will continue to be deployed to ensure all homes are compliant with the Long-Term Care Homes Act. When the ministry receives any information from any source, it is immediately triaged. Where there is high or moderate risk to residents, a risk level is assigned and inspections are conducted in the home, regardless of its outbreak status. The government's priority is protecting the health and well-being of Ontarians, especially long-term care residents who are among Ontario's most vulnerable seniors. The government will continue to explore every opportunity to provide further support to long-term care partners as the situation evolves.

Quick Facts

The Canadian Armed Forces will continue to provide support until June 12, 2020.

A recent emergency order made on May 12, 2020 allows the Ministry of Long-Term Care to order alternative management to temporarily manage a long-term care home where at least one resident or staff member has tested positive for COVID-19. A mandatory management order helps to address the outbreak and effectively protects our most vulnerable Ontarians from COVID-19.

Every long-term care home in Ontario gets inspected at least once a year.
The ministry’s more than 140 inspectors conducted 2,882 inspections in 2019 to ensure that long-term care homes are safe and well-operated, and are meeting all the requirements in the Act and Regulation. 
Inspectors are the ministry’s frontline teams and play a critical role in collecting information and coordinating to ensure that long-term care homes in critical need of support are receiving the supplies, staff and support they need.  
Inspections conducted by the Ministry of Long-Term Care continue to be the most rigorous in Canada. Ontario's legislation is the most prescriptive so in turn, the requirements for long-term care operators are the strictest in the country. As recommended by Ontario’s Auditor General, the ministry uses a risk-based inspection approach, which prioritizes issues and homes based on risk of harm to residents. This approach to inspections was also endorsed by the Gillese Inquiry.  

Concerns about compliance in long-term care homes should be reported as soon as possible to the ministry by calling the Family Support and Action Line at 1-866-434-0144.

Ministry of Transportation


TORONTO — Today, John Yakabuski, MPP for Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, announced the Ontario government is moving forward with the first stage of widening Highway 17 from two to four lanes between Arnprior and Renfrew. The highway expansion, with four new interchanges, will keep families safe, connect communities, and drive economic growth in the region.
""Highway 17 is a lifeline for travel and the movement of goods throughout Renfrew County,"" said MPP Yakabuski. ""Twinning this vital highway corridor will improve safety, strengthen the connection between communities, create jobs and attract investment to the region."" The government is requesting Expressions of Interest from qualified contractors for the first stage of the highway expansion, which will see a new interchange built at the Calabogie Road Intersection. Construction will begin following the awarding of the contract and completion of the design and environmental assessment. ""Our government is supporting local communities with critical infrastructure investments that will keep families safe, goods moving, and drive economic growth and job creation,"" said Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation. ""Modernizing and expanding this section of Highway 17 will ensure a safe and efficient highway network for Eastern Ontario."" Ontario is widening 22.5 kilometres of Highway 17 from Scheel Drive to three kilometres west of Bruce Street in Renfrew County. The highway expansion project will help to inform the Province's first regional transportation plan for Eastern Ontario, to be released in 2021.

Quick Facts

The construction of a new interchange at the Calabogie Road intersection in the Township of McNab/Braeside is Stage 1 in the Highway 17 Widening Project between Arnprior and Renfrew.
Stage 2 of the project includes building three new interchanges and widening Highway 17 from two lanes to four from Scheel Drive in the Township of McNab/Braeside to just west of Bruce Street in Horton Township.
Highway 17/417 is the longest provincial highway in Ontario, stretching for more than 1,900 kilometres from the Ontario/Manitoba border to the Quebec border in Eastern Ontario.

Ontario Takes Immediate Action to Investigate Worst Hit Long-Term Care Homes
Canadian Armed Forces support helping to stabilize five long-term care homes

May 26, 2020  1:30 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO ― Since the outset of the COVID-19 global pandemic, the Ontario government has put the safety and security of our seniors as a top priority. The onset of COVID-19 has only exacerbated the already difficult situation in long-term care in the province.
Today, the Ontario government outlined key findings from the Canadian Armed Forces report on the five long-term care homes at which the military has been assisting. The report details serious concerns around infection prevention, safety, staffing and level of care. The report also indicates that these five homes are beginning to stabilize with the support of the armed forces. ""The health and safety of the residents and staff in our long-term care homes is our number one priority. It is clear the long-term care system in Ontario must be fixed,"" said Premier Ford. ""The report from the Canadian Armed Forces on these five long-term care homes is extremely troubling. Our government will take immediate action to investigate the concerns raised by the Canadian Armed Forces to ensure the safety of our residents in these five long-term care homes and in homes across the province."" On April 22, the Ontario government formally requested assistance from the federal government in the form of the Canadian Armed Forces to support five long-term care homes that were in crisis. These homes were amongst the hardest hit in Ontario with COVID-19 outbreaks and had significant challenges that could not be rectified through various efforts. Those challenges included: staffing, infection prevention and control, resident safety, food preparation and janitorial services. On May 10, the Canadian Armed Forces reported 15 out of 20 categories being in high-risk. As of May 25, based on the Canadian Armed Forces assessment, 13 of these 15 categories were no longer considered high-risk. The Ontario government is once again calling on the federal government and the Canadian Armed Forces to extend their current mission for at least an additional 30 days. ""Thank you to the brave women and men in our Canadian Armed Forces who have helped immensely to stabilize our hardest hit long-term care homes,"" said Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""We are continuing to take action to ensure our most vulnerable people living in our long-term care homes receive safe and quality care."" The government has already begun an active investigation based on the Canadian Armed Forces report. To date, one death has been referred to the Office of the Chief Coroner for investigation. In addition to continued regular inspections, the Ministry of Long-Term Care Inspections Branch will immediately investigate specific critical incidents referred to in the report. In addition, the government recently announced it will be launching an independent commission into Ontario's long-term care system beginning in September. The government also continues to work with hospital partners to assist long-term care homes across the province with clinical, infection prevention and control, and other supports.

Quick Facts

The following information is based on long-term care homes self-reported data as of May 25, 2020:

Out of 626 long-term care homes in Ontario, there are currently 150 experiencing an outbreak, which is down from a high of 190. That means there are 476 homes not experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak;


There are currently 1,855 active resident cases, which is the lowest since April 20, and 1,335 active staff cases, which is the lowest since April 27;

17 homes have only one resident case (0 staff);

29 homes have only one staff case (0 resident); and

46 homes have only one case among staff or residents (i.e. a staff or resident is a confirmed case).

More than 6,500 Ontarians offer to deliver food, run errands and connect with seniors and people with disabilities during COVID-19

May 25, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Ontario's volunteers and small businesses are rising to the challenge and helping seniors and other vulnerable people during the COVID-19 outbreak. Thousands of people are generously giving their time and resources to make and deliver food, run errands, and check in on those who are self-isolating.
Today's update was provided by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Prabmeet Sarkaria, Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction. ""Over the past few weeks, I've been moved by hundreds of stories of people reaching out in selfless acts of kindness to help those most in need,"" said Premier Ford. ""It's that Ontario spirit that is giving us the strength to pull through these tough times. If you have some spare time, I encourage you to sign up and volunteer because we are all in this together."" On April 9, the government announced it was investing $100,000 in its partnership with SPARK Ontario to support the province's first bilingual volunteer hub connecting volunteers with community organizations that support vulnerable Ontarians. To date, the response has been tremendous: Over 54,000 users have visited the SPARK Ontario website to learn how they can volunteer;Over 3,500 civic-minded Ontarians have signed up on the site to volunteer, and over 3,100 have contacted community organizations regarding a volunteer opportunity; and141 community organizations have registered for volunteer matching and more than 100 COVID-19-related volunteer opportunities have been posted online.Today, volunteers are supporting seniors, people with disabilities and others in need as they stay home during the COVID-19 outbreak with food delivery, shopping for supplies, running errands, providing remote mental health and crisis support, and tutoring kids.Volunteers are also mentoring seniors on technology to ensure they are connected online, as well as providing mental health support to both seniors and people with disabilities by writing letters and poems. The government has partnered with the Older Adults Centres Association of Ontario to help implement the Seniors Centres Without Walls model of programming, where isolated seniors can participate in group programs over the phone. As of April 30, 2020, 35 programs have begun running in their communities. ""Although it is critical for our most vulnerable citizens to self-isolate in order to stay healthy and safe, the lack of social interaction can be extremely difficult,"" said Raymond Cho, Minister for Seniors and Accessibility. ""SPARK Ontario's volunteer hub provides a helping hand and reassurance that they are not alone. I congratulate the thousands of Ontarians who have stepped up to volunteer at this challenging time."" ""As I connect and host virtual roundtables with small businesses across the province, I'm also hearing about the tremendous generosity of our small businesses and the many ways they are giving back to their communities,"" said Associate Minister Sarkaria. ""In so many remarkable ways, these local heroes are demonstrating the Ontario spirit. As part of the Small Businesses, Big Hearts initiative, we want to highlight these acts of kindness. Please reach out to me to share the positive news!"" Through the new Ontario Community Support Program, the province is working with the Ontario Community Support Association (OCSA) and their large volunteer base to increase Meals on Wheels food deliveries and deliver essential supplies to isolated, low-income seniors and people with disabilities and chronic medical conditions. More than 500 meal referrals and nearly 2,000 essential supply referrals have been made since the program launched in mid-April.

Quick Facts

The Ontario Government invested $11 million to implement the Ontario Community Support Program. This is in addition to the $20 million over two years the province has invested to protect seniors in retirement homes through increased infection control and active screening procedures.

The province has also doubled Guaranteed Annual Income System (GAINS) payments for low income seniors. Individuals will receive up to $166 per month and couples will receive up to $332 per month. These doubled payments will continue for six months and provide an additional $75 million to 194,000 vulnerable seniors who may need more help to cover essential expenses during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Temporary measures required to help contain COVID-19 outbreak

May 25, 2020 12:15 P.M.

Ministry of Long-Term Care


TORONTO —The Ministry of Long-Term Care has issued Mandatory Management Orders appointing local hospitals to temporarily manage two long-term care homes for 90 days. Southlake Regional Health Centre will temporarily manage River Glen Haven Nursing Home in Sutton and Humber River Hospital will temporarily manage Downsview Long Term Care in North York. The orders may be extended beyond the 90 days, if necessary.
Despite receiving hospital support for weeks, these homes have been unable to contain the spread of COVID-19. By taking these steps the government is enabling a rigorous management structure to help contain the spread of the disease and assist in returning these homes to normal operations. ""Our government is using every tool available to keep Ontarians safe, especially our most vulnerable people during this unprecedented time,"" said Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""I am confident that the talented staff at these hospitals and long-term care homes will work together to contain COVID-19 and move beyond the crisis.""  The Ministry of Long-Term Care will continue to make decisions on which long-term care homes may require additional management support on a case-by-case basis. The province is working with its health partners in addressing challenges in the long-term care sector by involving hospitals in deploying Infection Prevention and Control teams to homes, continued staff and resident testing, addressing personal protective equipment supply issues, and redeploying hospital staff to help with critical staffing shortages in long-term care homes.

Quick Facts

A recent emergency order made on May 12, 2020 allows the Ministry of Long-Term Care to order alternative management to temporarily manage a long-term care home where at least one resident or staff member has tested positive for COVID-19. A mandatory management order helps to address the outbreak and effectively protects our most vulnerable Ontarians from COVID-19.
The government recently announced the launch of an independent, non-partisan commission into Ontario's long-term care system beginning in September 2020. Over the next several months, the details of the commission will be finalized including the terms of reference, membership, leadership of the commission and reporting timelines.
Testing of long-term care residents and staff for COVID-19 has been completed with additional rounds of testing to begin in the coming days and weeks.

Ratification of the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation (OSSTF) Central Agreements

Ministry of Education


TORONTO — Today, Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education, issued the following statement in response to the ratification of the final central agreements with teachers and education workers. The teachers' agreement is between the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation (OSSTF) and the Ontario Public School Boards' Association (OPSBA). The other agreement is between the OSSTF education workers, OPSBA, Ontario Catholic School Trustees' Association (OCSTA), l'Association des conseils scolaires des écoles publiques de l'Ontario (ACÉPO) and l'Association franco-ontarienne des conseils scolaires catholiques (AFOCSC):
""I would like to congratulate all of the parties for the ratification of the 2019-22 central agreements, delivering needed stability for Ontario's children, parents, and all education staff. Our Government achieved our main priority - landing deals that advance the priorities of students, parents, and taxpayers. We now have successfully ratified central agreements with all of our education labour partners. Our focus will be to work with all partners in this unprecedented time to deliver the best education using every tool available - including technology - to support academic achievement. We thank teachers and education workers for playing a critical role in promoting positive learning environments for students in all corners of our province — most especially those conducting synchronous online learning. We know that while in-class instruction cannot be replaced, online synchronous classrooms can still provide a sense of community and an opportunity for collaborative learning, while students are home. While this ratification concludes the 2019-2022 teacher and education worker central negotiations, our commitment to parents remains unchanged. We will continue to stand up for parents to protect our children's futures and invest in their potential.""

Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation (OSSTF) Central Agreements Now Ratified


May 22, 2020  4:00 P.M.

Ministry of Education


The central agreements with teachers and education workers represented by the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation (OSSTF) have been ratified by school boards and the union and agreed to by the Government of Ontario. OSSTF represents almost 28,000 teachers from grade 9 to 12 in the English public-school system, and almost 16,000 education workers across the province.
The central agreements with OSSTF teachers and education workers demonstrate the government's commitment to reaching deals that protect our children's futures and invest in their potential. The government also agreed to ratification of agreements with the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) on November 4, 2019, the Education Workers' Alliance of Ontario (EWAO) on February 4, 2020, the Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association (OECTA) on April 8, 2020, the Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario (ETFO) on April 28, 2020, the Ontario Council of Educational Workers (OCEW) on May 4, 2020, and Association des enseignantes et des enseignants franco-ontariens (AEFO) on May 8, 2020. These agreements were reached while respecting taxpayers, students and families, and recognizing the important contributions of front-line workers in our education system. Collective agreements between school boards and OSSTF bargaining units include both central and local terms. The central terms are now resolved. In order to complete the collective bargaining process, local terms need to be reached between each school board and its OSSTF bargaining units. The three-year collective agreements will be effective September 1, 2019 through to August 31, 2022. HIGHLIGHTS OF THE CENTRAL AGREEMENT WITH TEACHERS Compensation and benefits: Under the agreement, OSSTF teachers will receive a one per cent increase to wages and salaries per year, for three years. Consistent with Protecting a Sustainable Public Sector for Future Generations Act, 2019, the agreement allows for annual inflationary increases to the funding for members who are eligible for benefits and for a one-time payment up to three percent of annual funding if the Employee Life and Health Trust's (ELHT's) surplus falls below a certain threshold, for benefit maintenance. Support for Students Fund: Total system priorities investments in the amount of approximately $44.7 million over the 2020-21 and 2021-22 school years. The fund shall be allocated to create additional teacher positions to provide school boards with more flexibility to address special education, mental health initiatives as well as unique learning needs. In addition, OSSTF teachers will receive funding of approximately $28.6 million over two years to support Adult Day Schools. Class size: Provincial funding and legislated class size restrictions provide for an average class size of 23 for students in grades 9-12 for the 2020-21 and 2021-22 school years, which is effectively the same as the 2019-20 school year. Online learning: The government is moving forward with a requirement that Ontario students entering Grade 9 in the 2020-21 school year complete two mandatory online learning courses in order to graduate. Exemptions to the requirement can be made for reasons such as accommodating individual students with learning needs, students who have issues accessing technology and newcomers to Ontario who enter secondary school after Grade 9. The request for an exemption can be made by a parent/guardian or the student who has reached the age of 18 through an opt out process. Address absenteeism and reduced sick leave usage: The agreement includes a measure to reduce the impact of routine medical and dental appointments during the school day. Health and safety: Renewed mandate for the Provincial Working Group on Health and Safety to continue their work, meeting, sharing resources, and making recommendations. Teachers will be provided with one half-day of violence prevention training in each of the 2020-21 and 2021-22 school years.  Hiring practices: OSSTF formally recognized the government's prerogative to create, amend, or revoke hiring practice regulations in the education system, including O. Reg 274/12. HIGHLIGHTS OF THE CENTRAL AGREEMENT WITH EDUCATION WORKERS Compensation and benefits: Under the agreement, OSSTF education workers will receive a one per cent increase to wages and salaries per year, for three years. Consistent with Protecting a Sustainable Public Sector for Future Generations Act, 2019, the agreement allows for annual inflationary increases to the funding for members who are eligible for benefits and for a one-time payment up to three percent of annual funding if the Employee Life and Health Trust's (ELHT's) surplus falls below a certain threshold for benefit maintenance. Support for Students Fund: Total system priorities investments in the amount of approximately $40.54 million over the 2020-21 and 2021-22 school years. The fund shall be allocated to create additional education worker positions to provide school boards with more flexibility to address special education, unique learning needs, mental health initiatives and employees who play a role in promoting safe, healthy and caring schools. Full day kindergarten and class size: The government is committed to maintaining full-day kindergarten and retaining the existing staffing model. Address absenteeism and reduced sick leave usage: The agreement includes a measure to reduce the impact of routine medical and dental appointments during the school day. Health and safety: Renewed mandate for the Provincial Working Group on Health and Safety to continue their work, meeting, sharing resources, and making recommendations. Education Workers will be provided with one half-day of violence prevention training in each of the 2020-21 and 2021-22 school years. Priorities and partnerships fund: Education workers will receive a one-time grant in the amount of $500,000 to support apprenticeship opportunities. Community use of schools funding: Funding in the amount of $58,000 per school year will be maintained to continue staffing schools with OSSTF custodians during community use. Professional development: School boards will be provided a one-time grant in the amount of $1.5 million to support education workers' professional development.

New Programs Focus on Hospitality Workers and Apprentices

May 22, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — As the economy gradually reopens, the Ontario government is helping people affected by COVID-19 get back to work. The province is investing in Ontario's first Virtual Action Centre, an online counselling and training portal, to support laid off and unemployed hospitality workers, and is helping apprentices by providing grants to purchase tools, protective equipment and clothing for their trade, along with forgiving previous loans to purchase tools.
The announcement was made today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""The impact of COVID-19 has been devastating for many business owners, workers, and families, and that's why we are doing everything we can to help people through this difficult period,"" said Premier Ford. ""Hospitality workers and our skilled tradespeople have been among those hardest hit by this pandemic. These new programs will ensure they're ready to get back on the job and play an important role in our economic recovery."" The government is providing an Ontario Tools Grant of $2.5 million in 2020-21 and $7.5 million in 2021-22 and ongoing. This will help new eligible apprentices purchase the equipment they need to start their careers. The funding amounts will be distributed as follows: $1,000 for those in motive power sector trades;$600 for those in construction and industrial sector trades;$400 for those in service sector trades.To be eligible for the new grant, apprentices must have: completed level 1 training on or after April 1, 2020;an active registered training agreement; andbeen registered as an apprentice for at least 12 months.The government is also forgiving more than $10 million in outstanding loans owed by apprentices for tool purchases made at the beginning of their careers. The Loans for Tools Program allowed thousands of new apprentices to buy tools, equipment, clothing, manuals and code books required for their trade. About 19,000 apprentices who participated in the program owed, on average, $495. ""If we are going to rebuild our economy, we must reach out and help the workers and businesses that are suffering as a result of COVID-19,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""The programs that we are announcing today will leave more money in the pockets of our apprentices and support those hospitality workers who have been laid-off by providing access to the training and services they need to recover and rejoin the workforce."" The government is also investing nearly $2 million to open a Virtual Action Centre in partnership with UNITE HERE Local 75. This virtual job training resource will provide up to 7,000 unemployed workers in the hospitality sector with access to a wide range of services and supports online and over the phone, including: Stress management and mental health resources through video conferencing;Immediate health and safety online training for workers who return to work at designated quarantined sites;Technical skills online training;Online training to upgrade English language and digital skills;Peer group facilitation and employment preparation through videoconferencing.UNITE HERE will operate the Virtual Action Centre. UNITE HERE is a union that represents workers in hotels, restaurants, racetracks and casinos, laundry and food service companies, airport concessions and apparel, textile and general manufacturing and distribution centers. ""Ontario's hotel and hospitality sectors create thousands of jobs across the province,"" said Lisa MacLeod, Minister of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries. ""This new virtual platform will make sure that those workers are supported as we gradually reopen the province and prepare our $35 billion tourism sector to welcome visitors back."" ""We are very grateful for the generous support of the Ontario government,"" said Guled Warsame, President of UNITE HERE Local 75. ""This support will provide services and skills training to our members who are laid-off due to COVID-19. We know that people are at the heart of the hospitality industry. We are very grateful and proud to work with the provincial government to ensure that people are provided with support and the opportunity to upgrade their skills and get back to work as soon as possible.""

Ontario Makes it Easier to Conduct Business during COVID-19
Legislative changes allow corporations to operate virtually and electronically 

May 22, 2020 11:30 A.M.

Ministry of Government and Consumer Services


TORONTO -The Government of Ontario is making it easier for people to conduct business and practice physical distancing in the new COVID-19 environment. The province is permitting Ontario corporations to conduct virtual meetings and to defer certain annual meetings in specified circumstances and is allowing the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services to accept copies of documents, electronic signatures on documents, and electronic filing of documents. These changes are part of COVID-19 Response and Reforms to Modernize Ontario Act, 2020.
""The COVID-19 outbreak has forced change upon everyone in order to adhere to public health measures and to flatten the curve,"" said Lisa Thompson, Minister of Government and Consumer Services. ""The reality is, we must balance the need to practice physical distancing with the need to conduct business each and every day. These legislative changes will provide corporations with an opportunity to rethink how they operate in the new normal and be more efficient in the future."" Providing temporary flexibility to hold meetings virtually, defer annual meetings in specified circumstances, and submit e-filings will help Ontario corporations to safely meet their obligations during the COVID-19 outbreak while reducing the number of touchpoints needed to file documentation. Additionally, the COVID-19 Response and Reforms to Modernize Ontario Act, 2020 will permanently allow the Ministry to accept copies of documents signed by electronic signature, providing greater flexibility to businesses moving forward. The government has consulted with the Business Law Modernization and Burden Reduction Council on these legislative amendments to address corporate and business law issues during the pandemic. The Council is a group of legal experts appointed by the Minister of Government and Consumer Services to advise on modernizing Ontario's business laws, some of which have not changed in over ten years. The government also consulted with key businesses, condominium corporation sector stakeholders, and co-operative corporation sector stakeholders.  ""I want to thank all of the stakeholders and advisors who have taken the time to provide feedback and actionable solutions during the COVID-19 outbreak,"" said Minister Thompson. ""By working together, we are able to navigate our way through what are clearly unchartered waters."" 

Quick Facts

Legislative amendments to the Corporations Act, the Business Corporations Act, the Co-operative Corporations Act and the Condominium Act, 1998 related to virtual meetings and the deferral of annual meetings in some circumstances, are in force and retroactive to March 17, 2020, the day the Declaration of Emergency came into effect. 
To enable businesses to file copies of documents, documents signed by electronic signature and temporary electronic filing to the Ministry, the Alternative Filing Methods for Business Act was introduced along with legislative amendments to the Business Corporations Act, Business Names Act, Corporations Act, Corporations Information Act, Co-operative Corporations Act, Extra-Provincial Corporations Act, Limited Partnerships Act, and the unproclaimed Not-for-Profit Corporations Act, 2010 (to take effect upon proclamation).
The Business Law Modernization and Burden Reduction Council is a short-term advisory body comprising eight members that have provided recommendations to the government on business law matters since February 2019.

Ontario-Based Solutions Contribute to the Global Effort against the Outbreak

Office of the Premier


Ontario is funding the following research on preventing, detecting and treating COVID-19. These projects focus on important areas of research, including vaccine development, diagnostics, drug trials and development, and social sciences. 
A Randomized Open-Label Trial of CONvalescent Plasma for Hospitalized Adults with Acute COVID-19 Respiratory Illness (CONCOR-1)  Donald Arnold, Principal Investigator  McMaster University   CONCOR-1 is a clinical trial that will collect blood plasma from individuals who have recovered from COVID-19, known as COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Convalescent plasma contains COVID-19 antibodies, proteins that help fight the virus. Convalescent plasma will be injected into patients currently fighting the infection, to test whether this is an effective treatment for the virus. This clinical trial will enrol patients 16 years of age and older admitted to hospital with COVID-19 and who require supplemental oxygen for respiratory illness.   Partners include 60 hospitals across Canada and three hospitals in New York City, the Canadian Blood Services and Héma-Québec and the New York Blood Center.   Research and Deployment of Rapid High-Throughput Diagnostic Testing for COVID-19  Marek Smieja, Principal Investigator  St Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton   This project will increase Ontario's COVID-19 testing capacity by deploying robotic liquid handling technology, specimen pooling, and efficient sample preparation, while reducing biological risk and ensuring reliable results. The Disease Diagnostics & Development group in the Research Institute of St Joe's Hamilton (RSJH) is collaborating with the Hamilton Regional Laboratory Medicine Program (HRLMP) and other clinical laboratories across the province to quickly develop, validate, and deliver high-throughput, COVID-19 testing, with the goal of testing up to 6,000 samples per lab daily.   Assay Development for SARS-CoV-2 Sero-Surveillance  Jennifer Gommerman, Principal Investigator  University of Toronto   This study will provide a better understanding of the immune response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19. This approach aims to measure the level and/or types of antibodies induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the blood of acute and convalescent patients. In addition, measuring these antibodies in the saliva of asymptomatic infected subjects identified through contact tracing will provide insights into what the early immune response to the virus looks like, and how this may correlate with clinical outcome. This knowledge, as well as the development of a robust serosurveillance platform, represents a powerful weapon in our fight against COVID-19.   Multivalent Antibody Scaffold to Deliver an Exceptionally Potent and Broad Antiviral Against SARS-CoV-2  Jean-Philippe Julien, Principal Investigator  The Hospital for Sick Children   This project has the potential to develop a unique antibody-based molecule for protection and treatment against COVID-19. Molecular technology will allow these researchers to decipher the vulnerabilities of the virus with the goal of developing a potent and broad antiviral that neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and prevents associated COVID-19 symptoms.   Developing Prophylactic Virus-Vectored Vaccines for COVID-19  Byram Bridle, Leonardo Susta and Sarah Wootton (Co-Principal Investigators, University of Guelph); Darwyn Kobasa, National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada (Collaborator) University of Guelph   This research aims to develop a vaccination strategy for COVID-19. By developing avian avulavirus (AAvV-1) and adenovirus viral-vectored vaccines expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a target antigen, researchers will test these vaccines in mice to identify a way to induce robust protective mucosal (respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital tract) and systemic immunity. Mucosal immunity plays a significant role in preventing pathogens from getting into the body. Systemic immunity clears any pathogens that bypass mucosal barriers. After optimization, these vaccines will be evaluated in a hamster challenge model at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.   The RAPID COVID Study - Application of Point-of-Care COVID-19 Testing to Optimize Patient Care, Resource Allocation and Safety for Frontline Staff  Derek So, Principal Investigator  University of Ottawa Heart Institute   This study will determine the role of point-of-care testing (POC) as a tool to improve care of COVID-19 patients and conserve resources. A major obstacle facing hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak is the inability to quickly diagnose who is infected with the virus. Delayed test results could mean that patients, who ultimately test negative, are treated for days utilising resources that could be better deployed elsewhere. An immediate diagnosis of COVID-19 among carriers could provide more expedient treatment, prevent clinical deterioration and help health care workers avoid unnecessary risk of exposure.   In collaboration with Spartan Biosciences, which has developed a novel point-of-care 45-  minute bedside COVID-19 test, and a team of specialists from six centres in Ontario, this research will evaluate the efficacy of POC testing to determine when, how and to who it can be applied.   A Prospective, Observational Research Study on the Diagnosis of COVID-19 Infection from Stool Samples of Children and Adults  Nikhil Pai, Jeff Pernica, Marek Smieja (Co-Principal Investigators)  McMaster University   Through the development and use of a novel test to diagnose COVID-19 from stool samples, this team will assess up to 4,500 stool samples collected from outpatient clinics, emergency departments and inpatient wards across eight major Hamilton region hospitals and clinics. This work will improve COVID-19 disease detection in children and adults who lack respiratory symptoms, are asymptomatic, or are presumed to have ""recovered"" from past infection. The researchers hope to expand COVID-19 testing options across Canada and ultimately, better identify patients who carry high risk of community transmission than traditional respiratory testing alone.   Cellular Immuno-Therapy for COVID-19 Induced Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome: The CIRCA-19 Trial  Duncan Stewart, Principal Investigator  Ottawa Hospital Research Institute   Through a series of trials, this research will rapidly evaluate the safety and efficacy of using mesenchymal stromal/stem cells, or MSCs, to help treat patients with COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Up to 25 percent of all patients admitted to hospital require admission to an intensive care unit, and as many as 40 percent develop severe difficulty breathing due to ARDS.   In total, 27 patients will undergo three sequential trials. The first trial, called the Vanguard study, is designed to quickly determine the optimal dosing strategy of MSCs derived from bone marrow to treat patients experiencing ARDS. The next two trials will use the optimal dose of cells determined by the Vanguard trial, but will administer MSCs derived from the umbilical cord, which is an abundant and readily available source.   Rapid Identification of Immunogenic and T-cell Epitopes to Enable Serologic Testing, Passive Immunotherapy, and Epitope Vaccine for COVID-19  Shawn Li, Principal Investigator  Western University   To curb the COVID-19 outbreak caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, researchers are looking to solve three critical challenges as quickly as possible - detection, treatment, and vaccination. This project will address these challenges by developing a point-of-care blood test to identify infected individuals, including those without symptoms, devising strategies for the production of virus-neutralizing antibodies to treat the severely ill, and identifying viral epitopes to inform epitope-vaccine development.   The Impact of the Coronavirus Pandemic on Children with Medical Complexity Technology Dependency: A Novel Research Cohort Study  Audrey Lim, Principal Investigator  McMaster University   This study addresses how to effectively manage pediatric patients remotely by identifying the barriers and facilitators of virtual clinics. COVID-19 is placing strain on families of children with medical complexity, medical fragility and technology dependency. Many of these children are dependent on life sustaining technology such as tracheostomy, home mechanical ventilation, and/or enteral feeding tubes. Though accounting for less than 1 percent of all children in Ontario, this group is at increased risk of multiple and prolonged hospitalizations and poorer health outcomes. Normally, these children are seen at a hospital to address their multiple complex needs, however due to COVID-19, all in-person clinic appointments have been replaced by virtual clinics. Parental satisfaction with virtual clinic healthcare teams will also be assessed using a quality improvement tool developed for this study. This research has the potential to advance virtual medicine, beyond COVID-19.   Food Retail Environment Surveillance for Health and Economic Resiliency: FRESHER Ontario  Jason Gilliland, Principal Investigator  Western University   The Food Retail Environment Surveillance for Health & Economic Resiliency (FRESHER) project is a rapid response to the widespread closures of, and modified operating conditions for, many retail food outlets. The FRESHER project will examine the economic and social impacts of COVID-19 in Southwestern Ontario by identifying what businesses modified their operations, temporarily closed or permanently closed during the outbreak and how the outbreak has affected businesses and their employees. This study will help inform policies and programs that will maintain Ontario's food security, incentivize economic growth during the recovery period, and improve resiliency among businesses during future pandemics and emergencies.   Protective Immunity in Individuals Infected with COVID-19  Ishac Nazy, Principal Investigator  McMaster University   The goal of this research is to determine the makeup, concentration, strength and viral properties of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies to provide insights into the immune response of individuals infected with COVID-19. Working with Dr. Arnold (CONCOR-1 study on convalescent plasma therapy), this team will use samples from recovered patients to test whether antibodies exist, and if they are able to bind and neutralize the virus. This research will determine whether immunity is longstanding or if it wanes over time; and will inform researchers how immune-based treatments work to fight off the virus, including convalescent plasma or future vaccines.   Clinical Research on the Therapeutic Benefits of Annexin A5 in Severe COVID-19 Patients  Claudio Martin, Principal Investigator  Lawson Health Research Institute   There are currently no proven therapies to treat COVID-19. In the most severe cases, the disease is complicated by sepsis acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiorgan failure. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by the body's response to an infection. While the body normally releases chemicals to fight an infection, sepsis occurs when the body's response to these chemicals is out of balance, triggering systemic inflammation that can damage multiple organs. Many critically ill COVID-19 patients develop sepsis 1-2 days before ARDS, suggesting that sepsis is a major contributor to the development of organ and respiratory failure.   This clinical trial will examine the effects of Annexin A5, in treating critically ill COVID-19 patients who develop sepsis. Annexin A5 is a human protein that has potent anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic (cell death prevention) and moderate anticoagulant (blood clot prevention) properties. The ultimate goal of the trial is to use Annexin A5 to treat sepsis and prevent respiratory and multi-organ failure.   Novel Coronavirus Antiviral Drug Discovery Using High-Throughput Screening  Jean-Simon Diallo, Principal Investigator  Ottawa Hospital Research Institute   Using a novel bio-sensor that detects drugs that disrupt the attachment of coronaviruses to cells, this research will test approximately 1,200 approved drugs to better understand their potential to prevent viral infection in cells and their ability to block the interaction between COVID-19 and its receptor. A second phase of this study will attempt to identify novel antivirals from a small (>220,000) molecule library.   Canada's COVID-19 Pandemic Response and Impact in Low-Income and Homeless or At-Risk for Homelessness Populations in Ottawa (Canada): A Mixed Method Study  Smita Pakhale, Principal Investigator  The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute   Vulnerable populations face numerous social and health inequities that are exacerbated during times of crises. Lessons learned from previous public health crises suggest that inappropriate communication strategies jeopardize risk reduction for vulnerable populations. The objective of this research is to measure the impacts of COVID-19 public health emergency response efforts and communication strategies on Ottawa's low-income, homeless or at-risk for homelessness populations. The findings could help inform public health messaging strategies and pandemic approaches for vulnerable populations.

Ontario Leading COVID-19 Research in Canada
Province Announces First Phase of Research Projects to Fight COVID-19

May 21, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government is quickly moving forward with innovative research to prevent, detect and treat COVID-19. These projects, part of the government's $20 million Ontario COVID-19 Rapid Research Fund, focus on areas of research such as vaccine development, diagnostics, drug trials and development, and social sciences. Additionally, Ontario is leading the country with 22 clinical trials investigating COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.
Today's announcement was made by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Ross Romano, Minister of Colleges and Universities. ""Ontario is leading the nation in the battle to defeat this deadly virus. We have some of the most incredible researchers and innovators anywhere in the world right here in our province,"" said Premier Ford. ""There's no reason why a new rapid testing method, vaccine or treatment can't be found right here in Ontario. Our government is investing in some very promising research proposals, which have the potential to save lives and help us get back to a way of life that is as close to normal as possible."" The Ontario government is funding 15 high-quality and promising proposals that were submitted in response to a recent call for proposals for the Ontario COVID-19 Rapid Research Fund. Announced only four weeks ago, the $20 million fund was created as an immediate response to engaging the research community on ways to fight COVID-19. Where relevant, a portion of these funds will be used to cover costs associated with licensing and commercialization, including patenting, of the valuable intellectual property generated by successful projects to ensure any economic outcomes from these proposals benefit Ontario's economy, workers and researchers. ""Researchers in Ontario represent some of the best and brightest in the country and we are tapping into their expertise to find Ontario-based solutions to treat the infection and stop the spread of the virus,"" said Minister Romano. ""Our government is encouraged by the ideas and solutions researchers have put forward to-date. These projects will support Ontario's response to the COVID-19 outbreak and help us make smart and effective decisions as we look ahead to the future."" Many of Ontario's research hospitals, universities, colleges and research institutes are leading Canada with their ground-breaking COVID-19 research projects. Eleven of the 22 clinical trials that are being led by these institutions have already secured the necessary approvals by Health Canada to advance potential vaccines and therapeutics. Ontario also has the largest share of the total 25 clinical trials approved by Health Canada in the country. ""Research will not only play an important role in the fight against COVID-19, but it will also drive innovation and our economic recovery as we restart the province,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""This $20 million investment in our research sector will mean more made-in-Ontario solutions as we continue to fight this virus and move into the next phase of our recovery."" Ontario's research will expand the global understanding of COVID-19 and further the capacity in the health care, artificial intelligence, and supply chain sectors to assist frontline workers today and in the future. ""Research to prevent, detect and treat COVID-19 is a key component in our fight against the virus,"" said Minister Elliott. ""These projects and clinical trials will contribute to both our local and global efforts to understand how COVID-19 is evolving and inform health system planning and the careful and gradual reopening of the provincial economy.""

Quick Facts

These 15 proposals are the first to receive funding from the Ontario COVID-19 Rapid Research Fund, with additional projects expected to be announced in the coming weeks. Projects were evaluated by a peer review committee. The selection process for these types of projects typically takes up to eighteen weeks to complete. For these projects the selection process was shortened to two weeks while maintaining the same high-quality and independent process that leveraged the expertise of researchers to evaluate.
The government of Ontario is investing $20 million to support COVID-19 research by tapping into the expertise of Ontario’s colleges and universities, research institutions and non-profit scientific partners. Funding was announced as part of Ontario’s Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19.

The Ontario government received a positive response from the research sector to the request for proposals for the Fund, with hundreds of eligible submissions.
To date, the Ontario Together portal has received donations of more than five million pieces of personal protective equipment and other supplies to protect frontline workers.

Over 54,000 users have visited the SPARK Ontario website to learn how they can volunteer, and over 3,500 civic-minded Ontarians from across the province have signed up on the site to volunteer.
Ontario is investing in artificial intelligence (AI) research through CIFAR to stop the spread of COVID-19. Throughout 2020, projects will identify early intervention strategies and effective treatments, support public health measures, and help improve our understanding of viral transmission and the mental health and social impacts of the virus.

Ontario Reduces Financial Barriers to Postsecondary Education
Student Assistance Applications Open for 2020-21 School Year

May 20, 2020  3:00 P.M.

Ministry of Colleges and Universities


TORONTO — The Ontario government is reducing financial barriers for full-time students attending postsecondary education. Starting today, those most in need can apply to the Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP) for the 2020-21 school year.
""Investing in higher education is one of the most important investments a person can make in their future,"" said Ross Romano, Minister of College and Universities. ""To help ensure today's students, and tomorrow's entrepreneurs, innovators and workers can obtain the skills they need to succeed in a highly competitive global economy, our government is helping to remove the financial barriers to postsecondary education."" For many students, the loans they receive from OSAP are their first major financial commitment. To support a greater understanding of the program and the responsibilities as an OSAP recipient, applicants will be required to complete an information module that highlights basic information about the student assistance program and financial literacy. This is knowledge students will need to make informed financial decisions today, and throughout their lives. During this unprecedented period, the government is providing a six-month temporary deferral of OSAP loan payments and interest accrual on OSAP loans from March 30-September 30, 2020 to support OSAP borrowers in good standing. The province has also worked with postsecondary institutions to support virtual learning and virtual exams. The government is now preparing for the 2020-21 school year by working closely with the province's colleges and universities to ensure students receive the high-caliber education and training they need to obtain rewarding careers. Acting on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health, Ontario's postsecondary institutions are developing their plans for the fall term - exploring a range of delivery options depending on the trajectory of COVID-19.

Face coverings now recommended when physical distancing is a challenge

May 20, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — As the Ontario government carefully and gradually reopens the province, those taking public transit, returning to work or going out shopping are being urged to continue to adhere to public health advice as the best line of defence against COVID-19. To assist the public, the Ministry of Health today released specific recommendations on how to choose, wear and care for appropriate face coverings used in public where physical distancing is not possible, along with additional safety measures for provincial transit agencies.
The details were released today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation. ""Now that we are in Stage 1 of our Framework for Reopening the Province, more people will be returning to workplaces, going to stores and parks, and using public transit,"" said Premier Ford. ""I strongly urge everyone to continue following the public health advice, such as physical distancing and restricting gatherings to five people or less. Although we are making progress, COVID-19 is still a risk that we must guard against. Please stay safe and protect yourself and others."" Since the beginning of the outbreak, Dr. David Williams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, has advised people to wash their hands often, stay at home if feeling ill, and practise physical distancing by staying at least two metres apart from anyone outside their household. Now that the province is reopening, the Chief Medical Officer of Health and other health experts are recommending that individuals wear a face covering where physical distancing is not possible, such as on public transit or in a small grocery store or pharmacy. In order to assist people and reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19, the Ministry of Health released the following face covering recommendations: Wear your face covering safely and snugly to cover your nose and mouth, without any gaps. Ensure your face covering is made of at least two layers of tightly woven material and can be cleaned multiple times without losing its shape;Medical masks, such as surgical and N95 masks, should be reserved for use by health care workers, those providing direct care, first responders and individuals who are ill and must leave their home for essential reasons such as seeking medical care, picking up medication or groceries;Face coverings should not be placed on or used by children under the age of two; anyone who has trouble breathing; and anyone who is unable to remove it without assistance.""If you need a face covering, it is critically important people wear one that is appropriate for the situation,"" said Minister Elliott. ""Those taking transit or going out who can't physically distance should wear non-medical grade cloth masks. We need to reserve all of the medical masks to protect our frontline health care workers, first responders and people who are ill."" Workers and employers may also consider using face coverings as an additional public health measure in addition to mandatory occupational health and safety measures. To assist provincial transit agencies in protecting transit staff and riders in this new environment, the Ministry of Health is also recommending the following measures be put in place: Physical distancing of at least two metres by admitting fewer passengers and using physical markers between seats;The use of face coverings, particularly when physical distancing is not feasible;Ensuring the availability of alcohol-based hand rub upon entering and exiting the vehicle;Implementing engineering controls like plexiglass windows between drivers and passengers; andEnhanced cleaning, particularly of high-touch surfaces.""Ontario's public transit systems are critical to supporting the economy and getting people where they need to go as the province begins to reopen,"" said Minister Mulroney. ""The health and well-being of all transit workers and passengers is a top priority for our government and we will be working with transit agencies to ensure that public transit can continue to operate safely.""  All Canadians continue to be legally required to self-isolate for 14 days when returning home from international travel. In the meantime, Ontario and public health experts will carefully monitor the key public health indicators outlined in A Framework to Reopening our Province at each stage of reopening and will adjust public health measures if necessary.

Expansion will relieve congestion, shorten commute times and spur economic growth

May 20, 2020  9:30 A.M.

Ministry of Transportation


TORONTO — Today, the governments of Canada and Ontario announced the widening of Highway 401 from six to ten lanes in the Cambridge area. This major highway expansion will relieve congestion, shorten commute times and ensure the safe and reliable movement of essential goods along Canada's busiest highway and critical trade corridor.
""Highway 401 is a lifeline for travel and the movement of goods throughout our province and that's why we are making historic investments to expand and modernize it,"" said Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation. ""Together with our federal partners, we are investing in these critical infrastructure projects to drive economic growth and create jobs during these extremely difficult times."" ""Investments in modern transportation infrastructure are important to building strong communities and thriving businesses,"" said the Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities. ""The widening of Highway 401 in Cambridge, including the creation of high occupancy vehicle lanes, will make it easier and safer for Ontarians and local businesses to get to their destination. With our partners, we're building transportation networks that support a strong economy, and the safe movement of people and goods.""   The highway will be widened from six to ten lanes between Hespeler Road and Townline Road. Construction on the project, which includes High Occupancy Vehicle lanes, is expected to begin later this year. ""The work to widen Highway 401 will improve traffic flow and make travel safer for residents and businesses,"" said Bryan May, Member of Parliament for Cambridge. ""The project will also make transportation of goods through our region more efficient. Ultimately, safer roads with less congestion will keep Cambridge moving."" ""Widening Highway 401 in the Cambridge area will bring economic benefits to our local community and make it easier for businesses and families travelling on this vital highway corridor,"" said Belinda Karahalios, MPP for Cambridge. ""This announcement is part of our government's commitment to this region and for keeping the province moving."" ""Everyone in the Region of Waterloo knows how important the 401 is to our communities."" said Amy Fee, MPP for Kitchener South-Hespeler. ""This investment will reduce travel times and help keep goods moving through this critical trade link and improve the quality of life in our growing region."" ""Our government is ensuring that the necessary investments are taking place to keep Southwestern Ontario moving."" said Mike Harris, MPP for Kitchener-Conestoga. ""Widening the 401 is part of the government's plan to improve outdated infrastructure and make travel safer, easier and faster for families and businesses.""

Quick Facts

Highway 401 is an essential part of Ontario’s highway network connecting the Greater Toronto Area with southwestern Ontario and the US for international trade and economic development.
In 2017 the Government of Canada committed to funding up to 50 per cent of eligible costs to a maximum of $96 million through the Building Canada Fund–Major Infrastructure Component of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan.
This project is the second widening project in Cambridge. The widening of Highway 401 from Highway 8 to Hespeler Road was completed in 2019.

Assistance available for manufacturing companies retooling to support the front lines 

May 19, 2020  2:00 P.M.

Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade


TORONTO ― The Ontario government is working with Medical Innovation Xchange (MIX), Canada's first industry-led hub for med-tech start-ups, to provide non-medical manufacturing companies free support as they retool to provide essential supplies and equipment to health care facilities during COVID-19.  
With this new collaboration, the government will drive innovation in the sector, create jobs and build Ontario's domestic medical supply chain to ensure the province is as self-sufficient as possible and prepared for a future health crisis.   ""Ontario has some of the best and brightest and innovative people in the world and it's critical that we leverage that advantage to better prepare for the future,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""Our government's collaboration with Medical Innovation Xchange members is an example of how we are collaborating with our cutting-edge businesses to solve problems, grow our medical technologies sector and build a safer environment for Ontario's health care facilities."" Non-medical manufacturing companies that have received funding through the Ontario Together Fund, or a Purchase Order with the Province of Ontario, can access MIX members' medical advisory services, including assistance navigating regulatory hurdles and increasing efficiencies. By taking advantage of these opportunities, companies can accelerate the delivery of much needed medical supplies and products to the front lines. To support the development of proposals submitted by businesses and individuals through the Ontario Together web portal and help businesses retool their operations, the government launched the $50 million Ontario Together Fund. All submissions received through the portal are being reviewed and prioritized to focus on solutions that can respond to where the need is greatest and can be implemented quickly.  ""MIX was founded to help young domestic medical technology companies navigate the specific challenges in the healthcare sector,"" said MIX Founder Armen Bakirtzian. ""We understand how to be efficient with resources and make the fewest mistakes while accelerating timelines to build critical medical supplies and equipment.""

Government unveils plans for reopening child care, day camps and initiatives to strengthen learning into the summer

May 19, 2020  1:15 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government is protecting the health and safety of students during the COVID-19 outbreak by keeping schools closed for the rest of this school year. This decision was made after consulting with the Chief Medical Officer of Health, health experts on the COVID-19 Command Table, and medical experts at The Hospital for Sick Children. At the same time, the government is planning for the reopening of schools for the 2020-21 school year, the gradual reopening of child care, and the opening of summer day camps subject to the continuing progress in trends of key public health indicators.
Today's announcement was made by Premier Doug Ford, Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education, and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""Nothing is more important than protecting our kids in this province, bar none over anything,"" said Premier Ford. ""Today's announcement gives parents certainty, knowing that their children can continue to learn safely at home and that we have a plan for child care as we work to gradually reopen more of our economy, when it is safe to do so."" All students who were on track to graduate from secondary school before the initial school closure order was made in March will be able to graduate, and all students will receive report cards. Later this summer, the government will announce a plan to strengthen learning and safety protocols to enable students and staff to return to in-class instruction for the 2020-21 school year. That plan will be bolstered by an enhanced province-wide virtual learning program that will allow all students to learn, regardless of the challenges that may transpire in the coming months. Private schools, licensed child care centres and EarlyON programs will also remain closed for the safety and protection of children, families and staff through Stage 1 of the Framework for Reopening the Province. Emergency child care will continue to operate and provide support for health care and other frontline workers. A gradual reopening of child care is expected to begin when the province is ready to transition to Stage 2 based on public health criteria, which will include robust safety protocols for the safety of Ontario's youngest learners and their staff. ""We will never waver from our commitment to keep your child safe, while learning at home,"" said Minister Lecce. ""Our plan will ensure students receive the best educational experience, both inside and outside the classroom, during this difficult time. That is why we are strengthening summer learning opportunities, reopening summer day camps, and it is why we will continue to make the case for synchronous, live, and dynamic learning."" Assuming trends in key public health indicators continue to improve, summer day camps, both indoor and outdoor, may be permitted in July and August of this year with strict health and safety guidelines to be developed in partnership with local public health, the Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development, and municipalities. Overnight camps will not be permitted to operate in the summer of 2020.  The province also unveiled an expanded seven-point summer learning plan to ensure Ontario students have every opportunity to continue their learning through the summer months. Summer learning programs are being expanded to reach the most students in Ontario history, to ensure they remain on track to start the 2020-21 school year with the confidence and knowledge required to succeed. To support at-home learning, the government is leveraging all tools, resources, technologies and services to assist school boards deliver equitable and effective learning through access to technology and Internet connectivity, especially for students in rural and remote parts of Ontario. To help improve access to remote learning, Ontario is partnering with 34 organizations and private businesses, along with school boards, to address key needs among educators, students and their families during the COVID-19 outbreak. Ontario has worked to identify and make available low-cost, high-impact solutions that can significantly improve the Learn at Home experience now and into the future. Access to digital learning resources, supports for special education needs and mental health, as well as Internet connectivity and access to devices have all been identified by school boards and other stakeholders as urgent needs during the current school closure period. These organizations and businesses were identified through a call for proposals on the Ontario Together website between March 31, 2020 and April 21, 2020.

Summer Learning Plan The province unveiled an expanded seven-point summer learning plan for Ontario students to ensure students have every opportunity to continue their learning through the summer months. Summer learning programs are being expanded to reach the most students in Ontario history, to ensure they remain on track to start the 2020-21 school year with the confidence and knowledge required to succeed. 
The summer learning seven-point plan will be focused around the following elements:  Expanded core programming represents 'traditional' summer school courses focused on grades 9 to 12, with additional opportunities for grade 8 students to better prepare.  Introduction of upgrading courses, which will allow students to upgrade their mark in a course in half the time it would have taken them previously. Targeted supports for vulnerable students to support access to non-credit ministry educational programs and leadership supports.  Focused programming for students with special education or mental health needs, including dedicated learning supports such as access to educational assistants and existing after-school programs that could be delivered through summer school Communicating volunteer opportunities for students so that students can leverage virtual volunteer opportunities where possible;Summer programming in Provincial and Demonstration Schools to focus on continued learning for our students with specialized learning needs; andKey concept mapping for next year's learning to focus on compulsory, high-demand and pre-requisite secondary coursesSummer Camps and Programs In Ontario, there are over 450 camps which provide both day and overnight camp services, employing thousands of Ontarians, including students. These camps provide families with children, youth, and adults with special needs, with much needed respite, while engaging individuals in meaningful activities.  Based on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health, indoor and outdoor summer day camps may be permitted in July and August of this year with strict health and safety guidelines to be developed in partnership with local public health, the Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development, and municipalities. Any final decisions to permit summer day camps will be based on trends from key public health indicators continuing to show progress at the time camps are scheduled to open officially. Overnight camps will not be permitted to operate in the summer of 2020. In addition to expanding the pre-existing summer school course offerings, summer programs are being designed to help students upgrade their courses and refresh their learning. Non-credit programs will be available to deliver existing or modified programs to support vulnerable students. A new two-week program for students with special education needs and/or mental health needs will focus on closing gaps in skills development and learning, and on establishing routines. To support students with special education needs participate in summer program offerings, the ministry will also be providing a top-up to boards for summer school programs in 2020.  Learn at Home Resources A more user-friendly Learn at Home site was also launched today, and an adapted summer learning site will be developed to provide resources to help students refresh their learning in preparation for 2020-21 courses. The site will focus on compulsory, high-demand, and prerequisite secondary courses, such as math, science, English, and French. The resources are available at Ontario.ca/LearnatHome. Access to Services, Tools, and Technology As part of the Government of Ontario's aim to build-up and improve the Learn at Home program, the government working with non-profits, organizations, and businesses, is offering a comprehensive suite of services and resources to Ontario school boards to support students, parents and educators during the current school closure. School boards have asked for access to services, tools, and technology that can aid them in the delivery of modern and quality online learning. The government launched the Ontario Together portal to solicit offers and encourage private enterprise and the non-profit sectors to step forward to propose solutions that historically have impeded learning from home. As a result of those submissions, Ontario is moving forward with 34 partnerships with organizations and private businesses, along with school boards, to address key needs among educators, students and their families during the COVID-19 outbreak. The government remains committed to an inclusive online learning program that enables local school boards to provide access to the technology and software required to learn from home.   Through the government's Broadband Modernization Program, the province is also working with all school boards to deliver sustainable, modernized networks with improved Internet access at the target speed. Upon completion, all students are expected to have the same equitable access to digital resources across the province. As of March 31, 2020, broadband modernization is complete at 1,983 schools and in progress at 2,954 schools.

Ontario Extends Emergency Orders to Keep People Safe
Some Outdoor Recreational Amenities Reopening with Restrictions 

May 19, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government, in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health, has extended all emergency orders currently in force until May 29, 2020. That includes the closure of bars and restaurants except for takeout and delivery only, restrictions on social gatherings of more than five people, and staff redeployment rules for long-term care homes and congregate settings like retirement homes and women's shelters. The government is also allowing drive-in religious gatherings.
Today, the province officially enters the first stage of its Framework for Reopening the Province. As part of this initial stage, the government is permitting the reopening of some outdoor recreational amenities, including outdoor sports facilities and multi-use fields, off-leash dog areas, and outdoor picnic sites, benches and shelters in parks and recreational areas, effective as of Tuesday, May 19, 2020. Outdoor playgrounds, play structures and equipment, fitness equipment, public swimming pools, splash pads and similar outdoor water facilities will remain closed until later stages of the province's reopening plan. ""Although we are entering the first stage of our framework to reopen the economy, it's critical that we continue to do so in a safe and responsible manner,"" said Premier Ford. ""The people of Ontario have been doing a fantastic job to help flatten the curve and stop the spread of this terrible virus. With warmer weather beginning, individuals and families will now be able to enjoy many outdoor amenities, but everyone must continue to maintain physical distancing from those outside of their household."" To ensure that individuals and families have safe access to outdoor spaces, it is critical they take everyday steps to reduce exposure to the virus, such as maintaining physical distancing by staying two metres apart from anyone outside of their household, washing hands regularly, and staying home if feeling unwell. ""It's never been more important for people to continue following the public health measures and advice we've laid out, so we don't undo the tremendous progress we've made to contain COVID-19,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""While reopening parks and other outdoor spaces is important for our physical and mental health, we're encouraging people to be responsible by keeping a safe distance of at least two metres from members outside of their household."" In addition, the government has approved an exemption to the emergency order related to gatherings to allow Ontarians to attend drive-in religious gatherings, under certain conditions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The conditions include keeping vehicles two metres or more apart, only members of the same household can be in one vehicle, people will not be able to leave their vehicles, and no more than five people can conduct the service at one time from outside a motor vehicle and they must stay at least two metres apart. ""Our government recognizes the importance that Ontarians place on participating in religious services,"" said Solicitor General Sylvia Jones. ""We continue to take a measured approach to reopening our province and this exemption is another important step forward in that process."" On the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health, the Ontario government has extended all emergency orders that have been put in place to-date under s.7.0.2 (4) of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act until May 29, 2020. The emergency orders include: Closure of EstablishmentsProhibiting Organized Public Events, Certain GatheringsWork Deployment Measures for Health Care WorkersDrinking Water Systems and Sewage WorksElectronic ServiceWork Deployment Measures in Long-Term Care HomesElectricity Price for RPP ConsumersClosure of Places of Non-Essential BusinessesTraffic ManagementStreamlining Requirements for Long-Term Care HomesProhibition on Certain Persons Charging Unconscionable Prices for Sales of Necessary GoodsClosure of Outdoor Recreational AmenitiesEnforcement of OrdersWork Deployment Measures for Boards of HealthWork Deployment Measures in Retirement HomesAccess to COVID-19 Status Information by Specified PersonsService Agencies Providing Services and Supports to Adults with Developmental DisabilitiesPickup and Delivery of CannabisSignatures in Wills and Powers of AttorneyUse of Force and Firearms in Policing ServicesChild Care FeesAgreements Between Health Service Providers and Retirement HomesTemporary Health or Residential FacilitiesClosure of Public Lands for Recreational CampingWork Deployment Measures for Service Agencies Providing Violence Against Women Residential Services and Crisis Line ServicesLimiting Work to a Single Long-Term Care HomeWork Deployment Measures for District Social Services Administration BoardsDeployment of Employees of Service Provider OrganizationsWork Deployment Measures for MunicipalitiesLimiting Work to a Single Retirement HomeWork Deployment Measures for Mental Health and Addictions AgenciesCongregate Care SettingsAccess to Personal Health Information by Means of the Electronic Health RecordGlobal Adjustment for Market Participants and ConsumersCertain Persons Enabled to Issue Medical Certificates of DeathHospital Credentialing ProcessesEducation SectorManagement of Long-term Care Homes in OutbreakExtending these orders supports the government's plan to cautiously and safely reopen businesses, services and amenities in a way that will enable the province to continue to protect the health and safety of Ontarians.

Ontario Ready to Respond to Wildland Fire Season
Measures in place to strengthen emergency preparedness while protecting fire fighters from COVID-19

May 15, 2020 11:30 A.M.

Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry


TORONTO —The Ontario government has taken additional steps to protect people and property during the wildland fire season, including an increase in base funding for emergency forest firefighting by $30.2 million, and ensuring safety measures are in place to protect Ontario's highly trained fire rangers from COVID-19.
At 12:01 a.m. on May 16, 2020, Ontario is lifting the Restricted Fire Zone (RFZ) designation that was put in place last month across Ontario's fire region.  The province will continue to assess forest fire hazard conditions and an RFZ designation may be reinstated in higher risk areas if conditions deteriorate. These restrictions are put in place in order to reduce the number of preventable human-caused fires and lower the risk of wildfires impacting the public. To help stop the spread of COVID-19 fire rangers will be required to follow the health and safety guidelines recommended by the Chief Medical Officer of Health, such as physical distancing, frequent hand washing, and daily self-assessments by staff. ""This is an extraordinary period. As we put measures in place to protect our staff and the public from the pandemic, we have been taking additional steps to prepare for the wildland fire season,"" said John Yakabuski, Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry. ""Nothing is more important than protecting the safety of people and communities across the province. Although we want people to enjoy themselves, lifting the Restricted Fire Zone designation does not mean we can let our guard down when it comes to preventing human-caused forest fires."" The province has also implemented a more aggressive approach to fighting wildland fires this season with a focus on detecting fires early, combating them with full force and keeping them as small as possible. ""Despite the challenges of these unprecedented times, Ontario's emergency management personnel have been proactively working with partners to prepare for potential evacuations due to the wildland fire season,"" said Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General.  ""Public safety remains our top priority and our Provincial Emergency Operations Centre will continue to monitor forest fire situations with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, and be ready to coordinate a response if called upon for evacuation assistance.""

Quick Facts

Human-caused fires represent approximately 50 per cent of wildland fires that occur in Ontario each year.
So far this year, Ontario has had 37 wildland fires burning 93 hectares. This is below the 10-year average of 114 wildland fires and 8,260 hectares burned to date. 
Before starting an outdoor fire, please check with your local municipality to see if a local fire ban is still in effect.

Additional seasonal, retail and household businesses must follow public health guidelines

May 14, 2020  1:30 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Today, the Ontario government announced the retailers, seasonal businesses and health and community service providers who will be permitted to open or expand their services on Tuesday, May 19, 2020 at 12:01 a.m., provided that the general trend on health indicators continues to improve as part of the first stage of the government's reopening framework. The workplaces opening as part this stage are well-positioned to put workplace safety measures in place and get more people back to work, while not overburdening public transit and other services.
The government also announced additional seasonal services and activities will be permitted to open as early as Saturday May 16, 2020 at 12:01 a.m., in time for the Victoria Day long weekend, as key public health indicators continue to show progress.                    The details were provided by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance, Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, and Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""During the last several weeks, the people of Ontario have been called on to make incredible sacrifices to help us stop the spread of COVID-19, including staying home from work, closing down businesses and going without a regular paycheque,"" said Premier Ford. ""However, we are reopening even more of our businesses beginning this long weekend. We are taking a cautious, balanced approach to our economic reopening, to protect the health and safety of everyone."" As soon as 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, May 16, 2020: Golf courses will be able to open, with clubhouses open only for washrooms and restaurants open only for take-out.Marinas, boat clubs and public boat launches may open for recreational use.Private parks and campgrounds may open to enable preparation for the season and to allow access for trailers and recreational vehicles whose owners have a full season contract.Businesses that board animals, such as stables, may allow boarders to visit, care for or ride their animal.The government's responsible and measured approach to reopening will allow business owners and service provider's time to ensure workplaces are safe for staff, consumers and the general public. Assuming trends in key public health indicators continue to improve, Ontario's first stage of reopening will begin on Tuesday, May 19, 2020 at 12:01 a.m. and will include: Retail services that are not in shopping malls and have separate street-front entrances with measures in place that can enable physical distancing, such as limiting the number of customers in the store at any one time and booking appointments beforehand or on the spot.Seasonal businesses and recreational activities for individual or single competitors, including training and sport competitions conducted by a recognized national or provincial sport organization. This includes indoor and outdoor non-team sport competitions that can be played while maintaining physical distancing and without spectators, such as tennis, track and field and horse racing.Animal services, specifically pet care services, such as grooming and training, and regular veterinary appointments.Indoor and outdoor household services that can follow public health guidelines, such as housekeepers, cooks, cleaning and maintenance.Lifting essential workplace limits on construction.Allowing certain health and medical services to resume, such as in-person counselling; in-person services, in addition to virtual services, delivered by health professionals; and scheduled surgeries, all based on the ability to meet pre-specified conditions as outlined in A Measured Approach to Planning for Surgeries and Procedures During the COVID-19 Pandemic.""We are taking a cautious, practical and reasonable approach to restarting the economy, while maintaining the health and safety of the people of Ontario as our top priority,"" said Minister Phillips. ""This will allow Ontario to emerge from this outbreak with a clear path to economic recovery that keeps people safe and healthy."" The government and health and safety associations have released more than 90 safety guidance documents to assist employers in multiple sectors, including construction, retail, facilities maintenance and manufacturing. As new sectors of the economy begin to reopen, additional resources will be made available to help protect the safety of workers and the general public. To support business-owners, workers and the economic recovery of the province, the government has launched a website to provide businesses with information on personal protective equipment (PPE) suppliers. The Workplace PPE Supplier Directory has an up-to-date list of Ontario companies and business associations that are ready to supply personal protective equipment. ""Ontario's businesses stepped up at the outset of this crisis not only to keep their workers and customers safe, but to come forward with innovative ideas and solutions that represent the best of the Ontario Spirit,"" said Minister Fedeli. ""This new website is truly a made-in-Ontario approach with Ontario businesses helping Ontario businesses."" The government continues to prioritize the needs of patients, frontline health care workers and first responders when it comes to having critical equipment and supplies to protect themselves during the COVID-19 outbreak. Businesses are encouraged to access only the PPE they need to keep their employees and customers safe. ""We will leave no stone unturned in our mission to keep workers in this province safe,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""Ontario's labour laws are clear: businesses must protect the health and safety of workers, including against workplace hazards like COVID-19. That's why our ministry has released practical safety guidelines, doubled our capacity to help people by phone and hired more inspectors. We want to ensure everyone is safe at work."" To ensure that these first actions to reopen the province are a success, the public should continue to adhere to public health measures, including practising physical distancing or wearing a face covering when physical distancing is difficult or not possible, as well as regular handwashing and staying home when ill. The Chief Medical Officer of Health will closely monitor the evolving situation to advise when certain public health restrictions, including adjustments to social gatherings can be gradually loosened or if they need to be tightened. ""Because of the collective efforts of all Ontarians, we are making real and significant progress in our battle against COVID-19, with the number of new cases each day shrinking,"" said Minister Elliott. ""As we move forward with caution, public health experts will closely monitor each stage of reopening to carefully assess the evolution of the outbreak, so we can benefit from the best practices and lessons learned across Ontario.""

These contain recommendations and tips for employers on how to keep workers and customers safe and prevent the spread of COVID-19. 
On April 27, 2020, the government released A Framework for Reopening our Province, which unveiled the guiding principles to the safe, stage-by-stage reopening of businesses, services and public spaces in Ontario. This gradual reopening is part of the first stage of Phase 2: Restart in Ontario’s Framework for Reopening our Province. 
On March 25, 2020, the government launched Ontario’s Action Plan: Responding to COVID 19, a $17-billion package with funding targeted to protect the people of Ontario and support jobs, businesses and families as part of the government’s initial response to the pandemic. 
The new Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee wants to hear directly from people and organizations from all regions and sectors to help inform the next phases of Ontario’s Action Plan in response to COVID-19. The survey, which is seeking feedback on the impacts of COVID-19 on personal finances, business supports and government relief measures, will be open until June 2020.

Ontario Marks Children and Youth in Care Day
Government reaffirms its commitment to help them reach their full potential

May 14, 2020 12:00 P.M.

Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services


TORONTO — Today, Jill Dunlop, Associate Minister of Children and Women's Issues and Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education, released the following statement to recognize Children and Youth in Care Day:
""Children and Youth in Care Day is an opportunity to raise awareness about children and youth who are in the care of a children's aid society in Ontario and to reaffirm our commitment to help them reach their full potential. It is also an opportunity to thank the staff, managers and community partners who are working on the front lines to keep children, youth and families safe, supported and healthy, especially during the COVID-19 outbreak. Because of their commitment and dedication, children and youth across Ontario continue to have access to the critical supports and resources they need. Current and former children and youth in care make tremendous contributions to our province as they demonstrate strength, bravery, and resilience each and every day. We thank them for sharing their lived experiences and ideas as we redesign and modernize the child welfare system in Ontario to ensure we build a system that gives them the quality supports they deserve. During these unprecedented times, nothing is more important than protecting the health and well-being of children and youth in care. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, our government has taken decisive action to meet the immediate needs of children and youth in care. Throughout the COVID-19 outbreak, no youth in care or former youth in care in Ontario will age out of the supports and services they are currently receiving through children's aid societies. Our government is deeply committed to providing the best care and support to children and youth in the child welfare system. Our vision is for an Ontario where every child and youth have the supports they need to succeed and thrive. Through our engagements on strengthening the child welfare system, we have heard valuable input about where the child welfare sector is now and where it should go in the future. The need for change is clear. We want all children and youth in care to know they are not alone and that we are committed to continue listening and collaborating with them and building a system that delivers the outcomes our children and youth deserve.""

Ministry of Transportation


TORONTO - The Ontario government is introducing new bus routes that will connect passengers to jobs, hospitals and other essential services in the Northwest with the launch of two new intercommunity bus services.  
Starting May 17, 2020, the Ontario Northland Transportation Commission (ONTC) will begin permanent intercommunity bus service from White River to Thunder Bay with three return trips per week. The agency will also provide new permanent intercommunity bus service from Thunder Bay to Winnipeg, starting May 18, 2020, with two return trips per week. ""People in Northern Ontario deserve access to safe and reliable public transportation that connects them to employment opportunities, medical appointments and other essential services,"" said Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation. ""Our government is working closely with the Ontario Northland Transportation Commission to fill the recent gap in the Northwest."" The expanded bus service to Winnipeg from Thunder Bay will travel along Highway 17 via Dryden and Kenora and provide stops at Health Sciences Centre Winnipeg and the University of Winnipeg. ""For too long Northwestern Ontario has been excluded from Ontario's passenger transportation network and today our government is keeping its promise to bring reliable and safe bus transportation to the Northwest,"" said Greg Rickford, MPP for Kenora-Rainy River. ""I am proud to see the ONTC connect people and communities from Thunder Bay to Winnipeg and everywhere in between.""  ""Ontario Northland is proud to be expanding our bus service across northwestern Ontario, with stops in Thunder Bay, Dryden, Kenora and Winnipeg,"" says Corina Moore, ONTC President and CEO. ""This route extends the integrated transportation system that is growing throughout the province to provide passengers with more convenient connections and direct stops at hospitals, post-secondary education institutions and other transportation providers.""

Quick Facts

Canada and Ontario Take Steps to Further Protect Farm Workers
Funding will help enhance health and safety measures during COVID-19

May 14, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs


WOODSTOCK — The governments of Canada and Ontario are investing up to $2.25 million to help farmers better protect employees and ensure the continued supply of healthy food products for consumers during the COVID-19 outbreak.
Through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership (the Partnership), the federal and provincial governments are launching the second intake of the Agri-food Workplace Protection Program to help farmers enhance health and safety measures to prevent the spread of the virus. The funding will be used for initiatives like purchasing personal protective equipment, enhanced cleaning and disinfection, and redesigning workstations. Support is also available for farmers who experience unexpected costs for housing and transportation as a result of a COVID-19 outbreak among on-farm employees. ""We care deeply about the well being of farmers and are supporting the investments already being made on farms to keep employees safe,"" said the Honourable Marie-Claude Bibeau, federal Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. ""This additional support will help Ontario farmers quickly adopt new on-farm measures and practices that follow the best public health guidance, so they can continue to focus on their critical work of feeding Canadians."" ""Our farmers and their hard-working employees play a critical role in keeping our food supply chain strong, providing us with fresh, high-quality and nutritious food,"" said Ernie Hardeman, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. ""Today's announcement is an important step in keeping our essential workers healthy and safe during the COVID-19 outbreak and beyond."" The Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) is now accepting applications and will expedite the approval process to help support workplace health and safety in the agri-food sector. Eligible applications will be received and assessed on a continuous basis, while funding is available. Today's announcement is in addition to the $2.25 million investment announced last week to help provincially-licensed meat processors implement COVID-19 health and safety measures. The Agri-food Workplace Protection Program builds on previous actions taken by the federal and provincial government to support the agri-food sector. This includes $1 million to help Ontario farmers, food processors and other agri-food supply chain partners address labour shortages, as well as $2.5 million to improve e-business opportunities for Ontario's agri-food sector. Since June 2018, both the federal and provincial governments have committed support to approximately 2,500 projects through the Partnership to help eligible Ontario farmers, processors, businesses and sector organizations innovate and grow.

Quick Facts

More information about this targeted intake and other cost-share funding opportunities can be found online at: http://omafra.gov.on.ca/english/cap/index.htm or by calling 1-877-424-1300. 
OMAFRA delivers cost-share funding for the Agri-food Workplace and Protection Program. The Partnership is a five-year, $3-billion commitment by Canada's federal, provincial and territorial governments to support Canada's agri-food and agri-products sectors.
The Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development recently released safety guidelines for employers to help protect workers, customers, and the general public from COVID-19.
Health and Safety inspectors are now working with employers in the agri-food sector to help ensure the safety of employees, including temporary foreign workers.

Province provides relief for Ontarians using the Ontario Drug Benefit Program

May 13, 2020  4:02 P.M.

Ministry of Health


TORONTO — The Ontario government is making the cost of prescription drugs more affordable. Effective today, people using the Ontario Drug Benefit Program will not be required to pay any co-payment until July 1, 2020 for any prescription of 30+ days that is now being dispensed in installments. In addition, existing and new Trillium Drug Program households can apply for an income reassessment to help reduce the financial burden for families during the outbreak.
""During these unprecedented times, our government is doing everything we can to provide additional relief for vulnerable people impacted by COVID-19,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""That's why we are taking action to help ensure Ontarians continue to have access to the prescription drugs they need, without it being a source of stress or financial burden during the outbreak.""   If a Trillium Drug Program household has experienced an income change in 2019 or 2020 of 10 per cent or more compared to their 2018 income, they can apply to have their deductible recalculated  by completing and submitting the Annual Deductible Re-Assessment Form. Eligible households who are not currently enrolled in the Trillium Drug Program and have high prescription costs can also complete and submit an application and re-assessment form by e-mail or fax.

Quick Facts

To ensure there is an adequate supply of medications in the province during COVID-19, pharmacists and physicians are dispensing 30-days or less of medication at a time, with some exceptions. 
Ontarians should call their pharmacy within 10 days before the end of their prescription for a refill and ask about delivery options if they can’t pick up the medicine themselves.

Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services


TORONTO - Today, Jill Dunlop, Associate Minister of Children and Women's Issues released the following statement regarding new measures to support people experiencing or at risk of sexual assault, gender-based violence and human trafficking during COVID-19:
""May is Sexual Assault Prevention Month, an important time to recognize those on the frontlines who are working each and every day to prevent sexual assault, gender-based violence and human trafficking. These professionals are dedicated and compassionate individuals who give selflessly to support those most in need. Clearly, these extraordinary times are creating extraordinary challenges. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak there has been an increased risk of gender-based violence for many individuals who have been staying home and practicing physical distancing for weeks now. It is crucial that Ontarians who have experienced or are at risk of sexual assault, gender-based violence or human trafficking have continued access to counselling and other critical services they need to stay safe, heal and rebuild their lives. To further support those who need and rely on these services, our government is investing $1 million to help frontline agencies adapt to remote service delivery and ensure continued operation during COVID-19. This funding will assist counselling service providers like the Assaulted Women's Helpline, who also work the Seniors Safety Line, which will receive $200,000 to develop text and online chat platforms, set up toll-free lines, provide on-demand interpreter services and hire additional staff to respond to increased call volume. Along with the $40 million relief fund for residential service providers and emergency funding for victim services we have already provided, this response fund will ensure a range of critical supports remain available at this time. This is in addition to our government's large investment of $148 million in relief funding to ensure municipalities and social service providers can better respond to COVID-19. Together with our partners across Ontario, our government remains committed to preventing sexual assault, gender-based violence and human trafficking, as well as supporting victims, survivors and those at risk of these crimes. Again, I would like to express my deep appreciation to those on the frontlines who are working tirelessly to ensure that people experiencing sexual and gender-based violence receive the support they need in this uncertain and difficult time.""

Voluntary Redeployment of Education Sector Workers During COVID-19


May 13, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


The Ministry of Education, along with trustees' associations and union representatives, have developed and endorsed a framework which will allow the temporary voluntary redeployment of eligible education sector staff, while maintaining their employment status and compensation with their school board. Voluntary redeployment is part of an ongoing provincial initiative to address staffing shortages in critical sectors during the COVID-19 outbreak.
ELIGIBLE STAFF Redeployment is voluntary and has been endorsed by all four trustees' associations and the following unions and councils of unions at the provincial/central level: Association des enseignantes et des enseignants franco-ontariens (AEFO)Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE)Education Workers' Alliance of Ontario (EWAO)Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario (ETFO)Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation (OSSTF)Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association (OECTA)Employees who are required to support Continuity of Learning in the education sector will not be eligible for temporary redeployments, such as instructional and special education teachers, and certain IT employees. Most other employees are eligible, subject to the local school board's operational needs. This includes those working in custodial and maintenance roles, children and youth services, social workers, paraprofessionals, office support staff, and educational assistants. Occasional teachers and casual education worker staff who are not currently working and potentially receiving federal supports are also eligible. REDEPLOYMENT LOCATION Education workers who register could be matched with opportunities based on their skill set, staffing needs and region. Staffing needs will vary across the province. Employers urgently seeking staffing support are hospitals, long-term care homes, retirement homes, women's shelters and other congregate care settings for vulnerable populations. Staff who volunteer to be redeployed may or may not be deployed to a location with an active COVID-19 outbreak. A temporary redeployment may be terminated at any time by the employee, the employer of the employee's home position, or the receiving employer. SUPPORTS FOR REDEPLOYED STAFF Compensation and Benefits: Employees will maintain their employment status and compensation (salary and benefits) with their school board, in accordance with their collective agreement. Health and Safety: The health and safety of all employees is a top priority. Before school board employees begin any temporary redeployment, the receiving employer will provide onboarding, training and appropriate safety equipment. Pandemic Pay: On April 25, the Premier announced temporary pandemic pay for frontline workers including a $4 per hour worked pandemic premium, and a lump sum payment of $250 per month if working over 100 hours per month. Temporarily redeployed employees can receive the temporary pandemic pay if they and the worksite meet the eligibility criteria. Childcare: Employees who are voluntarily redeployed would be eligible for emergency child care should it be necessary. Staff interested in finding out more about registration and locations of emergency childcare should contact their local Child Care Service System Mangers. HOW TO APPLY Education sector staff who wish to volunteer will receive further information from their local employers. Local school boards and local unions must first sign an agreement to permit redeployment for employees who wish to volunteer. School boards will review applications for volunteers based on their operational requirements. It may not be feasible for all staff who wish to volunteer to have their request granted.

Ontario provides further support for seniors and communities during COVID-19

May 13, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government is working together with the province's education sector to voluntarily place available employees in staffing roles needed at congregate care settings during the COVID-19 outbreak. This initiative is part of the government's ongoing efforts to redeploy broader public sector workers to areas where they are needed most, such as hospitals, long-term care homes, retirement homes, women's shelters, and homes serving those with developmental disabilities.
The details were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education, and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""It is inspiring to see our school boards, trustees, and labour leaders come together and provide education workers with the opportunity to support our frontline workers and take care of our most vulnerable,"" said Premier Ford. ""Whether it's cooking or cleaning, or supporting mental wellness, this voluntary initiative will enable our education workers to go where they're needed most during this crisis and make a difference in people's lives and in their communities."" A framework was developed and endorsed by the Ontario government, trustees' associations, and almost all of the provincial union representatives that will allow the temporary voluntary redeployment of education sector employees, while ensuring they maintain their employment status with their school boards. ""Every day, Ontarians are making an incredible difference to help those most in need during the COVID-19 outbreak,"" said Minister Lecce. ""We know that we must do more to care for our seniors ― that is why this agreement is so important. It will help pave the way for more staff to be deployed to help give dignity, support, and comfort to our most vulnerable citizens. I want to thank our education workers for stepping up to help and for standing out as true leaders within our communities."" Starting later this week, subject to a local agreement of the framework, eligible education sector staff who volunteer will be able to register through an online portal and to be matched with congregate settings that are facing staffing shortages. Positions available may include custodial, maintenance, food preparation, children and youth service workers, social workers, and educational assistants. Training and appropriate safety equipment will be provided to redeployed staff. Volunteers who are redeployed will be eligible for Ontario's temporary pandemic premium and emergency child care.

Quick Facts

Those who are directly involved in the continuity of learning are not eligible for redeployment, such as instructional and special education teachers. Most other employees are eligible, subject to the local school board’s operational needs.


A temporary redeployment may be terminated at any time by the employee, current employer, or receiving employer.


Education sector staff will be provided with more information by the school board following local agreements.


The framework was endorsed in principle by all four trustees’ associations, and the following unions and councils of unions at the provincial/central level: Association des enseignantes et des enseignants franco-ontariens (AEFO), Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), Education Workers’ Alliance of Ontario (EWAO), Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario (ETFO), Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation (OSSTF) and Ontario English Catholic Teachers’ Association (OECTA).

Protecting Ontario's Children with COVID-19


May 13, 2020  9:00 A.M.

Ministry of Health


Today, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, issued the following statement about multisystem inflammatory vasculitis, which appears to be similar to Kawasaki Syndrome, in children and COVID-19:
""Recent reports in Canada and internationally indicate that there may be an increase in multisystem inflammatory vasculitis, a rare but serious multisystem inflammatory illness that impacts children who have been diagnosed with COVID-19. While the link between this inflammatory illness and COVID-19 is not confirmed at this time, we are taking immediate action to better monitor this emerging issue so that we can effectively respond to the illness and protect Ontario's children. In consultation with Dr. David Williams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, we are updating the case definition of COVID-19 to include multisystem inflammatory vasculitis as an atypical presentation in children. This will support clinicians in making clinical assessments of patients who may have symptoms, including some of the most vulnerable of patients, children. Some of the symptoms associated with this illness include persistent fever, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, as well as rash. Parents should contact their health care providers immediately if their children are having these symptoms. While we are being vigilant to monitor any situation that could be related to COVID-19, recent data in Canada indicates that the majority of COVID-19 infections in children are mild and do not require hospitalization. People under the age of 19 make up five per cent of COVID-19 cases and no Canadian children are known to have died. We will continue to assess the situation as it evolves, including how to track this illness to ensure we have access to appropriate data and information to care for young patients. As we learn more, we will determine if further actions are needed to support our response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Nothing is more important than the health and wellbeing of all Ontarians, especially our children.""

 Ontario Takes Steps to Better Protect Long-Term Care Residents and Staff During the COVID-19 Outbreak


May 13, 2020  7:00 A.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government has adopted an emergency order allowing the province to issue a mandatory management order for a long-term care home struggling to deal with a COVID-19 outbreak. This order would support the use of rapid, immediate and effective management alternatives to protect residents and staff within a home. The manager could be any person, including a corporation or a hospital.
""We are doing everything we can to fortify the iron ring of protection around our long-term care residents and the heroic frontline staff who care for them,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""By taking this step, we will be better prepared to immediately swing into action if a home is struggling to contain this deadly virus."" A long-term care home may require management assistance if they face challenges like a high number of cases among residents or staff, a high number of deaths, an outbreak that has not yet been resolved, significant staffing issues or outstanding requirements from infection prevention and control assessments. Decisions regarding when and where to assign additional management support will be made on a case-by-case basis.   ""We are incredibly grateful to long-term care operators across the province who are working tirelessly each day to contain COVID-19 outbreaks,"" said Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""This is another step we are taking to ensure homes are provided with the support they need at this challenging time to maintain the quality of care our residents deserve.""   On April 15, 2020, the government announced a COVID-19 Action Plan for Long-Term Care Homes to help prevent the spread of the virus by focusing on additional testing, containment, addressing staffing challenges and securing personal protective equipment. The province also adopted several emergency orders restricting the movement of staff between multiple homes; enabling the implementation of pandemic premium pay for LTC staff; and enabling the deployment of hospital staff to address staffing shortages and the use of Infection Prevention and Control teams. In addition, Canadian Armed Forces personnel have been deployed into five long-term care homes to provide support where significant staffing shortages are occurring.

Declaration of Emergency Extended While Ontario Gradually Reopens the Economy
New legislation will allow for more virtual or remote transactions during COVID-19

May 12, 2020  2:30 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government is extending the Declaration of Emergency under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act. This additional time will ensure the province has the necessary tools and health care capacity to contain COVID-19, while gradually reopening businesses, services, and amenities safely.
Passed during a special sitting of the Ontario Legislature today, the Declaration of Emergency has been extended until June 2. The declaration will allow Ontario to continue to enforce current emergency orders, such as restricting retirement and long-term care home employees from working in more than one facility and prohibiting events and gatherings of more than five people. Since the emergency was first declared on March 17, the government has taken over 150 actions to help protect individuals, families, and businesses from the impacts of COVID-19. A full list of emergency orders can be found on the e-Laws website, under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act. ""We are making steady progress to flatten the curve and get more people back to work safely, including our legislators, but we still have far to go in defeating COVID-19,"" said Premier Ford. ""Extending the declaration of emergency will allow us to continue to take action to protect Ontarians, while carefully and cautiously reopening more parts of our economy."" The House also passed the COVID-19 Response and Reforms to Modernize Ontario Act, 2020, which will help people conduct business while practising physical distancing by: Providing authority to address in-person attendance rules for school board trustees' meetings in regulation. This would provide the flexibility in certain emergency situations to allow trustees to meet virtually during school closures;Enabling corporations to call and hold meetings virtually, as applicable, and extending the time period in which annual meetings must be held in specific circumstances;Allowing designations of a beneficiary to be provided electronically for Retirement Savings Plans, Retirement Income Funds, Locked-in Retirement Accounts, Life Income Funds and Tax-Free Savings Accounts;Allowing electronic filing of business registration documents, and the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services to accept copies of business registration documents and e-signatures;Allowing for regulations to set out the parameters for remotely commissioning or notarizing a document;Extending, on a one-time basis for 2020, the legislated four-year period during which a Métis Nation of Ontario (MNO) election is mandated to be held to give more time to support remote voting.The Expenditure Estimates for the 2020-21 fiscal year were also tabled in the Legislature. This includes program spending to support the $17 billion announced as part of Ontario's Action Plan 2020: Responding to COVID-19 to ensure the province's health care system, communities, and economy are better positioned to weather challenges posed by the pandemic. ""Today's legislation is just one step further in the fight against COVID-19,"" said Government House Leader Paul Calandra. ""We are all eager to reopen the economy and return to work, while physical distancing remains an important reality. Today's legislation helps to modernize some of our economic and community activity and make many necessary interactions that much easier and safer.""

Ontario Marks the First Provincial Day of Action on Litter
A Reminder that Everyone Can Play a Role in Maintaining a Cleaner, Healthier Ontario

May 12, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks


Toronto - Today Jeff Yurek, Minister of the Environment, Conservation and Parks and Andrea Khanjin, Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of the Environment, Conservation and Parks released the following statement:
“Today is the first Provincial Day of Action on Litter in Ontario, a day when all Ontarians can raise awareness and take action to reduce litter and waste at home and in our communities.  During the COVID-19 outbreak, we have seen people across the province doing their part to combat the health crisis from home, or as essential service workers on the frontlines. These are extraordinary times with our focus entirely on staying safe and stopping the spread, but we must never forget the importance of preserving our environment.  When the time is right, our government will work with communities and our partners to organize litter clean-up days across the province. We know that Ontarians are eager to return outdoors, and this will be a great opportunity to reconnect with nature.  There are actions all of us can still take to put litter in its proper place while staying at home and physically distancing. Today, and every day individuals and families can reduce, prevent or divert waste, in the following ways:   Choosing products with less packaging and replace single-use food wraps with reusable storage containers. Becoming experts in what goes in the green bin and blue box. For anything that does belong in the trash, such as disposable gloves and masks, making sure garbage bags are properly tied or sealed, to keep our neighbourhoods clean and safe.  Our government is working hard to meet our Made in Ontario Environment Plan commitment to keep our neighbourhoods, parks and waterways clean and free of litter and waste. We’re expanding green bin or similar collection systems, developing a proposal to ban food waste from landfills, and supporting safe food donation. We’ve also started the process of making producers responsible for the waste they create by managing the blue box program.  Businesses across the province are also stepping up to the challenge by opening package-free shops, developing eco-friendly products such as sustainable textiles, and reducing food waste by connecting surplus food to those in need.   The Provincial Day of Action on Litter is a reminder of the importance of our greenspaces and the role we all play in maintaining a cleaner, healthier Ontario for our communities and loved ones now and for future generations.”

 Ontario Retail Stores Open for Curbside Pickup and Delivery 
Health and safety guidelines in place to protect workers and customers

May 11, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO ― Starting today, more people will be returning to work across the province as the Ontario government allows retail stores with a street entrance to offer curbside pickup and delivery. Over the weekend, garden centres, nurseries, hardware stores and safety supply stores began offering in-store purchasing. All retailers should follow available safety guidelines in order to protect staff, consumers and the general public during the COVID-19 outbreak.
In addition, provincial parks and conservation reserves will begin opening today with limited access. To start, recreational activities will be restricted to walking, hiking, biking and birdwatching. People will be able to access all parks and conservation reserves for free until the end of the month. Today's update was provided by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. ""The reopening of more businesses and provincial parks is a clear sign that we are making progress in our battle against COVID-19,"" said Premier Ford. ""We are getting more people back to work when safe to do so and laying the groundwork for a full economic recovery. At the same time, we are moving carefully and cautiously to ensure we don't put people at risk and remain ready to respond to any potential outbreaks or surges in cases."" ""As we see more positive signs on the public health front, the fight for business-owners, for workers and for families continues,"" said Minister Phillips. ""Our Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee is actively working towards the next important step, which is reopening our province so we can get the people of Ontario back on the job safely. We are all going to have to work together to get our economy growing again. And now more than ever, the Ontario Spirit will ensure we're successful in these next steps."" The Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development and its health and safety association partners have now released over 80 sector-specific health and safety guidelines, including guidelines for curbside pickup and delivery services. The Ministry of Health has also released a Guidance Document for Essential Workplaces. Business owners should use these guidelines to develop reopening plans that work for their business and protect workers, customers and the general public as the province prepares for the gradual reopening of the economy. ""Throughout this period of uncertainty, businesses and people across Ontario have responded tremendously to help fight this outbreak,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""Today, businesses can offer curbside pickup and delivery, if they follow appropriate safety guidelines. This is the next step forward in safely and methodically re-opening our economy, so that we can return to the path of economic prosperity and renewal."" ""Hardworking families and small businesses have shown remarkable resiliency in navigating the challenges brought on by COVID-19,"" said Prabmeet Sarkaria, Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction. ""The guidelines we put in place for deliveries and curbside pickup are helping Ontarians access the things they need, while laying the groundwork for the economic recovery ahead."" Easing restrictions on retail stores is aligned with the first phase of the government's Framework for Reopening our Province, Protect and Support, which allows for businesses that can operate safely to do so. The Framework also includes guiding principles for the safe, gradual reopening of businesses, services and public spaces, and sets out the criteria Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health and health experts are using to advise the government on adjusting or loosening public health measures. ""Together, we have made tremendous progress in our shared battle against COVID-19,"" said Minister Elliott. ""There is still work to be done. Each of us needs to keep up the fight by continuing to practise physical distancing, frequent handwashing and staying home when ill. Let's continue to do our part.""

Ontario Helps Build, Repair and Replace Municipal Roads and Bridges
Province supports 24 local communities to keep families safe and goods moving

May 11, 2020 10:30 A.M.

Ministry of Transportation


The Ontario government is providing $30 million to build a safer and more reliable transportation system that will help keep goods moving and better connect communities across the province.
The 2020-21 Connecting Links program will support 24 municipalities across the province to help them build, repair or replace municipal roads and bridges that connect two ends of a provincial highway through a community or to a border crossing. ""We understand that the maintenance and repair costs of roads and bridges places a heavy burden on our municipal partners,"" said Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation. ""That is why we continue to support our local communities with investments that will keep families safe, goods moving, and drive economic growth and job creation."" The funding will support three bridge repairs, 10 resurfacing projects, seven reconstruction projects, and four detailed design projects to prepare for further infrastructure investments. Connecting Link projects are reviewed based on technical need and safety considerations such as the condition of the connecting link bridge and road, need for repair in the near term and cost effectiveness. Eligible municipalities are also encouraged to apply for funding for the 2021-22 Connecting Links Program, which will be open to applications later this year.

Quick Facts

The Connecting Links program is delivered through the Ministry of Transportation. The funding covers up to 90 per cent of eligible project costs, to a maximum of $3 million. Eligible costs include the design, construction, renewal, rehabilitation and replacement of connecting links.
In Ontario, there are a total of 352 kilometres of connecting links, with 70 bridges in 77 municipalities.

Ministry of Education


TORONTO — Today, Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education, issued the following statement to encourage school boards to proceed with celebrations of student achievement subject to health and safety limitations during the COVID-19 outbreak:
""Students have worked incredibly hard this school year, and we know that the COVID-19 outbreak has forced some schools to cancel or delay important milestones to recognize student achievement, such as prom and graduation ceremonies. Although we are making great efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 in Ontario, it may still be some time before schools and boards are able to offer the kinds of ceremonies and traditions in the same way they have in previous years.  I spoke directly to many graduating students and their parents. Their stories have moved me to act. I firmly believe Ontario students deserve this positive conclusion to their academic journey, even if ceremonies are delayed.  Despite this uncertainty, I am encouraging boards to reschedule these events based on input from local medical officers of health. In some cases, this might mean facilitating graduation ceremonies and proms during the summer or fall when it is safe to do so. These are important events for all students and their families. While students in Ontario have been incredibly flexible and eager in the transition to Learn at Home, we know that the support of their parents and guardians has been critical in rapidly shifting toward a newer model of learning. Students and parents deserve to celebrate many of these critical milestones — especially graduation ceremonies — and I expect boards to preserve these opportunities to proudly recognize the incredible success and achievement resulting from the hard work of our students.""

""People are eager to enjoy the warmer weather, stretch their legs and reconnect with nature,"" said Minister Yurek. ""In consultation with our health experts, we're working to slowly phase-in the opening of Ontario Parks in a measured way to ensure the health and safety of visitors and staff. People should take note that not all amenities will be open and plan accordingly."" Over the next several weeks, Ontario Parks' staff will be conducting critical maintenance and other parks start-up procedures, so that more recreational activities and facilities will be available when it is safe to do so.

Ontario Enables School Board Employees to Be Voluntarily Redeployed to Congregate Care Settings
Emergency order would help alleviate critical staffing shortages during COVID-19

May  9, 2020  9:30 A.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government has approved an emergency order that would enable available school board employees to be voluntarily redeployed to congregate care settings during the COVID-19 pandemic, including hospitals, long-term care homes, retirement homes, and women's shelters. Many of these congregate care settings are in need of staff such as custodial and maintenance workers.
""Our priority continues to be protecting our most vulnerable citizens and the dedicated staff that care for them during the COVID-19 outbreak,"" said Premier Ford. ""Many of our long-term care homes, and shelters are short of staff, so I am encouraging any available educational workers to help out if you can, because you can make a real difference in the lives of those most in need."" Under the emergency order, school boards would be authorized to develop and implement staff redeployment plans. Voluntarily redeployed staff would maintain their employment relationship with the school board and would continue to receive their compensation and other employment benefits. They would also be eligible for the provincial government's pandemic pay and emergency child care. ""While all the Trustee Associations that represent school boards, and many of the unions have confirmed their willingness to help out, there is no provision within the School Boards Collective Bargaining Act to redeploy staff to non-education employers,"" said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education. ""This emergency order opens the door for our educational workers to voluntarily go where they are needed most during this crisis."" Training and appropriate safety equipment will be provided to any educational worker who volunteers to be redeployed in a congregate setting.

Province Protecting Child Care For Parents When They Return to Work 

May  9, 2020  9:13 A.M.

Ministry of Education


TORONTO — The Ontario Government is protecting licensed child care in Ontario during the COVID-19 outbreak by ensuring parents retain access to local licensed child care, as well as EarlyON Child and Family Centres. The government unveiled a plan that, together with federal and municipal partnership, provides supports to licensed child care providers to ensure they remain sustainable and ready to open when parents return to work. 
""We are taking action to protect local child care spaces for parents as they return to work,"" said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education. ""Our plan is focused on two objectives. The first was focused on saving parents money by prohibiting child care providers from charging families during the closure period. The second objective was focused on protecting child care spaces across our province, so families can re-enter the workforce with confidence that local centres will be accessible and safe."" The plan is focused on protecting child care spaces for parents with a time-limited approach that includes:  support for fixed operating costs for eligible child care and EarlyON Centres, while providers are prohibited from charging parent fees while the Emergency Order is in effect;direct and rapid funding delivery through municipal service managers for centres that currently receive funding;a straightforward application process for child care centres that do not currently receive provincial funding by allowing them to apply directly to the Ministry of Education;direction that all child care centres will be required to maximize all available support under Canada's COVID-19 Economic Response Plan, including staffing costs retroactively to March 15, 2020, in addition to federal-provincial rental subsidy supports;red tape reduction and cost savings by waiving all child care licensing applications, renewals and revision fees;automatic extension of child care licenses set to expire during the emergency period; andprotecting existing base funding for licensed home child care agencies, and regular funding and wage enhancement grant funding for licensed home child care providers who have remained active during the emergency closure. The government's plan harnesses the full support of all levels of government and ensures the sector and the child care spaces families depend on remain available in urban and rural communities across Ontario. 

Quick Facts

The province is supporting parents during the COVID-19 outbreak by temporarily preventing child care providers from collecting payments from parents. Child care centres, with the exception of those providing emergency child care to health care and other frontline workers, were ordered closed to help prevent the spread of the virus and keep the children and child care staff safe.
Ontario is also helping parents pay for the extra costs associated with school and child care closures during the COVID-19 outbreak by providing a one-time payment of $200 per child up to 12 years of age, and $250 for those with special needs, including children enrolled in private schools.
There are over 5,500 child care centres and 124 licensed home child care agencies across Ontario. 
School Boards will not charge rent for child care centres or EarlyON centres located in schools, until the end of the closure period.

Canada and Ontario Take Additional Steps to Protect Agri-Food Workers During COVID-19
Investment will help ensure the continued supply of healthy meat products

May  8, 2020  4:25 P.M.

Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs


WOODSTOCK — The governments of Canada and Ontario are investing $2.25 million in provincially licensed meat processing plants to better protect employees and ensure the continued supply of healthy products for consumers during the COVID-19 outbreak.
Through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership (the Partnership), the first stream of the Agri-food Workplace Protection Program will provide funding to implement COVID-19 health and safety measures in provincially licensed meat plants, including purchasing additional personal protective equipment, redesigning workstations, supporting employees who require mandatory isolation, and work-site mobility and transportation. ""We are tremendously grateful to our meat processors who are providing an essential service to put food on our tables during this unprecedented time. The health and safety of these individuals on the frontlines is paramount,"" said Honourable Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. ""The funding announced today will help Ontario meat businesses with the costs of implementing the measures that follow the best public health guidance."" ""Our meat processors and their hard-working employees play a critical role in keeping our entire food supply chain safe and strong, while supplying us with fresh, high-quality, and nutritious food,"" said Ernie Hardeman, Ontario Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. ""Today's announcement is an important step in keeping our essential workers healthy and safe during COVID-19 and beyond.""  ""The health and safety of agri-food workers, and all workers across Ontario, is a top priority,"" said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""Meat processing employees are rightly being recognized as unsung heroes for their role in putting food on our tables during COVID-19. The initiative announced today is one more way we're helping them stay healthy on the job."" The Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) will begin accepting applications on May 12, 2020 and will expedite the approval process to get the necessary support to the agri-food sector faster. Eligible applications will be received and assessed on a continuous basis, while funding is available. Today's announcement follows previous actions taken by the federal and provincial government to support the agri-food sector. Those commitments include $1 million to help Ontario farmers, food processors and other agri-food supply chain partners address labour shortages, as well as $2.5 million to improve e-business opportunities for Ontario's agri-food sector. Since June 2018, both the federal and provincial governments have committed support to approximately 2,500 projects through the Partnership to help eligible Ontario farmers, processors, businesses and sector organizations innovate and grow.

COVID-19 outbreak underscores the urgent need to expand access across the province

May  8, 2020  3:30 P.M.

Ministry of the Attorney General


TORONTO — Today, Attorney General Doug Downey released the following statement on building a justice system for the 21st century that is more accessible, responsive and resilient for Ontarians:
""In an effort to keep people safe and uphold the administration of justice during the COVID-19 outbreak, the Ontario government and our justice partners established new and innovative ways of delivering justice remotely and online. Experience gained during COVID-19 underscores the urgent need to invest in technology, modernize processes and expand access to justice across the province, including in rural and remote regions. Our justice partners have joined us in acknowledging we must continue to press forward boldly toward a more accessible, responsive and resilient system that will continue to evolve long after the pandemic is over. The needs of the justice sector have changed and there is broad consensus we cannot go back to the way things were done before the public health emergency. That is why our government has made the decision not to proceed with the Halton Region Consolidated Courthouse construction project, which was in the procurement phase before the COVID-19 outbreak. This investment will be repurposed to transform and update Ontario's severely antiquated justice system, and address immediate infrastructure needs at the courthouses in Milton and Burlington. Shifting traditional investments toward innovation and new technology will move more services online and position Ontario at the forefront of building the modern justice system of the future. These responsible investments will leave a legacy of transformational benefits to all Ontarians in every region of our province, making it easier, faster and more affordable to access justice no matter where people live. This innovative new approach will allow Ontario to take concrete action for the first time in recent memory to support a truly reimagined justice system. It will move Ontario's justice system forward by decades and allow it to emerge from this public health crisis more resilient and better positioned to face future challenges. Our government will engage with justice sector partners, leaders and innovators to develop investment priorities that support new ways of delivering and increasing access to justice that spans the entire sector and province, including rural and remote communities and criminal, civil and family law fields. I look forward to sharing the outcomes of these consultations and our government's transformational vision of a reimagined, 21st century justice system later this summer. Ontario's justice system will become a leader and emerge from this crisis more resilient and better prepared to respond to future challenges in a post COVID-19 environment.""

Association des enseignantes et des enseignants franco-ontariens (AEFO) Central Agreement Now Ratified


May  8, 2020  3:00 P.M.

Ministry of Education


The central agreement with teachers represented by the Association des enseignantes et des enseignants franco-ontariens (AEFO) has been ratified by school boards and the union and agreed to by the Government of Ontario. AEFO represents approximately 11,950 members in the French-language Catholic and French-language public K-12 education sector.
The central agreement with AEFO teachers demonstrates the government's commitment to reaching deals that protect our children's futures and invest in their potential. The government also agreed to ratification of agreements with the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) on November 4, 2019, the Education Workers' Alliance of Ontario (EWAO) on February 4, 2020, the Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association (OECTA) on April 8, 2020, the Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario (ETFO) on April 28, 2020 and the Ontario Council of Educational Workers (OCEW) on May 4, 2020. These agreements were reached while respecting taxpayers, students and families, and recognizing the important contributions of frontline workers in our education system. It reflects the government's commitment to a fiscally sustainable publicly funded education system. Collective agreements between school boards and AEFO bargaining units include both central and local terms. The central terms are now resolved. In order to complete the collective bargaining process, local terms need to be reached between each school board and its AEFO bargaining units. The three-year collective agreements will be effective September 1, 2019 through to August 31, 2022. HIGHLIGHTS OF THE CENTRAL AGREEMENT Compensation and Benefits: Under the agreement, AEFO members will receive a one per cent increase to wages and salaries per year, for three years. Consistent with Protecting a Sustainable Public Sector for Future Generations Act, 2019, the agreement allows for annual inflationary increases to the funding for existing benefits so members will not experience a reduction to their existing benefits coverage, along with a one per cent enhancement.  Support for Students Fund: Total system priorities investments in the amount of approximately $13.4 million over the 2020-21 and 2021-22 school years. The fund shall be allocated to create additional teacher positions to provide school boards with more flexibility to address special education, mental health initiatives, unique learning needs as wells as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) programming. Full Day Kindergarten and Class Size: The government is committed to maintaining full-day kindergarten and retaining the existing staffing model. There are no changes to class size for grades 1-8 for the 2020-21 and 2021-22 school years. Provincial funding and legislated class size restrictions provide for an average class size of 23 for students in grades 9-12 for the 2020-21 and 2021-22 school years, which is effectively the same as the 2019-20 school year. Online Learning: The government is moving forward with a requirement that Ontario students entering Grade 9 in the 2020-2021 school year will be required to complete two mandatory online learning courses in order to graduate. Exemptions to the requirement can be made for reasons such as accommodating individual students with special education needs, students who have issues accessing technology and newcomers to Ontario who enter secondary school after Grade 9. The request for an exemption can be made by a parent/guardian or the student who has reached the age of 18 through a set process. Hiring Practices: Seniority-based hiring is maintained. Boards now have more flexibility to consider additional candidates that are not on the Long-Term Occasional Teaching (LTO) list if fewer than the prescribed number of qualified LTOs have applied. Health and Safety: Teachers will be provided with one half-day of violence prevention training in each of the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 school years.

Government continues to prepare for the next stages of reopening the economy 

May  8, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — As people gradually begin returning to work, the Ontario government continues preparing for the next phase of restarting the provincial economy through the implementation of its Framework for Reopening our Province. At the same time, the government has been supporting struggling business owners directly impacted by COVID-19 by providing tax deferrals and commercial rent relief, and by removing regulatory roadblocks.
Today, Premier Doug Ford, Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance, and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, highlighted the ongoing preparations for reopening the economy, including the work of the Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee. ""The COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on people's lives and livelihoods, but thanks to the incredible efforts of our frontline health care workers and all individuals and families, we can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel,"" said Premier Ford. ""By Monday, thousands of people will be returning to work at hardware stores, retail outlets and garden centres across the province. Now with the right framework and the right guidelines in place, we can start getting more of Ontario back to work quickly and safely."" Over the past week, the government has begun easing restrictions on workplaces that can operate safely by following public health and safety guidelines. Today, garden centres and nurseries will be able to open for in-store payment and purchases. Hardware stores and safety supply stores will be permitted to open for in-store payment and purchases as soon as 12:01 a.m. on Saturday.  On Monday at 12:01 a.m., non-essential retail stores with a street entrance can begin offering curbside pickup and delivery. These actions come as the province continues to face the unprecedented economic situation created by the COVID-19 outbreak. Today, Statistics Canada released its monthly job numbers, which showed a 689,200 decrease in employment in Ontario. ""The COVID-19 pandemic has hit Ontario's economy hard, and the latest job numbers highlight the need to get our businesses back up and running as quickly and safely as possible,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""Our government is absolutely committed to working with our business community and supporting workers to ensure that they can all emerge from this period of uncertainty stronger than before."" The province is also providing $241 million of a total $900 million to the new Ontario-Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance Program (OCECRA), with contributions from the federal government, to deliver relief to small businesses and ensure they are ready to reopen their doors when the emergency measures are lifted. Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19 also includes $10 billion in support for people and businesses to improve cash flows by providing a five-month penalty and interest-free period to make payments for the majority of provincially administered taxes, deferring the upcoming quarterly municipal remittance of education property tax, and providing up to $1.9 billion in financial relief by allowing employers to defer Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) payments for up to six months. ""We stand united as a province, shoulder to shoulder with those that have been negatively impacted by this virus,"" said Minister Phillips. ""I want them to know that we are going to beat COVID-19. The Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee is working based on the Framework to Reopen Our Province, which set out three stages, as well as core public health criteria necessary to move towards reopening. I'm confident we'll soon be in a position to take another significant step. That should give us hope."" In order to make life easier for businesses faced with the unique challenges created by the global outbreak, the Ontario government has launched the COVID-19: Tackling the Barriers online portal. Businesses working to retool their operations to produce health-related products, or those struggling to operate in this new environment of physical distancing, can submit any potential roadblocks and suggest possible solutions through the website. ""Clearly, it is not business as usual for anyone, we understand that and we want to help,"" said Prabmeet Sarkaria, Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction. ""Our government is prepared to temporarily adjust our processes, rules, and regulations to accommodate unforeseen circumstances. I encourage everyone to visit the website to identify barriers or suggest solutions so we can get the economy up and running, and people back to work, as soon as possible.""

Office of the Premier


TORONTO ― Today, Premier Doug Ford issued the following statement to commemorate the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe (VE) Day:
""On May 8, 1945, Canadians flooded the streets to cheer and celebrate as the Allied Forces liberated Europe from the brutal tyranny of the Nazi regime. During World War II, Canada played a pivotal role in securing this important victory, from its troops bravely storming the beaches of Normandy on D-Day to freeing the Netherlands from Nazi occupation. For many, the victory was bittersweet. While more than one million Canadians served during the Second World War, over 45,000 soldiers made the ultimate sacrifice. While we cannot mark this important milestone together in person, we stand united in recognizing the heroism and bravery of those who fought to defend our freedoms and protect our way of life. As Canadians, we can take inspiration from the legacy of those who blazed the trail before us. By sticking together, we can overcome any obstacle, especially during these extraordinary and difficult times. I want to take a moment to thank our men and women in uniform, both our veterans and those who are actively serving today, for keeping our country safe and free. On this day and every day, we honour these Canadian heroes who gave everything in the service of their country. For their sacrifice, we will never forget.""

TORONTO — Lisa MacLeod, Minister of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries, issued a statement in response to Ontario permitting professional sport training facilities to reopen:  
""Our top priority remains the health and safety of all Ontarians. As we prepare for a safe and gradual reopening of the economy, we have been working closely with public health experts and our professional sport teams to prepare for a return to play when it is safe to do so. I am pleased to announce that beginning today in Ontario, professional sport training facilities will be permitted to reopen, provided their respective sports leagues have established health and safety protocols in response to COVID-19.  While it is imperative to do everything we can to stop the spread of COVID-19, we need to carefully and cautiously begin to reopen the economy. This is a critical sector for Ontario as sport represents more than $12.6 billion to Ontario's economy and thousands of jobs across the province. We are pleased to see professional sports teams take a leading role in producing new rigorous protocols to keep their athletes safe, while allowing them to train in a voluntary and individualized manner.  We look forward to seeing our athletes return to play in the not-too-distant future.""

Kingston ― The Ontario government is investing over $2.2 million in Kingston to give people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness the housing and support services they need.

""Home Base Housing and its many community partners have a plan to end youth homelessness. Our long-term vision for the redevelopment of 484 Albert Street includes new supportive housing which will be affordable and will incorporate counselling and employment training opportunities for the young people in our community who will live there. The quick response from the Province of Ontario to help make this vision become reality is welcome news. We are ready to move ahead with this exciting project,"" said Tom Greening, Executive Director of Home Base Housing.

Ontario Releases Plan to Resume Scheduled Surgeries and Procedures
Hospitals must continue to maintain capacity to respond to COVID-19

May  7, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government has developed a comprehensive framework to help hospitals assess their readiness and begin planning for the gradual resumption of scheduled surgeries and procedures, while maintaining capacity to respond to COVID-19. Timelines will vary from hospital to hospital and be conditional on approval by regional oversight tables involved with planning and coordinating Ontario's response to COVID-19.
Details were provided today by Premier Doug Ford and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""We're taking a responsible and gradual approach to resuming scheduled surgeries, one that will keep our health care system strong, protect our frontline staff and patients, and ensure our hospitals stay prepared for any potential outbreak or surge of COVID-19,"" said Premier Ford. ""We're asking each hospital to come up with a plan based on their community's needs and the trends they're seeing on the ground. Together, we can get surgeries back on track as soon as possible."" The framework, A Measured Approach to Planning for Surgeries and Procedures During the COVID-19 Pandemic, contains clear criteria that must be met before hospitals can resume scheduled surgeries, including ensuring that the hospital and its region have the following: A stable number of COVID-19 cases;A stable supply of personal protective equipment;A stable supply of medications;An adequate capacity of inpatient and intensive care unit beds;An adequate capacity of health human resources; andThe availability of post-acute care outside the hospital that would be required to support patients after discharge.These criteria will ensure hospitals take a measured and responsible approach that prioritizes the health and safety of patients and health care workers, while maintaining plans to support long-term care homes in their region. ""Delaying scheduled surgeries was one of the toughest decisions we had to make as we responded to the growing threat of COVID-19,"" said Minister Elliott. ""However, it was imperative to ensure our readiness to protect the health and wellbeing of Ontarians as we planned for a worst-case scenario. Due to the collective efforts of everyone to stop the spread of this virus, we are now in a position where we can begin to plan for ramping up surgeries."" As a first step, hospitals will need to assess if there is adequate staffing, equipment and other resources to resume scheduled care. This assessment will be revisited on a weekly basis to reflect changing needs and requirements, including responding to any COVID-19 surges that may occur locally. The framework also sets out the criteria for prioritizing surgeries such as: A patient's condition;The type of procedure a patient requires and whether options for non-operative treatments exist;The associated risks of delaying a patient's surgery; andThe resources required in terms of personal protective equipment, medications, intensive care unit beds, and other care requirements needed after an operation.Hospitals are also encouraged to look for opportunities to improve care delivery for scheduled surgical and procedural care. This could include using services that reduce patient time spent in acute care settings, the use of virtual care, care in the community, post-op remote monitoring programs, outpatient care, and the use of e-consults services, virtual medical assessments and triaging.

Quick Facts

The criteria were developed under the advice and leadership of Ontario Health and reflects guidance from the Surgical and Procedural Planning Committee, whose membership includes a wide range of hospital leaders, health care experts and leading clinicians from across the province.

Patients requiring non-emergency care can access physician care through telephone and video services. Patients can contact their physician for details or Telehealth Ontario if they do not have a family doctor. 
Emergent or urgent surgery and procedures have been continuing on a case-by-case basis, weighing the risk of further delay of treatment against the risk of proceeding and the risk of virus transmission.

Ontario Protecting Forestry Jobs & Worker Safety During COVID-19
Province invests in worker safety to prevent the spread of the virus 

May  7, 2020 11:00 A.M.

Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry


The Ontario government is protecting people and jobs in northern, rural and Indigenous communities, while supporting long-term forest sustainability, by investing in protective measures to stop the spread of COVID-19 during the upcoming tree planting season.
Today, John Yakabuski, Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry, announced the government is making $3.5 million available to help put protective measures in place for the workers who plant trees this season. ""We are safeguarding the workers who regenerate our forests and the communities where they work during the COVID-19 outbreak,"" said Minister Yakabuski. ""This will help the industry expand existing facilities and modify operations to ensure that those helping to renew Ontario's forests can work in a safe environment. With these measures, we are also securing the planting of 70 million trees this year in Ontario's forests."" Funds will be used for larger camp facilities and additional kitchens to provide more space, as well as extra personal protective equipment, plastic partitions for transporting workers and more wash stations. Ontario's forest industry is critical to the provincial economy, generating over $18 billion in revenue and supporting approximately 155,000 direct and indirect jobs. The vital role this industry plays is especially evident during the COVID-19 outbreak, as it provides essential forest products for hygiene, food and medical supplies, as well as packaging and shipping products. Minister Yakabuski has launched virtual consultations with leaders from the forestry sector to discuss their interests and concerns as Ontario prepares to reopen the economy during the COVID-19 outbreak, within guidelines from the Chief Medical Officer of Health. Ideas from this virtual consultation will be reported into the government's new Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee. The Committee will take in this feedback to identify how best to protect and support people and jobs, restart the economy and move towards recovery across Ontario. ""The government's number one priority remains the health and well-being of the people of Ontario, even as we restart the economy and drive subsequent recovery,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance and Chair of the Committee. ""People across Ontario need to know they can count on their elected officials as we move forward. That's why we're working with all partners and doing everything we can to understand what's needed to continue to protect and support people and our economy in the coming weeks, months and years."" These consultations reflect a Team Ontario approach, working across parties and with experts, local leaders and people across Ontario. ""It is so important to hear directly from forestry stakeholders on the economic impact of COVID-19 and listen to their needs and priorities,"" said Minister Yakabuski. ""By working together with our partners in the forest sector, we can support a careful, stage-by-stage approach to loosening emergency measures and reopening Ontario's economy.""

Quick Facts

The forest industry has been identified as an essential sector; providing essential forest products for hygiene, food and medical supplies, as well as packaging and shipping products.
Reforestation is a crucial part of sustainable forest management. Tree planting normally begins in May in central and northern Ontario. Ontario’s forest sector plants approximately 70 million trees annually to help regenerate Ontario’s forests.
On March 25, 2020, the government launched Ontario’s Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19. The first phase of the government’s response, it is a $17 billion package with funding targeted to help families and a variety of sectors across Ontario.

Retailers to follow health and safety guidelines 

May  6, 2020  1:30 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO ― The Ontario government is allowing all retail stores with a street entrance to provide curbside pickup and delivery, as well as in-store payment and purchases at garden centres, nurseries, hardware stores and safety supply stores. The business owners should review the health and safety guidelines developed by the province and its health and safety association partners.
Today's announcement was made by Premier Doug Ford, Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance, and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""We haven't been sitting on our hands. Whether it's releasing our framework for reopening or putting in place the workplace safety guidelines needed to help businesses adapt to the new environment, we've been laying the groundwork for the safe, measured, and gradual reopening of our province,"" said Premier Ford. ""As the trends improve, we can move forward with reopening more and more of our economy and getting people back to work."" As early as Friday, May 8 at 12:01 a.m., garden centres and nurseries will be able to open for in-store payment and purchases, operating under the same guidelines as grocery stores and pharmacies. Hardware stores and safety supply stores will be permitted to open for in-store payment and purchases as soon as 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, May 9. On Monday, May 11 at 12:01 a.m., retail stores with a street entrance can begin offering curbside pickup and delivery, in accordance with the Ministry of Health's Guidance Document for Essential Workplaces and occupational health and safety requirements. In addition to easing restrictions on retail, the government is also expanding essential construction to allow below-grade multi-unit residential construction projects like apartments and condominiums to begin and existing above-grade projects to continue. This will help clear the way for the housing and jobs our economy will need to support economic recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak. Businesses must follow public health measures and should review the workplace safety guidelines, such as promoting physical distancing and frequent handwashing, sanitizing surfaces, installing physical barriers, staggering shifts, and using contactless payment options to stop the spread of COVID-19. ""It's due to the progress we have made collectively to slow the spread of COVID-19 that we are able to see a gradual easing of restrictions, allowing certain businesses to reopen safely,"" said Minister Fedeli. ""During this period, we must move cautiously and strike the right balance between getting people back to work and preventing further outbreaks. Protecting the safety of staff, customers and the general public is our number one priority."" The Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development, in partnership with Ontario's health and safety associations, has released over 60 sector-specific health and safety guidelines, including guidelines for curbside pickup and delivery services. Business owners should review the guidelines and consult with local public health officials to ensure they have the information they need to protect workers, customers and the general public as the province prepares for the gradual reopening of the economy. ""Small businesses across Ontario have done their part to help slow the spread of COVID-19,"" said Prabmeet Sarkaria, Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction. ""I encourage all business owners to learn the new health and safety guidelines, so when it comes time to reopen you will be prepared to hit the ground running and provide the services we all count on every day."" The government's Framework for Reopening our Province, which was released on April 27, 2020, includes guiding principles for the safe, gradual reopening of businesses, services and public spaces, and the criteria Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health and health experts are using to advise the government on the loosening of public health measures, including emergency orders. ""The health and safety of every Ontarian will always be our top priority as we continue planning for the next phase of our fight against COVID-19,"" said Minister Elliott. ""Together, each of us have put in tremendous effort to stop the spread, and because of these collective efforts we have made tangible progress. More than ever, we need to continue practicing physical distancing while we slowly and carefully reopen Ontario's economy.""

That's why we are providing virtual mental health supports, allowing people to get the help they need while still physically distancing."" The province has also established a Mental Health and Addictions COVID-19 Response Table, led by the Mental Health and Addictions Centre of Excellence at Ontario Health, to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on access to public mental health and addictions services. Its members include representatives from across Ontario's mental health and addictions sector, who are working collaboratively to focus on maintaining services during the outbreak. The Response Table is identifying concerns and implementing quick solutions, supporting virtual care strategies, sharing best practices, and connecting with other COVID-19 regional and provincial tables to ensure any issues impacting the province's mental health and addictions system are quickly resolved.  ""Ontario's mental health and addictions organizations are working around-the-clock to ensure individuals and families have access to the critical mental health and addictions supports they need,"" said Minister Tibollo. ""I applaud these mental health professionals for their commitment, dedication and compassion during these unprecedented times."" At Ontario.ca/coronavirus, people can find information about the different virtual mental health and wellness options that meet their unique needs, including online therapy.

Ministry of Education


TORONTO — Today, Minister of Education Stephen Lecce issued the following statement in response to the ratification of the central agreement with the Ontario Council of Educational Workers (OCEW), the Ontario Public School Boards' Association (OPSBA), and the Ontario Catholic School Trustees' Association (OCSTA).
""I would like to congratulate OCEW, OPSBA and OCSTA for the ratification of the 2019-22 central agreement. Like our deals with the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), the Education Workers' Alliance of Ontario (EWAO), the Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association (OECTA) and the Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario (ETFO), our primary objective was to reach good deals with teachers' and education workers' unions, that will advance the priorities of students and parents. Education workers play a critical role in promoting positive learning environments for students in all corners of our province — they provide a safe and stimulating educational environment that promotes growth and learning. Our government demonstrated an unwavering commitment to reaching deals that will protect our children's futures and invest in their potential. We now have tentative central agreements with everyone and have delivered six ratified deals to date.""

OCEW Central Agreement Now Ratified


May  5, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Ministry of Education


The central agreement with the Ontario Council of Educational Workers (OCEW) has been ratified. OCEW is a council of seven unions whose members represent about eight per cent of education workers or approximately 6,900 positions, across the province, including custodial and maintenance workers, educational assistants, and early childhood educators.
This central agreement with OCEW demonstrates the government's commitment to reaching deals that protect our children's futures and invest in their potential. The government also agreed to ratification of agreements with the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) on November 4, 2019, the Education Workers' Alliance of Ontario (EWAO) on February 4, 2020, the Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association (OECTA) on April 8, 2020 and the Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario (ETFO) on April 28, 2020. These agreements were reached by recognizing the important contributions of education workers, while respecting taxpayers, students and families, and demonstrating the government's commitment to a fiscally sustainable publicly funded education system. Collective agreements between school boards and OCEW's bargaining units include central terms and local terms. The central terms are now resolved. In order to complete the collective bargaining process, local terms need to be reached between each school board and its local bargaining units. The central agreement was reached on April 4 between OCEW, the Ontario Public School Boards' Association (OPSBA), the Ontario Catholic School Trustees' Association (OCSTA), and the Crown. The three-year collective agreements will be effective from September 1, 2019 to August 31, 2022. HIGHLIGHTS OF THE CENTRAL AGREEMENT  Compensation and Benefits: Under the agreement, OCEW education workers will receive a one per cent wage increase per year for three years. Benefits plan costs will also be held to a one per cent increase in each of the three years of the agreement. Support for Students Fund: The government will fund $9,657,372 in 2020-2021 and $9,753,946 in the 2021-2022 school year. The fund will be allocated for permanent staff according to board needs, supports for students with special needs, English Language Learners, Indigenous students, and student mental health and well being initiatives. Job Security: Jobs will be maintained but may vary through attrition, changes in student enrolment, school closures, and other factors. Reducing absenteeism and sick leave usage: The agreement includes a requirement stating that a medical certificate may be requested by the school board and shall be provided for access to the short-term disability leave. Measures also give school boards the ability to seek additional medical information relating to sick leave or short-term disability leave usage.

Ontario Significantly Increases Daily Lab Testing
Expanded testing critical to stop the spread of COVID-19

May  4, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Ontario has significantly increased testing and contact tracing capacity, allowing health experts to identify cases of COVID-19 and support efforts to stop the spread of the virus in the community, long-term care homes, and other congregate settings. In partnership with Ontario Health, Public Health Ontario, local public health units, and hospital and community laboratories, the Ontario government has developed an integrated laboratory system which has established the province as a national leader in daily testing volumes per capita.
""We've been working around the clock to establish a vast and robust testing regime, which is critical in our fight against this deadly virus,"" said Premier Ford. ""We're now exceeding our target of 16,000 tests a day, with many of those tests aimed at protecting our long-term care residents and staff. This important milestone provides a strong foundation for gradually reopening our economy and getting people back to work, while protecting the health and safety of all Ontarians."" Testing is being carried out in hospitals, long-term care homes, group homes, shelters, emergency child care centres, and other congregate settings. Once test samples are collected and received from frontline staff, patients, residents and children, labs are providing test results generally within 24 to 48 hours. On May 2, 2020, the province released updated guidance to the health sector to ensure consistency across the province, and to help guide decision-making on the testing of priority population groups. To date, Ontario has conducted over 342,000 tests, with testing results being made available to patients through the user-friendly online portal. The portal was developed to help ease pressure on frontline workers, allowing them to focus their efforts on combating COVID-19. ""Thanks to the joint efforts of this diverse group of health experts we have dramatically expanded the scale and scope of COVID-19 testing provincewide and have emerged as a national leader,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""We have met and exceeded our testing goals, which is critical to containing and limiting the spread of this new virus, both in our communities and in long-term care homes and other shared living spaces."" The new integrated laboratory system will support the province's health care system and laboratory network far beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The provincewide testing network consists of more than 20 organizations and is coordinating and leveraging the diverse expertise located throughout the province. This is being achieved through daily check-ins and processes that address operational needs, such as: Levels of supplies, expected supply consumption per day, inventory replenishment and other supply chain issuesEquipment informationTechnical capacity and advancesTest turn-around times and the shifting of test samples to laboratories that have spare processing capacityOngoing scientific and technical review of test performanceAlternative approaches to processingEmerging technologyOntario has also helped expand the capacity of public health units to conduct contact tracing and case management. Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19 provided $100 million in additional investments for public health units to support COVID-19 monitoring and testing, including funding to support enhanced contact tracing. This funding enables public health units to hire more personnel. In addition, Ontario previously issued an emergency order to provide public health units the authority and flexibility they need to make staffing decisions that support their ongoing efforts to contain the virus. With the help of volunteers, public health units have been able to expand their capacity to conduct case and contact management ― both of which are critical to stopping the spread of the virus. These include the thousands of retired nurses and medical students who have signed up through the province's website.

Quick Facts

On April 10, 2020, the province committed to expanding its testing capacity by doubling the number of tests processed each day to 8,000 by April 15, 2020 and 14,000 by April 29, 2020. 
Within 48 hours of implementation, the province’s COVID-19 Action Plan for Protecting Long-Term Care Homes significantly increased testing of long-term care staff and residents. 

The province’s COVID-19 Action Plan for Vulnerable People further expanded testing of staff and clients at group homes, homeless shelters, and other congregate settings.
Ontario has a provincewide network of 23 laboratory sites working in coordination to further increase capacity and test turn-around times for COVID-19 testing.
Ontario is now a leader in Canada in daily testing volumes per capita. Recent expansion of testing has the province’s per capita testing ahead of Alberta, British Columbia and Quebec.

Ontario Continues to Support Mental Health Needs During COVID-19


May  4, 2020  9:00 A.M.

Ministry of Health


Today, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services, Michael Tibollo, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, and Jill Dunlop, Associate Minister of Children and Women's Issues, released the following statement to acknowledge Mental Health Week:
""During this unprecedented time in Ontario, many people are facing great challenges as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. During Mental Health Week this year, we are dedicated to raising awareness around an issue that affects over one million Ontarians each year. Our government recognizes many Ontarians are experiencing increased anxiety because of COVID-19 and are worried about their health, the health of their family and friends, and the future of their livelihoods and are feeling anxious in physical isolation. We want to help those who need support and have taken immediate action to ensure everyone can access the high-quality care they expect and deserve. Recently, our government announced up to $12 million in emergency funding to immediately expand online and virtual mental health supports. This brings additional access to care for people across the province and specific services to our frontline heroes. We know maintaining physical distancing can be stressful for many people across the province. Just as it is critical that Ontarians heed the advice of our public health experts to stay at home and maintain safe physical distancing, it is critical that we continue providing everyone with the supports they need to stay both physically and mentally healthy. Ontario's community mental health and addictions sector is working hard every single day to continue delivering services to people in need. We thank them all for their efforts and we will continue working collaboratively with them to identify further opportunities for investments to ensure all Ontarians have access to supports. This week also marks Maternal Mental Health Week and Children's Mental Health Week, which coincides with National Child and Youth Mental Health Day on May 7. The mental health of all children and youth in Ontario is of great importance. That is why we have recently expanded programs, such as BounceBack, and have provided emergency funding to Kids Help Phone, to further support children and youth who are struggling with their mental health. Ontario also launched a Roadmap to Wellness: A Plan to Build Ontario's Mental Health and Addictions System, which provides a clear path forward toward offering Ontarians easier access to standardized, high-quality care and supports in communities across the province. As we implement this plan, we will continue listening and collaborating with our partners to ensure it works for all Ontarians. We are committed to creating an Ontario where everyone is fully supported in their journey toward mental wellness. While you are staying home, we urge you to stay in touch with each other, and to reach out for help when you need it and to those who may be struggling. Even if we cannot be close physically, we are all in this together.""

Ontario Ready to Respond to Spring Flooding Season 
Province and Partners Develop Further Preparedness Measures for Communities at Risk

May  2, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government has been actively working with federal and municipal governments, First Nations partners, and non-governmental organizations to prepare and respond to any flooding situation across the province during the COVID-19 outbreak.
As part of Ontario's flood preparedness planning, the province has been working with the federal government, municipalities and First Nations partners to develop evacuation plans. Recognizing the impact of COVID-19 on municipalities this year, Ontario is taking the lead on identifying suitable locations to host evacuees and to minimize the reliance on municipal resources for various supports, including health care and social services. As a result, the province has taken steps to ensure that provincial, federal and non-governmental resources, such as the Canadian Red Cross, can be deployed to minimize the burden on local communities as much as possible. The flooding update was provided today by Premier Doug Ford, John Yakabuski, Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry, Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General, and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""During these unprecedented times, our government is prepared for any scenario, and that includes the spring flooding season,"" said Premier Ford. ""By working together with our federal, municipal, and First Nations partners and putting our provincial flooding strategy into action, we have taken the critical steps needed to help keep people and communities safe."" Ontario has also been engaging with the federal government to support First Nations communities staying on their lands as long as it is safe to do so, including where First Nations community members would be temporarily relocated to higher and safer grounds within their own communities. Relocating community members from reserve to traditional hunt camps or other remote sites also addresses concerns around the potential spread of COVID-19 to these vulnerable communities. ""Our staff are closely monitoring ongoing flooding risks across the province and working with partners and communities on any areas of concern,"" said Minister Yakabuski. ""We are ready to respond to any requests for sandbags during this very challenging time. We also continue to work with our partners to advance the important long-term initiatives outlined in Ontario's Flooding Strategy, which will help us become more resilient to flooding events in the years to come."" Current provincial projections show a moderate-to-high risk of flooding for northern Ontario and the James and Hudson Bay coasts, where staff are closely monitoring all major tributaries in anticipation of ice breakup, expected to begin in early May. As of April 30, 2020, surveillance flights have begun across the Far North to monitor these ice breakups, with operations based out of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry's Moosonee Field Office. There is also a risk of shoreline flooding from snow melt in southern Ontario along the Great Lakes. The province's Surface Water Monitoring Centre in Peterborough continues to monitor water levels in other areas at risk throughout the province, including communities in the Ottawa Valley and along the Great Lakes. ""Thanks to the extraordinary efforts of our emergency management personnel and partners, we will be able to safely evacuate Northern communities and provide for their needs until they can safely return home,"" said Solicitor General Jones. ""We continue to monitor flood risks and we are assessing all necessary actions to maintain the safety and wellbeing of communities. We will be ready to proceed with evacuations should the need arise."" ""Our government will continue to work with First Nations leadership and the federal government to ensure the safety of remote Indigenous community members during the flood season,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Indigenous Affairs. ""If or when an evacuation occurs, it will be conducted in the safest way possible, providing additional support to evacuees and northern host communities. Indigenous leaders across the province have taken critical steps to protect their communities from the spread of COVID-19 and we will continue to support those efforts through out the flooding season."" In March, the government released Protecting People and Property: Ontario's Flooding Strategy, which outlines the steps the province is taking to reduce flood risks and help Ontarians better prepare for flooding events. Actions outlined in the strategy include increasing access to current and timely information, using improved future rainfall prediction data and establishing a flood mapping technical team.

Quick Facts

Ontario works to keep people safe and secure by coordinating with other organizations to prepare for and respond to emergencies. In parallel to the work done to prepare for potential flood-related evacuations, the province is also engaged in a contingency planning process to prepare for the forest fire season.
To determine the potential for flooding, Ontario monitors flood risks on a continuous basis. This includes using weather forecasts, recorded snow depths, and stream gauge and camera data to analyze water levels and flows.
For remote far northern areas of Ontario, the province uses radar and satellite imagery, surveillance flights and Indigenous community knowledge and expertise.
Ontario’s Surface Water Monitoring Centre carries out storm surge modelling and provides twice daily notifications to local conservation authorities and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry’s district offices along the Great Lakes.
Great Lakes water levels remain very high — particularly Lakes Erie, Huron, St. Clair and Superior — and this is expected to continue for the next few months. The municipalities of Chatham-Kent and Pelee both declared emergencies this year due to high levels and storm surge impacts on Lake Erie. 
In 2019-20, as part of a $1-million “Build Back Better” pilot project, the province provided municipalities that qualified for Municipal Disaster Recovery Assistance funding with up to 15 per cent above the estimated cost of rebuilding damaged public infrastructure to make it more resilient to extreme weather. Eligible projects include raising roads to provide better overland flow of water, improving bridges, and increasing the size of ditches and catch basins to increase their capacity to hold water.
The province’s updated Provincial Policy Statement (PPS), which came into effect May 1, responds to the recommendations of the report of the Special Advisor on Flooding and is part of Ontario’s Flooding Strategy. The PPS, 2020 acknowledges the role of the province, planning authorities and conservation authorities in working together to mitigate the risks associated with natural hazards, including the impacts of a changing climate.
As part of Ontario’s Action Plan: Responding to COVID 19, the government committed $4.3 million to support emergency planning and management in remote First Nations in the event that these First Nations are forced to evacuate during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Ontario Providing Support for Industrial and Commercial Electricity Consumers During COVID-19
Businesses to See Temporary Relief starting from April 2020

May  1, 2020  3:30 P.M.

Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines


TORONTO - Through an emergency order passed today, the Ontario government is taking steps to defer a portion of Global Adjustment (GA) charges for industrial and commercial electricity consumers that do not participate in the Regulated Price Plan for the period starting from April 2020. This initiative is intended to provide companies with temporary immediate relief on their monthly electricity bills in April, May and June 2020. The government intends to keep this emergency order in place until May 31, 2020, and subsequent regulatory amendments would, if approved, provide for the deferral of these charges for June 2020 as well.
This relief will prevent a marked increase in Global Adjustment charges due to the low electricity demand caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. Without this emergency order, a small industrial or commercial consumer (i.e., Class B) could have seen bills increase by 15 per cent or more. This emergency order will hold GA rates in line with pre-COVID-19 levels. ""Ontario's industrial and commercial electricity consumers are being impacted by COVID-19. They employ thousands of hardworking Ontarians, and we know this is a challenging time for them,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines. ""This would provide immediate financial support for more than 50,000 companies when they need it most: as they do their part to stop the spread of COVID-19 and as they prepare to help get our economy moving again.""

Quick Facts

The GA rate for smaller industrial and commercial consumers (i.e., Class B) has been set at $115 per megawatt-hour, which is roughly in line with the March 2020 value. Large industrial and commercial consumers (i.e., Class A) will receive the same percentage reduction in GA charges as Class B consumers.
Subject to the approval of subsequent amendments, deferred costs would be recovered over a 12-month period beginning in January 2021.

Emergency orders issued to help better manage health care resources 

May  1, 2020  3:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Today, the Ontario government issued new temporary emergency orders under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act to support the immediate needs of the province's hospitals and health care workers so they can better manage critical health care human resources during COVID-19.
""By taking these steps today, we are improving flexibility for our hospitals and health care workers so they can focus more of their time and resources on providing patient care and stopping the spread,"" said Premier Ford. ""We will do whatever it takes to ensure our frontline health care heroes are safe and have everything they need to do their jobs more efficiently.""   The new temporary emergency orders issued today will: Give hospitals the authority and flexibility to more quickly appoint, re-appoint and grant privileges to medical and other professional staff, in order to address potential surge volumes due to COVID-19. This emergency order will allow for the reduction of administrative processes and better enable hospitals to focus operational resources on providing frontline services.Authorize coroners, registered nurses appointed as coroner investigators, and public health units to access the provincial electronic health record to help reduce demands on clinicians' time related to death investigations, reduce exposure to COVID-19 related death investigations, and improve the ability to monitor the spread of the virus.Allow registered nurses appointed as coroner investigators to complete medical certificates of death instead of a physician or nurse practitioner, giving these medical professionals more time to focus on patient care.""Extending the authority to a limited number of registered nurses, who are trained and authorized to investigate deaths, is imperative as we work to stop the spread of COVID-19,"" noted Solicitor General Sylvia Jones. ""This temporary order will help ensure clinicians remain available for patient care as well as provide respectful care of the deceased and the timely completion of medical certificates of death.""

Quick Facts

Registered nurses, currently appointed under s. 16.1 of the Coroners Act, are trained in all aspects of death investigation, including determination of cause and manner of death. Training specific to completion of the medical certificate of death will be provided with ongoing review and mentoring.
The completion of a medical certificate of death is necessary to understand the extent of infection and illness in the community.

Certain Businesses Allowed to Reopen Under Strict Safety Guidelines
Steady Decrease in COVID-19 Cases Required Before Beginning Next Stage of Reopening

May  1, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO ― The Ontario government is allowing certain businesses and workplaces to reopen as long as they comply with strict public health measures and operate safely during the COVID-19 outbreak. Those permitted to start up include seasonal businesses and some essential construction projects.
Today's announcement was made by Premier Doug Ford, Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance, Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. The Chief Medical Officer of Health has provided general recommendations on how the openings of businesses and workplaces could be implemented to support safe operations, including strict adherence to health and safety requirements. ""We are allowing certain businesses to reopen under strict guidelines because we are confident they can operate safely and adapt to the current environment,"" said Premier Ford. ""While further reductions in the spread are needed before we can begin reopening the province, we have the right framework and the right workplace guidelines in place to do so gradually and safely.""  The government, in partnership with Ontario's health and safety associations, has developed more than 60 guidelines in response to COVID-19. These sector-specific measures will help employers prepare their workplaces so they can be reopened safely and ensure workers, customers and the general public are protected. By following the proper health and safety guidelines these businesses will be permitted to begin operations on Monday, May 4 at 12:01 a.m.: Garden centres and nurseries with curbside pick-up and delivery only;Lawn care and landscaping;Additional essential construction projects that include:shipping and logistics;broadband, telecommunications, and digital infrastructure;any other project that supports the improved delivery of goods and services;municipal projects;colleges and universities;child care centres;schools; andsite preparation, excavation, and servicing for institutional, commercial, industrial and residential development;Automatic and self-serve car washes;Auto dealerships, open by appointment only;Golf courses may prepare their courses for the upcoming season, but not open to the public; andMarinas may also begin preparations for the recreational boating season by servicing boats and other watercraft and placing boats in the water, but not open to the public. Boats and watercraft must be secured to a dock in the marina until public access is allowed.""Ontario workers and businesses have shown exemplary cooperation and resilience throughout the course of this crisis,"" said Minister Fedeli. ""We're beginning to ease restrictions on select businesses as we carefully and methodically re-open Ontario's economy and continue together on our path to renewed prosperity."" Although certain businesses are being permitted to reopen, it is critical that people continue to stay home, practise physical distancing and only go out for essential reasons, to pick up groceries, prescriptions or to keep a medical appointment. It is through these simple actions that Ontario is making progress to stop the spread of COVID-19.   ""As we begin planning for the next phase of our fight against COVID-19, Ontarians should continue to stay home as much as possible to ensure we stop as quickly as possible the spread of this virus,"" said Minister Elliott. ""While we have made tremendous progress in our shared battle against this new virus, we are not done yet. We need to keep up the fight by continuing to practise physical distancing and good hygiene habits."" On April 27, the government released A Framework for Reopening our Province, which outlines the criteria Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health and health experts are using to advise the government on the loosening of emergency measures, as well as guiding principles for the safe, gradual reopening of businesses, services and public spaces. While the government remains in Phase One of Ontario's Action Plan in response to COVID-19, Protect and Support, allowing certain businesses and workplaces to open under strict guidelines demonstrates the government's commitment to balance the needs of the economy with the health and safety of the people of Ontario. ""People's efforts are paying off and we can see a light at the end of the tunnel,"" said Minister Phillips. ""Our response has always been based on the current status of the outbreak in our province, and on what makes sense for Ontario. To be clear ― we haven't moved into the reopening phase of our response to COVID-19. Not yet. But based on the best public health advice available to us, we are a step closer.""

$11,600 in Fines for Illegal Migratory Bird Hunt


April 30, 2020  4:00 P.M.

Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry


The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry wants to remind migratory bird hunters that proper permits are required and that the rules regarding baiting and shot size are in place to protect the resource for future generations.
Five men have been fined a total of $11,600 for migratory bird hunting-related offences. Conservation officers launched an investigation, which included the use of a remotely piloted aircraft system, after receiving a tip from the public. Brett McLean and Guy Cooper of Mississauga, and Thomas Caravasilis of Toronto pleaded guilty to unlawfully depositing bait less than 14 days prior to the opening day for migratory birds. McLean, Cooper, Caravasilis, Thomas Davies of Gravenhurst and Lukas Timm of Orangeville pleaded guilty to hunting migratory birds within 400 metres of bait. Court heard that on September 20, 2019, a conservation officer witnessed Cooper and McLean placing bait in a pond near the Town of Gravenhurst. The following day, conservation officers witnessed the hunters engaged in migratory bird hunting on the same pond. Further investigation found that Davies was hunting without a permit and using toxic shot. He also failed to carry the required accreditation while hunting with a firearm. Justice of the Peace Doug Conley heard the case in the Ontario Court of Justice, Bracebridge, on March 4, 2020. MNRF conservation officers continue to patrol and protect our natural resources during the COVID-19 outbreak and would like to remind everyone that by respecting seasons, sanctuaries, bag and possession limits we all help ensure our natural resources stay healthy. Visit Ontario's website to learn more about how the province continues to protect Ontarians from COVID-19.

Ontario Providing Employers with Workplace Safety Guidelines 
Province Takes Critical Steps to Help Businesses Adapt to New Environment

April 30, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO ― The Ontario government is ensuring employers have the safety guidelines they need to protect workers, customers, and the general public from COVID-19 as it prepares for a gradual reopening of the provincial economy.
The government safety guidelines released today will provide direction to those working in manufacturing, food manufacturing and processing, restaurant and food service, and the agricultural sector. These measures build on more than 60 guidelines developed by Ontario's health and safety associations in response to COVID-19 for various sectors such as retail, health care, construction, transportation, police services, firefighters, and transit employees.  ""We all want to reopen our businesses, services and favourite places across the province, but we must do it in a safe and responsible way,"" said Premier Ford. ""That's why we are providing clear guidelines to employers, with practical measures to help them keep staff and customers safe while preventing the spread of COVID-19. By taking these steps, we will be prepared to get people back to work when the time is right."" These new sector-specific guidelines feature recommended actions employers can begin to plan for as they prepare to adapt to the new reality during COVID-19, including: Ways to ensure appropriate physical distancing, like eliminating pay-at-the-door options, holding team meetings outdoors, staggering shift times and using ground markings and barriers to manage traffic flow.Changes to the workplace, like installing plexiglass barriers, increasing the air intake on building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems to increase air flow, and using boot sanitizing trays.Promoting proper workplace sanitation, providing personal protective equipment, substituting dry dusting with vacuuming, ensuring customer-facing staff are given hand sanitizer, providing a place to dispose of sanitizing wipes, and enforcing handwashing before and after breaks.The government is also issuing posters to promote a variety of useful safety tips. The posters offer helpful advice on physical distancing and sanitation. They are downloadable from the Ontario.ca website so employers can print and post them in their workplaces. ""We are truly in extraordinary times and employers and employees are facing situations they have never had to deal with before,"" said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""It is incumbent on our government, with the advice of health officials, to provide the guidance and tips outlining the safest ways to reopen workplaces and help prevent the spread."" The government will work with Ontario's health and safety associations to bring forward additional workplace safety guidelines for more sectors in the coming days and weeks. Starting this week, 58 new inspectors will join the hundreds of existing provincial labour inspectors on the ground. The inspectors, which include workers from the Technical Standards and Safety Authority (TSSA) and the Ontario College of Trades (OCOT), will be tasked with communicating COVID-19 safety guidelines to essential workplaces or enforcing emergency measures, including physical distancing and the closure of non-essential businesses. ""Protecting the health and well-being of Ontarians during the COVID-19 outbreak has been and will always be our government's number one priority,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""These guidelines will help employers begin to plan for their safe reopening based on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health and in alignment with our framework to ease public health measures and restart our economy. In doing so, we can ensure we continue to stop the spread of COVID-19 and keep workers safe."" ""Our province's businesses have made great efforts to protect the health and safety of their workers throughout the course of this pandemic,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""These new guidelines will help employers continue to protect their staff and customers as we begin to carefully and methodically re-open our economy, so that we can return Ontario to prosperity in the safest way possible."" The government is committed to a careful, stage-by-stage approach to loosening emergency measures and reopening Ontario's economy. Public health and workplace safety will remain the top priority, while balancing the needs of people and businesses.

Ontario To Help More Essential Staff During the COVID-19 Outbreak

April 29, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO ― The Ontario government is further expanding the list of essential workers eligible to receive free emergency child care during the COVID-19 outbreak. Those who will benefit include people who work in the food supply chain, retirement homes, grocery stores and pharmacies, and certain federal employees, including the military. Since emergency child care was introduced last month, almost 100 child care centres have reopened along with 40 Licensed Home Child Care Agencies in communities across the province.
The announcement was made today by Premier Doug Ford, Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education, and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""While our frontline workers are looking after us, we need to make sure we're looking after them and their families,"" said Premier Ford. ""Providing emergency child care for our essential workers gives parents one less thing to worry about when they're on the job saving lives, protecting us, or keeping shelves stocked with food and necessities."" On March 22, 2020, the government announced an emergency order directing certain child care centres to reopen subject to physical distancing constraints as part of the province's support for health care and other frontline workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. The list of essential workers eligible to access emergency childcare has now been further expanded. To accommodate more children, 37 additional centres have been approved and will be reopening in the coming days. ""We are providing emergency child care to more frontline workers because in these unprecedented times, we will do whatever it takes to keep families safe and supported,"" said Minister Lecce. ""They are making tremendous sacrifices every day, and we will be there for them every step of the way."" The additional frontline workers who can now access emergency childcare services include: Workers in grocery stores and pharmaciesTruck drivers (driver's licence Class A and Class D)Workers in the food supply chain, including food processingWorkers in retirement homesAuxiliary workers in health care settings, including cooks and cleaning staff in hospitals and long-term care homesInterpreters and intervenors who support people who are deaf, deafened, hard of hearing and deafblindMinistry of Natural Resources and Forestry (MNRF) emergency personnelProvincial officers and onsite staff in Ontario courtsCanadian Armed Forces and Department of National Defence staff working in OntarioAdditional workers supporting public safety and correctional servicesThe Ontario Ministry of Education is working with Consolidated Municipal Service Managers (CMSM) and District Social Services Administration Boards (DSSAB) in their role as service system managers for early years and child care, as well as First Nations, to implement emergency child care centres in communities across the province. Ontario will continue to monitor local needs to ensure frontline staff can continue to work and will communicate more details as the situation evolves. A list of emergency child care centres is available on Ontario.ca/coronavirus.

Quick Facts

The list of essential workers eligible to access emergency childcare was previously expanded on April 17, 2020 to include those who assist vulnerable communities, emergency response and law enforcement sector staff, more health and safety workers, and certain federal employees.
Child care for members of the Canadian Armed Forces and employees of the Department of National Defence who are working in Ontario would be provided by a Military Family Resource Centre.
The government has established strict guidelines for each centre and the local Medical Officer of Health must be consulted and supportive of protocols and actions in place.
All sites are also required to have a protocol in place in the event that a child, parent or staff member at the site is exposed to COVID-19.

Government Takes Further Action to Drive Accountability and Confront Racism

April 28, 2020  5:40 P.M.

Ministry of Education


TORONTO - Today, Minister of Education, Stephen Lecce, announced he has appointed Arleen Huggins to conduct an investigation into the Peel District School Board's compliance with the Minister's binding Directions to the Board issued on March 13, 2020.
""We expect our school leaders - trustees, senior administration, and educators - to ensure all students are learning in safe and inclusive classrooms,"" said Minister Lecce. ""This is why effective, transparent, and accountable school board governance is essential to the success and well-being of students in Ontario's publicly funded schools."" Ms. Huggins is a practising lawyer with thirty years experience in employment law, human rights law, workplace harassment and discrimination investigations and commercial litigation. She is a former President of the Canadian Association of Black Lawyers and a Former Chair of both the Canadian Bar Association Standing Committee on Equity and the Ontario Bar Association Equal Opportunity Committee.  Ms. Huggins was also on the founding Board of the African Canadian Legal Clinic and has served on the Doctors Without Borders Human Resources Committee and the federal Judicial Appointments Advisory Committee (JAAC) for the GTA. With the issuance of 27 binding Directions to the Board on March 13, 2020, the Minister provided clear direction with specific timelines and deliverables to address systemic discrimination, particularly anti-Black racism, as well as dysfunctional governance, leadership and human resources practices within the PDSB. ""When it comes to confronting racism and discrimination, I will not accept delay or inaction,"" added Minister Lecce. ""The message I am sending is — do better. Our kids deserve better. And I will do whatever it takes to ensure these issues are addressed immediately and effectively.""  The Ontario Government is committed to ensuring PDSB complies with the Minister's binding Directions so that parents, students and the community get the positive change that they need and deserve. Ms. Huggins will deliver her report to the Minister on or before May 18, 2020.

Quick Facts

Last fall the government launched a review of PDSB to ensure an effective board governance that promotes equity, increases accountability, transparency and safeguards the success and well-being of all students. 
The Minister is directing this investigation pursuant to the authority under section 230 of the Education Act, as a result of concerns that the PDSB has contravened his binding Direction that all members of the Board, the Director of Education, and Associate Directors of Education undertake mandatory mediation (Direction 1).
Direction 1 further requires the PDSB to satisfy the Minister of Education that the Board can work together with the Director and Associate Directors of Education to provide good governance in the interests of all students of the PDSB. 
The Ministry has concerns about the PDSB’s ability to provide good governance and that the lack of co-operation among the members of the board, and with and among the senior leadership team, might result in a contravention of other Ministerial directions, specifically:  
 Direction 6 (mandatory trustee learning plan)
Direction 7 (composition of Board committees)
 Direction 8 (Director’s performance appraisal)
Direction 12 (Human Rights Commissioner’s independence of office)
 Direction 16 (Board anti-racism policy)

The PDSB is responsible for 257 schools in Brampton, Mississauga and Caledon, and over 155,000 students representing a rich array of racial, ethnic, linguistic and religious backgrounds.

Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario (ETFO) Central Agreements Now Ratified


April 28, 2020  2:00 P.M.

Ministry of Education


The central agreements with the Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario (ETFO) have been ratified by school boards and the union, and agreed to by the Government of Ontario. ETFO represents approximately 2,724 education workers in the English-language public and English-language Catholic K-12 education sector, and more than 83,000 elementary teachers in the English-language public K-12 education sector.
These central agreements with ETFO Teachers and Education Workers demonstrate the government's commitment to reaching deals that protect our children's futures and invest in their potential. The government also agreed to ratification of agreements with Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) on November 4, 2019, the Education Workers' Alliance of Ontario (EWAO) on February 4, 2020, and the Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association (OECTA) on April 8, 2020. These agreements were reached while respecting taxpayers, students and families, and recognizing the important contributions of front-line workers in our education system. They reflect the government's commitment to a fiscally sustainable publicly funded education system. Collective agreements between school boards and ETFO include both central and local terms. The central terms are now resolved. In order to complete the collective bargaining process, local terms need to be reached between each school board and its ETFO Teacher and Education Worker bargaining units. The three-year collective agreements will be effective September 1, 2019, through to August 31, 2022. HIGHLIGHTS OF THE CENTRAL AGREEMENT WITH EDUCATION WORKERS Compensation and benefits: Under the agreement, ETFO education workers will receive a one per cent increase to wages and salaries per year for three years. Benefits funding will be provided as a one-time inflationary increase equivalent to 4 per cent per year at the end of the agreement. A funding increase could be provided earlier if the plan falls below certain funding thresholds. These provisions are consistent with Protecting a Sustainable Public Sector for Future Generations Act, 2019. Support for Students Fund: Total system priorities investments in the amount of approximately $0.9 million over two years beginning in the 2020-21 school year. The funds will be used to protect and enhance services and supports for students with special education needs. Professional Development/Learning: The Crown has created a one-time Priorities and Partnerships Fund (PPF) grant in the amount of $2.8 million over two years beginning in the 2020-21 school year. Funds from this PPF will be used for professional learning for education workers. Boards and local bargaining units shall meet to discuss the utilization of these funds. Class Size and Full-Day Kindergarten: There are no changes to class size for Ontario's youngest learners in junior kindergarten through Grade 3. Provincial funding, and legislated class size restrictions provide class sizes for grades 4-8 to reflect an average class size of 24.5. Address absenteeism and reduced sick leave usage: The agreement includes a measure to reduce the impact of routine medical and dental appointments during the school day. Health and Safety: Teachers will be provided with one half-day of violence prevention training in each of the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 school years. HIGHLIGHTS OF THE CENTRAL AGREEMENT WITH TEACHERS Compensation and benefits: Under the agreement, ETFO teachers will receive a one per cent increase to wages and salaries per year for three years. There is a one per cent increase to benefits funding in each year of the agreement, which may be used to supplement inflationary increases. An additional one-time three per cent increase is available if actual inflation costs are higher. These provisions are consistent with Protecting a Sustainable Public Sector for Future Generations Act, 2019. Support for Students Fund: The government will invest approximately $89.1 million over two years in government priorities, including addressing special education supports, mental health and well-being initiatives, and STEM education. Class Size and Full Day Kindergarten: The government is maintaining full-day kindergarten and retaining the existing staffing model in kindergarten and grades 1-8 for the 2020-21 and 2021-22 school years. Health and Safety: Teachers will be provided with one half-day of violence prevention training in each of the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 school years. Hiring practices: ETFO formally recognized the government's unilateral prerogative to create, amend, or revoke hiring practice regulations in the education system, including O. Reg 274/12.

TORONTO — Today, Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education, issued the following statement in response to the ratification of the central agreements with the Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario (ETFO) and the Ontario Public School Boards' Association (OPSBA), and the ETFO Education Workers and the Council of Trustees' Associations (CTA):
""I would like to congratulate ETFO, OPSBA and the CTA for the ratification of the 2019-22 central agreements. Like our deals with the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), the Education Workers' Alliance of Ontario (EWAO) and the Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association (OECTA) our primary objective was to reach good deals with teachers' and education workers' unions, that will advance the priorities of students and parents. Teachers and education workers play a critical role in promoting positive learning environments for students in all corners of our province — they provide a safe and stimulating educational environment that promotes growth and learning. Our government demonstrated an unwavering commitment to reaching deals that will protect our children's futures and invest in their potential. We now have tentative central agreements with everyone and have delivered five ratified deals to date.""

New Website Accepting Proposals for Temporarily Changing Rules and Regulations 

April 28, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government is launching the COVID-19: Tackling the Barriers website to help businesses overcome the unique challenges created by the global pandemic. Businesses working to retool their operations to produce health-related products, or those that want to continue their operations in this new environment of physical distancing, can submit any potential roadblocks to the website. The province is prepared to allow temporary changes to provincial rules and regulations in order to remove any barriers that are hindering business and negatively impacting Ontario's supply chain.
Today's announcement was made by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Prabmeet Sarkaria, Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction. ""With COVID-19, we are facing unchartered territory. As government, we must be prepared to work with businesses and show some flexibility in helping them to overcome challenges they may have never faced before,"" said Premier Ford. ""This website will allow us to listen to and support businesses as they adapt to this new environment. At the same time, it should also make it easier for businesses to retool to produce the health-related supplies and equipment that our frontline workers need."" ""During this extraordinary period, we need to do everything we can to support businesses as they struggle to operate as an essential business, or wait for the outbreak to subside,"" said Minister Sarkaria. ""Clearly, it is not business as usual for anyone, and that's why our government is prepared to temporarily adjust our processes, rules, and regulations to accommodate unforeseen circumstances. I encourage everyone to visit our new website if there are any questions or concerns."" The website builds on steps the government has already taken to help businesses respond to COVID-19, including: providing $10 billion in provincial tax deferrals, Workplace Safety and Insurance Board premium deferrals, and other business supports;providing more than $900 million in urgent relief to small businesses and their landlords through a new program, the Ontario-Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance Program (OCECRA);providing $50 million to help businesses such as manufacturers and distilleries retool so they can produce health-related products and supplies, such as ventilators, gowns, face masks and hand sanitizer;permitting 24-hour construction for critical infrastructure;permitting 24-hour deliveries in every municipality across the province to help grocery stores and pharmacies keep their shelves stocked; andallowing restaurants and bars to sell alcohol with food takeout or delivery orders.In order to help Ontario businesses focus on overcoming today's challenges, the province is also pausing or extending any existing public consultations, delaying non-urgent related consultations while the emergency situation remains in place, and considering extending deadlines for reports and audits.

Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development


TORONTO — The Honourable Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development, issued the following statement regarding the National Day of Mourning:
""Today, we observe the National Day of Mourning to honour those who have died, been injured or become ill in the course of their work. As Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development, I'm asking everyone in Ontario to take a few moments to remember those who are no longer with us, and think about those who are still living with the consequences of a workplace tragedy. The National Day of Mourning was established in 1984 to commemorate workers and their families affected by workplace accidents. It provides all of us with an opportunity to reflect on these unsung heroes who carried out their duties in circumstances they never could have imagined. This is an extraordinary year, as it brings with it the never-before seen risk of COVID-19. Clearly, this deadly virus puts us all in harm's way, especially our essential workers who have been on the front lines protecting us, caring for us and serving us since the outbreak began several weeks ago.   I am deeply saddened when I think of all of those who have lost their life due to COVID-19, including our workers and our seniors. Their lives will be celebrated, their contributions will be honoured, and their absence will be mourned. Our government is doing everything it can to make sure that workplaces are safe and workers can return home to your loved ones at the end of the day. I am committed to preventing and eliminating workplace accidents, by ensuring training and safety information is widely available, hiring more workplace inspectors and ensuring employees know they have the right to refuse to work in an unsafe environment. If a worker ever has any concerns about their safety at work, they can file a complaint with the Ministry's Health and Safety Contact Centre by calling 1-877-202-0008.   Today we're remembering those who have been killed, injured or become ill while on the job. Our ministry is continuing to develop Ontario's Occupational Health and Safety Strategy to prevent further workplace deaths, injuries and illness, and working with partners across our government to keep Ontario workers safe today, tomorrow and into the future.""

Premier and Ministers Commit to New Phased Approach for a Safe Restart and Recovery 

April 27, 2020  1:30 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Today, the Ontario government released A Framework for Reopening our Province, which outlines the criteria Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health and health experts will use to advise the government on the loosening of emergency measures, as well as guiding principles for the safe, gradual reopening of businesses, services and public spaces. The framework also provides details of an outreach strategy, led by the Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee, to help inform the restart of the provincial economy.
Details were provided by Premier Doug Ford, Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance, Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""Our top priority remains protecting the health and safety of the people of Ontario and supporting our frontline heroes as we do everything in our power to contain and defeat this deadly virus,"" said Premier Ford. ""At the same time, we are preparing for the responsible restart of our economy. This next phase of our response to COVID-19 is designed to help us map out what needs to be done, and when, to get us back on the road to recovery."" The government is planning a stage-by-stage approach to reopening the economy to ensure there are appropriate measures in place so workplaces can open safely. Public health officials will carefully monitor each stage for two to four weeks, as they assess the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak to determine if it is necessary to change course to maintain public health. Stage 1: For businesses that were ordered to close or restrict operations, opening select workplaces that can immediately modify operations to meet public health guidance. Opening some outdoor spaces like parks and allowing for a greater number of individuals to attend some events. Hospitals would also begin to offer some non-urgent and scheduled surgeries, and other health care services.Stage 2: Opening more workplaces, based on risk assessments, which may include some service industries and additional office and retail workplaces. Some larger public gatherings would be allowed, and more outdoor spaces would open.Stage 3: Opening of all workplaces responsibly and further relaxing of restrictions on public gatherings.Throughout each stage, continued protections for vulnerable populations must be in place, along with the continued practice of physical distancing, hand washing and respiratory hygiene, and significant mitigation plans to limit health risks. ""Recent public health indicators show us that we're beginning to turn a corner in the COVID-19 outbreak, while economic data, feedback from businesses and insights from our communities are outlining how we need to plan for economic recovery,"" said Minister Phillips. ""Turning on an economy after an unprecedented shut-down is not as simple as flipping a switch. We need to plan this out carefully to ensure we do not spark a sudden outbreak, undo the progress we have made and put the safety of the public at risk.""   To reopen the economy, the government will consider factors such as the risk of the spread of COVID-19 and the ability to implement protective measures to keep workplaces safe. The Chief Medical Officer of Health and health experts will provide advice to the government about easing public health measures using a range of set criteria, including: A consistent two-to-four week decrease in the number of new daily COVID-19 cases;Sufficient acute and critical care capacity, including access to ventilators and ongoing availability of personal protective equipment;Approximately 90 per cent of new COVID-19 contacts are being reached by local public health officials within one day, with guidance and direction to contain community spread; andOngoing testing of suspected COVID-19 cases, especially of vulnerable populations, to detect new outbreaks quickly.""It is because of the collective efforts of all Ontarians to stay at home and stop the spread of COVID-19 that we are able to consider plans to move into the next phase of our battle against this virus,"" said Minister Elliott. ""The Chief Medical Officer of Health has outlined some criteria he will use to advise government on when we may begin to slowly and safely ease public health measures and restart our economy. To be able to do so, we need everyone to continue their extraordinary efforts so that we can meet these thresholds and begin to move forward."" Supporting the next phases of Ontario's Action Plan, the new Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee, chaired by Minister Phillips, will be consulting with key sectors in all regions to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the provincial economy and develop a plan to move forward. The government and Members of Provincial Parliament will lead discussions with business associations, chambers of commerce, municipal leaders, the postsecondary sector, corporate leaders, small business owners, community and social service providers, Indigenous partners, Franco-Ontarians, entrepreneurs and others. The work of the committee will build on Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19, the first phase of the government's $17 billion response, that is delivering targeted relief for businesses and families across Ontario. ""The COVID-19 outbreak has had far-reaching economic impacts for businesses and communities across Ontario,"" said Minister Fedeli. ""In the face of these challenges, businesses and individuals have stepped up to support our frontline workers, produce essential equipment and keep our supply chains moving. Our plan to carefully and methodically reopen Ontario's economy will ensure that businesses are supported on our path to renewed economic prosperity.""

School Closures Extended to Keep Students, Staff and Families Safe
Students Will Still Be Able to Complete School Year 

April 26, 2020 12:30 P.M.

Ministry of Education


TORONTO — Today, Education Minister Stephen Lecce announced that all publicly-funded schools will remain closed until at least May 31, 2020, as part of an effort to keep students, staff and families safe from COVID-19.
The extension was based on expert advice from the Chief Medical Officer of Health and health officials on the COVID-19 Command Table and is part of the government's ongoing effort to stop the spread of the virus. The advice was to extend school closures for an additional period of time to permit updated modelling and data to inform next steps, given the government's absolute commitment to safety. ""We will do whatever it takes to keep our students safe,"" said Minister Lecce. ""The government is taking a careful approach which provides our medical experts the time to review the modelling and make the best decision for the safety of our students and the future of learning.""  The government took immediate action to close schools in Ontario, the first in Canada to do so. The ministry continues to monitor the evolving situation and if necessary, the closure may be extended further to protect the health and safety of Ontario's school communities. At the same time the Ontario government is taking steps to ensure learning can continue. In March the province unveiled its Learn at Home portal. It offers all students high-quality resources, featuring made-in-Ontario math and literacy resources, created by Ontario-certified educators, in both English and French. Elementary resources are designed to help young students learn at home with interactive activities that encourage participation through entertaining and stimulating digital content. High school content was designed with a focus on STEM courses and ensures core competencies and skills are reinforced. At the end of March the Ministry of Education unveiled the second phase of Learn at Home to ensure the continuity of learning for students. This included providing clarity for parents, enhancing education supports and creating opportunities for educators to connect with students. The government has also partnered with Rogers Communications and Apple to help meet the educational needs of students and families during the COVID-19 outbreak. iPads are being purchased and distributed by Ontario school boards, pre-equipped with free Rogers LTE wireless data. Apple is providing on-going support in French and English to teachers, parents and students, with a collection of resources to support learning and working from home. To date, over 20,000 iPads have been sent to targeted families in need. The free Rogers wireless data will be available until the end of June. ""Regardless of what transpires over the coming weeks, Ontario's students will be able to complete their school year with confidence,"" added Minister Lecce. ""In particular, for students in their final year, we are removing all impediments to ensure students graduate and pursue post-secondary education."" 

Quick Facts

Should schools be permitted to reopen, school employees will have access as of May 29, 2020.
The Ministry of Education will move forward to replace the remainder of Professional Activity (PA) days and examination days with instructional time, as well as the introduction of an expanded summer learning program that will focus on credit recovery, supports for vulnerable students, and course upgrading. Boards are to find solutions at the local level in keeping with this direction while upholding collective agreement obligations.
Private schools, First Nation schools, licensed child care centres and EarlyON programs will remain closed until May 6, 2020, with certain exceptions for licenced care, under an emergency order made under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, which only allows closures to be extended for 14 days at a time.
Through the Ontario Together web site, the province received more than 300 proposals from businesses, organizations and everyday Ontarians to provide solutions to remote learning while schools are closed during the COVID-19 global pandemic. Next steps will be shared soon.

Government Recognizes the Dedication and Sacrifice of Frontline Workers

April 25, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — In recognition of the dedication, long hours and increased risk of working to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, the Ontario government is providing frontline staff with a temporary pandemic payment.
This increase will provide four dollars per hour worked on top of existing hourly wages, regardless of the qualified employee's hourly wage. In addition, employees working over 100 hours per month would receive lump sum payments of $250 per month for each of the next four months. This means that eligible employees working an average of 40 hours per week would receive $3,560 in additional compensation. Those eligible to receive the payment will be staff working in long-term care homes, retirement homes, emergency shelters, supportive housing, social services congregate care settings, corrections institutions and youth justice facilities, as well as those providing home and community care and some staff in hospitals. The announcement was made today by Premier Doug Ford, Peter Bethlenfalvy, President of the Treasury Board, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""During these dark days, the Ontario spirit continues to shine through with everyday acts of heroism, courage, and compassion by our frontline workers,"" said Premier Ford. ""These people put themselves in harm's way to care for our sick and vulnerable citizens. I am truly grateful, as are the people of Ontario, for their service, and it's time we give something back to those who sacrifice so much day in and day out."" Staff providing frontline clinical services, along with those providing support services, such as cleaning and meal preparation, will be eligible to receive the pandemic payment. The additional compensation is temporary and would begin flowing immediately and continue for 16 weeks. ""The pandemic payment recognizes the valiant efforts of our frontline workers in the fight against COVID-19,"" said Minister Bethlenfalvy. ""These heroic workers are delivering critical services that support all Ontarians, including the most vulnerable members of our communities, often putting themselves or their loved ones at risk. They are saving lives and we owe them an incredible debt of gratitude."" ""It is vital that we retain our frontline health care workers as we continue our fight to stop the spread of COVID-19,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""We are taking further actions to continue to ensure that our healthcare workers are supported, and the health care sector maintains a safe staffing level, especially in places where it is needed the most."" These measures build on steps the government has already taken to support frontline workers, including providing free emergency child care and securing necessary medical equipment and supplies.  The Ontario government remains committed to using every resource it has to support frontline workers as we work to stop the spread of COVID-19.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — On the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health, the Ontario government is introducing new and amending some emergency orders under subsection 7.0.2 (4) of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act to better support Ontario's long-term care homes and deafblind community. The orders would allow for the redeployment of staff to ensure they can work where they are needed most during the COVID-19 outbreak.
The government is also amending an emergency order to help ensure food security for some individuals and families during the pandemic.  ""Our long-term care homes are under attack or at high risk of an attack from this deadly virus,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""That's why we are continually shoring up our defences and fortifying the iron ring of protection around these vulnerable seniors and staff. These new emergency orders will allow us to get even more boots on the ground in our long-term care homes, and ensure those with visual or hearing disabilities continue receiving the support they deserve.""  The new and amended emergency orders being introduced will: Allow health service providers, including hospitals, to temporarily reassign frontline staff to provide services and supports in long-term care homes.This will help to quickly provide much-needed staffing support to long-term care homes while they continue to fight outbreaks.Provide staffing flexibility to service providers and employers in the intervenor services sector, which helps people who have a combined loss of hearing and vision. This will give employers the temporary authority to redirect staff to carry out essential tasks to support and protect people who are deafblind. It will also ensure staffing measures are in place to allow for physical distancing.Permit the use of allotment gardens and community gardens across the province. These gardens are an essential source of fresh food for some individuals and families, including those who face food insecurity. Local medical officers of health will provide advice, recommendation and instructions that the gardens must meet in order to operate, such as physical distancing, and cleaning and disinfecting commonly used equipment and surfaces."

NOTE: This information is no longer current. Please visit Ontario.ca/RentAssistance.    The Ontario Government is committing $241 million to partner with the federal government and deliver more than $900 million in urgent relief to small businesses and their landlords through a new program, the Ontario-Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance Program (OCECRA).
How does the program work? The program has been developed to share the cost between small business tenants and landlords. Small business tenants and landlords would each be asked to pay 25 per cent of the tenant's total rent (i.e., gross monthly rent payable under a lease agreement) and the provincial and federal government would cost share the remaining 50 per cent. For example, a monthly rent for a small business is $10,000. In this example, the landlord forgoes $2,500 (25 per cent of rent). The small business would be responsible for paying $2,500 (25 per cent of rent). The program would cover the remaining $5,000. The loan would be contingent on the signing of a rent forgiveness agreement between impacted tenants and landlords, which reduces the rental costs of small business tenants for April to June 2020 by at least 75 per cent. This would also include a moratorium on evictions for three months. How long would a commercial property owner have to apply for OCECRA?  The OCECRA would be administered by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) and would be available until August 31, 2020. Support would be retroactive to April 1, covering April, May and June 2020. The federal government designed the program and program details are being finalized by the federal government. To receive more information, visit CMHC's website and sign-up to receive additional details including when the application process opens. Are there any eligibility requirements for commercial property owners?  The OCECRA would apply to commercial properties with small business tenants. To qualify for the program, the property owner must meet the following requirements:  Own property that generates rental revenue from commercial real property located in Canada.Be the property owner of the commercial real property where the impacted small business tenants are located.Have a mortgage loan secured by the commercial real property, occupied by one or more small business tenants.Have entered or will enter into a rent reduction agreement for the period of April, May, and June 2020, that will reduce impacted small business tenant's rent by at least 75%.The rent reduction agreement with impacted tenants includes a moratorium on eviction for the period of April, May and June 2020.Declared rental income on their tax return (personal or corporate) for tax years 2018 and/or 2019.  For those property owners who do not have a mortgage, an alternative mechanism will be implemented. Further information will be outlined by CMHC in the near future.  What are the eligibility requirements for small businesses?  OCECRA for small businesses is applicable to commercial property owners with:  Eligible small business tenants. Eligible small business subtenants. Residential components and multi-unit residential properties with commercial tenants (i.e. mixed usage). Impacted small business tenants are businesses, including non-profit and charitable organizations who: Pay monthly rent not exceeding $50,000 in gross rent per location (as defined by a valid and enforceable lease agreement);Generate no more than $20 million in gross annual revenues, calculated on a consolidated basis (at the ultimate parent level); and  Have temporarily ceased operations (i.e., generating no revenues), or who are experiencing a 70 per cent drop in pre-COVID-19 revenues (determined by comparing revenues in April, May or June of 2020 to the same month of 2019 or alternatively compared to average revenues earned in January and February 2020).  Are any small businesses excluded from the OCECRA program? The following exclusions would apply:   Entities owned by individuals holding political office;Entities that promote violence, incite hatred or discriminate on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, color, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability; and,An entity in the Lenders special accounts or Restructuring Group prior to March 1, 2020.

Rent Assistance in Addition to Billions in Measures to Support Business During the COVID-19 Outbreak

April 24, 2020 12:30 P.M.

Office of the Premier


NOTE: This information is no longer current. Please visit Ontario.ca/RentAssistance.   TORONTO — The Ontario government is partnering with the federal government to provide urgent relief for small businesses and landlords affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. The province is committing $241 million through the new Ontario-Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance Program (OCECRA). The total amount of provincial-federal relief that would be provided is more than $900 million, helping to ensure small businesses are ready to reopen their doors when the emergency measures are lifted.
Details of the new program were announced today by Premier Doug Ford, Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""The vast majority of Ontario's small businesses and landlords are struggling during this extraordinary public health emergency,"" said Premier Ford. ""That's why we are doing everything we can to support them through these tough economic times, so they can hit the ground running when we are in a position to open up the provincial economy. I want to thank the federal government for partnering with us to help our small businesses and commercial landlords. I look forward to working together to also provide much-needed support to residential renters ahead of May 1."" The OCECRA will provide forgivable loans to eligible commercial property owners experiencing potential rent shortfalls because their small business tenants have been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. To receive the loan, property owners will be required to reduce the rental costs of small business tenants for April to June 2020 by at least 75 per cent and commit to a moratorium on evictions for three months. Partnering with the federal government on the OCECRA builds on the provincial government's approach to supporting business during COVID-19. As part of Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19, the government has implemented a series of cash flow supports amounting to $10 billion to help support jobs and the economy, including: Doubling the Employer Health Tax exemption for 2020, cutting taxes by $355 million, benefiting roughly 57,000 employers;Eliminating penalties and interest to businesses who miss filing or remittance deadlines for various provincially administered taxes for five months starting April 1, 2020, providing up to $6 billion in cashflow for about 100,000 Ontario businesses;Postponing the planned property tax reassessment for 2021, providing stability for Ontario's property taxpayers;Deferring the upcoming quarterly (June 30) remittance of education property tax to school boards by 90 days, providing municipalities with the flexibility to, in turn, provide property tax deferrals of over $1.8 billion to local residents and businesses;Implementing the new Regional Opportunities Investment Tax Credit for businesses that make eligible capital investments in designated regions of the province where employment growth has significantly lagged behind below the provincial average.Ontario has also suspended time-of-use electricity rates for eligible small businesses, as well as residential and farm time-of-use customers, holding electricity prices to the off-peak rate of 10.1 cents-per-kilowatt-hour, for 24 hours per day, seven days a week for 45 days, for all time-of-use customers, who make up the majority of electricity consumers in the province. By switching to a fixed off-peak rate, time-of-use customers will see rate reductions of over 50 per cent compared to on-peak rates. ""To help stop the spread of COVID-19, businesses have closed their doors and employees have stayed home and that has been working, but it has also created significant financial hardship,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. ""By subsidizing rent payments, reducing taxes, extending deadlines, and eliminating penalties and interest, we're helping to ensure businesses can start up quickly when the time is right."" The Ontario government has also worked with the federal government to develop the Small and Medium-sized Enterprise Loan that will enable up to $40 billion in lending, supported through Export Development Canada and the Business Development Bank. This program will help businesses meet cash flow requirements through guaranteed loans. ""Ontario's small and medium-sized businesses are vital to our economy and include some of the hardest-working people in the world who have rolled up their sleeves to support our frontline healthcare workers, and beat this virus,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""This package of supports will help them get through these difficult days and resume normal operations as soon as possible."" ""In the months ahead, small businesses will be critical to Ontario's economic recovery. Together with our federal partners, we are ensuring we support our small businesses today, so that they can continue to create opportunities for hardworking Ontario families tomorrow,"" said Prabmeet Sarkaria, Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction. ""With rents coming due, it's extremely important that the federal government move quickly to implement this program and get small businesses and property owners the support they urgently need.""

""Beginning today at sundown, Muslims in Ontario and all over the world will observe the month of Ramadan. For the Muslim community, Ramadan is the most important and holiest month of the year. It is a time for self-reflection, charitable giving, and prayer. This year, Ramadan will be unlike any other, as we continue to practise social distancing to fight the COVID-19 outbreak. This will mean Muslims will have to pray at home rather than in services at mosques, but the spirit and meaning of Ramadan will continue to inspire those observing this sacred time. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Muslim community for their generosity and support towards those in need during this unprecedented time. On behalf of the people of Ontario, I wish the Muslim community a happy Ramadan and I look forward to celebrating with you next year.""

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Ontario is delivering a new COVID-19 Action Plan for Vulnerable People to better protect vulnerable populations during the outbreak of COVID-19. This plan builds on the government's previous actions to protect people living in high-risk settings, including homes serving those with developmental disabilities, shelters for survivors of gender-based violence and human trafficking, children's residential settings, and those residential settings supporting vulnerable Indigenous individuals and families both on and off reserve.
Details of the plan were unveiled today by Premier Doug Ford, Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""The plan we are announcing today will build on and support the critical work that is currently being carried out each and every day by our frontline heroes to care for our most vulnerable citizens,"" said Premier Ford. ""These people are most at risk during this pandemic and that's why we are helping these organizations immediately ramp up screening and testing, deploy more protective masks and gloves, and put more boots on the ground in the fight against COVID-19."" ""We have been working in close partnership with the federal government, municipalities, First Nations, Indigenous organizations and bargaining agents as part of the rapid response to COVID-19 in congregate care settings,"" said Minister Smith. ""The action plan we are delivering today lays out a set of interventions, tailored by sector, to enable prevention and infection control, while maintaining service continuity for the benefit of our vulnerable clients and staff."" The COVID-19 Action Plan for Vulnerable People focuses on three specific areas: Enhanced Screening and Reduced Exposure to Prevent SpreadEnhancing screening of visitors, staff, and residents on sites, as well as restricting non-essential visitors.Providing masks to staff working in congregate care settings and providing training on the use of personal protective equipment in the event of an outbreak.  Infection Control: Managing Outbreaks and Limiting SpreadEnhancing testing of symptomatic staff and clients to identify the need for isolation and additional infection control measures on-site.Planning to limit staff from working at more than one congregate care setting during an outbreak, specifically in developmental services, intervenor services, violence against women and anti-human trafficking settings.Providing additional training and support for high-risk settings dealing with an outbreak, including guidance on how to isolate clients.Sustaining Staffing and Managing Staff ShortagesWorking with organizations to promote workforce stability and capacity in high-risk settings.""Women and children who are in a vulnerable place in their lives must have access to the supports they need and a setting that is safe,"" said Jill Dunlop, Associate Minister of Children and Women's Issues. ""We are taking steps to stop the spread of COVID-19, including physical distancing, flexible staffing, and cleaning and disinfecting protocols, to keep people safe where they work and where they live."" ""We know that those who live and work in homeless shelters face unique challenges because of the COVID-19 outbreak,"" said Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. ""That's why we're working closely with service managers and our local partners to collect data and identify specific actions we can take to help."" The government will work with Indigenous-led congregate care settings both on and off reserve to ensure that these tools and supports are available and adapted to meet their local needs in keeping their clients and staff safe. ""Indigenous leaders across the province have taken swift action to protect their communities from the spread of COVID-19 and today's enhanced safety measures will provide additional protection for those community members living and working in congregate care settings,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines and Minister of Indigenous Affairs. The plan also supports mobilizing action to assessed high-risk locations in managing the COVID-19 outbreak in the days and weeks to come by providing assistance with staffing and additional training and support. The government is also moving immediately to solicit ideas on additional actions and measures that can be taken now to further support vulnerable Ontarians and staff in high-risk settings.

Quick Facts

Tens of thousands of Ontarians live and work in congregate care settings across more than 4,000 locations.
The Action Plan builds on current measures implemented by the government to protect vulnerable populations, including visitor restrictions, flexibility for staff hours, expanded access to emergency daycare for frontline workers, and providing alternate settings for care. 
The province has also suspended evictions, provided funds through the province’s $200 million Social Services Relief Fund to Service Managers and invested over $37 million to support outbreak planning, prevention and mitigation efforts to ensure the health and well-being of Indigenous people and communities. Constant monitoring is also underway with local public health organizations.
The government is expanding the list of eligible expenses under Special Services at Home and for Passport funding. We will also continue to assist families and provide greater clarity about what expenses are eligible under the Ontario Autism program, including Childhood Budgets and Interim one-time funding, for the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak.

TORONTO — The Ontario government is making progress on the implementation of the COVID-19 Action Plan for Protecting Long-Term Care Homes to help stop and contain the spread of COVID-19 in the province's long-term care homes. The government has introduced more aggressive testing, screening, and surveillance, deployed specialized teams from hospitals, public health and the home care sector, recruited additional frontline staff, and increased personal protective equipment.    
Today's update was provided by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""Within 48 hours of launching our Action Plan, we sent in reinforcements to further protect our most vulnerable seniors and those who care for them in our long-term care homes,"" said Premier Ford. ""Today, we are making progress against this ruthless disease, but I want to emphasize that every option is on the table to get our long-term care homes what they need to stop the spread. That is why we intend to make a formal request for assistance from the federal government."" Since the Action Plan was announced, the government has worked swiftly and decisively to provide targeted, on-the-ground support to long-term care homes through the following measures: Assisting 20 long-term care homes, which were previously experiencing outbreaks, to become now outbreak-free. Increasing testing on both symptomatic and asymptomatic staff and residents. To date, approximately 11,600 tests have been completed amongst residents in long-term care.Conducting additional testing of asymptomatic residents and staff outside of the testing guidance at 21 long-term care homes, to help understand the spread of the virus.Setting up a 24/7 Long-Term Care COVID-19 Response Team, which has already helped more than 30 homes by putting in place infection control protocols, resolving staffing issues, and fulfilling personal protective equipment needs.Launching 31 Infection Prevention and Control interventions, which are currently in progress, with six assessments already completed. Continuing to identify critical 24-, 48-, and 72-hour help that homes need by matching qualified people and volunteers who can help with duties, including nursing support and cleaning. Responding to every escalated request for personal protective equipment from long-term care homes within 24 hours through the following measures:A four-step process is in place to ensure an optimized regional distribution and redistribution when supplies are urgently needed.Critical supply needs are escalated for provincial action.Daily distribution of supply from provincial warehouses to regional sites.Daily monitoring of and reporting against performance target of 100 per cent of critical need requests being shipped within 24 hours.Working with hospitals across the province to deploy additional staffing and infection prevention controls in long-term care homes:In Toronto alone, five hospitals (Michael Garron Hospital, Women's College, North York General, Unity Health Toronto and Mount Sinai Hospital) have been engaged to support approximately 40 long-term care homes in the city.Other hospital partners and health partners have stepped up to help their local homes, including Trillium Health Partners, Halton Healthcare, Grand River, Cambridge Memorial Hospital, and the Ottawa Hospital.More than 70 volunteers, including registered nurses, social workers, administration and medical doctors, have been recruited from the University Health Network to assist long-term care homes in the Greater Toronto Area.Providing over 400 job matches for long-term care homes through the province's Health Workforce Matching Portal, with over half of Ontario's long-term care homes now using the portal.To further support ongoing efforts to fight COVID-19 in Ontario's long-term care homes, the federal government has offered resources that could include personnel and other supports from Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada and Canadian Armed Forces. This support would be deployed to five priority long-term care homes as one element of the government's robust Action Plan. The Ontario government will be making a formal request to access those extra reinforcements today. The government continues to explore additional measures to help stop the spread of COVID-19 and keep vulnerable people safe, including building isolation capacity at long-term care homes. ""We must continue to act swiftly and decisively to keep our loved ones in long-term care safe, as well as their caregivers,"" said Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""Our long-term care homes continue to be the front-lines of this pandemic and we must continue to work around the clock to assist all our dedicated staff during this crisis.""

An opportunity to increase awareness and appreciation of earth’s natural environment

April 22, 2020  9:00 A.M.

Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks


TORONTO — Today, Jeff Yurek, Minister of Environment, Conservation and Parks released the following statement on the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.
""Today is the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, the day that we as global citizens come together to increase awareness and appreciation of Earth's natural environment. It's a chance to reflect on the importance of the environment to our own health and wellbeing, and what we must do to protect it for future generations. As we continue to fight the spread of COVID-19, we are seeing, first hand, how our personal contributions make a difference. Now, more than ever, true meaningful action begins at home.  I've been so inspired by what I've seen online these past few weeks. I've seen gardeners re-growing their own produce from vegetable stalks and making seed pods using old toilet paper rolls, people sewing masks from used textiles and children creating homemade ""thank you"" signs to show appreciation to frontline waste collection workers.  I've also been encouraged by all the organizations like the Toronto Zoo and Earth Rangers stepping it up to offer free daily educational activities virtually that help growing minds stay connected with nature and wildlife, while practicing physical distancing.  Our government continues to take action to support a healthy and clean environment through actions committed to in our Made-in-Ontario Environment Plan. Through our plan, we will continue to protect our land, air, and water, address litter and reduce waste, and fight climate change.   So today, on Earth Day, I want to thank you all for your incredible contributions and I look forward to engaging with you as we work together to make our communities and our province a cleaner, healthier place to live, work and grow.""

Funding and services will help seniors and people with disabilities during the COVID-19 outbreak

April 21, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government is delivering much-needed support to Ontario's most vulnerable citizens, including seniors and persons with disabilities, during the outbreak of COVID-19. The province is investing $11 million to help deliver meals, medicines and other essentials to those in need and doubling the Guaranteed Annual Income System (GAINS) payments.
Today's announcement was made by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care, and Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services.   ""As we face some of the darkest times in our province's history, we have a duty to protect and care for the most vulnerable in our society,"" said Premier Ford. ""Our seniors and people with disabilities are the most at risk during this crisis, and we must go above and beyond to ensure they get financial relief, food, medicine and other essentials without delay."" The province is working with the Ontario Community Support Association (OCSA) to launch a new Ontario Community Support Program to expand existing Meals on Wheels services to reach low-income seniors and people with disabilities and chronic medical conditions across Ontario. The program will also develop the capacity of community organizations and others to help deliver medication and other essentials. ""We know that the best way we can all take care of ourselves during this outbreak is to stay home,"" said Raymond Cho, Minister for Seniors and Accessibility. ""For older Ontarians and people with disabilities, this may be especially challenging. That is why I am so proud to see the Ontario Spirit being demonstrated by the volunteers, local not-for-profit organizations, charities and businesses that are helping our most vulnerable through the Ontario Community Support Program."" This week the province will also be issuing the first doubled Guaranteed Annual Income System (GAINS) payments. Individuals will receive up to $166 per month and couples will receive up to $332 per month. These doubled payments will continue for six months and provide an additional $75 million to 194,000 vulnerable seniors who may need more help to cover essential expenses during the COVID-19 outbreak. ""As part of Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19, we are investing $3.7 billion to provide immediate and direct support to Ontario's people and employers. It starts with those most in need,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. ""For our vulnerable seniors, we will double the Guaranteed Annual Income System payment for six months. That will ensure 194,000 of our lowest income seniors will have some extra support during these unprecedented times. The first payment will start to arrive this week and assist low income seniors with their essential expenses when they need it most."" The province is investing $40 million in the Residential Relief Fund. The funding will assist developmental services, child welfare, victims shelters, and organizations delivering social services to vulnerable First Nations individuals and families with COVID-related costs, such as the purchase of personal protective equipment (PPE) and enhanced staffing. In addition, the government is providing $148 million to municipal partners that administer social services with funding to support the province's most vulnerable as part of the province's $200 million in social services relief funding in response to COVID-19. ""Our government is taking decisive action to protect the health and safety of our most vulnerable populations,"" said Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services. ""If you have a friend or neighbour who is a senior or a person with a disability, please reach out to them to ensure they have what they need and are doing okay during this very difficult period.""

Today, Premier Doug Ford issued the following statement to mark Yom HaShoah:
""At sundown, the people of Ontario and the Jewish community across the province and around the world will remember one of the darkest periods in human history. Yom HaShoah commemorates the lives and heroism of Jewish people who were brutally murdered by the Nazi regime during the Second World War. We must never forget the millions of women, children and men who lost their lives in the Holocaust. What took place during the Holocaust must never be repeated. We remember not only the atrocities, but also the many heroes and survivors, so that we can learn from the past and educate future generations. As survivors age, we must renew our commitment to remember the past and to vigilantly keep the promise - never again. We recognize the many contributions of the Jewish community to our province, while renewing our commitment to fight anti-Semitism and hate in all its forms. I want to thank MPPs Will Bouma and Robin Martin for leading a private members' bill to officially adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism. We are stronger when we stand together. Ontario will always promote a society that respects diversity and freedom.""

Modelling shows physical distancing still needed to prevent further spread

April 20, 2020 12:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government today released updated COVID-19 modelling, which shows that the enhanced public health measures, including staying home and physically distancing from each other, are working to contain the spread of the virus and flatten the curve. However, the Chief Medical Officer of Health says emergency measures must remain in place to continue reducing the number of cases and deaths.
""The modelling clearly demonstrates that we are making progress in our fight against this deadly virus. That's due to the actions of all Ontarians, those who are staying home and practising physical distancing, and to the heroic efforts of our frontline health care workers,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""But COVID-19 continues to be a clear and present danger, especially to our seniors and most vulnerable citizens. That is why we must continue to follow the advice of our Chief Medical Officer of Health and stay the course in order to keep people safe and healthy."" Key highlights from the modelling update include: The wave of new community spread cases of COVID-19 in Ontario appears to have peaked.Outbreaks in long-term care and congregate settings continue to be a major concern. Concerted actions are underway to protect vulnerable people in these settings.Ontario is now trending toward a best case scenario rather than a worst case scenario and has significantly improved its standing as compared to March modelling.The province has avoided a significant surge in cases. Total cumulative cases are forecast to be substantially lower than worst case or even moderate case scenarios projected by previous models.While several hundred new cases are identified daily in Ontario, hospitals across the province have not been overwhelmed by the COVID-19 outbreak as a result of capacity planning and the public health measures currently in place. The rate of growth day-over-day is declining.To further reduce the number of cases and deaths, it remains critical that Ontarians continue to adhere to public health measures, including staying home and practicing physical distancing if they must go out for essential reasons only.""The information released today shows early but unmistakable signs that our efforts are working,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""These numbers are not an accident. They are the result of months of planning and collective action to stop the spread of COVID-19 and flatten the curve. However, in order for these projections to become reality, each of us must continue to stay home as much possible and practise physical distancing."" To enhance protections for residents and staff in long-term care homes, last week Ontario launched the COVID-19 Action Plan: Long-Term Care Homes. This action plan will ensure the implementation of critical new measures to prevent further outbreaks and deaths from COVID-19 in long-term care homes. These measures include enhancing and expanding testing for symptomatic and asymptomatic contacts of confirmed cases; providing public health and infection control expertise; and redeploying staff from hospitals and home and community care to support the long-term care home workforce. ""The new province-wide modelling data are encouraging, but we know that long-term care homes and other congregate settings will track on a different path,"" said Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""We will continue to take aggressive action to support our most vulnerable residents and their caregivers.""

Quick Facts

All Ontarians need to stay home unless absolutely necessary for essential trips, such as accessing health care services, groceries, picking up prescriptions or supporting vulnerable community members with meeting essential needs. If you must leave your home, go alone and stay at least two metres apart from others.
Ontario has made improvements to its COVID-19 Self-Assessment Tool by expanding its symptom list, addressing the most high risk individuals, and making it more accessible and responsive. 
Take these everyday steps to reduce exposure to COVID-19 and protect your health: wash your hands often with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer; sneeze and cough into your sleeve; avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth; avoid contact with people who are sick; stay home if you are sick.

During this entire process, our aim was to ensure our young people receive the best education we can offer, so they can develop the skills they need to succeed in the classroom and in the jobs of the future. We will remain focused on the government's dual priority of keeping students safe while ensuring the continuity of education. Moreover, we remain determined to continuously strengthen teacher-led learning and virtual learning for the benefit of our students, and we continue to look to our educators to rise to the challenge and deliver quality education to every child, wherever they may live.""

Ontario Investing $20 Million to Advance Medical Research

April 18, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government is investing $20 million to advance medical research and develop tools and resources to combat COVID-19 and other infectious diseases through the Ontario COVID-19 Rapid Research Fund. The government is calling on all of the province's world-class research institutions, postsecondary institutions, and non-profit scientific partners to take action in the development of innovative solutions to track and defeat COVID-19.
The announcement was made today by Premier Doug Ford and Ross Romano, Minister of Colleges and Universities. The investment is part of Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19. ""We have some of the best and brightest minds anywhere in the world right here in Ontario,"" said Premier Ford. ""Whether it's developing a vaccine, using 3-D printers to make personal protective equipment or designing better portable ventilators, our brilliant researchers are leading the charge in the fight against COVID-19 and giving our frontline health care workers the tools and resources they need to deliver top-notch care for patients."" Ontario's postsecondary education sector and research community has already taken on a leadership role to combat COVID-19. Colleges and universities, research hospitals and institutes across the province have stepped up to support their local communities by donating lifesaving ventilators, personal protective equipment and conducting invaluable research on detection and treatment. ""Our province, our country and the entire world face an unprecedented situation, and the innovation and expertise of our research community is needed now more than ever,"" said Minister Romano. ""We need to continue mobilizing people and ideas and leveraging our top talent in this global effort to find a solution to this crisis and keep people safe."" Ontario researchers are encouraged to submit proposals through the new Ontario Together website. This portal was established to locate or manufacture emergency products and identify immediate and innovative solutions to help support the province's response to COVID-19. The website also includes an option for research institutions, in addition to individuals, corporations and other entities, to submit ideas about how to expand health care capacity and knowledge, better utilize artificial intelligence, and build Ontario's current and future supply chain capacity. Research submissions through the Ontario Together portal will be accepted until April 24, 2020. ""When we launched Ontario Together on March 21st, our province's medical technology and pharmaceutical companies quickly stepped up to offer made-in-Ontario solutions in the fight against COVID-19,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""This incredible response demonstrates the strength of the Ontario Spirit in our business community and world-class manufacturing and life sciences sectors."" The province is particularly interested in proposals that are highly feasible with achievable results within one year or a maximum of two years. 

Quick Facts

A diverse field of COVID-19 research will be eligible for funding and may include, but is not limited to, researching the COVID-19 strain, developing a vaccine, enhancing testing procedures, or improving modelling tools to help track the virus.
Researchers are encouraged to contact their institutions for further details.
In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Ministry of Colleges and Universities is supporting researchers currently conducting Ontario Research Fund and Early Researcher Award projects by allowing salary payments, changing reporting deadlines and extending projects that would have otherwise been completed before March 31, 2021.
Ontario is developing a new platform, the Pandemic Threat Response (PANTHR), to provide secure and anonymized health data that will allow researchers to better support health system planning and responsiveness, including the immediate need to analyze the current COVID-19 outbreak.
Postsecondary institutions have donated hundreds and thousands of items, including personal protective equipment and ventilators.
Ontario is combatting COVID-19 by working with colleges to get trained paramedic students into the workforce to support frontline health care workers. Colleges will provide training opportunities and a streamlined path to early graduation and practice for paramedic students with valuable skills needed by the health care sector.

The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry would like to remind hunters that it is illegal and unsafe to discharge a firearm down, from or across public roads. Hunters are also reminded they must handle firearms with reasonable consideration for people and property.
Following an investigation, two men have been convicted of firearms offences and possessing illegally killed wildlife in the Bancroft area. On November 12, 2019, conservation officers from the Bancroft Enforcement Unit located evidence of recent deer hunting activity while conducting a patrol in Carlow Township of Hastings County. An investigation determined that earlier that day two men had harvested two deer near Hass Road, and that both men discharged their firearm across the road. On March 3, 2020, both men pleaded guilty to charges under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Actin Bancroft Provincial Offences Court, before Justice of the Peace Ernest Parsons. Brandon Bellis of Foxboro was fined $3,000 for discharging a firearm without reasonable consideration for people or property and $500 for possessing illegally killed wildlife. He also received a one-year hunting suspension and must successfully retake the Ontario Hunter Education Course before he can hunt again. Eric Mclennan of Campbellford was fined $3,000 for discharging a firearm without reasonable consideration for people or property and $500 for possessing illegally killed wildlife. He also received a one-year hunting suspension and must successfully retake the Ontario Hunter Education Course before he can hunt again. The seized deer was donated to a local charity. Conservation officers continue to patrol and protect our natural resources during the COVID-19 outbreak and would like to remind everyone that by respecting seasons, sanctuaries, bag and possession limits we all help ensure our natural resources stay healthy.

$1 million in new funding to support efforts that match employers with job-seekers

April 17, 2020  4:00 P.M.

Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs


TORONTO — The governments of Canada and Ontario are investing up to $1 million in new funding to connect workers with in-demand jobs in the agri-food sector to keep the nation's supply chains strong and store shelves stocked during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership (the Partnership), the federal and provincial governments will provide support that will help people connect with job opportunities in the sector quickly. This program would help primary agriculture, food processing companies and grocery retail to recruit and train workers who are important to keeping the essential food supply chain functioning. ""The women and men who work on farms, in processing plants and throughout the food production chain, are doing an essential service for us during this critical time and we are thankful for their dedication and hard work,"" said the Honourable Marie-Claude Bibeau, federal Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. ""There is a strong need for workers on Canadian farms and in food processing businesses right now and our Government is taking concrete actions to find solutions, including through this new initiative, to ensure that Canadians continue to have high-quality food on their grocery store shelves and kitchen tables."" ""This is a very labour-intensive sector so it is critical to attract more people to ensure our food supply chain continues to provide healthy and nutritious food to Ontario families during this COVID-19 outbreak,"" said the Honourable Ernie Hardeman, Ontario Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. ""Our government is doing everything possible to ensure we support our farmers and food processors to fill job vacancies, including the development of a new web portal connecting workers with employers."" Through the Partnership's Place to Grow: Agri-Food Innovation Initiative, the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) will immediately accept applications and will expedite the approval process to help address sector labour concerns quickly. Since June 2018, both the federal and provincial governments have committed support to approximately 2,500 projects, through the Partnership, to help eligible Ontario farmers, processors, businesses and sector organizations innovate and grow.

Quick Facts

Funding will be cost-shared by the Province.
The intake is provided under the Place to Grow: Agri-Food Innovation Initiative – Addressing Labour Supply and Training Challenges project category.
The Partnership is a five-year, $3-billion commitment by Canada's federal, provincial and territorial governments that supports Canada's agri-food and agri-products sectors.
This targeted intake will begin accepting applications on April 17, 2020. Eligible applications will be received and assessed on a continuous basis, while funding is available.
More information about this targeted intake and the program guidelines can be found online at: http://omafra.gov.on.ca/english/cap/labour_supply_training.htm or by calling: 1-877-424-1300.
This programming follows Ontario’s recent establishment of an online portal to help link agri-food sector employers with people interested in being a part of government’s response to COVID-19.
OMAFRA delivers cost-share funding under the Place to Grow program.
The Ontario agri-food sector supports more than 837,000 jobs in Ontario and contributes more than $47.5 billion each year to the province’s economy.

iPad Devices with Free Rogers Wireless Data Will Support Learning at Home 

April 17, 2020  1:30 P.M.

Ministry of Education


TORONTO — The Ontario government has partnered with Rogers Communications and Apple to help meet the educational needs of students and families during the COVID-19 outbreak. iPad devices are being purchased and distributed by Ontario school boards, pre-equipped with free Rogers LTE wireless data. Apple is providing ongoing support in French and English to teachers, parents and students, with a collection of resources to support learning and working from home.
""This important partnership will enable students to learn while making technology accessible for those that truly need it,"" said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education. ""Our government is committed to ensuring equitable access to education, so that every child - irrespective of ability, geography or socio-economic circumstance - can continue their learning while schools are closed."" This week, Ontario school boards began distributing iPad devices to students who don't have either the technology or the Internet they need to access the Learn at Home program.  To date, over 21,000 will be sent to the homes of families in need. The free Rogers wireless data will be available until the end of June.   Also, Apple is providing videos, apps and books to help teachers build engaging lessons for students at home, along with fun and creative activities that kids and families can do with the built-in features of the iPad device. Apple is also offering teachers free one-to-one virtual coaching by Apple Professional Learning Specialists. In addition to providing free wireless data, Rogers is also working with Ontario school boards to provide high-speed, low-cost Internet to subsidized tenants and members of housing partners across Ontario through its Connected for Success program, as well as the Government of Canada Connecting Families initiative.  The Province has accelerated the delivery of broadband Internet access, currently on track to be in every high school in Ontario by September 2020 and elementary school by September 2021.  ""With this collaboration and commitment to ongoing support for remote learning, our school boards, Apple and Rogers clearly demonstrate the Ontario spirit and the incredible ability to overcome any obstacle for our kids,"" said Minister Lecce. ""For some of the most vulnerable members of our society, accessing online learning tools at home is an added burden at a time when there is already a lot of stress,"" said Dean Prevost, President, Rogers for Business. ""Rogers is pleased to be working alongside the Ontario Government, Apple and school boards across the province to help close the digital divide for some of our most vulnerable young people and their families.""

Quick Facts

Ontario’s Ministry of Education has collaborated with educators, school boards, Apple and Rogers to support the Learn at Home program with an iPad and integrated wireless remote learning solution to help meet the educational needs of our province’s families.
Working with Apple and Rogers, Ontario school boards now have access to affordable solutions with the iPad device, which is the most secure device for education that’s also easy to use, and to manage and deploy — so that no student is left behind while schools are closed due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation.
iPad devices will be purchased and distributed by Ontario school boards, pre-equipped with Rogers LTE wireless data. Rogers is providing this plan at no cost for the balance of the school year (until June 30, 2020). Students and families do not need to contact Rogers to set the devices up.
School boards will determine requirements for student eligibility to receive an iPad.
In addition, Rogers is allowing eligible households to sign up for high-speed Internet with no overage fees for $9.99 monthly.

An emergency order was issued which will offer support to those providing a variety of critical services including people who assist vulnerable communities, emergency response and law enforcement sector staff, more health and safety workers, and certain federal employees.
The announcement was made today by Premier Doug Ford and Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education. ""Our frontline workers have made so many sacrifices and put the needs of the community ahead of themselves,"" said Premier Ford. ""These heroes work day-in and day-out to ensure everyone else can stay home and stay safe and healthy. The least we can do is ensure the safety of their children during these unprecedented times."" On March 20, 2020, the government issued an emergency order directing certain child care centres to reopen with fewer children to allow for physical distancing. This decision was made to support health care and other frontline workers responding to the COVID-19 outbreak. The list of essential workers eligible to access emergency childcare has now been expanded. ""Our frontline workers are making a real difference in our lives and deserve our support,"" said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education. ""We are providing emergency child care to more frontline workers because in these unprecedented times, we will do whatever it takes to keep families safe, cared for, and healthy."" ""Dedicated people are on the frontlines, serving our most vulnerable in developmental services agencies, in residential care homes,"" said Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services. ""We need to support them by making sure their families are taken care of when they go to work."" The additional frontline workers who can now access emergency childcare services include: Staff working in developmental services, victim services, violence against women services, anti-human trafficking services and child welfare services (children's aid societies) and in children's residential settings;Additional staff identified by the Ministry of the Solicitor General, including:First Nations constables;Office of the Fire Marshal and Emergency Management fire investigators;Select critical staff in community corrections, such as probation and parole officers;Contractors in institutional corrections services;Frontline staff at the Provincial Forensic Pathology Unit;Critical staff at the Centre of Forensic Sciences; andCritical staff operating the Provincial Emergency Operations Centre.Staff working in shelters (e.g., serving homeless populations);Power workers;Pharmaceutical and medical supplies and device manufacturing workers;Non-municipal water and waste-water employees; andFederally employed staff including Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers and Canada Post employees. ""By ensuring staff who support some of our most vulnerable, including survivors of domestic violence, victims of human trafficking, and children and youth in care, have access to emergency child care, we can continue to provide these important services throughout the COVID-19 outbreak,"" said Jill Dunlop, Associate Minister of Children and Women's Issues. The Ontario Ministry of Education is working with Consolidated Municipal Service Managers (CMSM) and District Social Services Administration Boards (DSSAB) in their role as service system managers for early years and child care, as well as First Nations, to implement emergency child care centres in communities across the province. Ontario will continue to monitor local needs to ensure frontline staff can continue to work and will communicate more details as the situation evolves. A list of emergency child care centres is available on Ontario.ca/coronavirus.

Quick Facts

The need for child care spaces could grow by an estimated 11,300 during the eligibility expansion.
Since emergency child care was introduced last month, there are 74 child care centres up and running and home child care is being provided by 33 Licensed Home Child Care Agencies in communities across the province. 41 additional centres have also been approved and will be coming online in the coming days.
On April 14, 2020, the government issued an emergency order to give violence against women and anti-human trafficking agencies who deliver emergency residential services greater flexibility to address staffing challenges arising from the COVID-19 outbreak.

 Province makes it easier to reassign staff where they are needed most

April 17, 2020  7:00 A.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — To help stop the spread of COVID-19 among the province's most vulnerable citizens and ensure frontline services can continue to be delivered in priority areas, the Ontario government has issued new temporary emergency orders under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act.
""Every day, incredible sacrifices are being made by frontline workers in every region of the province to care for our most vulnerable citizens,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""In order to better protect our seniors, people with various abilities, and the homeless population, along with our heroic frontline workers, our government is adopting emergency measures to provide flexibility in a variety of staffing arrangements to help stop the spread of this terrible virus."" The Emergency Measures issued to further protect vulnerable people during the COVID-19 outbreak include: Restricting retirement home employees from working in more than one retirement home, long-term care home or health care setting, with compliance required by April 22, 2020;Providing Local Health Integration Networks with the ability to direct home care service provider organizations to safely reassign frontline staff to areas where they are most needed, including home and community care settings, long-term care homes, supportive housing, retirement homes and hospitals;Providing municipalities and District Social Service Administration Boards with the flexibility to offer reassignments to certain staff to where there is local need during the outbreak, including child care, by-law enforcement, and public health services. ""We have heard the concerns of our municipal partners and are taking action to ensure they have the support they need to help their communities during the outbreak to address local needs,"" said Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. ""Today our government is taking further action to protect both the residents and staff of retirement homes. The health and safety of retirement home residents is of the utmost importance,"" said Raymond Cho, Minister for Seniors and Accessibility. ""We must stop the spread of COVID-19 and we must do everything we can to protect retirement home residents and staff."" In order to ensure there are enough paramedics and emergency medical attendants, ambulance services will have the flexibility to hire and assign college students who have not yet completed exams or graduated, to provide services appropriate to their competence level and scope of practice. ""We continue to take decisive action to contain the virus and support our heroic frontline workers during this challenging time,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""Expanding the capacity of our health care workforce will support their incredible efforts to provide patients with the care they need."" With the new staffing flexibility measures, municipalities or District Social Services Administration Boards will determine where there is a local need for staffing to deliver particular services. These employers have to comply with all provincial orders, as well as any guidance and safety standards prescribed by the Ontario government for COVID-19. They are also responsible for ensuring that any staff reassigned to the new duties have the required training and skills. ""During this critical time, our local delivery partners need the flexibility to be able to respond quickly and effectively to maintain essential frontline services,"" said Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services. ""We will continue to face these challenges together as we work to protect the health and safety of all Ontarians.""

Quick Facts

As announced on April 15, Ontario is restricting long-term care staff from working in more than one long-term care home, retirement home or health care setting to help stop the spread of COVID-19 between facilities.
Local Health Integration Networks are responsible for arranging in-home or school health and social services, and for processing placements in long-term care facilities for individuals who can no longer remain in their own homes.

Ontario Enables Auto Insurance Companies to Provide Driver Rebates During COVID-19 
Regulatory Changes Open the Door for Auto Insurance Rebates

April 16, 2020  3:00 P.M.

Ministry of Finance


TORONTO — The Ontario government is enabling auto insurance companies to provide temporary insurance premium rebates to drivers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The province has amended a regulation under the Insurance Act to help ease the financial pressure on working people and families during this public health crisis.
By amending this regulation insurance companies would be able to provide auto insurance premium rebates to consumers for up to 12 months after the declared emergency has ended.  ""We are in an unprecedented time and people are experiencing extraordinary financial pressures,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. ""My message to insurance companies has been clear: they should provide relief that reflects the financial hardships their dedicated customers are facing due to the COVID-19 outbreak."" ""All of us will remember how companies treat us during these unprecedented times. I often remind business leaders that their customers from the past five years are likely to be their customers for the next five years,"" said Phillips. ""Insurance companies indicated that the regulation preventing rebates was a barrier to providing relief to their customers. That barrier has now been removed so auto insurance companies can step up and do the right thing for the people and families of Ontario."" The Government and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario (FSRA) will continue to work together to monitor how the auto insurance sector is responding. 

Quick Facts

Ontario is the first jurisdiction in Canada to remove existing restrictions on rebating so auto insurers can provide additional consumer relief. 
The rebating prohibition is designed to protect consumers from being misled in purchasing decisions based on a rebate and to provide consumer protection from insurers who may discriminate between consumers.
Auto insurance policy terms generally last for 12 months. The 12-month time period of this regulation would allow insurers to provide rebates to all policyholders, regardless of their annual policy renewal date.
The Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario (FSRA) is an independent regulatory agency designed to improve consumer and pension plan beneficiary protections in Ontario. FSRA is responsible for monitoring compliance with and enforcing the Insurance Act and its regulations.

Province adds more than 2,000 acute care and critical care beds and enacts pandemic staffing plans

April 16, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Acting on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health and other health care professionals, the Ontario government has significantly expanded hospital capacity in preparation for any COVID-19 outbreak scenario. The province has added 1,035 acute care beds and 1,492 critical care beds and taken steps to ensure hospitals have the staff available to care for a sudden surge in patients.
""Thanks to the hard work and relentless preparation of our hospital staff to build capacity in our hospitals, we are in a position to better allocate resources to sectors that are in critical need and respond to any potential surge in cases,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""When you combine these life-saving beds with the very best care delivered by our highly skilled hospital staff, our patients will definitely have a fighting chance against this deadly virus."" Hospitals across the province have taken steps to make more beds available for COVID-19 patients in every region of the province. As a result, Ontario has a total of 20,354 acute care beds with a potential for an additional 4,205 more acute care beds by April 30, 2020. Of Ontario's 3,504 critical care beds, 2,811 are now equipped with ventilators, up from 1,319 when the outbreak first started. ""As we've said from the outset of the COVID-19 outbreak, Ontario will be prepared to respond to any outbreak scenario, including having plans in place for the worst-case scenario,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Heath. ""Thanks to the innovative work by our health care leaders, we have been able to significantly expand acute and critical care capacity in Ontario's hospitals. While these are positive steps forward, it remains as important as ever that everyone continues to help stop the spread by staying home unless you are an essential service worker."" This bed capacity expansion has been organized in coordination with pandemic staffing plans to ensure each hospital has the physicians and staff needed, including in case of a major surge of cases. Measures include: Redeploying surgical nursing staff who can now work with medicine units;Sharing highly trained emergency department and intensive care unit nursing staffs across units;Sharing physician resources across hospitals in a given region;Recruiting family doctors to complete shifts within the hospital; andRecruiting retirees, including nursing and support services.The province continues to focus on what resources will be needed to further enhance capacity quickly, if the need arises. Hospitals have identified additional opportunities to add new beds, including through the use of field hospitals, conference centres, school locations and more. Sites are ready to open based on the needs of the community.

Quick Facts

Ontario’s hospitals activated their pandemic plans to guide their decisions on how they created the enhanced capacity, including postponing some elective surgeries and reorganizing the discharging of alternate level of care patient to appropriate locations.

Several other measures, including the launch of Ontario’s online self-assessment tool, opening assessment centres, increasing Telehealth capacity and the ability to consult with emergency department doctors virtually have also helped to reduce emergency room visits and hospital admissions.
As of April 13, 2020, the average hospital occupancy rate was 69.1%% (64.1% for acute care only), a significant decrease from 96.2% (97.3% for acute beds) before COVID-19 measures. There are over 7,300 acute care beds unoccupied and over 2,000 critical care beds currently available across Ontario.
Ontario recently placed an order with O-Two Medical Technologies to produce 10,000 ventilator units, along with the support of Ontario's world-class manufacturing sector.

Robust action plan and new emergency order to protect the most vulnerable in long-term care homes

April 15, 2020  2:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — In order to better protect the most vulnerable and stop the spread of COVID-19 in long-term care homes, the Ontario government has developed a robust action plan with key measures to be implemented within hours. In addition, the province has issued a new emergency order restricting long-term care staff from working in more than one long-term care home, retirement home or health care setting. These measures are being taken on the advice of Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health.
The COVID-19 Action Plan: Long-Term Care Homes was announced today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""We will do everything we can to protect our seniors and most vulnerable citizens because we all know they are most at risk during this pandemic,"" said Premier Ford. ""Our three-point action plan builds on the measures we have already taken to fortify that iron ring of protection we have placed around our long-term care residents and those who care for them.""  The COVID-19 Action Plan: Long-Term Care Homes adds critical new measures to prevent further outbreaks and deaths from COVID-19 in long-term care homes, including:    Aggressive Testing, Screening, and Surveillance: enhancing testing for symptomatic residents and staff and those who have been in contact with persons confirmed to have COVID-19; expanding screening to include more asymptomatic contacts of confirmed cases; and leveraging surveillance tools to enable care providers to move proactively against the disease.Managing Outbreaks and Spread of the Disease: supporting long-term care homes with public health and infection control expertise to contain and prevent outbreaks; providing additional training and support for current staff working in outbreak conditions.Growing our Heroic Long-Term Care Workforce: redeploying staff from hospitals and home and community care to support the long-term care home workforce and respond to outbreaks, alongside intensive on-going recruitment initiatives.Additional measures under development will help to ensure preparedness and respond to the situation as it evolves, including improving isolation capacity at long-term care homes. Within less than 48 hours, the government will immediately act to deliver: enhanced testing and surveillance for symptomatic residents and staff and those in contact with persons confirmed to have COVID-19;testing of asymptomatic residents and staff in select homes across the province to better understand how COVID-19 is spreading;risk and capacity assessments for all homes;working with Ontario Health, the Ontario Hospital Association, and public health units to assemble infection control and preventions teams and additional supports;enhanced guidance on personal protective equipment and continued priority distribution to homes;enhanced training and education to support staff working in outbreak situations; andredeploying hospital and home care resources into homes.""We must continue to act to stop the spread of this virus in our long-term care homes,"" said Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""Nothing is more important than protecting the health and well-being of our loved ones in long-term care, or the front-line heroes who care for them."" ""This new action plan significantly enhances existing efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19 and protect our most vulnerable, including long-term care home residents and the staff who care for them,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""Having significantly expanded the scope and scale of testing and made considerable progress in securing personal protective equipment, Ontario has never been better positioned to deliver on our commitment to support long-term care homes in our shared battle against this virus."" The government has also issued an emergency order directing long-term care employers to ensure their employees, including registered nurses, registered practical nurses, personal support workers, kitchen and cleaning staff only work in one long-term care home. This means that employees cannot work in multiple locations such as a retirement home or other health care setting. As a result of this order, long-term care workers who must temporarily give up a job in another care setting are protected from losing their job as they are entitled to an unpaid leave of absence. To help long-term care workers make up these lost wages, the government encourages long-term care employers to offer full-time hours to their part-time employees during the COVID-19 outbreak. To help employers cover this expense, the government is taking action to ensure long-term care homes have the flexibility and funds to rapidly hire nurses and other front-line staff they need, when they need them. These emergency funds are available to help long-term care homes cover the incremental costs of increasing hours for part-time staff to help those staff limit their work locations. All long-term care staff continue to be subject to rigorous screening procedures and must follow personal protective equipment guidelines, including wearing surgical masks, gowns, gloves and eye protection while in homes.

Quick Facts

The COVID-19 Action Plan: Long-Term Care Homes will continue to evolve in response to COVID-19. The government is actively seeking and acting on proposals to fight this virus through the Ontario Together portal. 
The temporary emergency order will come into effect on April 22, 2020 in order to give long-term care homes enough time to be compliant with the order. It builds on previous emergency orders issued March 24 and March 28, 2020.
An investment of $243 million in COVID-19 emergency funding is available to homes to cover the costs associated with securing the staffing, supplies, and capacity they need at this unprecedented time.
To help understaffed long-term care homes find qualified staff, the government launched an online tool to help match skilled front-line workers with employers: the Health Workforce Matching Portal.

Ontario Supporting Education Sector, Students, and Municipalities During COVID-19 Outbreak


April 14, 2020  3:30 P.M.

Office of the Premier


To assist the education sector, municipalities, and students during the COVID-19 emergency, Ontario has passed the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Support and Protection Act in the Ontario Legislative Assembly, amending the Education Act, Planning Act, Development Charges Act, Police Services Act and the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities Act. The changes are as follows:
Education Act Amending the Education Act will allow school boards with an expiring education development charge (EDC) by-law to use their existing by-law for an additional six months after the end of the COVID-19 outbreak, so they can continue to charge fees on new construction. This change ensures school boards can retain a vital source of revenue that helps support new school projects. This amendment aligns with the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing's approach to development charges that are expiring during the COVID-19 outbreak. The Education Act is also being amended to provide a fair and consistent, provincewide approach to addressing school suspensions and expulsions. During the closure period and with the physical distancing requirements, it is not feasible for boards to complete investigations and hold expulsion hearings. To guarantee procedural fairness for students, especially where the principal's investigation may lead to a recommendation for an expulsion hearing, the amendment extends the timeline for principals and boards to carry out investigations and expulsion hearings for these students up to 20 school days after the school closure order ends, and when schools re-open. The amendment will help protect the safety and security of students and staff upon the reopening of schools. Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities Act Amending the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities Act will temporarily suspend student loan payments for OSAP borrowers and initiate a six-month interest-free moratorium on OSAP loans. Both measures will automatically apply to current OSAP loans, providing immediate relief to OSAP borrowers during this difficult time. Anyone who wishes to continue to make payments to their loan can still make one-time payments through their online account or online banking. Planning Act Amending the Planning Act will provide municipalities the time they need to focus on local public health priorities by making it possible to suspend certain planning decision timelines during a declared state of emergency. These changes will temporarily pause the need for municipalities and planning boards to make planning decisions within specified timelines without the risk of appeal. If municipalities choose to process planning applications, they may still do so by holding virtual/electronic public meetings and making decisions on planning matters during the COVID-19 outbreak. Development Charges Act Amending the Development Charges Act will ensure municipalities can continue to count on a vital source of revenue that helps pay for local growth-related infrastructure, such as roads, water and sewers as well as fire and police services. This change allows municipalities with an expiring development charge by-law to use their existing by-law during the current emergency and for six months following the end of the emergency declaration, so they can continue to charge fees on new construction. Police Services Act The Solicitor General can give municipalities an extension on the deadline to prepare and adopt a community safety and well-being plan. Municipalities have inquired about an extension in order to keep resources focussed on dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak. The amendments to the Police Services Act allow the Solicitor General to extend the deadline past January 1, 2021, which will help ensure municipalities are able to meet the legislative requirements and complete their community safety and well-being plans within new required timelines, which will be set at a later date.

Sustained Measures Necessary to Stop the Spread and Protect Public Health

April 14, 2020  3:30 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO ― On the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health and with the approval of the Ontario legislature, the Ontario government is extending the Declaration of Emergency under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act for a further 28 days. This will allow the government to continue to use every tool at its disposal to protect the health and safety of the people of Ontario during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Passed during a special sitting of the Ontario legislature and with the full cooperation of all parties, the Declaration of Emergency has been extended until May 12. The extension of the provincial declaration of emergency allows Ontario to continue to enforce current emergency orders, such as the closure of all non-essential workplaces, outdoor amenities such as parks and recreational areas, public places and bars and restaurants, as well as restrictions on social gatherings of more than five people, and prohibitions against price-gouging. A full list of emergency orders can be found on the e-Laws website under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act. ""During these unprecedented times, we cannot let our guard down. The actions being taken by everyone to stay home and practice physical distancing are making a difference, but we are not out of the woods yet,"" said Premier Ford. ""With the support of every Ontario MPP, we continue to take any and all actions necessary to support our frontline health care workers and respond rapidly and decisively to slow the spread of this deadly virus."" The legislature also passed the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Support and Protection Act to amend the Education Act, Planning Act, Development Charges Act, Police Services Act and the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities Act. This new legislation demonstrates that the government is actively listening to the concerns of education and municipal stakeholders during this COVID-19 emergency. ""This legislation is about protecting the health and economic interests of Ontarians,"" said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education. ""We will do whatever it takes to get through this challenge ― most especially for the next generation ― so that students continue learning and graduating."" The amendments to the Education Act will allow school boards to continue charging fees on new construction in order to retain a vital source of revenue for new school projects. The bill also includes an amendment to provide a fair and consistent provincewide approach to addressing school suspensions and expulsions as part of the government's commitment to the safety of students and staff upon the reopening of schools. The changes to the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities Act will temporarily suspend student loan payments for OSAP borrowers and initiate a six-month interest-free moratorium on OSAP loans. ""We are taking action to ease the financial burden for students and current borrowers during the COVID-19 outbreak,"" said Ross Romano, Minister of Colleges and Universities. ""By temporarily suspending loan repayments and interest accrual, our government is providing immediate support for OSAP borrowers during these challenging times.""   The government is making it possible to suspend certain municipal planning decision timelines during the state of emergency, and change the Development Charges Act to ensure municipalities can continue to count on a vital source of revenue that helps pay for local growth-related infrastructure, such as roads, water and sewers as well as fire and police services. The amendments to the Police Services Act also allow the Solicitor General to give municipalities an extension beyond January 1, 2021 to prepare and adopt a community safety and well-being plan. ""Nothing is more important than protecting the health and well-being of all individuals and families,"" said Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. ""We have listened to our municipal partners and made these changes to help them better manage staff time and resources so they can focus on the COVID-19 outbreak."" ""In these unprecedented times, our government is doing everything in its power to support our municipal, policing and community partners,"" said Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General. ""While Community Safety and Well-Being Plans are an important tool for municipalities to keep our communities safe, we need them to focus on allocating resources where they are needed most right now, and that is to stop the spread of COVID-19.""

Ontario Secures Critical Medical Equipment and Supplies
Same-Day Deliveries Made to Protect Patients and Frontline Workers from COVID-19

April 13, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government continues to ensure that patients, frontline health care workers and first responders have the critical equipment and supplies they need to protect themselves during the COVID-19 outbreak. Over the last five days, more than 13 million surgical and procedural masks, 200,000 N95 respirator masks, and 38 ventilators have been delivered to Ontario's pandemic stockpile warehouses.  
""The global competition to secure critical personal protective equipment and medical supplies is fierce, yet our team of procurement specialists continues to locate the masks, gloves and ventilators we need to keep our frontline workers and patients safe,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""I also want to take this opportunity to thank Premier Jason Kenney and the people of Alberta for making a generous donation of critical medical supplies and equipment in the fight against COVID-19. By standing united in adversity, Team Canada will stop this virus in its tracks."" Ontario is providing same-day deliveries to hospitals, long-term care and retirement homes, and other facilities to support essential workers in all settings and ensuring supplies and equipment are expedited to those most in need. This includes shipments this past weekend of 6.5 million surgical and procedural masks to over 650 providers across the province to protect our frontline workers, patients and residents. ""I am pleased to report that we continue making significant progress in securing the necessary personal protective equipment needed to effectively respond to COVID-19,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""Nothing is more important than protecting the health and safety of patients and the workers caring for them, as well as our first responders. We will continue working around the clock to add to the provincial stockpile to ensure that we are equipped to support those fighting this outbreak on the frontlines."" Ontario has been procuring vital supplies and personal protective equipment through its traditional suppliers and donations, as well as working in collaboration with the federal government, other provinces, and Ontario's manufacturers. On Saturday, Alberta committed to send Ontario 250,000 N95 masks, 2.5 million surgical masks, 15 million surgical gloves, 87,000 safety goggles, and 50 ventilators.  While Ontario is making progress in procuring critical supplies and equipment, the global supply chain remains constrained. Conservation of supplies and equipment, particularly personal protective equipment is of utmost importance. The government is working to ensure those in priority areas and in urgent need are receiving the supplies they need.

Quick Facts

Ontario obtains its own supplies and receives others procured centrally by the federal government. 
As of April 13, through the Ontario Together web portal, the province has received over 14,500 submissions from businesses and private citizens, offering to provide or donate various supplies and equipment, such as masks, face shields, testing equipment, ventilators, hand sanitizer, gowns and coveralls. More than 9,000 emergency supply submissions have generated nearly $90 million in purchases of critical equipment and supplies. 
Ontario has launched a new $50 million Ontario Together Fund to help businesses provide innovative solutions or retool their operations to manufacture essential medical supplies and equipment, including gowns, coveralls, masks, face shields, testing equipment and ventilators
Ontario is making it easier for businesses to work with government by developing a smarter procurement system that will save taxpayer money, drive office efficiencies and help small- and medium-sized businesses tap into new opportunities in government procurement.

Province Developing New Health Data Platform to Help Defeat COVID-19
New platform will allow researchers to better detect, plan and respond to the outbreak

April 12, 2020  4:02 P.M.

Ministry of Health


TORONTO —The Ontario government is taking steps to better detect, plan and respond to the COVID-19 outbreak. In consultation with the Ontario Privacy Commissioner, the province is developing a new health data platform called the Pandemic Threat Response (PANTHR). This new platform will hold secure health data that will allow researchers to better support health system planning and responsiveness, including the immediate need to analyze the current COVID-19 outbreak.
""Better access to integrated data will improve modelling and research to determine how COVID-19 is evolving, ensuring frontline staff are as prepared as possible in these unprecedented times,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""While access to data is important, we are taking all measures to ensure patient privacy is always respected and Ontarians are aware of how anonymized information may be shared."" Ontario will appoint a PANTHR special advisor and form a roundtable to provide recommendations about the data and policies to support and help overcome barriers while developing this platform. The information gathered in the secure platform will help break down long-standing barriers and allow researchers to help with: Increasing detection of COVID-19;Discovering risk factors for vulnerable populations;Predicting when and where outbreaks may happen;Evaluating how preventative and treatment measures are working; andIdentifying where to allocate equipment and other resources. ""Integrating data from across the province will allow us to effectively leverage tools, like artificial intelligence, to better understand this virus, how it spreads and the most effective means of combatting it,"" said Peter Bethlenfalvy, President of the Treasury Board. ""These key insights will mean our world-class health system partners have secure access to better and more consistent population data, improving decision-making in health care and aiding our efforts to beat COVID-19. The health and safety of Ontarians remains our singular focus - this is another measure that will allow us to continue to deliver on that commitment.""  When launched, PANTHR will provide access to de-identified, integrated data on publicly funded administrative health services records, including: Physician claims submitted to the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP);Medical drug claims submitted to the Ontario Drug Benefit Program;Discharge summaries of hospital stays and emergency department visits; andClaims for home care and long-term care. PANTHR will also contain clinical data from special registry collections, such as the Critical Care Information System (CCIS), which reports on critical care capacity in the province, and clinical data extracted from public health, hospital, laboratory and diagnostic imaging information systems. Other supporting data may also be added based on needs of researchers in achieving COVID-19 objectives.

Today, Premier Doug Ford issued the following statement to mark Easter Sunday:
""Today, people across Ontario will celebrate the joyous occasion of Easter. For Christians, Easter Sunday is the holiest day in the Christian calendar and marks the triumphant resurrection of Jesus Christ. For others, the Easter long weekend is a time to celebrate the arrival of spring, spend quality time with family, and exchange gifts such as chocolates and sweets with loved ones. This year, Easter celebrations will be different due to the pandemic. All but essential workers will need to stay home and practise physical distancing in order to help keep everyone safe and healthy. However, we can still enjoy a meal with those in our household and connect with loved ones by phone, email or videochat. Please think of our seniors and those facing hard times, and consider reaching out or dropping off necessities for them. For the kids worried about whether the Easter Bunny will come this year, don't worry. Earlier this week, I declared the Easter Bunny's delivery of chocolates and candy an essential service. The Easter Bunny will still be hopping about, while following the rules of physical distancing and avoiding public areas to keep us all protected and ensuring everyone can enjoy this special time. From my family to yours, I want to wish everyone a safe and healthy holiday at home. Happy Easter!""

April 11, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Thousands of businesses and private citizens have stepped up and offered to help the Ontario government defeat COVID-19. On March 21, Premier Doug Ford launched the Ontario Together web portal appealing to Ontario's manufacturers, entrepreneurs and innovators to provide essential supplies and equipment to support front line workers in their fight against the pandemic. To date, the portal has received over 14,000 submissions offering to provide everything from hand sanitizer, to gowns and coveralls, to masks and face shields, to testing equipment and ventilators.
""Since our initial call to action was issued, we have had a tremendous response from Ontario businesses,"" said Premier Ford. ""These go-getters have stepped up in a big way to support our frontline workers with medical supplies and equipment, and many more are coming forward with a variety of innovative solutions. We have mobilized our manufacturing firepower and are converting it into Canada's manufacturing workshop. But we need to enlist even more of our entrepreneurial leaders in order to stop this virus in its tracks."" More than 7,500 emergency supply submissions have generated nearly $90 million in purchases of critical equipment and supplies. These include: 5.1 million gloves20 million masks250,000 face shields50,000 units of clip-on hand sanitizer for OPP officers""When we put out the call to the business community for help, they quickly mobilized to meet the need for essential supplies and personal protective equipment,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""It's heartening to see how many made-in-Ontario solutions have been offered to directly help those on the frontlines. This incredible response demonstrates the strength of the Ontario Spirit in our business community and world-class manufacturing sector."" Over 1,200 submissions were received for the first three challenges to support the delivery of mental health solutions to vulnerable populations, ensure the strength of our supply chains and deliver financial advice to the small business community. The government's next challenge will call for ideas on how to support remote learning, with new challenges posted to the Ontario Together web portal on a regular basis. To support the development of proposals submitted by businesses and individuals through the Ontario Together web portal and help businesses retool their operations, the government launched the $50 million Ontario Together Fund. All submissions received through the portal are being reviewed and prioritized to focus on solutions that can respond to where the need is greatest and can be implemented quickly.

Ontario Takes Further Action to Stop the Spread of COVID-19 
Province Extends Emergency Orders until April 23

April 11, 2020  8:00 A.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — To help stop the spread of COVID-19 and protect the health and safety of people across the province, the Ontario government has extended all emergency orders that have been put in place to-date under s.7.0.2 (4) of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act until April 23, 2020, including the closure of outdoor amenities in parks and recreational areas, non-essential workplaces, public places and bars and restaurants, along with restrictions on social gatherings and the prohibition of price gouging.
In addition, new measures have been introduced to address surge capacity in retirement homes, restrict recreational camping on Crown land, and allow the repurposing of existing buildings and temporary structures. All of these actions are based on the advice of Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health. ""I understand the actions we are taking are affecting the lives and livelihoods of people across the province, but these are extraordinary times and we need to do whatever we can to keep individuals and families safe and stop the spread of this terrible virus,"" said Premier Ford. ""We all must continue to do our part by staying home and practicing physical distancing. With the proper precautions and additional measures we're taking today, I am confident we will get through this together and stronger."" Ontario introduced the following new steps to help stop the spread of COVID-19. The government is: Making it easier to repurpose existing buildings and put up temporary structures, like tents, so communities can meet their local needs quickly. This will reduce pressure on health care facilities, where needed, and help shelters provide more space for sleeping to maintain the physical distancing requirements to reduce the spread of the virus.Temporarily enabling hospitals to increase their capacity by using the beds and services of retirement homes without certain labour relations implications during the declared provincial emergency.Prohibiting recreational camping on Crown land as of April 9, 2020. Under the emergency order, no individual can camp on Crown land, including the placement of tents or other camping structures, while the order is in effect. The government will continue to monitor the situation and re-evaluate if further actions are required.Supporting construction workers and businesses with emergency action to help improve cash flow in the construction industry during the COVID-19 outbreak. This will lift the suspension of limitation periods and procedural time periods under the Construction Act and allow the release of holdback payments to contractors and subcontractors.The following emergency orders have been extended until April 23, 2020: Closure of public places and establishments with exemption for emergency child care for health care and frontline essential service workersProhibiting events and gatherings of more than five peopleWork deployment for health service providersDrinking water and sewageElectronic service of documentsWork deployment for long-term care homesElectricity pricingClosure of non-essential workplacesTraffic managementStreamlining requirements for long-term care homesProhibiting unfair pricing for necessary goodsEnforcement of ordersWork deployment for boards of healthWork deployment measures in retirement homesAccess to COVID-19 status information by specified personsService agencies providing services and supports to adults with developmental disabilitiesPick up and delivery of cannabisSignatures in wills and powers of attorneyUse of force and firearms in policing servicesClosure of outdoor recreational amenities"

Ontario Protects Parents during COVID-19
Province Prevents Operators from Charging Fees while Child Cares are Closed

April 10, 2020  2:30 P.M.

Ministry of Education


TORONTO — During the COVID-19 outbreak, the Ontario government is temporarily preventing child care centres from collecting payments from parents, while also ensuring that their child care spaces are protected. Child care centres, with the exception of those accommodating health care and other frontline workers, were ordered closed to help prevent the spread of the virus and keep the children and child care staff safe.  
An emergency order has been issued, and immediately prevents any child care operator from charging parent fees where care is not being provided. The order also means that parents cannot lose their child care space because they are not paying fees during this period. This will help provide much needed relief for parents during the outbreak. ""COVID-19 has imposed significant financial pressure on working parents,"" said Stephen Lecce, Education Minister. ""We need to support our parents who may be facing reduced income or layoffs during the COVID-19 outbreak."" The child care sector, like many others, is facing significant financial pressures. Child care providers can seek supports for businesses and individuals under the federal government's Economic Response Plan. ""We are defending the interests of consumers and protecting parents' hard-earned money by ordering child care centres to stop charging fees for services not rendered,"" said Minister Lecce. ""From protecting health and safety, to jobs and incomes, we will do whatever it takes to get our province and our incredibly resilient people through this.""  The Ontario government will continue to work with the child care sector and federal, municipal and First Nations partners on a plan to ensure the sustainability of the sector during the outbreak.

Quick Facts

Child care centres have been ordered to close through a provincial Emergency Order. 
Some child care centres that are providing child care for health care and other frontline workers, and home-based child care providers (licensed and unlicensed), are permitted to continue to operate
Over 1 million applications have been received through Ontario’s Support for Families. The simple online application gives parents a one-time payment of $200 for each child aged 0 to 12, or $250 for children 21 years old or younger with special needs.

Ontario Significantly Expanding COVID-19 Testing
Enhanced testing strategy will help stop the spread of the virus

April 10, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — To stop the spread of COVID-19, the Ontario government is implementing the next phase of its strategy to significantly expand and enhance testing. In addition to the ongoing testing of the general public at any of the 100 assessment centres now established across the province, Ontario will be proactively testing several priority groups, including:
Hospital inpatients;Residents of long-term care and retirement homes;Health care workers, caregivers, care providers, paramedics, and first responders, including police and firefighters;Remote, isolated, rural and Indigenous communities;Other congregate living centres, including homeless shelters, prisons and group homes;Specific vulnerable populations, including patients undergoing chemotherapy or hemodialysis and requiring transplants, as well as pregnant persons, newborns and cross-border workers; andOther essential workers, as defined by provincial orders.""We're laser-focused on ramping up our testing capacity so we can protect the most vulnerable in our communities and those who protect them, like our frontline health care workers and first responders,"" said Premier Ford. ""By expanding our testing capacity, we will be able to find cases faster, intervene earlier, reduce the spread, and save lives."" By implementing this strategy, Ontario expects to double the number of tests processed each day to 8,000 by April 15, 2020 and 14,000 by April 29, 2020, at which point overall lab capacity will have been further expanded. ""By significantly increasing the number of tests each day, we will identify cases early, contain them and prevent putting more people at risk,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""Doing so is especially important for priority groups like hospital inpatients, long-term care home residents and our brave frontline health care workers and first responders, all of whom are more vulnerable to being exposed to this virus. Nothing is more important than protecting their health and wellbeing."" This testing strategy follows extensive efforts to expand Ontario's lab testing capacity, which helped to quickly eliminate a backlog of approximately 10,000 people within less than two weeks. To date, the province has conducted over 94,000 tests. The province has re-established same-day testing results, which are now conveniently accessible to patients through a new user-friendly online portal. This portal will help ease pressure on public health units and frontline workers, allowing them to focus their efforts on combating COVID-19. The province is also helping to significantly expand the capacity of public health units to conduct contact tracing and case management, both of which are critical to stopping the spread of the virus, by enabling the use of volunteers, including retired nurses and medical students. People who have tested negative for COVID-19 must still follow all precautions, including staying at home except to pick up essential supplies like groceries and prescriptions, and keeping at least two-meters apart from others. While an individual may receive a negative test at a given moment in time, the individual is still able to contract and spread the virus.

Quick Facts

Testing guidelines have been provided to health-system partners, including public health units, assessment centres, primary care settings and long-term care homes. Guidelines are forthcoming for specific vulnerable populations and essential workers. The province will also provide guidelines to begin targeted surveillance by sampling populations within northern towns. 
Ontario will continue to increase its testing capacity by leveraging hospital, community and research labs.
The province is also updating the list of symptoms related to COVID-19, including a hoarse voice, difficulty swallowing, loss of sense of smell or taste, diarrhea or nausea/vomiting. For seniors, there are additional symptoms including chills, delirium with no other obvious reason, falls, acute functional decline, increased heart rate and decreased blood pressure. These updated symptoms are in addition to difficulty breathing, fever, cough, muscle aches, fatigue, headache, sore throat and runny nose.
All Ontarians should stay home unless for essential reasons only, such as such as accessing health care services, shopping for groceries, picking up medication, walking pets when required, or supporting vulnerable community members with meeting essential needs. If you must leave your home, stay at least two meters apart from others.

Office of the Premier


Today, Premier Doug Ford issued the following statement to mark Good Friday:
""Christians across Ontario and around the world today will observe the sacred occasion of Good Friday and look forward with hope to the joy of Easter Sunday. Many of them will spend the day in prayer, fasting, and charitable giving to commemorate the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. While many will be unable to mark this day as they have traditionally done in the past, we strongly urge everyone to stay home and stay connected with loved ones by phone, email or virtual get-togethers. Many places of worship are working hard to connect the community of faith through the livestreaming or televising of services this weekend. I thank all of those who are doing their part to slow the spread of COVID-19 and practicing physical distancing. My thoughts today are especially with our frontline health care workers, first responders, correctional officers, and essential workers. Thank you for everything you do, and in many cases, special thanks to those who are working through the weekend to keep everyone safe and healthy. My heart also goes out to those who are struggling during this difficult period. Our government is working hard to fight this virus while supporting individuals, families and businesses. We will get through this. I wish everyone observing this solemn occasion a peaceful and prayerful Good Friday.""

TORONTO - Today, Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation issued the following statement regarding the Hamilton Transportation Task Force Report:
""I am pleased that we are one step closer to ensuring that the province's commitment of $1 billion in capital funding is invested in realistic and affordable transportation projects in Hamilton. The Task Force has recommended a list of proposed projects that will improve access to the transportation network, reduce congestion, and lower greenhouse gas emissions. In order to determine which of these projects will best serve the needs of Hamilton, the Task Force has also recommended further analysis. To this end, I am asking Metrolinx and Infrastructure Ontario to conduct a technical review of the project options contained in the report. In the interest of full transparency, I am also releasing the report to stakeholders and the public. I would like to thank Chair Tony Valeri and the members of the Hamilton Transportation Task Force, Richard J. Brennan, Anthony V. Primerano, Dr. Saiedeh Razavi and Janette Smith, for their recommendations on transportation options for the City of Hamilton. Our government remains committed to ensuring that the City of Hamilton gets the transit and transportation infrastructure it needs and deserves in order to connect people to places and jobs and ensure a seamless transit experience.""

TORONTO — The Government of Ontario is partnering with SPARK Ontario to help seniors and the most vulnerable stay connected and healthy as they self isolate during the COVID-19 outbreak.
SPARK Ontario is the province's first bilingual volunteer hub designed to direct volunteers to where they are needed most. The needs of each community vary, but groups across the province are looking for volunteers to help deliver food or medicines, run errands or check-up on seniors and the most vulnerable by phone or email while they self-isolate. ""During this difficult time, it is more important than ever that we come together to support the most vulnerable in our communities,"" said Raymond Cho, Minister for Seniors and Accessibility. ""By working with SPARK Ontario and with the support of the Ministry of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries, we are mobilizing the power of volunteers to help those most in need, especially our older adults and those with disabilities."" Volunteer organizations can visit www.sparkontario.ca to post volunteer opportunities available in their communities. Ontarians interested in volunteering are encouraged to check the website for opportunities to make a difference where they live.

Premier Ford Appoints Team to Develop Plan for Post-Pandemic Growth and Prosperity

April  9, 2020  1:20 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government has launched a new Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee which will focus on getting businesses up and running and people back to work after the COVID-19 pandemic is over. While the government's primary focus is on combatting the virus, supporting frontline health care workers and providing immediate relief to people and businesses, this new committee will be developing a plan to stimulate economic growth and job-creation in the weeks and months ahead.
""My heart goes out to those individuals and families who have been out of work, or whose business has closed through no fault of their own,"" said Premier Ford. ""I can assure each person affected by this crisis that we will do everything we can to support you, and get you back on the job as soon as possible. While our government battles this virus, members of our new Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee will roll up their sleeves and develop a roadmap to a stronger, more prosperous economy.""   The membership of the Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee includes:  • Rod Phillips, Chair, Minister of Finance  • Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade  • Peter Bethlenfalvy, President of the Treasury Board  • Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation  • Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health  • Ernie Hardeman, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs  • Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines and Minister of Indigenous Affairs  • John Yakabuski, Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry  • Laurie Scott, Minister of Infrastructure  • Lisa MacLeod, Minister of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries  • Lisa Thompson, Minister of Government and Consumer Services  • Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development  • Prabmeet Sarkaria, Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction  The Committee will be consulting with a wide variety of people to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the provincial economy and develop an action plan to move forward, including business associations, chambers of commerce, municipal leaders, corporate leaders, small business owners, and entrepreneurs. ""While we focus our energy and resources on defeating COVID-19, today's job numbers highlight why we also need to plan for an economic recovery,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. ""At Premier Ford's request, I have convened the Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee. And our first order of business is to prepare for the next phase of Ontario's Action Plan, which will be ready to launch as soon as COVID-19 is contained. This team will get our economy moving again ― with a focus on job creation, opportunities for growth, and protecting our province from future threats."" Today, Statistics Canada released its monthly job numbers, which showed a 402,800 decrease in employment in Ontario. To support the provincial effort to deal with this crisis, the government launched Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19. This is a $17 billion package with funding targeted to help families and a variety of sectors across the province. In addition to $3.3 billion in more health care resources, the plan includes $3.7 billion to support people and jobs, and relief of $6 billion by temporarily deferring taxes for 100,000 Ontario businesses, $1.9 billion to allow employers to defer Workplace Safety and Insurance Board payments, and $1.8 billion to defer municipal education property tax payments. The government is also providing $52 million from the package to better support individuals and families in financial crisis through social assistance. This funding will support those who are not able to access federal assistance to cover needs such as food costs, rent, medicine and other essential services during this time. Individuals can easily apply online for assistance. To support small businesses, the Ontario government has also worked with the federal government to develop the Small and Medium-sized Enterprise Loan that will enable up to $40 billion in lending, supported through Export Development Canada and the Business Development Bank. This new program will help businesses meet cash flow requirements through guaranteed loans. ""Our government is pulling out all the stops to support our job creators and workers today, during this very difficult time,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""But it is incumbent upon us to look ahead and map out a plan that considers life after COVID-19, a plan that will guide us into a future filled with hope, new employment opportunities and steady economic growth."" ""While the health and safety of Ontarians is our top priority, we need to ensure that our province is positioned to support and facilitate economic growth when we lift the State of Emergency,"" said Peter Bethlenfalvy, President of the Treasury Board. ""This starts with the Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee, which will ensure we have a long-term, strategic vision to responsibly reopen our economy.""

OECTA Central Agreement Now Ratified


April  9, 2020  8:15 A.M.

Ministry of Education


The central agreement with the Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association (OECTA) representing 45,000 teachers across the province, including elementary and secondary teachers has been ratified by school boards and the union, and agreed to by the Government of Ontario.
The government focused on ending the impasse with OECTA and delivered on its commitment to reach a deal that protects our children's futures and invests in their potential, while being fair to teachers. Collective agreements between school boards and OECTA include central terms and local terms. The central terms are now resolved. In order to complete the collective bargaining process, local terms need to be reached between each school board and its OECTA bargaining units. The agreement was reached on March 12 between OECTA, OCSTA, and the Crown.The three-year collective agreements will be effective September 1, 2019, through August 31, 2022. HIGHLIGHTS OF THE CENTRAL AGREEMENT Compensation and benefits: Under the agreement, OECTA teachers will receive a one per cent wage increase per year, for three years. Consistent with Protecting a Sustainable Public Sector for Future Generations Act, 2019, the agreement allows for inflationary increases to the funding for existing benefits so members shouldn't suffer a reduction to their existing benefits, along with a 1% enhancement. Supports for Students Fund: The government will fund $33.5 million in the 2020-2021 school year and $33.8 million in the 2021-2022 school year. The fund shall be allocated to create additional teacher positions to provide flexibility to address special education, mental health initiatives and STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) programming. Hiring practices: Thirty-five per cent of the hiring for vacant permanent teaching positions will now support the school boards' effort to promote merit and diversity in hiring practices and provide opportunity for mobility of teachers between boards.  For the remaining sixty-five per cent of the vacancies, hiring will be continued to be conducted based on seniority. Full-day kindergarten: The government is committed to maintaining full-day kindergarten and retaining the existing staffing model. Class size: There are no changes to class size for Ontario's youngest learners in Junior Kindergarten through Grade 3.  Provincial funding, and legislated class size restrictions provide class sizes for grades 4-8 to reflect an average class size of 24.5, and a change for grades 9-12 to reflect an average class size of 23 which is effectively the same as 2019-2020 school year. Online Learning (E-Learning): The government is also moving forward with a requirement that Ontario students entering Grade 9 in the 2020-2021 school year will be required to complete two mandatory online learning courses in order to graduate. Exemptions to the requirement can be made for reasons such as to accommodate individual students with learning needs, students who have issues accessing technology and newcomers to Ontario who enter secondary school after Grade 9. The request for an exemption can be made by a parent/guardian or the student who has reached the age of 18 through a set process.

TORONTO — Today, Minister of Education Stephen Lecce, issued the following statement in response to the ratification of the central agreement with the Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association (OECTA) and the Ontario Catholic School Trustees' Association (OCSTA):
""I would like to congratulate OECTA and OCSTA for the ratification of the 2019-22 central agreement, the first deal reached with Ontario teachers. We will continue to advance efforts that improve and modernize Ontario's education system and serve the needs of students and their families, while being fiscally responsible. Our aim is to ensure our system is responsive and adaptive to the challenges on the horizon, and we have full confidence that educators will rise to the challenge and work hard to ensure students learn and succeed.  Like our deals with the Education Workers' Alliance of Ontario (EWAO) and the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), our primary objective was to provide predictability and certainty to parents, students and educators alike. The time is now for the outstanding deals - parents deserve predictability.""

Public should exercise caution as bears come out of hibernation

April  8, 2020  5:00 P.M.

Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry


The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry and the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) remind you to exercise caution as bears begin to come out of hibernation this spring.
Black bears waking up from hibernation are faced with a scarcity of natural food sources, leading them to look for food in garbage cans and bird feeders. You can prevent bears from visiting your home and neighbourhood by:   Storing garbage in waste containers with tight-fitting lids Putting out garbage only on the morning of pickup Putting away bird feeders for the spring (you can offer birds natural alternatives, such as flowers, nesting boxes and fresh water) Cleaning food residue and grease from outdoor barbecue grills after each use Keeping pet food indoors  Bears that enter your community are not necessarily a threat, but it is important to know who to call if you encounter a bear. For non-emergencies, the province operates a toll-free Bear Wise reporting line (1-866-514-2327). The line is open 24/7 from April 1 to November 30. If a bear is posing an immediate threat by exhibiting threatening or aggressive behaviour, remain calm and call 911 or your local police department.

Quick Facts

Visit Bear Wise at Ontario.ca to learn more about how to avoid attracting bears and what to do if you encounter one.
Bears will remember their last source of food and return there when hungry, sometimes travelling over 100 kilometres.

Extending Construction Hours Will Help Keep Ontario Workers Safe

April  8, 2020  1:15 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — In response to the outbreak of COVID-19, Ontario is extending construction hours for essential construction projects, like critical projects in the health care sector, to 24 hours a day. Work on new hospital builds, expansions, and COVID-19 assessment centres will be able to continue any time of the night or day in order to help accelerate the construction of these important projects and enable employers to take additional steps to protect the health and safety of workers on these job sites.
Premier Doug Ford, Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development, and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, today announced extended construction hours and other measures to keep Ontario workplaces safe. ""During this escalating crisis, we are taking immediate steps to ensure the necessary infrastructure is in place, particularly to properly care for those with severe COVID-19 symptoms and other patients who require critical care,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""That's why we're extending construction hours to allow us to build essential infrastructure faster, while ensuring construction workers can practice physical distancing on work sites to stay safe and healthy."" Ontario will temporarily limit local noise bylaws from applying to these types of essential construction activities beginning April 7, 2020. This will allow for expedited construction on key facilities, such as new hospital builds, expansions, temporary COVID-19 response units or structures, and COVID-19 assessment centres. Extending hours for essential construction will also give worksite managers more flexibility to stagger shifts, limit the number of people in one place, and take reasonable precautions to keep workers safe and healthy under the recent guidelines issued by Ontario's Chief Prevention Officer for construction sites. Ontario is also making essential workplaces across the province safer during the COVID-19 pandemic by: Redeploying more than 30 employment standards officers to help businesses understand and comply with health and safety requirements;Working with health and safety associations to deploy up to 30 specialists to support employers and workers in the field;Issuing health and safety guidance notes to support specific sectors;Doubling the capacity of Ontario's Health and Safety Call Centre from 25 to 50 phonelines;Providing job-protected leave under the Employment Standards Act for workers who need to self-isolate or care for a loved one because of COVID-19;Issuing a call to recently-retired inspectors who may be able and willing to return to their positions;Providing compliance assistance and enforcing the emergency orders issued under the Emergency Measures and Civil Protection Act.""Our government is doing everything in its power to make sure workers on the job are safe during this pandemic,"" said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""That means more inspections, more inspectors, more phone lines, and more people to take your calls. We have conducted thousands of inspections and investigations across the province in March and we will continue to conduct more this month. We will do everything in our power to keep the essential workers of our province safe."" ""We're helping to protect the health and safety of construction workers and ensure that critical health care-related construction projects continue during this outbreak,"" said Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. ""Temporarily limiting noise bylaws to extend the hours for construction work will help make it possible to stagger shifts and have fewer workers on site at any given time so they can practice physical distancing."" ""As part of our plan to stop the spread of COVID-19, we are continuing to expand health care capacity in communities across the province,"" said Minister Elliott. ""That includes building new assessment centres and field hospitals, both of which are critical to ensuring we are able to care for Ontarians as we contain this new virus. Extended hours will ensure that work on these facilities continues safely to the benefit of all Ontarians.""

Quick Facts

All Ontarians should stay home unless absolutely necessary for essential reasons, such as such as accessing health care services, shopping for groceries, picking up medication, walking pets when required, or supporting vulnerable community members with meeting essential needs. If you must leave your home, stay at least two (2) meters apart from others.
If you think you may have COVID-19 symptoms or have been in close contact with someone who has it, first self-isolate and then use Ontario's Self-Assessment Tool to see if you need to seek further care.
Take these everyday steps to reduce exposure to the virus and protect your health: wash your hands often with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer; sneeze and cough into your sleeve; avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth; avoid contact with people who are sick; and stay home if you are sick.

Premier Doug Ford Brings Passover Greetings to Ontario's Jewish Community


April  8, 2020  7:30 A.M.

Office of the Premier


Today, Premier Doug Ford issued the following statement to mark the beginning of Passover:
""This evening at sundown, the Jewish community across Ontario and around the world will begin the eight-day celebration of Passover. Passover commemorates the Exodus and liberation of the Israelites from bondage in ancient Egypt. It is a celebration of freedom, faith, and the tremendous perseverance of the Jewish people. It is a time to reflect on the blessings we have and remember those around the world who still struggle for basic rights and freedoms. This year, we understand communities may not be able to celebrate the same as in the past. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, everyone must stay home and practice physical distancing. We encourage you to find ways to stay connected and celebrate with loved ones and friends in different ways, by phone or video chat, as we all do our part to slow the spread of COVID-19 and keep everyone safe and healthy. While looking forward to the day when everyone can join the Seder table together again, I hope this serves as a time to reflect upon the cherished traditions and customs that keep Jewish families and communities united during this difficult time.   On behalf of the people of Ontario, I wish everyone a peaceful and joyous Passover. Chag Pesach sameach!""

Over $37 million committed to support outbreak planning, prevention and mitigation

April  7, 2020  3:00 P.M.

Ministry of Indigenous Affairs


TORONTO- As part of Ontario's Action Plan: Response to COVID-19, the Ontario government is investing over $37 million to support outbreak planning, prevention and mitigation efforts to ensure the health and well-being of Indigenous people and communities — particularly those in remote and far-northern regions.
""Indigenous communities face unique challenges in planning for and tackling the COVID-19 outbreak,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Indigenous Affairs. ""We are working closely with Indigenous leaders and making critical investments to ensure Indigenous people and communities have the necessary tools and supports in place to stop the spread of COVID-19."" The funding will respond to the unique needs of First Nations, Métis and Inuit people and families across the province. The total of $37.8 million includes:  $16.4 million from the Ministry of Indigenous Affairs to provide emergency funds for food, household goods, critical supplies, transportation, and support and care, responsive services and supports for urban Indigenous people, self-isolation facilities in remote and northern communities, prevention and awareness efforts, and pandemic planning;$10 million from the Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services to support Indigenous communities and agencies in responding to the needs of vulnerable children, families and elders during the outbreak;$7.4 million from the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing to help social service providers, charities and non-profits delivering critical housing services to Indigenous people living off-reserve; and$4 million from the Ministry of Transportation to ensure continued service to remote and northern airports, enabling essential goods and services to continue reaching isolated communities. ""We know the continuation of social services is critical to the unique needs of First Nations, Inuit, Métis and urban Indigenous communities. We're committed to responding to those needs now and as they continue to develop,"" said Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services.  In addition to this funding, the government is working with the Indigenous business community to assess how to address the impacts of COVID-19 on Indigenous businesses, economies and workers.   ""We are acting quickly to support Indigenous people living off-reserve who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless during this unprecedented time,"" said Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. ""This funding will go straight to Indigenous service providers, who know best what the immediate needs are on the ground."" The Ministry of Transportation (MTO) owns and operates 29 airports, with 26 serving remote First Nations communities. These airports provide a vital link to Indigenous communities, enabling shipments of essential supplies, such as food, fuel and water, and connecting essential services, including health care, education and social services. The ministry will work cooperatively with Indigenous communities wishing to enact their own measures related to the COVID-19 outbreak, including consideration of requests for the full or partial closures of MTO airports. ""We recognize these airports are lifelines to the communities they serve, many of which are isolated,"" said Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation. ""Our investment will ensure that critical services and goods continue to be available to First Nations and northern communities.""

Province Launches Online Portal to Match Available Health Care Workers with Employers

April  7, 2020  1:15 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government is taking further action to stop the spread of COVID-19 by actively recruiting health care workers to increase the frontline capacity of hospitals, clinics, and assessment centres. Today, the province is launching a new online tool that will help match skilled frontline workers with employers.
The new Health Workforce Matching Portal will enable health care providers with a range of experience to join the province's response to COVID-19. Those providers include retired or non-active health care professionals, internationally educated health care professionals, students, and volunteers with health care experience. The portal will efficiently match the availability and skillsets of frontline health care workers to the employers in need of assistance to perform a variety of public health functions, such as case and contact management. ""Our health care heroes on the frontlines of this battle are doing extraordinary work, but they need reinforcements to step up and lend a hand to help defeat this virus,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""Whether you're retired or in training, we can't afford to have people with professional health care skills who want to help sitting on the sidelines during this crisis. This is a call to action and I encourage every available person with health care experience to get involved."" Employers and interested health care professionals can visit the portal here and create a profile. Once registered, professionals can add their availability and employers can enter their request for support. Registrants will receive an email notification if matched. ""Since the beginning of this outbreak, we have heard from thousands of volunteers who want to help in any way they can,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""We are very grateful for those stepping up during these unprecedented times. That's why we are using everything possible to support these frontline healthcare workers as they fight the spread of this virus."" On April 1, Ontario issued a new emergency order under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, to enhance the public health units' human resources capacity and support their ongoing fight against COVID-19.

TORONTO — Today, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General, issued the following statement regarding new emergency measures to protect Ontario's first responders and stop the spread of COVID-19:
""First responders put their lives on the line every day to protect Ontarians and they are at great risk of being directly exposed to COVID-19 as they fulfill their frontline duties. We must do everything in our power to ensure the health and well-being of those working on the frontlines and provide them with the tools they need to do their jobs and keep Ontarians safe. With their safety and health in mind, our government has made an emergency order that will allow police, firefighters and paramedics to obtain COVID-19 positive status information about individuals with whom they are coming into contact. During this pandemic, it is crucial that our first responders have access to this critical information when they are preparing to respond to an emergency in order to protect themselves and the public and help stop the spread of this virus. The information disclosed will be limited to an individual's name, address, date of birth, and whether the individual has had a positive COVID-19 test result. Strict protocols will be enforced to limit access to this information and will only be used to allow first responders to take appropriate safety precautions to protect themselves and the communities they serve. Once the declaration of emergency is lifted, this data will be made inaccessible to first responders. We will continue to take decisive action to stop the spread of COVID-19 and protect the health and safety of all Ontarians.""

Province Deferring Provincial Land Tax Payments for 90 Days

April  6, 2020  2:00 P.M.

Ministry of Finance


TORONTO — During the COVID-19 outbreak, the Ontario government is deferring $15 million in property taxes for people and businesses in parts of Northern Ontario located outside of municipal boundaries. This tax deferral builds on the $10 billion in cash flow supports made available to people and businesses as part of Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19. 
""Our government is taking action to protect every person and every business across Ontario during this unprecedented time, including remote parts of Northern Ontario,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. ""All communities are feeling the impacts of this global outbreak. That's why we're providing a measure of relief for the owners of over 63,000 residential and business properties outside municipal boundaries."" Through these measures, Ontario is giving taxpayers in unincorporated areas more time to pay each of the four 2020 Provincial Land Tax installments. Taxpayers will have 90 extra days to pay without incurring interest or penalties.  For example, taxpayers who would be required to pay the April 7 property tax installment will have until July 6 to pay without interest or penalties. This action is complementary to new support for municipalities that was announced in Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19. In this plan, the Province announced it is deferring the upcoming quarterly (June 30) remittance of education property tax to school boards by 90 days. This will provide municipalities with the flexibility to, in turn, provide property tax deferrals of over $1.8 billion to local residents and businesses. ""Additional cash flow during these tough times can help keep food on the table for people in every corner of the province,"" said Minister Phillips. ""That's why we've made $10 billion in cash flow support available through tax and other deferrals as part of Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19. The Province is doing its part and we're grateful to our partners in the other levels of government for doing theirs.""

Quick Facts

The Provincial Land Tax is the property tax paid in unincorporated areas of northern Ontario outside municipal boundaries. The Province directly collects this tax to help fund community services, such as policing, land ambulance, public health and social services in unincorporated areas. 
This deferral of unincorporated area property tax payments applies to all of the levies that are collected through the consolidated Provincial Land Tax bill. This includes Provincial Land Tax, education property tax, and any Local Road Board and Local Service Board levies that are paid through the Provincial Land Tax bill.
To ensure this deferral does not have a financial impact on Local Roads and Services Boards, which provide additional services in these remote communities, the Province will continue to make payments to these partners, as scheduled. In addition, to ensure this does not have a financial impact on school boards, the Province will adjust payments to school boards to offset the deferral.
Ontario’s Action Plan: Responding to COVID 19 includes $7 billion in direct supports for health care, people and jobs and makes available approximately $10 billion in support for people and businesses through tax and other deferrals to improve their cash flows. This $17 billion plan outlines the government’s first steps in response to COVID-19.

Province Providing One-time Financial Assistance During School and Child Care Closures 

April  6, 2020  1:15 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government is offering direct financial support to parents while Ontario schools and child care centres remain closed as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.
The new Support for Families initiative offers a one-time payment of $200 per child 0 to 12 years of age, and $250 for those 0 to 21 years of age with special needs. The announcement was made today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education. ""During this extraordinary time, we're doing everything we can to support parents to keep everyone safe and ensure our children continue to learn and stay mentally active,"" said Premier Ford. ""This one-time funding will allow parents to access additional tools for our kids to use while at home and studying remotely. I want to remind everyone to stay at home and only go out if absolutely necessary. It's the only way we are going to defeat this terrible virus."" ""Our aim during these extraordinarily challenging times is to continue supporting those impacted hardest by the COVID-19 outbreak — Ontario families,"" said Minister Lecce. ""School and child care closures have disrupted family life a great deal and our government will do whatever it takes to support them and keep them safe. This funding will flow to parents directly, to offer them immediate relief during this difficult time."" Families can complete a simple online application at Ontario's Support for Families web page to access this financial support. Parents already receiving Support for Parents payments through direct deposit will be automatically eligible for this financial support and do not need to submit a new application. ""As we reach a critical juncture in our fight against COVID-19, it's important schools and child care centres remain closed,"" said Minister Elliott. ""Keeping Ontarians safe is our number one priority and it's also our duty to help parents who are supporting their children and families during this unprecedented time."" Through this initiative the government is providing over $300 million in relief to parents across Ontario as part of Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19. ""With schools and child care closed, life has become more difficult for families and they need some extra help,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. ""Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19, includes $7 billion in direct support for people and jobs, and $10 billion in cash flow support for people and businesses. This $17 billion plan includes direct relief for parents when they need it the most.""

Quick Facts

Ontario public schools will remain closed to teachers until Friday, May 1, 2020, and to students until Monday, May 4, 2020, to keep Ontario’s students safe from COVID-19. Private schools, licensed child care centres and EarlyON programs will also remain closed until April 13, according to the Declaration of Emergency, which only allows closures to be extended for one 14-day period at a time.
On March 22, Ontario announced its effort to support health care and frontline workers with emergency child care services across the province. Frontline workers who make use of these services are also eligible for this one-time payment.
The Government reiterated its focus on positive mental health supports for students dealing with the challenges of COVID-19. Premier Ford announced an investment of up to $12 million to deliver online and virtual mental health supports across our province, supporting students, families and frontline workers. 
Ontario launched the second phase of Learn at Home and Apprendre à la maison, a new online portal that provides resources for families so students can continue their education while schools are closed due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation.

Province providing relief funding for residential service providers that support vulnerable populations

April  4, 2020  3:00 P.M.

Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services


TORONTO — As part of the Government of Ontario’s efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19, the province is investing up to $40 million to support organizations that provide residential services for children and youth, people with developmental disabilities and emergency shelters for women and families fleeing domestic violence.
The COVID-19 Residential Relief Fund will cover costs such as additional staffing, residential respite for caregivers; personal protective equipment and supplies; initiatives to support physical distancing and transportation to minimize client exposure.  “Our government is doing everything it can to help Ontario’s most vulnerable get through this difficult and challenging time,”  said Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services “I want to personally thank all the staff and managers who are working on the frontlines of the developmental services sector for keeping our most vulnerable citizens safe during this unprecedented time. You exemplify the true Ontario spirit each and every day.”  Ontario is also taking action to help ensure that staffing and resources are available to help care for and protect people with developmental disabilities and the frontline workers who support them. These temporary measures provide further flexibility for developmental service agencies to redirect their staffing and financial resources to essential tasks that keep individuals with developmental disabilities safe and out of hospital. The Relief Fund will also help address increased residential costs that emergency shelters for women fleeing domestic violence and survivors of human trafficking are facing at this time. “This is a trying time for everyone, as we continue to stay at home to stop the spread of COVID-19, but we know that home isn’t safe for everyone. That’s why it’s critical during this time that residential organizations for people fleeing violence have the security they need to continue supporting vulnerable women,” said Jill Dunlop, Associate Minister of Children and Women’s Issues.

New online portal connects employers with workers looking to make a difference

Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs


TORONTO - In order to ensure grocery store shelves remain full and families have food on the table during the COVID-19 outbreak, the Government of Ontario is launching a new web portal, connecting workers with employers looking to fill positions in the agri-food sector. This new online tool will make it easier to match people to essential jobs and training resources throughout the provincial food supply chain.
""Right now, there are important jobs that need to be filled across the food supply chain and we are looking for individuals who embody the Ontario spirit to step up and provide an essential service,"" said Ernie Hardeman, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. ""From farm to fork, it's these dedicated heroes in the agri-food sector who are working through this difficult period each and every day to keep food on our kitchen tables."" Ontario's agriculture and food industry relies on hundreds of thousands of people to work in diverse jobs from farming and food processing to transport and food retail, and the need for workers in many other parts of the food system remains strong. Ontario.ca/AgFoodJobs provides access to information on job opportunities and training resources in all parts of Ontario's food supply chain - from grocery retailers to bakeries and cheese processing plants to opportunities on farms. ""Working in the agri-food sector is a great way to contribute to your community and join the thousands of hard-working men and women helping to feed the province during this unprecedented time,"" said Minister Hardeman. ""Our food supply chain is one of the strongest in the world and our government wants to thank all of the people who work everyday to ensure individuals and families can access healthy and nutritious Ontario-produced foods.""

Quick Facts

Ontario’s agri-food sector is comprised of primary agriculture, food, beverage and wholesale, and retail and food services.
In 2018, Ontario's agri-food industry employed more than 837,000 people, representing 11.6 per cent of the province’s labour force and contributed $47.7 billion in GDP to the provincial economy (6.6 per cent of total Ontario GDP).

Ontario Protecting Seniors in Retirement Homes During COVID-19 Outbreak


April  3, 2020  4:30 P.M.

Ministry for Seniors and Accessibility


TORONTO — Today, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Raymond Cho, Minister for Seniors and Accessibility, issued the following statement addressing concerns regarding staffing for retirement homes during the COVID-19 outbreak:
""As the province takes decisive action to safeguard the health and safety of Ontarians, we are taking immediate action to protect seniors living in retirement homes. A temporary order has been made under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act that will help retirement homes address emergency staffing needs as they respond to COVID-19. With this temporary action, retirement homes will have more flexibility to recruit and reassign staff to address the impacts of this new virus and will be able to focus more resources toward implementing the protocols and procedures put in place to keep residents safe. Retirement homes are also required to report any outbreak of COVID-19 to the Retirement Homes Regulatory Authority, as well as the local medical officer of health. These important measures are aligned with similar orders issued for hospitals and long-term care homes and will allow retirement homes to more quickly deploy personnel as needed. To further safeguard the health of seniors living in retirement homes our government has also amended the Retirement Homes Act, 2010 requiring that all retirement homes follow the Chief Medical Officer of Health's guidance and recommendations regarding infection control and prevention. We are also investing $20 million in additional funding to support increased infection control and active screening measures. Our government will continue to take decisive action to stop the spread of COVID-19 to protect the health and safety of Ontarians, especially Ontario's most vulnerable people.""

TORONTO - Attorney General Doug Downey announced the appointment of two new justices to the Ontario Court of Justice, effective April 16, 2020.
Justice Edward Prutschi was called to the bar in 2000 and opened his own criminal law practice that same year. He has represented clients on a diverse array of matters, including homicide and domestic violence cases. In addition to his own practice, Justice Prutschi has spent the past decade providing legal commentary and analysis for various media outlets, including the Toronto Sun, Newstalk 1010 and CTV News. Since 2016 he has served as a board member for the United Jewish Appeal Federation of Greater Toronto (UJA) and in 2018 he received the UJA's Shem Tov award for his volunteer service to Toronto's Jewish community. Chief Justice Lise Maisonneuve has assigned Justice Prutschi to Newmarket. Justice Lynn Robinson was called to the bar in 1991. Since 2012 she has worked as Crown counsel and regional coordinator in the Central West region. In this role, Justice Robinson recommended and implemented evidence-based solutions to help modernize the criminal justice system. She was lead counsel on an international fraud jury trial involving over 800 investors. Prior to this work, she was an assistant Crown attorney in Cornwall, London and Kitchener, working on a number of cases with victims and vulnerable people.

Ontario Provides Full Transparency by Releasing COVID-19 Modelling
Projected number of cases and deaths can be significantly reduced if people stay home

April  3, 2020  3:45 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO - Today, the Ontario government released extensive COVID-19 modelling, revealing several scenarios that project the potential number of cases and deaths. In doing so, the province is providing the public with full transparency about the consequences should everyone but essential workers fail to stay home and practice physical distancing.
""The models show that the potential to spread COVID-19 is massive and deadly if we don't act swiftly to stay home and practise physical distancing,"" said Premier Ford. ""We owe it to our frontline and essential workers, to our family, friends and neighbours to restrict our travel, and act responsibly. This is the only way we are going to minimize the risk to people, stop the spread and reduce the number of fatalities."" Key highlights from the modelling include: While COVID-19 impacts Ontarians of all ages, those over the age of 60 face higher risk of severe disease leading to higher mortality rates. The data demonstrates the need to focus public health measures on protecting seniors.Had Ontario taken no action, the impact of COVID-19 would have risen to an estimated 300,000 cases and an estimated death toll of 6,000 people.Due to timely public health measures, Ontario has avoided much more dire impacts, preventing an estimated 220,000 cases and 4,400 deaths to date.Over the course of the pandemic, between 3,000 and 15,000 deaths related to COVID-19 are predicted with current public health measures in place, compared to a total projected 100,000 deaths if no action were taken.By taking further measures, Ontario can further reduce the number of cases and deaths related to COVID-19 down to projections as low as 12,500 additional cases and 200 additional deaths by the end of April.On the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health, Ontario will continue to take decisive action to stop the spread of COVID-19. Most recently, the province banned organized public events and social gatherings of more than five people and closed all outdoor recreational amenities, such as sports fields and playgrounds. At the same time, the province's COVID-19 Command Table has been implementing extensive measures to build health-system capacity to prepare for increased hospitalizations. ""Ontario is entering a critical juncture in our fight against COVID-19,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""The numbers released today are sobering. While they reveal a disastrous path, they also serve as a call to arms for greater action. We have for months now been preparing for this very moment, but to avoid the worst-case scenario we are relying on every Ontarian to stay home to stop the spread of this virus. Lives depend on the public heeding this advice."" ""We feel is it important to be transparent with the public about the challenges we are facing, and the important work we all need to do to flatten the curve,"" said Dr. Peter Donnelly, President and CEO of Public Health Ontario. ""How this outbreak unfolds is in the hands of the public, in all of your hands. We can change the outcomes by how we all stay at home and physically distance ourselves.""

Quick Facts

Ontario has launched a new user-friendly online portal for the public to easily access their COVID-19 lab test results. By offering faster and secure access to test results on their computer or mobile device, this portal will help ease pressures on public health units and frontline workers to provide this information so that they can better focus on containing COVID-19.
On March 30, 2020, Dr. Williams issued a statement to strongly encourage Ontarians to stay home, limit the number of essential trips and adhere to physical distancing.
If you think you may have COVID-19 symptoms or have been in close contact with someone who has it, first self-isolate and then use Ontario's Self-Assessment Tool to see if you need to seek further care.
Take these everyday steps to reduce exposure to COVID-19 and protect your health: Wash your hands often with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer; Sneeze and cough into your sleeve; Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth; Avoid contact with people who are sick; and stay home if you are sick.

Ontario Extends Business Closures to Stop the Spread of COVID-19 
Additional Measures Necessary to Protect the Health and Safety of the People of Ontario 

April  3, 2020  2:15 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Following the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health, the Ontario government is reducing the list of businesses classified as essential and ordering more workplaces to close. This measure is necessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and protect the health of the people of Ontario, while ensuring that necessary goods and services remain available.
The government is ordering all businesses not covered by the updated Emergency Order to close effective as of Saturday, April 4, 2020 at 11:59 p.m. This closure will be in effect for 14 days, with the possibility of an extension as the situation evolves. Teleworking, online commerce and other innovative ways of working remotely are permitted at all times and are strongly encouraged for all businesses. All supply chains necessary for the production of vital food and healthcare supplies are being protected and remain intact. The updated essential businesses list can be found here. ""We are facing a critical moment in the fight against COVID-19 and we must do everything in our power to keep everyone safe and healthy and prevent our health care system from being overwhelmed,"" said Premier Ford. ""Everyone must do their part to stop the spread and flatten the curve. If you are not an essential business, you need to close your doors, work from home if possible and play a role to help contain this outbreak. This is a matter of life and death."" As a temporary measure the Ontario government has revised the list of essential businesses. The updated list will direct additional businesses to close and restricts specified businesses to providing services by alternate methods such as curb side pick up and delivery, except in exceptional circumstances. This includes stores that sell hardware products, vehicle parts and supplies, pet and animal supplies, office supplies and computer products and repairs and safety supplies. ""We have now reached a critical time in our fight against COVID-19."" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health ""Every step taken by the province and every effort made by each of us to avoid close contact with others are the key to our success as a province to stop the spread of this virus."" Only critical construction projects will continue, including industrial projects such as refineries and petrochemical plants and infrastructure projects such as new hospitals, roads and bridges. New starts in residential projects will stop, while residential construction that is near completion will continue. Business-owners with questions concerning their essential business status are encouraged to call the Stop the Spread hotline at 1-888-444-3659. The hotline is available from 8:30 a.m.― 9:00 p.m. Monday to Friday and 8:30 a.m.— 5:00 p.m. Saturday and Sunday.  ""We recognize the toll this outbreak is taking on business owners and workers,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""Ontario businesses are top of mind during this unprecedented time. We know that the only way to ensure the health of our businesses and our economy is to ensure the health of all Ontarians."" The government is implementing additional measures to protect frontline workers in essential businesses by adding more than 60 special consultants and officers and doubling the number of phone agents at its Health and Safety Call Centre to 50 to make it easier for workers to report safety concerns. Workers worried their workplaces are unsafe can phone 1-877-202-0008 to speak with an agent. ""If you're a worker on the frontlines of this outbreak, you should know we're doing everything in our power to keep you safe at work,"" said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""We're beefing up our inspectors and making it easier for you to report your concerns. We're working around the clock.""

TORONTO — To support public health units' extensive efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19, Ontario is taking further action to redirect existing resources to focus squarely on the fight against this new virus while allowing for public health units to considerably increase their capacity.
Ontario has launched a new user-friendly online portal for the public to easily access their COVID-19 lab test results. By offering faster and secure access to test results on their computer or mobile device, this portal will help ease pressures on public health units and frontline workers to provide this information so that they can better focus on containing COVID-19. ""With this new portal, patients will be able to access their test results faster from the safety of their home,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""It will help reduce the burden on our public health units and frontline health workers, allowing them to focus their efforts where they are needed most during this challenging time."" Ontario is also issuing a new emergency order under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, effective immediately, to provide public health units the authority and flexibility they need to make staffing decisions that support their ongoing fight against the outbreak of COVID-19, despite any collective agreements. As a result, public health units will be able to significantly expand their capacity to implement critical public health functions, such as case and contact management, through the use of volunteers, including the thousands of retired nurses and medical students who have signed up through the province's website. This latest order will support the recommendation made by Dr. David Williams, Chief Medical Officer of Health, for all public health units to implement more aggressive contact tracing and management in response to the increase of community transmission. The province's medical officers of health are also encouraged to use their authority under Section 22 of the Health Protection and Promotion Act to ensure isolation of cases and contacts of COVID-19. ""We are at a critical juncture in our fight against COVID-19,"" said Elliott. ""Our success as a province depends on our ability to quickly and effectively stop the spread of this new virus. These actions offer considerable support to our local health units and give them the authority they need to act and contain COVID-19 in our communities.""

Supporting emergency responders by restricting all outdoor fires in Ontario’s fire region during COVID-19 outbreak

April  2, 2020  2:00 P.M.

Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry


TORONTO — The Ontario government is taking action to protect people and communities from the risk of preventable human-caused fires and to ensure that the province's emergency response system remains strong during the COVID-19 outbreak.
Starting April 3, 2020, Ontario's entire legislated fire region will be designated a Restricted Fire Zone. Residents who live in an area with a restricted fire zone cannot have an outdoor fire—this includes burning of grass, debris and campfires, even when using an outdoor fire grate, fire place or fire pit. ""During this very challenging time when we are fighting the spread of the virus, our number one priority is the health and safety of the people of Ontario,"" said John Yakabuski, Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry. ""We are putting these important preventative measures in place now to ensure that our emergency responders are able to focus their efforts where they are needed most."" This restriction will remain in place until Ontario's ability to respond to emergencies is no longer impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. Local municipalities are working to update their websites with information for residents. Meanwhile, Ontarians can learn about the rules under a Restricted Fire Zone at ontario.ca/page/outdoor-fire-restrictions.

Additional Resources will Improve Access to Online and Virtual Supports 

April  2, 2020  1:15 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Ontario government is making it easier for everyone, especially those on the front lines, to reach out for mental health support during the COVID-19 outbreak. To improve access, the province is providing emergency funding of up to $12 million to immediately expand online and virtual mental health supports and $2.6 million to hire new psychologists and other mental health workers to support Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) personnel.
""Dealing with an evolving crisis like COVID-19 puts a lot of stress on everyone, including people who are self-isolating, families with kids out of school, and the frontline health care workers and first responders who are keeping us safe each and every day,"" said Premier Ford. ""This very difficult situation will impact different people in different ways, but I can assure everyone we will be there to support you and help you cope in every way we can. Clearly, protecting our health and well-being is everything, and that includes our mental health."" These services will help people experiencing anxiety, stress and other mental health challenges, including people who are unable to access their regular in-person counselling supports. These resources will address the needs of youth and adults and will include more dedicated supports for those working on the frontlines who are dealing with the difficult realities of COVID-19 every single day. ""It's never been more important for Ontarians to stay home to stop the spread of COVID-19,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""As they do, we need to provide them with the supports they need to stay mentally healthy during these challenging times as more Ontarians experience heightened anxiety and depression."" With this investment, mental health agencies will receive emergency funding to hire and train more staff and purchase necessary equipment, appropriate technology and additional licenses. The emergency funding will immediately expand services, based on evidence-informed cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), on a range of platforms including:   BounceBack: A guided self-help program for adults and youth aged 15 and over using workbooks with online videos and phone coaching support.Kids Help Phone: 24/7 virtual support service offering professional counselling, information and referrals as well as volunteer-led, text-based support to young people in both English and French at 1-800-668-6868.Internet-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (iCBT): Online CBT , supported by therapists; available in English and French.iCBT for frontline health care workers: Online CBT targeted at frontline health care workers experiencing anxiety, burnout or PTSD. Those requiring intensive levels of care could be referred to virtual face-to-face care. Training for Brief CBT-based interventions: Training will be provided to frontline workers in organizations such as Telehealth and emergency departments in order to better support individuals experiencing acute anxiety due to the pandemic.The hiring of additional mental health workers for the OPP is in response to four of the 66 recommendations made by the OPP Independent Review Panel (IRP) in its final report. Established in April 2019 to examine the OPP's workplace culture, the IRP was also tasked to look into how the OPP addresses issues of mental health, occupational stress injuries and suicide among its members and provide a series of recommendations. The funding will help the OPP hire mental health workers who will: Provide clinical services to members of all ranks and make referrals to external services if needed;Develop and deliver mental health support programming specific to unique policing needs (e.g. geographical, specialized services, cultural);Facilitate educational programs to both uniform and civilian members to reduce stigma and promote resiliency and access to help when facing mental health challenges; andProvide guidance in peer support programs.""The current COVID-19 outbreak reinforces how much we rely on front lines workers and why it is so important to look after their mental health and wellbeing,"" said Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General. ""With this new assistance, OPP personnel will get access to the mental health support they need to continue protecting our communities."" ""Many Ontarians, including our dedicated first responders, are experiencing increased anxiety because of COVID-19 and are worried about their health, the health of their family and friends, and the future of their livelihoods,"" said Michael Tibollo, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. ""We continue to work with our partners across the mental health and addictions sector to fund more innovative services such as internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy, ensuring Ontarians receive the high-quality care they expect and deserve."" Where to Find Help: For Ontarians currently receiving mental health and addictions services and supports, please contact your current service provider to learn about potential virtual care options.For Ontarians interested in public addictions services and mental health services for those over 18, they can contact ConnexOntario, Ontario's mental health, addictions and problem gambling help line at 1-866-531-2600.Children and youth under 18 can locate mental health services through the Ontario.ca and Kids Help Phone websites, or contact Kids Help Phone (1-800-668-6868) for 24/7 support, if they need someone to talk to.Good2Talk is a free, confidential mental health support service providing professional counselling and information and referrals for mental health, addictions and well-being to postsecondary students in Ontario, 24/7/365.

Attorney General announces $4 million to support victims and protect front-line justice staff

April  2, 2020 11:30 A.M.

Ministry of the Attorney General


TORONTO - Attorney General Doug Downey today announced emergency action to support victims of crime and protect front-line staff who continue to uphold the administration of justice in response to COVID-19.
The government of Ontario is providing an emergency payment of more than $2.7 million to support services for victims of domestic violence and other violent crimes during the COVID-19 crisis. ""Staying home is unfortunately not always the safest option in certain households and sadly a recent increase in domestic violence has been reported to front-line victim service organizations,"" said Attorney General Downey. ""This emergency payment will ensure victims of crime, particularly those who are experiencing domestic violence, get the help they need  to stay safe and healthy during this crisis."" This additional one-time emergency payment will help more than 50 community agencies across Ontario, including victim crisis assistance organizations (VCAOs), Indigenous organizations and those based in rural areas, stay operational and accessible to victims during the public health crisis. Funds will help front-line staff respond to challenges caused by the COVID-19 crisis and enhance access to immediate supports for victims, including extended hotels stays, and transportation and meal vouchers available through the Victim Quick Response Program Plus (VQRP+). ""During the COVID-19 health emergency, victim service providers are seeing a spike in domestic violence cases just as victims are left with fewer and fewer places to turn for help,"" said Ontario Network of Victim Service Provider President, Sheri MacDonald. ""The Attorney General and his staff understand what we're facing on the front lines and his cooperation and decisive action make a true difference for our clients."" Ontario is also working closely with justice partners to ensure critical services continue while keeping essential front-line workers and all Ontarians safe.  To support these efforts, the government is investing $1.3 million in technology to help courts and tribunals continue the transition to remote operations. Investments include additional laptops, conference lines and doubling the complement of digital recording devices for court use. This funding was announced on March 25th in Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19. Ontario's courts and tribunals continue to shift to audio and video conferencing to hear priority matters. To date, all courtrooms in the Ontario Court of Justice are operating remotely.

 Ontario Supports Trucking Sector for Keeping Goods Moving

Ministry of Transportation


TORONTO - Today, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation issued the following statement on supporting truck drivers during the COVID-19 outbreak:
""In these extraordinary times, we have extraordinary heroes. Our truck drivers are these heroes. They are working long hours, day and night delivering food and equipment and other essential supplies for Ontario families.   Our truck drivers deserve our respect, our support, our thanks and our best efforts to help them as they continue to make sure we can put food on our tables and pick up other necessary items.  We have heard from those working within the trucking industry of the treatment that truck drivers have faced while travelling on our roads. In response, we are calling on all business owners to support truck drivers when they are stopping to rest, get gas or use washrooms.  This will better keep our truck drivers safe and healthy and on the road.  We expect businesses who rely on truck drivers to provide necessary facilities for these heroes. We need everyone to do their part to make sure drivers can keep doing their jobs safely.  As a government we are working closely with truck drivers and associations to respond to the issues they face on the road. We are providing more safe places for truck drivers to stop and rest across the province and are keeping all 23 ONroute travel plazas open for take-out, grab and go and drive-through services, including washrooms with enhanced cleaning. We are also providing portable washrooms at 32 truck inspection stations so trucks have a place to stop and rest safely. These actions build on measures announced last month that allow the 24-hour delivery of goods without the restrictions of municipal noise by-laws, and the extension of the validation of driver's licences, Commercial Vehicle Operator's Registration certificates and other products that expired on or after March 1, 2020.  Ontario is committed to supporting the trucking industry and we would like to thank commercial carriers and truck drivers for everything that they've done to keep goods moving during the COVID-19 outbreak.""

April  1, 2020  1:15 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO ― To stop the spread of COVID-19 and keep people safe, the Ontario government is launching a new $50 million Ontario Together Fund to help businesses provide innovative solutions or retool their operations in order to manufacture essential medical supplies and equipment, including gowns, coveralls, masks, face shields, testing equipment and ventilators. This new Fund will support the development of proposals submitted by businesses and individuals through the Ontario Together web portal.
The announcement was made today by Premier Doug Ford, Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""Ontario has an army of innovators, entrepreneurs, and the hardest-working people in the world ready to roll up their sleeves, support our frontline healthcare workers, and beat this virus,"" said Premier Ford. ""This mass mobilization of government, business, communities and private citizens to slow the spread of COVID-19 and keep people safe and healthy represents one of the largest and most ambitious efforts undertaken by Ontario in generations."" In addition, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade have worked closely with businesses across Ontario and the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association to ramp up production of ventilators to meet the need in Ontario and other parts of Canada. The government has recently placed an order with O-Two Medical Technologies who, with the support of Ontario's world-class manufacturing sector, will produce 10,000 ventilator units. ""Our government is taking extraordinary measures to support businesses and organizations that are responding to COVID-19,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""It's inspiring to see the Ontario business community respond to the call to action. Through the Ontario Together web portal and the Ontario Together Fund, we are making sure that companies have the resources and support they need to supply emergency products and innovative solutions quickly and efficiently to help address this challenging time together."" The government will be looking for the most viable, innovative proposals that can quickly provide critical goods and services and the greatest benefit to the people of Ontario. The government is providing one-time funding of $50 million in 2020-21 during the COVID-19 outbreak. It is time-limited and will be available to companies and organizations across the province. ""The fight against COVID-19 presents significant challenges for small businesses, but their strength and ingenuity are key to weathering this storm,"" said Prabmeet Sarkaria, Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction. ""The Ontario Action Plan gives families and small businesses the supports they need. Ontario Together will link the resources of government with the capacity and #OntarioSpirit of our small businesses ― to manufacture the resources Ontario needs."" ""Only by working together and harnessing the full potential of Ontario's innovators will we be able to confront the growing challenge of COVID-19,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""The Ontario Together Fund will help enable our business community to provide the supplies and equipment our frontline heroes need as they continue to keep Ontarians safe.""

Public Required to Identify Themselves if Charged with Breaching an Emergency Order During the COVID-19 Outbreak


March 31, 2020  9:00 P.M.

Ministry of the Solicitor General


TORONTO — People who are being charged with an offence under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act (EMCPA) will be required to identify themselves if asked by a provincial offences officer, which includes police officers, First Nations constables, special constables and municipal by-law enforcement officers. This temporary power was approved by the Ontario government today through an emergency order to better protect people during this COVID-19 outbreak. 
""It is essential that measures are in place to allow provincial offences officers to lawfully require an individual to disclose their correct name, date of birth and address in order to protect our communities,"" said Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General. ""By providing provincial offences officers with this temporary power to obtain identifying information under the EMCPA, they will be able to enforce emergency orders during these extraordinary times."" Emergency orders currently in place to address the COVID-19 outbreak include the closure of non-essential businesses, prohibiting organized public events and social gatherings of more than five people and stopping price gouging on necessary goods such as disinfectant products. Failing to comply with any of these emergency orders is an offence under the EMCPA and so is the failure to identify oneself accurately.  Failing to correctly identify oneself carries a fine of $750 for failure to comply with an order made under the EMCPA or $1,000 for obstructing any person in exercising a power if a provincial offences officer issues a ticket. In addition, failure to comply with an emergency order could carry punishments of up to one-year imprisonment or a fine of up to $100,000 for an individual, $500,000 for a director of a corporation, or $10,000,000 for a corporation itself if a provincial offences officer charges the individual by issuing a summons. These penalties apply in addition to the penalties for breaching other emergency orders. ""It is the responsibility of all Ontarians to do their part and respect the emergency orders in place. We are supporting provincial offences officer in their critical work to enforce that responsibility and ensure the safety and well-being of Ontarians,"" added Solicitor General Jones.

Province announces second phase of Learn at Home to support continuity of learning

March 31, 2020  1:15 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Due to the rapidly evolving COVID-19 outbreak, the Ontario government announced that schools and child care centres will remain closed to protect the health and safety of students and staff. This extension is being made on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health.
Today's announcement was made by Premier Doug Ford, Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education, Ross Romano, Minister of Colleges and Universities and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. To ensure continuity of learning, the government is launching the second phase of Learn at Home. Developed in conjunction with education partners, the government is establishing clarity for parents, enhancing education supports, and creating opportunities for teachers and educators to connect with students. ""The decision to extend school closures was not made lightly. We know from the medical experts that the next two weeks will be critical in the fight against COVID-19 and that's why we're taking further action to keep our kids safe and healthy by having them stay home,"" said Premier Ford. ""At the same time, we cannot put the school year in jeopardy. That's why we're providing additional tools for at-home learning and ensuring students from kindergarten to Grade 12 to postsecondary education can finish their academic year and get the credits they need to graduate.""  Public schools will remain closed to teachers until Friday, May 1, 2020, and to students until Monday, May 4, 2020.

Select centres designated to support frontline health care workers and first responders will remain open.    As previously announced, no student will have their graduation compromised by COVID-19 and the Ministry of Education continues to collaborate with the Ministry of Colleges and Universities to ensure that there will be no barriers to accessing postsecondary education. ""We will do whatever it takes to keep students safe from COVID-19 - which is why we have extended the school closure period and why we have unveiled a teacher-led program that keeps students learning while at home,"" said Minister Lecce. ""By providing clarity for parents, enhancing support for students and enabling the teacher-student relationship, we are ensuring our children continue to safely learn - providing some sense of stability and hope for them amid this difficulty.""  The second phase of Learn at Home features a new set of expectations for the education community, including: Reconnecting students with teachers and other school staff, including mental health workers;Re-establishing teacher-led learning by grade groupings as follows:Kindergarten-Grade 3: five hours of work per student/week (focus on literacy and math)Grades 4-6: five hours of work per student/week (focus on literacy, math, science and social studies)Grades 7-8: 10 hours of work per student/week (focus on math, literacy, science and social studies)Grades 9-12: three hours of work per course per week for semestered students; 1.5 hours of work per course per week for non-semestered students (focus on achieving credits/completion/graduation)Leveraging digital resources and identifying alternative forms of teacher-student connectivity, such as phone and mail;Developing a program of training for educators to support them in virtual learning delivery;Requiring final report cards for all students;Prioritizing and supporting students on track to graduate;Distributing laptops and/or devices from schools as needed, while observing public health direction;Maintaining a responsive posture for health care and community partner requests; andEstablishing formal COVID-19 working groups with education sector unions to work together, share ideas and to find solutions in the support of students.

Stay home, stay safe, lives depend on it."" On March 21, 2020, Ontario launched Ontario Together, an online portal helping organizations work with the province to meet the challenges of COVID-19. The government will leverage partnerships with the telecommunication sector to provide innovative, low-cost and high-impact solutions to solve the equity challenges facing some students across Ontario. With this resource, the Ministry of Education has posted a new challenge that looks for learning solutions focused on: Free or low-cost learning resources and supports for students, parents and educators;Access to devices such as computers, tablets and portable wi-fi hotspots for families that need the supports; andOther ideas, goods or services, for example, to support mental health and students with special education needs."

Ontario Enabling Students to Complete the Academic Year, Offering Loan Payment Deferrals and Financial Support for Institutions 

March 31, 2020  9:00 A.M.

Ministry of Colleges and Universities


TORONTO — The government of Ontario is easing the financial burden on students and making sure they can complete their studies during the COVID-19 outbreak by temporarily deferring payments for Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP) loans and making online learning supports, including year-end exams, available to postsecondary institutions.
""During this unprecedented period, it is important to help students and current borrowers, so students can continue with their studies and borrowers do not have to worry about making loan payments,"" said Premier Ford. ""Our government is doing everything it can to ensure our college and university students can take their exams and complete their school year while studying remotely.""    To support borrowers during this difficult period, loan repayments will be subject to a six-month interest-free moratorium until September 30, 2020. This means that during this time, borrowers will not be required to make any loan payments and interest will not accrue on their OSAP loans. Borrowers can still make one-time payments via their online account or online banking if they want to repay their loans faster. Payments during this period will go entirely towards their loan principal.    ""Students and their families make great sacrifices to attend postsecondary education and it is incumbent on us to do everything we can to ensure this academic year is not put in jeopardy,"" said Minister Romano. ""I want to thank our postsecondary institutions for their leadership in adopting alternative ways for students to study and take exams, while ensuring they practice physical distancing and stay safe."" To ensure students can successfully complete the academic year, Ontario has finalized an agreement with eCampusOntario to make digital learning supports available to postsecondary institutions. These interim digital learning supports, available in both French and English, will provide publicly-assisted colleges and universities with the technology they need to conduct year-end assessments, while preserving student privacy and the integrity of academic assessment. Ontario will work with other partners who may be interested in offering digital learning, such as Indigenous Institutes and private career colleges. Supports will be accessible on an as-needed basis and limited to those courses and programs where formal exams are required. The province is also distributing $25 million in additional funding to publicly-assisted colleges, universities and Indigenous Institutes to help address each institution's most pressing needs in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak such as deep cleaning, purchasing medical supplies or offering mental health supports.

Ontario Increasing Health and Safety Measures to Better Protect Frontline Nurses from COVID-19


March 30, 2020  3:58 P.M.

Ministry of Health


TORONTO — Ontario is taking further action to protect frontline nurses and to recognize their clinical training and experience to help to keep Ontarians and hospitals safe and healthy during the COVID-19 outbreak.
The province, in collaboration with the Chief Medical Officer of Health, and in consultation with the Ontario Nurses' Association (ONA), Ontario Health and the Ontario Hospital Association (OHA), is issuing a directive on health and safety standards for frontline nurses in hospitals in order to prevent exposure to and transmission of COVID-19. These standards have been developed with the guidance of clinically trained frontline nurses, hospital leaders and public health experts. ""It is critical that we are protecting our frontline nurses who are fighting to protect us from COVID-19 every day,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""We are collaborating with our partners in the health system to implement this new directive to ensure that nurses have the protection they need to safely provide the best care for their patients."" This directive outlines:  Precautions for interactions with suspected, presumed or confirmed COVID-19 patients, including relying on the clinical education and training that nurses receive to use their professional and clinical judgement;Point-of-care risk assessments for every patient interaction to assess appropriate health and safety measures; andTraining on safe use of all personal protective equipment (PPE).    The directive also addresses the ongoing stewardship and conservation of the current level of PPE supplies as the government aggressively pursues all available efforts to increase this supply to ensure the appropriate health and safety control measures are in place to mitigate the transmission of infections. A joint statement from the province, the Chief Medical Officer of Health and the ONA can be found here.

Quick Facts

As part of Ontario’s Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19, the province is investing $75 million to supply personal protective equipment and critical medical supplies to frontline staff.
A new website, Ontario Together, will help the government partner with Ontario’s manufacturing sector to meet the challenges of the COVID-19 outbreak and redirect resources towards the production of essential equipment such as ventilators, masks and swabs.
Everyone in Ontario should stay home unless absolutely necessary and practice physical distancing to reduce their exposure to other people. Avoid close contact (within 2 metres) with people outside of your immediate families.
If you think you may have COVID-19 symptoms or have been in close contact with someone who has it, first self-isolate and then use Ontario's Self-Assessment Tool to see if you need to seek further care.

Ontario Protecting Seniors During the COVID-19 Outbreak 
Province Investing $10 Million to Mobilize Businesses and Volunteers to Support the Most Vulnerable 

March 30, 2020  1:30 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government is working with businesses, volunteer organizations and non-profits to make it easier for Ontario's seniors to self-isolate and practice physical distancing during this unprecedented time by ensuring they can receive the support they need to stay safe and healthy. Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health is strongly urging those over the age of 70 or those with compromised immune systems or underlying medical conditions to stay at home.
The government is investing $10 million to help community organizations with the coordination of subsidized deliveries of meals, medicines and other necessities to seniors. This investment doubles the government's initial commitment in Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19. The government is also working with grocers and pharmacists to prioritize seniors' delivery orders and establish senior-only shopping hours. ""We take seriously the advice of Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, and we're working to put an iron ring of protection around our seniors from COVID-19,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""I know asking our seniors to stay at home will not be easy as it will mean inconvenience, isolation and significant change in routine. That's why we are encouraging everyone to reach out and support them, whether it's delivering their prescriptions or picking up the phone and giving them a call. It will all make a positive difference to our most vulnerable citizens."" The government is also working with province-wide organizations including Ontario Community Support Association (OCSA) and Older Adults Centres' Association of Ontario (OACAO) to identify and mobilize potential volunteer supports and expand the use of innovative technologies in the community to address social isolation and support daily living assistance. ""Our seniors have dedicated their lives to making Ontario the great province it is today. During this very difficult period, we need to take every step possible to protect them and ensure they stay healthy both physically and mentally,"" said Raymond Cho, Minister for Seniors and Accessibility. ""I encourage everyone to stay in regular contact with a parent, grand parent or neighbour to make sure they have everything they need."" This $10 million delivery coordination program for seniors living at home is in addition to the $20 million over two years the province has invested to protect seniors in retirement homes through increased infection control and active screening procedures and $243 million for long-term care homes to support 24/7 screening, additional staffing, enhanced cleaning and sanitation, and additional surge capacity. ""We must do everything in our power to care for and support Ontario's most vulnerable population,"" said Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""I want to assure you that we are working around the clock to assist and care for Ontario's seniors, especially those in long-term care, during this unprecedented time."" The government is implementing a new emergency order to ensure that staffing and resources are available to help care for and protect long-term care residents, providing further flexibility and allowing homes to redirect their staffing and financial resources to essential tasks. This is in addition to implementing a new approach to redeploying highly qualified inspectors to support long-term care homes on the ground through staff supply, care coordination, and helping homes prevent and contain infections.  ""It's never been more important that all Ontarians heed the advice of our Chief Medical Officer of Health by staying home and practicing physical distancing,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""This is especially true because it's the only way to protect our seniors and the most vulnerable people in our province. All of us need to do our part to stop the spread of this virus.""

Statement from the Chief Medical Officer of Health


March 30, 2020 12:40 P.M.

Ministry of Health


TORONTO — Today, Dr. David Williams, Chief Medical Officer of Health, issued the following statement in response to COVID-19:
""The Government of Ontario continues to take decisive action to respond to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) to help contain its spread and to protect the public. This has involved some unprecedented measures, and I know many of you continue to undertake great efforts to protect your families, friends, neighbours, clients and patients, and communities. However, we must do more. Everyone has a role to play in reducing the risk of spreading COVID-19 - there is no option for anyone to opt out. The lives of many Ontarians, especially our community's most vulnerable citizens, are in your hands and will depend on your actions over the coming days and weeks. I strongly recommend you and other members of your household stay home except for essential reasons, such as to: Access health care services;Shop for groceries;Pick-up medication at the pharmacy;Walk pets when required; andSupport vulnerable community members with meeting the above needs.To the fullest extent possible, you should also limit the number of these essential trips. However, when you are out in public you must adhere to physical distancing by reducing your exposure to other people outside of your household by keeping two metres from other people.  Given the greater risk of severe outcomes to Ontarians who are elderly, I am also strongly recommending that individuals over 70 years of age self-isolate. This means only leaving home or seeing other people for essential reasons. Where possible, you should seek services over the phone or internet or ask for help from friends, family or neighbours with essential errands. This also applies to individuals who have compromised immune systems and/or underlying medical conditions. As we have been saying repeatedly, it is critically important to wash your hands regularly (or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available), practice proper cough and sneeze etiquette, and avoid direct contact when greeting people.   In addition, as previously communicated and mandated by the federal government, all individuals who are returning from travel outside of Canada must self-isolate for 14 days when they return. You must not go to work, grocery stores or on walks. You should also monitor yourself for symptoms of COVID-19 for 14 days after returning and contact your primary care provider or Telehealth Ontario (1-866-797-0000) if you experience symptoms of COVID-19. I also ask that family members, individuals, neighbours, and services in our communities look at how they can support others by taking these necessary actions. This would allow seniors, other at-risk populations, and returning travellers to remain at home. The government is continuing to support all of the dedicated health care providers and front-line workers who are focused on keeping Ontarians healthy and safe.  We need to remember that we all have an obligation to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19 to our families, friends, neighbours, and communities. Please do not underestimate the impact that your actions will have in helping to stop the spread of this virus. For more information on COVID-19, including the current status of the outbreak, the online self-assessment tool to help determine how to seek further care, how Ontario is responding, and how to self isolate, please visit Ontario's COVID-19 web page. Thank you for your ongoing action and commitment.""

Ontario Enhancing Public Reporting about COVID-19 
Dedicated Website Will Include Expanded Information of Confirmed Cases Across the Province

March 30, 2020 10:55 A.M.

Ministry of Health


TORONTO — Ontario is enhancing the public information it provides about the status of COVID-19. As the outbreak evolves, Ontario has launched a new dedicated web page and is changing how COVID-19 cases are being reported to provide a more relevant summary of data from Public Health Ontario that offers expanded information every day at 10:30 a.m.
This daily epidemiologic summary replaces the general information on the status of COVID-19 cases that was previously provided twice daily on the web page. The new summary provides more provincial and regional data on confirmed cases, including trends of cases since the outbreak began, geography, exposure and severity.  ""Ontario has been diligently monitoring and taking decisive action to stop the spread of COVID-19 and keep Ontarians informed,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""We will continue to work with Public Health Ontario, public health units and the health sector to have and report on the best possible data to help us understand the scope of the COVID-19 outbreak in our province and inform our collective response to keep all Ontarians safe and healthy."" The daily summary is based on data recorded by local public health units in the province's integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS), as of 4 p.m. the day before the summary is posted. iPHIS is the Ministry of Health's disease reporting system, where data is regularly updated. In addition to the daily update to the website, Dr. David Williams, Chief Medical Officer of Health, and Dr. Barbara Yaffe, Associate Chief Medical Officer of Health, will continue to hold regularly scheduled daily media briefings via teleconference, to provide an update on the province's ongoing response to COVID-19.

With the COVID-19 situation changing day by day, we are working to ensure that workers have the tools they need to help keep job sites safe. We must do everything possible to fight the spread of this disease.  Today, Ontario's Chief Prevention Officer announced updated guidance to help employers better understand their responsibilities and what is needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 on the job site.  The update follows an initial guidance document circulated on March 20, 2020, and addresses sector topics including: providing better on-site sanitation, including a focus on high-touch areas like site trailers, door handles and hoistscommunicating roles,  responsibilities, and health & safety policies, by, for example,  posting site sanitization schedules and work schedulesenabling greater  distances between workers by staggering shifts, restricting site numbers  and limiting elevator usageprotecting public  health by tracking and monitoring workers Under Ontario law, employers must take every reasonable precaution to keep workers safe. Workers have the right to refuse unsafe work. If health and safety concerns are not resolved internally, a worker can seek enforcement by filing a complaint with the ministry's Health and Safety Contact Centre at 1-877-202-0008. Ministry inspectors are inspecting job sites today and every day. Employers and constructors should know: failure to comply with the Occupational Health and Safety Act and its regulations could result in a stop work order.  Keeping job sites open during the current pandemic requires a heightened focus on health and safety.  We all have a role to play in preventing the spread of COVID-19.""

TORONTO - Ontario continues to take important steps to protect the province's supply chain and make sure the heroes on the front lines have the essential goods and services they need in the fight against COVID-19 like ventilators, masks and swabs.
""COVID-19 is impacting supply chains across Canada, and around the world,"" said Lisa Thompson, Minister of Government and Consumer Services. ""That's why we are proclaiming the Supply Chain Management Act to make sure we can deploy critical supplies, equipment and services to where they are needed most."" These regulations will enable the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services and the Ministry of Health to centrally manage public sector supply chains. It will allow the collection of key data on inventories, orders and supply constraints and the development of a virtual inventory tool so that demand for crucial supplies are visible and trackable. With these measures in place, the government can prioritize buying what is needed most, deploying them, and allocating them on a priority basis to support the delivery of essential services to Ontarians.

New financial measure will allow insurance premium payment deferrals for six months 

March 26, 2020  3:20 P.M.

Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development


TORONTO - The Ontario Government is enabling $1.9 billion in relief for employers to reduce the financial strain on business brought on by COVID-19. The measure, which will run through the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB), will see premium payments deferred for six months for all businesses in the province.
""During this unprecedented period of uncertainty and hardship, our government is doing everything possible to support businesses and protect jobs,"" said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""By making this change today, we are building upon the substantial financial help we are providing business owners and workers. The top priority is to keep people safe.""  All employers covered by the WSIB's workplace insurance are automatically eligible for the provisions of the relief package and can defer premium reporting and payments until August 31, 2020. They will not be required to opt in to receive this benefit.  Additionally, the WSIB will cease interest accrual on all outstanding premium payments. They will not charge penalties during this six-month deferral period. There will be no negative consequences for businesses who defer premium reporting and payments. The WSIB will continue to fully cover workers at eligible workplaces.  ""We have worked closely with the Government of Ontario to help Ontario businesses as they face this unprecedented challenge,"" said Elizabeth Witmer, Chair of the WSIB. ""We're here to help.""  The relief program is part of a $17 billion package included in Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19. The government's action plan will make available $10 billion in support for people and businesses through tax and other deferrals to improve their cash flow, protecting jobs and household budgets. Additionally, through the WSIB, the government reduced costs to employers by a new rate framework and the elimination of the unfunded liability charge, putting more than $2 billion back into the economy. ""Our government is working day and night to provide Ontarians with certainty and support during this difficult time. This Relief Package being implemented by the WSIB will help sustain businesses, protect our economy and save jobs,"" said Minister McNaughton. The new measure builds on the government's previous actions to support business and protect jobs.

Quick Facts

The Workplace Safety and Insurance Board covers over five million people in more than 300,000 workplaces across Ontario.
Businesses are not required to inform the WSIB that they will be taking advantage of this financial relief package. 
The deferred premiums will amount to an average $1,760 for approximately 275,000 Ontario businesses.

Ministry of Long-Term Care


TORONTO — Today, Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care, issued the following statement in response to two deaths in Ontario long-term care homes related to COVID-19:
""I am deeply saddened to report to Ontarians that there have been two deaths related to COVID-19 in our province's long-term care system. On Monday, March 23, a woman in her 90s passed away after testing positive for COVID-19 and being rushed to Lakeridge Health in Oshawa. She was a resident at Hillsdale Terraces, a long-term care home in Oshawa. This morning, an 80-year-old woman passed away at St. Joseph's Hospital in Hamilton, where she had been in isolation since being admitted to the hospital on March 16. She was a resident of Heritage Green Nursing Home in Stoney Creek. I offer my condolences to the families, friends and loved ones of these individuals, and to their long-term care communities. My thoughts are with you at this devastating time. We will not stop our fight against COVID-19. These deaths speak to the severity of this outbreak and emphasize why our government is taking extensive action to keep long-term care residents and staff safe. We have introduced enhanced measures in long-term care homes to enforce social and physical distancing and contain the spread of COVID-19, increased bed availability and ensure homes are able to provide isolation rooms, ensure sufficient nursing and personal support care staff are available, and as of today, put in place a temporary order under the March 17, 2020 declaration of emergency that gives homes the flexibility they need to deploy staff when and where they are needed. These and more enhanced safety measures are outlined here. The health and well-being of all Ontarians, including long-term care residents, their families, and staff is, as always, our government's number one priority. We will continue to put in place any process necessary to our fight against this outbreak so that we can protect our province's most vulnerable.""

Ontario Providing Electricity Relief to Families, Small Businesses and Farms During COVID-19
Province suspending time-of-use rates for 45 days

March 24, 2020  1:15 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO - To support Ontarians through the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation, the Government of Ontario is providing immediate electricity rate relief for families, small businesses and farms paying time-of-use (TOU) rates.
For a 45-day period, the government is working to suspend time-of-use electricity rates, holding electricity prices to the off-peak rate of 10.1 cents-per-kilowatt-hour. This reduced price will be available 24 hours per day, seven days a week to all time-of-use customers, who make up the majority of electricity consumers in the province. By switching to a fixed off-peak rate, time-of-use customers will see rate reductions of over 50 per cent compared to on-peak rates. To deliver savings as quickly and conveniently as possible, this discount will be applied automatically to electricity bills without the need for customers to fill out an application form. ""During this unprecedented time, we are providing much-needed relief to Ontarians, specifically helping those who are doing the right thing by staying home and small businesses that have closed or are seeing fewer customers,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""By adopting a fixed, 24/7 off-peak rate, we are making things a little easier during these difficult times and putting more money in people's pockets for other important priorities and necessities."" The Government of Ontario issued an Emergency Order under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act to apply the off-peak TOU electricity rate for residential, small businesses, and farm customers who currently pay TOU rates. ""Ontario is fortunate to have a strong electricity system we can rely on during these exceptional times, and our government is proud to provide additional relief to Ontarians who are doing their part to stay home,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines. ""We thank the Ontario Energy Board and our partners at local distribution companies across the province for taking quick action to make this change and provide immediate support for hardworking people of Ontario,"" said Bill Walker, Associate Minister of Energy.

Quick Facts

The Ontario Energy Board sets time-of-use electricity rates for residential and small business customers through the Regulated Price Plan.
Time-of-use prices as of November, 2019 ― Off-Peak: 10.1₵/kWh, Mid-Peak: 14.4₵/kWh, On-Peak: 20.8₵/kWh
Depending on billing cycles, some customers will see these changes on their next electricity bill. TOU customers whose billing cycle ended before their local distribution company implemented this change will receive the reduced rate as a credit on a future bill.
The Ontario Electricity Rebate (OER) will continue to provide a 31.8 per cent rebate on the sub-total bill amount for all existing Regulated Price Plan (RPP) consumers.
There are approximately five million residential consumers, farms and some small businesses billed using time-of-use (TOU) electricity prices under the RPP.
The Ontario Energy Board has extended the winter ban on disconnections to July 31st.

Ontario Implements Enhanced Measures to Protect the Safety of Residents in Long-Term Care Homes
Additional protocols help keep province’s most vulnerable safe

March 24, 2020 11:00 A.M.

Ministry of Long-Term Care


TORONTO— Ontario is taking further steps to ensure that health sector workers, including those that work in the long-term care sector, are available, where and when they are needed. These enhanced measures will support the province's extensive efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19. 
On March 23, Ontario enacted a new order under the March 17, 2020 declaration of emergency to ensure personnel are properly deployed to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 to keep staff, volunteers and residents in long-term care homes safe. This temporary order would give long-term care homes the ability to free-up valuable staff, identify staffing priorities, and develop, modify and implement redeployment plans. Under this temporary order long-term care homes will be able to respond to, prevent and alleviate an outbreak of COVID-19 by carrying out measures such as: Redeploying staff within different locations in (or between) facilities of the health service provider;Changing the assignment of work, including assigning non-bargaining unit employees or contractors to perform bargaining unit work;Changing the scheduling of work or shift assignments;Deferring or cancelling vacations, absences or other leaves, regardless of whether such vacations, absences or leaves are established by statute, regulation, agreement or otherwise;Employing extra part-time or temporary staff or contractors, including for the purpose of performing bargaining unit work;Using volunteers to perform work, including to perform bargaining unit work; andProviding appropriate training or education as needed to staff and volunteers to achieve the purposes of a redeployment plan. Dr. David Williams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, has also issued a new directive for long-term care homes under the Long-Term Care Homes Act, 2007 that restricts residents from leaving a home for short visits with family and friends. In doing so, the province is ensuring residents do not inadvertently contract COVID-19 while out of the home and spread the virus upon their return. Instead, residents who want to go outside will be able to remain on the home's property and maintain safe social distancing from any family and friends who visit them. ""Ontario is implementing critical and necessary measures to ensure that we are able to protect the health and well-being of Ontarians, in particular our seniors,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""We have been working for several months now, with all our partners across the system, from public health to hospitals and long-term care operators, to put processes in place to contain this virus and be ready to respond to any scenario."" ""The health and well-being of all Ontarians, including long-term care residents, their families, and staff will continue to be our government's number one priority,"" said Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""Our government is taking all the necessary precautions to ensure our loved ones in Ontario's long-term care homes are safe and secure."" To help maintain the health and safety of residents, staff and essential visitors, Ontario is also increasing long-term care bed availability to ensure homes are able to provide isolation rooms when required, as well as providing long-term beds for people on the long-term care waitlist. In particular, patients in the hospital who no longer require hospital services will benefit from this increased long-term care bed capacity, and their placement into long-term care will also free up hospital beds to treat acute patients. In addition, Ontario is making necessary adjustments to ensure both resident and families' wishes are taken into account, and a sufficient number of staff are available to support long-term care home residents. Updated procedures will bring further clarity around admitting, discharging, and readmitting long-term care home residents at a time when homes are trying their best to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among residents, staff and essential visitors. Lastly, the province is ensuring sufficient nursing and personal support care staff are available to support long-term care home residents. All new nurses and personal support workers hired to help long-term care homes cope with COVID-19 will be screened to ensure they are qualified and present no risk to long-term care home residents. These critical steps add to the protocols that have recently been implemented to ensure a safe and secure environment for residents. Long-term care homes continue to restrict non-essential visits and actively screen essential visitors, staff, students, volunteers, residents moving into a long-term care home and residents returning to a long-term care home. As of March 9, 2020, when long-term care homes submit samples for standard respiratory testing, they are also being tested for COVID-19 automatically to ensure the province identifies potentially unknown cases.

Quick Facts

When utilized by long-term care homes, redeployment plans under the new order temporarily supersede the provisions of a collective agreement, including lay-off, seniority/service or bumping provisions.
As part of the ongoing government effort to prevent and contain the spread of COVID-19 across the province, the government has provided initial emergency funding to the long-term care home sector of $50 million effective immediately.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Due to the evolving COVID-19 situation, the Ontario government will be ordering at-risk workplaces to close-down, while encouraging businesses to explore opportunities to continue operations through work-from-home and innovative business models. At the same time, the government reminds businesses to put in place protocols for physical distancing and regular hand-washing in order to protect the health and safety of employees and the general public. 
Earlier today, Premier Doug Ford was joined by Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance and Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General to announce that the government will be closing at-risk workplaces to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Essential businesses include, but are not limited to grocery stores and pharmacies, telecommunications and IT infrastructure service providers, and businesses that support power generation, natural gas distribution and clean drinking water. Essential businesses are being asked to put into place any and all measures to safeguard the wellbeing of their employees on the front-lines. Teleworking and online commerce are permitted at all times for all businesses. ""While this was a difficult decision, we trust that Ontario's business leaders will be able to promote safety while carrying out business and protecting jobs,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""The grocery store clerks, transit and hydro workers and truckers are out there on the front lines making sure the people of Ontario continue to have access to the products and services they need. It is essential that their workplaces be kept as safe as possible so these local heroes can return home to their families worry free."" At-risk workplaces will be ordered to close by 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday, March 24th and where possible, take the necessary measures so staff can work from home allowing operations to continue. ""Our government applauds the sacrifice and hard work of all Ontario workers and businesses, and will stand by them through this crisis,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""We call on workplaces that remain open to be vigilant and to enforce the highest possible standards of cleanliness and caution as we continue the fight together against COVID-19.""

Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry


The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry wants to remind the public that non-resident hunters must use the services of a licenced outfitter while hunting bears in Ontario.
In May 2018, conservation officers with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, with assistance from the Canada Border Services Agency and Special Agents with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, investigated a hunting guide service. The investigation discovered that three men guided paying clients on illegal black bear hunts while operating a guide service around Spanish, Ontario. As a result, the three men and seven other people who were involved in the hunts were convicted of several charges under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act related to illegally shooting black bears, covering up what they had done by falsifying records and illegally transporting hides to the United States for taxidermy. Two trials took place, each heard by a different Justice of the Peace, in Elliot Lake. The charges were:  hunting black bear without a licence unlawfully transferring a black bear licence transporting illegally killed wildlife providing bear hunting services without a licence hunting black bear within 400 metres of a dump abandoning the flesh of a black bear suitable for food making a false statement in a document exporting wildlife without a permit being party to providing black bear hunting services without a licence being party to unlawfully attaching a seal to a bear killed by another person being party to exporting wildlife without a permit.  Ontario residents Russell Christensen and Keevin Beckerton were convicted. In addition, the following people from Michigan received convictions: Onie Miller III, Onie Miller IV, Adam Collins, BrieAnna Miller, Andrew Geiger, Kevin Henning, Falisha Colby, William Dewitt. In addition to $60,000 in total fines, two utility terrain vehicles (UTVs) were seized and permanently forfeited to the Crown and some people received lifetime hunting-licence suspensions. To report a natural resource violation or provide information about an unsolved case, members of the public can call the ministry TIPS line toll free at 1-877-847-7667 or contact your local ministry office. You can also call Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-TIPS. For more information about unsolved cases, please visit ontario.ca/mnrftips.

Changes to Ontario's Emergency Assistance Program in Response to COVID-19


March 23, 2020 12:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


Vulnerable Ontarians, including those who live in poverty, are homeless or unemployed, face even more significant impacts as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.
Ontario is providing $200 million in social services relief funding to help protect the health and safety of these vulnerable populations. Emergency Assistance Ontario's investment will provide additional resources directly to individuals and families in financial crisis. This includes those who are not able to access federal assistance to cover needs such as food costs, rent, medicine and other essential services during this time. Ontario is expanding access to existing Emergency Assistance under the current provisions of Ontario Works. This is available to people with limited income, assets or credit who are in a crisis or an emergency situation. Ontario is providing additional resources and expanding access to Emergency Assistance for those facing a COVID-19 related financial emergency by: Suspending the rule that limits emergencyassistance provision to only once in a six-month period for individuals and families affected by COVID-19; andAllowing people to receive emergency assistance for longer (48 days) without submitting a full Ontario Works application.Those who are already on Ontario Works or Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP), tourists and visitors are not eligible. Individuals can apply for this assistance online at Ontario.ca/community or through local Ontario Works offices.  Support for Current Social Assistance Clients The government is making additional resources available to enable Ontario Works administrators to provide discretionary benefits to those currently in receipt of social assistance. This funding can be used to meet a broad range of needs ― including cleaning supplies, transportation, food or clothing ― that individuals and families may be experiencing due to COVID-19. Individuals can access benefits through the Ontario Works program through online applications such as MyBenefits, contacting their Ontario Works caseworker or online at Ontario.ca/community. ODSP recipients are also eligible to receive these benefits and can contact their ODSP caseworker for additional information. Support of Workplace Health and Safety To protect the health and safety of frontline staff and clients, and to limit the spread of the virus, the ministry is modifying certain social assistance program requirements on a temporary basis, and is: Reducing the need for in-person contact by authorizing risk-based approaches to eligibility determination and other verification requirements, including deferral of visual verification requirements of original documents and allowing for the use of email or alternative methods to submit reports or documents. This documentation may be requested at a later date.Helping to reduce the burden on program staff by modifying certain program requirements - including no longer suspending clients who do not report income and suspending Eligibility Verification Process reviews - to enable deployment of resources to priority activities.Helping to reduce the burden on the health care system by enabling program staff to approve extensions to Special Diet Allowance, Mandatory Special Necessities benefits and medical transportation/supplies without endorsement from a health professional.Municipal and Service Delivery Partners In addition to families and individuals, municipalities and other organizations that provide social services will be eligible to receive this funding to support their response to COVID-19. Shelters, food banks, charities and non-profits will have immediate access to flexible funding to help them cope with growing demands and extraordinary circumstances. Consolidated Municipal Service Managers (CMSMs) and District Social Services Administration Boards (DSAABs) will be responsible for allocating funding, based on local priorities. Funding will also be made available to organizations delivering services to vulnerable First Nations individuals and families. Further details will be available shortly.

 Ontario Protecting the Most Vulnerable During COVID-19 Crisis
New Funding Will Support Municipalities, Food Banks, Homeless Shelters and Individuals

March 23, 2020 12:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government is providing $200 million in social services relief funding to help protect the health and safety of the province's most vulnerable people in response to the outbreak of COVID-19.
The province will be providing municipalities and organizations that administer social services with funding to support them in their response to COVID-19. The funding will help municipalities and social service providers such as shelters, food banks, emergency services, charities and non-profits continue to deliver their critical services, hire additional staff, and find ways to promote social distancing and self-isolation to keep clients safe and healthy. Ontario's municipal service managers will determine local needs and distribute the funding, ensuring clients are receiving the support they need.  ""Our government will spare no expense to protect the health and safety of all Ontarians,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""We are doing our part to show the Ontario spirit and we will make sure no one gets left behind. Organizations across the province are doing critical work right now to help vulnerable Ontarians and these funds will allow them to directly help those who need it most.""  The funding will also help individuals who do not qualify for emergency financial supports under federal programs. The government is putting in place an expanded Emergency Assistance program administered through Ontario Works (OW) to cover these individuals' needs such as food, rent, informal childcare, and services. There will also be discretionary benefits available to those who already receive social assistance. This new funding will help individuals and families in financial crisis who are not able to access federal assistance to cover needs such as food, rent, medicine, transportation and other services during this public health crisis. Funding will also be made available to organizations delivering social services to vulnerable First Nations individuals and families. Individuals can apply online at Ontario.ca/community. ""Protecting our most vulnerable is an absolute priority, as the COVID-19 crisis continues to develop,"" said Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services. ""We're expanding access to temporary emergency assistance so that individuals who have no other means of financial support can stay safe and healthy."" This fund will also help local communities support their shelter systems during this health crisis. The province's 47 municipal service managers will deliver this funding, ensuring clients are receiving the support they need, and will make local decisions on community funding. ""We are acting quickly to support those who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless during this unprecedented time,"" said Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. ""This funding will go straight to communities, who know best what the immediate needs are on the ground in their local shelters."" ""This new funding will provide much needed support to our province's most vulnerable as we continue to take decisive action to contain the spread of COVID-19,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""If Ontario is going to successfully flatten the curve, it's vital that we ensure that all Ontarians have the resources they need to protect their health and well-being.""

Quick Facts

Last week, Ontario announced a $304 million investment in COVID-19 response, including $20 million for residential facilities in developmental services, gender-based services and protective care for children and youth.
To further bolster safety measures for social-assistance clients and caseworkers, the government has also temporarily removed the requirement for clients to provide written documentation at this time. Ontario Works (OW) and Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP) payments will be made as usual and will continue based on previous levels of income support. Individuals will not have to visit their local office to provide written documentation during this time. If individuals need to connect with their caseworker, they are encouraged to connect over the phone instead of visiting in person.

Ontario Significantly Enhancing COVID-19 Screening Measures and Supports 
Interactive Self-Assessment Tool Now Available to Help Keep People Safe

March 23, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Ministry of Health


TORONTO — With the increasing severity of the COVID-19 outbreak, Ontario has now launched an enhanced and interactive self-assessment tool. This new easy-to-use tool takes the public through a series of questions to inform those who are concerned they may have contracted COVID-19. In a matter of seconds, this tool will help people determine if they are negative or it will provide them with guidance on where to seek care based on their needs. Critically, the enhanced tool provides the province with real-time data on the number and geography of users who are told to seek care, self-isolate or to monitor for symptoms. This data will help inform Ontario's ongoing response in order to keep individuals and families safe.
""I encourage anyone who may have been exposed to COVID-19, have symptoms or may have travelled outside of Canada to first self-isolate and then take a few seconds to complete our new online assessment tool,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""This easy-to-use tool, developed with guidance from Dr. Williams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, is a great first step in that process. By answering a few questions, Ontarians will be able to make informed choices about what to do, while the province collects real-time data to enhance our ongoing response."" The tool guides individuals through a series of questions and, based on their responses, users are provided clear direction on what action to take. These next steps could include: continue to practice social distancing; self-isolate; call a primary care provider or Telehealth Ontario; or in the case of symptoms such as severe difficulty breathing or severe chest pain, call 911 or go to the emergency department. Those people whose self-assessment shows they may have COVID-19 will be advised to call their primary care provider, who can conduct a virtual assessment by phone or other technology. People can also call Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000 (24/7), where they can speak to a health care professional about their symptoms. As announced last week, the province is rapidly expanding service capacity to ensure timely responses and has increased Telehealth's line capacity to more than 2,000 to help manage the high daily call volume. In some cases, based on the virtual assessment, individuals may be referred by their primary care provider or Telehealth Ontario to one of the province's 58 assessment centres for an in-person assessment. These centres, which are by referral only, are helping to ease the pressures on hospital emergency departments using innovative care models, including in some cases drive-thru testing. As part of the investment of up to $304 million to enhance the province's response to COVID-19, Ontario will be establishing additional assessment centres across the province. The centres are located in dedicated spaces, which will facilitate high-quality care to protect broader patient populations. The 58 centres that have already opened are in several municipalities across the province.  Visit Ontario's website to learn more about how the province continues to protect Ontarians from COVID-19.

Quick Facts

Ontarians should be practising social distancing to reduce their exposure to other people. Avoid close contact (within 2 metres) with people outside of your immediate families.
Anyone who has travelled outside of Canada should:

Self-isolate for 14 days when they return. People who are self-isolating should not go to work.
Monitor themselves for symptoms of the 2019 novel coronavirus for 14 days after returning to Canada.
Contact their primary care provider or Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000 if they experience symptoms of the 2019 novel coronavirus.

To help prevent the spread of COVID-19, wash your hands often, cough and sneeze into your sleeve or a tissue, and stay home if you are feeling sick.

Ontario to Open Select Child Care Centres across the Province 

March 22, 2020 11:51 A.M.

Ministry of Education


TORONTO — In order to support health care and frontline workers during this COVID-19 outbreak, Ontario plans to exempt certain child care centres from the order to close all licensed child care centres pursuant to the state of emergency declared earlier this week. This initiative is being done in partnership with service system managers and First Nations partners.
""We need to help our nurses, doctors and frontline care workers to be able to focus on protecting the health and well-being of all Ontarians,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""By allowing select child care centres to open their doors during these challenging times, our province's courageous frontline workers can rest assured knowing that their families are also being looked after.""  Health care and other frontline workers, including doctors, nurses, paramedics, firefighters, police, and correctional officers, will be able to access safe, local emergency child care. These child care centres will be required to follow existing health and safety requirements and have a plan in place should any staff, children or parents be exposed to the virus. ""During this unprecedented situation, we need to do everything we can to ensure our health care and other frontline staff have the support they need to continue to work,"" said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education. ""At the same time, we need to protect the safety of the staff and children at these centres. For that reason, we are putting strict measures in place, such as restricting the types of centres that can re-open and keeping the number of children in any one centre low.""  Once emergency child care centres open, a list of locations will be made available on ontario.ca/coronavirus.

Ontario Takes Extraordinary Steps to Ensure Health Care Resources are Available to Contain COVID-19


March 21, 2020  9:20 P.M.

Ministry of Health


TORONTO — Today, the Ontario government announced a new order under the March 17, 2020 declaration of emergency to ensure health care resources are available to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and keep individuals and families safe. This temporary order would give hospitals the ability to cancel and postpone services to free-up space and valuable staff, identify staffing priorities, and develop, modify and implement redeployment plans.
""On the best advice of Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, and in response to clear and urgent requests from our frontline health service providers, the province is taking decisive action to ensure we can continue to be responsive and nimble as the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases grows,"" said Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General. ""While normal protocols are important in routine times, these extraordinary steps will ensure our health sector workers are there, where and when they are needed, to care for Ontarians and support our extensive efforts to contain this virus."" Under this temporary order hospitals will be able to respond to, prevent and alleviate an outbreak of COVID-19 by carrying out measures such as:  Redeploying staff within different locations in (or between) facilities of the hospital;Redeploying staff to work in COVID-19 assessment centres;Changing the assignment of work, including assigning non-bargaining unit employees or contractors to perform bargaining unit work;Changing the scheduling of work or shift assignments;Deferring or cancelling vacations, absences or other leaves, regardless of whether such vacations, absences or leaves are established by statute, regulation, agreement or otherwise;Employing extra part-time or temporary staff or contractors, including for the purpose of performing bargaining unit work;Using volunteers to perform work, including to perform bargaining work; andProviding appropriate training or education as needed to staff and volunteers to achieve the purposes of a redeployment plan. When utilized by hospitals, these redeployment plans temporarily supersede the provisions of a collective agreement, including lay-off, seniority/service or bumping provisions. For example, currently a hospital would be required to post a lay-off notice and wait a period of time before being able to move a nurse or other unionized employee from an emergency department to a COVID-19 assessment centre. These measures would allow for the redeployment of staff to address the containment of COVID-19 without restriction or delay. ""I want to once again thank our nurses, doctors and frontline care workers for their extraordinary dedication and commitment as we continue to work together to protect the health and well-being of Ontarians,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""These temporary measures are necessary to ensure hospitals are able to effectively deploy personnel to where help and support is needed most in their facilities."" This time-limited order is valid for 14 days unless revoked or renewed in accordance with the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act.

Quick Facts

Ontarians should be practising social distancing to reduce their exposure to other people. Avoid close contact (within 2 metres) with people outside of your immediate families.
If you are returning from travel outside of Canada or if you believe you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 symptoms, you should begin to self-isolate for a period of 14 days, including social distancing and tracking your symptoms and how you feel.

March 21, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario Government is launching Ontario Together, a new website that will help businesses and their employees work with the province to meet the challenges of COVID-19. This initiative will remove barriers allowing Ontario's manufacturing sector to redeploy capacity towards the production of essential equipment like ventilators, masks and swabs.
Today's announcement was made by Premier Doug Ford and Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance and Flavio Volpe, President, Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association (APMA).   ""We're ready to mobilize our manufacturing might to help the entire country and we want Ontario to become the workshop of Canada,"" said Premier Ford. ""Extraordinary times call for extraordinary efforts and we are already seeing people stepping up and offering to help out as we deal with this unprecedented situation. This is a true demonstration of Ontario Spirit."" Ontario Together will identify the province's supply challenges and solicit ideas and advice from Ontario's business and manufacturing communities on how the government can work together to meet the need. Through the portal, companies will be able to submit proposals for the government to procure required goods and services and share creative solutions quickly. ""We're looking forward to leveraging Ontario's world class manufacturing and IT sectors to provide the necessary assistance to combat COVID-19,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""Ontario's businesses have shown they are ready and willing to work with us, and we urge them to join our government in finding made-in-Ontario solutions to ensure we continue to stay well supplied."" ""Ontario is home to some of the world's best hospitals led by dedicated professionals who are working around-the-clock to identify, diagnose and treat our population to manage and slow the spread of COVID-19,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""If we are going to stop the spread of this virus, we will need a steady stream of medical products and supplies to treat patients and keep frontline workers safe and healthy."" Through the Ontario Together website, the government will be partnering with some of the most innovative people across Canada and around the world, in order to redirect resources and explore new ways of doing business creatively and efficiently. ""Responding to COVID-19 is requiring all of us to think outside of the box and move quickly,"" said Lisa Thompson, Minister of Government and Consumer Services. ""By relying on status-quo procurement tools and techniques we will be unable to keep up with this rapidly evolving situation. Ontario Together will help us overcome the unique challenges we are facing today.""

Enhanced Health Care Coverage Critical to Support Efforts to Contain COVID-19

Ministry of Health


TORONTO — As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve globally and locally, Ontario is taking decisive and swift action to ensure the province continues to protect the health and well-being of Ontarians.
To ensure that anyone in need of care can receive it, Ontario is waiving the three-month waiting period for Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) coverage. Additionally, the province will cover the cost of COVID-19 services for uninsured people who do not meet the criteria for OHIP coverage. Together, these measures will ensure that no one will be discouraged from seeking screening or treatment for COVID-19 for financial reasons.""The health and well-being of Ontarians continues to be our government's number one priority,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""That's why we're working to guarantee that anyone who needs screening or care for COVID-19 will get it. In doing so, we can further help ensure we contain the spread of this virus."" These measures are in addition to Ontario's recent announcement that Ontarians with expiring and expired health cards will continue to have access to insured health services. Ontario is continuing to work with all partners across the system, from public health to hospitals and community care, to do everything we can to contain COVID-19 and ensure that the system is prepared to respond to any scenario. Visit Ontario's website to learn more about how the province continues to protect Ontarians from COVID-19.

Treasury Board Secretariat


TORONTO — Ontario is continuing to restore trust and accountability to government by releasing the salaries of Ontario Public Service and Broader Public Sector employees who were paid $100,000 or more in 2019, in accordance with the Public Sector Salary Disclosure Act, 1996.
Compensation as captured in the Public Sector Salary Disclosure can include employees who are being promoted in their career, natural progression through salary ranges, overtime payments, severance payments, one-time performance-based payments and payments that may be required on retirement. ""Our government's priority is the health and safety of all Ontarians and we are singularly focused on our response to the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Peter Bethlenfalvy, President of the Treasury Board. ""However, our government has also made commitments to the people of Ontario on transparency, accountability and respecting their tax dollars."" The Public Sector Salary Disclosure Act, 1996 makes Ontario's public sector more open and accountable to taxpayers. The act requires organizations that receive public funding from the Province of Ontario to make public, by March 31 each year, the names, positions, salaries and total taxable benefits of employees paid $100,000 or more in the previous calendar year. The act applies to the provincial government, Crown agencies and corporations, Ontario Power Generation and subsidiaries, publicly funded organizations such as hospitals, municipalities, school boards, universities and colleges, and not-for-profit organizations that receive $1 million or more, or receive between $120,000 and $1 million if the funding they receive is 10 per cent or more of their gross revenues. ""We have taken positive steps and seen real results, but we must continue working hard to ensure each dollar spent gets the best results for Ontarians,"" said Bethlenfalvy. ""Our government has a prudent and responsible plan to manage the province's finances and make sure we have the fiscal flexibility to deal with any challenge."" The 2019 data is available in a downloadable, machine-readable, sortable, searchable table format on Ontario.ca/salarydisclosure, making it transparent and accessible to the people of Ontario.

Ministry of the Solicitor General


TORONTO — Today, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General, issued the following statement regarding regulatory changes to temporary absences and parole at Ontario's adult correctional facilities as a further precautionary response to COVID-19:
""As Ontario continues to act to slow the spread of COVID-19, we are making further changes to protect our frontline workers and our health care system from the burden an outbreak in our correctional system could cause. On March 13, we announced measures to protect Ontario's adult correctional facilities from COVID-19 by granting intermittent inmates, who serve time on the weekends, temporary absences from custody, and temporarily halting personal visits. Intermittent inmates have already been deemed low-risk by the courts and remain in the community Monday to Friday to live and work. Building on these changes, Ontario is implementing amendments to Regulation 778 under the Ministry of Correctional Services Act to allow senior corrections officials to expand the use of temporary absences and for the Ontario Parole Board to use alternatives to in-person meetings. Going forward, correctional services will have the option to issue temporary absences beyond the current 72-hour maximum. This means those serving intermittent sentences, who have been granted a temporary absence will not have to report to a correctional facility every weekend, which will avoid cycling individuals back and forth between the community and a correctional facility.  In addition, the longer-term temporary absences will allow for early release of those inmates who are near the end of their sentence. To ensure public safety, inmates would be carefully assessed to ensure they are a low risk to reoffend. Those inmates who have been convicted of serious crimes, such as violent crimes or crimes involving guns, would not be considered for early release. A second regulatory amendment will allow the Ontario Parole Board to conduct hearings by electronic or written means, rather than solely in-person, providing alternate options for hearings. We continue to evaluate all options to limit the possible spread of COVID-19 within our correctional system. These regulatory amendments will help us preserve the integrity of our health care system, protect our frontline workers and help keep our communities safe.""

""The health and safety of Ontarians continues to remain our top priority. As announced yesterday, the province is extending the validity of government driver, vehicle, carrier products and services to help keep people safe and reduce the need for in-person visits to DriveTest centres. We want to assure Ontarians no driver's licence applicant will lose test fees as result of a last-minute cancellation or not attending DriveTest or as a result of a DriveTest interruption in service. In addition to the road test fees, we will also be waiving the current ""Fail to Keep Appointment"" penalty fee. Ontario will ensure that no customer will lose their current licence or lose their prepaid testing fees due to the current situation. If you have a road test scheduled and would like to reschedule please do so in advance of your appointment date. This direction will be in place until further notice, based on the advice of Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health and public health officials. We encourage people to use the extended validation period, and to follow the advice of our medical professions and stay at home. We have a responsibility to Ontarians to ensure that we take every possible step to enable social distancing and stop the spread of COVID-19. These additional measures are expected to minimize any impact to the driving needs of Ontarians during COVID-19.""

TORONTO — Today, Premier Doug Ford joined Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education to launch the first phase of Learn at Home and Apprendre à la maison, a new online portal that will provide resources for families so students can continue their education while schools are closed due to the ongoing COVID-19 situation.
""As a father myself, I know parents always want the best for their children, and I also know from speaking to parents that many are concerned that their child is going to fall behind while schools are closed during this difficult period,"" said Premier Ford. ""To support families and students, our government has developed a one-stop spot for at-home learning. It doesn't replace school, but offers a great alternative as we approach the end of March Break."" Learn at Home offers all students high-quality, made-in-Ontario math and literacy resources, created by Ontario-certified educators, in both English and French. Elementary resources are designed to help young students learn at home with interactive activities that encourage participation through entertaining and stimulating digital content. High school content was designed with a focus on STEM courses and ensure core competencies and skills are reinforced. The government is also providing access to course content for students who take the initiative to refresh and extend their learning.  ""The Learn at Home initiative will help mitigate 'learning loss' during this period of uncertainty,"" said Minister Lecce. ""Our plan will provide interactive teacher-led math supports to keep students learning and empower all students to learn key skills with an emphasis on STEM education, while also arming parents with resources to support them as their kids learn at home."" ""By offering new at-home educational resources, the province is further supporting Ontario's families as they help contain the spread of COVID-19,"" said Christine Elliott, Minister of Health. ""Each and every Ontarian has a role to play in flattening the curve. Our government is providing families with the support they need so that they can continue to contribute to our shared goal of protecting the health and wellbeing of all Ontarians, including our young students."" ""TVO is proud to be part of this important initiative by the Ministry of Education."" said Jennifer Hinshelwood, TVO's Acting Chief Operating Officer. ""TVO's suite of digital learning products are designed to engage young minds in learning - a mission that seems doubly important at times like this when many of our traditional learning environments are not accessible."" The at-home activities offered by Learn at Home provide quick and easy access to some of Ontario's best online kindergarten to grade 12 learning resources produced by Ontario College of Teachers (OCT) Educators. As part of the government's commitment to planning for every scenario, the province is working closely with education stakeholders to develop a plan for scaling and building additional online learning programs. ""In these uncertain times, we are proud as a public agency to join the Ministry of Education's efforts in supporting families and students,"" said Eric Minoli, TFO's Chief Operating Officer. ""Our online Apprendre à la maison program will help ensure continuity in education for Francophone and Francophile parents. TFO will be offering daily activities which will be accessible at all times on our IDELLO.ORG platform, BOUKILI.CA and our TV channel. TFO will remain a proud partner of all families through a tailored program of fun, high-quality educational activities and content, all of which will be aligned with the curriculum of Ontario.""

Ontario public schools will be closed from March 14 through to April 5, 2020 in an effort to contain the spread of COVID-19. Similarly, private schools and licensed child care centres will also be closed until April 5, 2020.
EQAO assessments for the 2019-20 school year have been cancelled, including the Ontario Secondary School Literacy test. The literacy requirement for students graduating in the 2019-20 school year has also been waived.
The Ministry of Education is working with TVO and TFO to roll-out robust education programming on their broadcast channels, with a phased-in approach commencing next week. This iterative process will ensure that Ontario students and families have additional mediums available for engaging with high-quality, made-in-Ontario education resources that support a continuity of learning for students.

Emergency Sitting Sees Two Critical Pieces of Legislation Receive Unanimous Consent 

March 19, 2020  2:25 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO ― Today, the Ontario government took unprecedented action to respond to COVID-19 by convening an emergency sitting of the legislature and passing two pieces of legislation which will protect the jobs of employees who self-isolate or quarantine, help keep store shelves stocked and give municipal councils the flexibility to continue operations while maintaining social distance.
The legislation passed with unanimous consent by only 26 MPPs. The number of members participating in this extraordinary session was intentionally kept small in order to practice social distancing and help prevent the spread of COVID-19. A first in Ontario history. ""I want to thank all parties for coming together to pass this important legislation so we can deliver immediate relief to Ontario workers and families,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""The health and safety of the people of Ontario is our number one priority and that's why we are protecting the jobs of workers and making sure that essentials like groceries, household basics, and medicine can arrive on store shelves. We must work together as Team Ontario to slow the spread of COVID-19 and flatten the curve."" The Employment Standards Amendment Act (Infectious Disease Emergencies), 2020 provides job-protected leave for employees who are in isolation or quarantine due to COVID-19, or those who need to be away from work to care for children because of school or day care closures or to care for other relatives. These measures are retroactive to January 25, 2020, the date the first presumptive COVID-19 case was confirmed in Ontario. The legislation will also make it clear employees cannot be required to show sick notes. ""During this time of great uncertainty, the last thing employees should have to worry about is job security,"" said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""People can't be punished for following the advice of our leading medical health professionals."" The Municipal Emergency Act, 2020 will ensure that for the near future, the delivery of goods to Ontario's businesses and consumers isn't impacted by municipal noise by-laws that may unintentionally be impeding such deliveries when they are most urgently needed. The legislation also gives municipalities the ability to fully conduct Council, local board and committee meetings electronically when faced with local and province-wide emergencies, empowering the government's municipal partners to respond quickly when in-person meetings cannot be held. ""These changes will assist in getting goods to market in a more expeditious manner. Our government wants to do everything we can to help connect distribution centres with grocery stores and pharmacies to replenish empty shelves more quickly,"" said Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. ""As well, we are helping communities respond to this crisis by allowing councils to conduct meetings remotely. These changes empower municipalities to respond quickly and continue to function when in-person meetings cannot be held, and council decisions need to be made.""

New Measures and Regulations Will Reduce In-person Visits to Help Contain Spread of COVID-19

March 19, 2020 12:00 P.M.

Ministry of Transportation


Ontario continues to take decisive action to protect the health and safety of all individuals and families.
As part of the province's enhanced measures, the Ministry of Transportation and Ministry of Health, in cooperation with the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services and ServiceOntario, is extending the validity period of driving products, services and health cards. These changes reduce the need for in-person visits to ServiceOntario, International Registration Plan offices and DriveTest centres during the COVID-19 outbreak, helping to promote social distancing and contain the spread of the virus. These new regulations include extensions for driver licences, licence plate validation, Ontario Photo Cards, and Commercial Vehicle Operator Registration certificates, among others. Expiring and expired health cards will continue to provide access to health services. The Ministry of Transportation is also automatically extending the due dates for medical or vision reports, which both reduces the need for in-person visits, but also ensures that patients do not need to visit their doctors, helping the health system to focus on containing COVID-19. ""We have a responsibility to Ontarians to ensure that we take every possible step to enable social distancing and stop the spread of COVID-19,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""By implementing these additional measures, Ontarians can avoid putting themselves at risk and will continue to have access to the services that they need, when they need them."" This extension will be in place until such time that, based on the advice of Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health and public health officials, the current situation improves. ""We're working with all partners across the system to do everything we can to contain this virus and ensure that the system is prepared to respond to any scenario,"" said Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation. ""These changes will help relieve the burden already faced by Ontarians and businesses by providing more time to renew their licences and permits without being penalized, while also reducing the need for in-person visits."" The Ministry of Transportation will continue to deliver time-critical services, including Motor Vehicle Inspection Station Stock orders and Single-Trip Oversize/Overweight permits. ""We urge our customers not to visit a ServiceOntario centre unless absolutely necessary,"" said Lisa Thompson, Minister of Government and Consumer Services. ""We encourage people to complete transactions online or use the extended validation period, and to follow the advice of our medical professions and stay at home."" As per advice from the Chief Medical Officer, we are encouraging everyone to take appropriate measures to protect themselves from the novel coronavirus. This includes staying home if you are sick and avoiding contact with people who are sick.

Ministry of the Attorney General


TORONTO — Today, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Doug Downey, Attorney General, issued the following statement in response to COVID-19 and the government's commitment to keep communities safe while continuing to hold offenders accountable:
""The health and well-being of Ontarians is our government's number one priority. This commitment extends across the vast network of justice partners and individuals who interact with the justice system on a daily basis. We are working around the clock with our partners to respond to this constantly evolving public health issue. Adjustments are being made throughout the justice system to minimize disruption and continue to provide seamless, responsive justice services to all Ontarians, particularly the most vulnerable members of our communities. Technology Solutions and Prioritizing Urgent Matters To sustain these efforts and to address health and safety concerns raised by legal service professionals, Ontario courts and tribunals are limiting in-person proceedings and making use of audio and video conferencing to hear priority matters remotely, where possible. Justice partners are working collaboratively to develop and deploy technology solutions and other innovative tools across the province to ensure urgent matters can be heard without needing to appear in person. This approach will also help to mitigate the potential impacts of possible service disruptions. Courts and tribunals are also deferring non-urgent matters until they can be managed safely and securely.  Ontario's judges and justices of the peace continue to prioritize critical matters such as criminal and child protection proceedings. There is strong collaboration across the system to ensure that urgent and priority legal matters continue to be heard before our courts and tribunals. All Tribunals Ontario in-person proceedings, including at the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal, Landlord and Tenant Board and Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario, are postponed and will be rescheduled at a later date. Where feasible, alternative hearing options such as written and telephone hearings will be considered. Front-line counter services will be closed until further notice. We are also working very closely with our partners and colleagues in Ontario's court systems to ensure Ontarians can see justice done while also prioritizing the protection of public health in the province. The following actions have been taken across the justice system:   The Superior Court of Justice has suspended all regular court operations until further notice, while continuing to hear urgent matters during this emergency period. All sittings of the Small Claims Court in Ontario are suspended until further notice.   The Ontario Court of Justice has established procedures to reduce the number of people who attend court in-person for criminal and family matters. All non-urgent matters have been adjourned. All Provincial Offences Act matters scheduled up to and including April 3, 2020 will be adjourned and rescheduled to a later date. Tickets, fines or other court business may be handled online.   The Court of Appeal has suspended all scheduled appeals until April 3, 2020. During this period, urgent appeals will be heard based on either the written materials or remotely.   Keeping People Safe We are committed to ensuring Ontarians remain safe and secure during this challenging time and are looking at all tools to help individuals and families stay in their homes. As part of this approach, the Ministry of the Attorney General has been granted an order suspending the enforcement of residential evictions until ordered otherwise by the court. Tribunals Ontario will not issue any new eviction orders until further notice. Sheriff's offices have been asked to postpone any scheduled enforcement of eviction orders currently set for this week. We want to thank our partners at the Superior and Ontario Courts of Justice, Tribunals Ontario, and the front-line workers across our justice system who are working hard to keep everyone safe and healthy while maintaining the administration of justice in our province. Ontario takes the health and safety of court users, staff and the judiciary very seriously. As this public health situation evolves, the government is committed to providing Ontarians with safe and reliable access to critical front-line services, including supporting the delivery of justice at its courthouses and tribunals. We are closely monitoring developments and will continue to provide updates as the situation evolves.""

Ministry for Seniors and Accessibility


TORONTO — Today, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Raymond Cho, Minister for Seniors and Accessibility, issued the following statement regarding Ontario's older adults in response to COVID-19:
""The health and wellness of seniors is of the utmost importance to our government. That is why yesterday Premier Doug Ford announced a $5 million investment to protect seniors in retirement homes through increased infection control and active screening procedures. We would like to reassure all Ontarians that the province has been diligently monitoring the developing situation in all: long-term care facilities, retirement and seniors' homes. The health, wellbeing and safety of all Ontarians is paramount to our government. In order to ensure a safe, healthy and secure environment for residents, the Chief Medical Officer of Health has recommended that licensed retirement homes only allow essential visitors—people visiting residents who are very ill or require end-of-life care—until further notice. Licensed retirement homes will continue to actively screen essential visitors and staff before they enter the home. It is recommended that no other visitors should be permitted to enter these premises. Instead, they should be asked to keep in touch with loved ones by phone or other technologies, as available. This recommendation was not made lightly. We recognize visits provide important social connections and improvements to quality of life for many residents and families may feel frustration, sadness and even anger considering this change. However, during the global COVID-19 pandemic, the health and well-being of Ontarians—especially retirement home residents who may be more vulnerable to such diseases, as well as their families and staff—is our number one priority. During this extraordinary time, it is as important as ever to be aware of all our older Ontarians and people with disabilities who may be vulnerable to social isolation. We encourage everyone to check in on elderly family members, people with disabilities and neighbours in your community with a phone or video call. We also encourage those who are able to help with errands such as picking up groceries for those who should remain at home and self isolate."" Visit Ontario's website to learn more about how the province continues to protect Ontarians from COVID-19. For individuals with loved ones living in a retirement home with questions regarding this procedure, please contact the Retirement Homes Regulatory Authority at 1-855-ASK-RHRA or at info@rhra.ca.

Ontario Taking Another Step to Integrate the Health Care System


March 18, 2020  9:30 A.M.

Ministry of Health


Ontario is building healthier and safer communities by taking further steps to end hallway health care and build an integrated, connected health care system. Today, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, issued a transfer order under the Connecting Care Act, 2019 to transfer the Ontario Telemedicine Network (OTN) to Ontario Health, the province's new health agency. The transfer will take effect on April 1, 2020.
""Our government is breaking down siloes within the health care sector as part of our plan to end hallway health care and build a modern, sustainable and connected health care system for current and future generations,"" said Elliott. ""A new health agency with one strategy and one set of priorities, the province is able to leverage the best practices and combine expertise from all the health agencies and now Ontario Telemedicine Network. This will ultimately better support health care providers with the tools, resources and information to deliver high-quality care to Ontarians."" The transfer of OTN into Ontario Health will further pave the way for digital-first approaches to health care in Ontario and improve the integration and efficiency of virtual care across the health care system. Based on feedback and guidance from Ontario Health, the transfer of the health system funding, planning and coordination functions of the Local Health Integration Networks (LHINs) will be postponed as the province continues to actively respond to COVID-19. Plans will be made to transfer these functions into Ontario Health at a later date. ""Now more than ever, everyone at Ontario Health is united behind a commitment to supporting front line providers as they continue delivering high-quality health care services to Ontarians, where and when they need them,"" said Matthew Anderson, President and CEO of Ontario Health. ""To this end, we are applying the collective knowledge and critical skills of all the organizations and individuals who have transferred in, which will soon include our great colleagues at OTN, to all areas of health care."" Ontario has a comprehensive plan to end hallway health care, which includes making investments and advancing new initiatives across four pillars:  Prevention and health promotion: keeping patients as healthy as possible in their communities and out of hospitals.Providing the right care in the right place: when patients need care, ensure that they receive it in the most appropriate setting, not always the hospital. This includes expanding access to home and community care.Integration and improved patient flow: better integrate care providers to ensure patients spend less time waiting in hospitals when they are ready to be discharged. Ontario Health Teams will play a critical role in connecting care providers and, in doing so, helping to end hallway health care.Building capacity: build new hospital and long-term care beds while increasing community-based services across Ontario.

Medical Officer of Health offers condolences to family and friends

Ministry of Health


TORONTO — Today, Dr. David Williams, Chief Medical Officer of Health issued the following statement in response to a death in Ontario potentially related to COVID-19:
""It brings me great sadness to report a death in Ontario that is potentially related to COVID-19. The individual was a 77-year old man who passed away on March 11 at the Royal Victoria Hospital. This individual was a close contact of a positive case and COVID-19 was recently identified after death. The coroner's investigation is ongoing and more will be known about the specific cause of death in the days ahead. I know all Ontario families join me in extending our heartfelt condolences to his friends, family and loved ones. I would also like to thank all the staff who provided him excellent care. This death is further evidence of the increasingly seriousness of the situation we are in, which is why the province has been taking decisive steps to manage the spread of COVID-19 in Ontario. Earlier today, the Ontario government enacted a declaration of emergency closing all facilities providing indoor recreational programs, public libraries, private schools, licensed child care centres, theatres, cinemas, concert venues and bars and restaurants, except to the extent that such facilities provide takeout food and delivery. These closures are effective immediately. The declaration also prohibits organized public events of over 50 people, including parades and events and communal services within places of worship until March 31st. It is now more important than ever that we all take steps to reduce opportunities for transmission. By working together, we can make a different in this outbreak and protect those among us who are most vulnerable to COVID-19.""

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Today, Premier Doug Ford and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, issued the following statement about ongoing and extensive efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19:
""Since we first learned of COVID-19, Ontario has actively monitored the developing situation and has acted decisively to contain the spread of this new virus to protect the health and well-being of all Ontarians. Given the latest developments both internationally and here at home, including growing evidence of community spread, the province is taking further action to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Based on advice from Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. David Williams, Ontario is responding to the evolving situation by moving forward with new measures to help contain the virus, including the recommended closure of all recreational programs and libraries, private schools, daycares, churches and other faith settings, as well as bars and restaurants, except those that may only offer takeout or delivery. These closures would be in line with the updated guidance to avoid large gatherings of over 50 people. We recognize that these measures will significantly impact the lives of many Ontarians. However, as the number of cases in Ontario continues to grow, we must heed the advice of our public health experts and take decisive action to protect the health and safety of the public, our government's top priority. As this situation continues to evolve, we are prepared to continue to respond quickly and effectively to any scenario to keep Ontarians safe."" Read the latest recommendations from Dr. Williams outlining enhanced public health measures and what Ontarians should do to help limit the transmission of COVID-19.

Enhanced Measures to Protect Ontarians from COVID-19

Ministry of Health


TORONTO — Today, Dr. David Williams, Chief Medical Officer of Health issued the following statement detailing enhanced public health measures to help contain the spread of COVID-19:
""Following a number of significant announcements regarding travel and public health measures over the past 72 hours, and after further consultations with my colleagues across Canada, I would like to take the opportunity to clarify my guidance to Ontarians on COVID-19. This is an evolving situation, and your role in helping to manage the spread of COVID-19 in Ontario is critical. It is imperative that we take steps now and take steps together to reduce opportunities for transmission. I am asking for your cooperation in following the advice below as best you can over the coming weeks. By working together, we can make a difference in this outbreak and protect those among us who are most vulnerable to COVID-19. The symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, new cough and difficulty breathing, and these may occur within 14 days of an exposure to another case.  Additional closures I am strongly recommending a further limitation to public gatherings from my advice on March 12, 2020. I am further advising Ontarians to avoid large gatherings of over 50 people. In addition, I am specifically requesting the closure of the following settings as soon as possible:  All recreational programs and librariesAll private schoolsAll daycaresAll churches and other faith settingsAll bars and restaurants, with the exception of restaurants that can shift to takeout/delivery mechanisms If you do not have any symptoms of COVID-19 Everyone in Ontario should be practicing social distancing to reduce their exposure to other people. This means that you can carry out daily activities, such as going to work (if you cannot work from home) and doing necessary shopping and appointments.   I ask that everyone in Ontario does their best to avoid close contact with people outside of their immediate families. Close contact includes being within 2 meters of another person.  In addition: If you believe you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 symptoms, I recommend that you begin to self-monitor for a period of 14 days. This means that, in addition to social distancing, you should track how you feel. You should take your temperature daily and log any other symptoms that develop (e.g., sore throat, new cough). You can share these records with your primary care provider over the phone if you seek assessment services.   All persons over 70 years of age and individuals who are immunocompromised are advised to self-isolate for a period of 14 days. This means that you should only leave your home or see other people for essential reasons.  Where possible, you should seek services over the phone or internet or ask for help from friends, family or neighbours with essential errands.  If you have travelled outside of Canada in the last 14 days If you have travelled and are not a healthcare worker or another essential service worker, I ask that you self-isolate for 14 days since your arrival in Canada. People who are self-isolating should not go to work. In addition:  Workers who have travelled and are part of workplaces that are essential to daily living are able to return to work as long as they are asymptomatic. However, they should self-monitor for a period of 14 days and identify themselves to their employer so that a plan can be put into place to ensure the protection of those workplaces.Children under the age of 16 years who have travelled outside of Canada should also self-isolate for a period of 14 days. Parents should actively monitor their children's symptoms. Children who are self-isolating should stay at home and avoid social gathering points such as community centres or parks.  Public Health Ontario has excellent fact sheets on how to self monitor and self isolate. If you start to feel symptoms of COVID-19 I am requesting anyone who begins to feel unwell (fever, new cough or difficulty breathing) to return home and self-isolate immediately. People who are self-isolating should seek clinical assessment over the phone - either through TeleHealth Ontario (1-866-797-0000) or by calling their primary care provider's office. If you need additional assessment, your primary care provider or TeleHealth will direct you to in-person care options. If you are in medical distress and need urgent care, you should call 911 and let them know what you are self-isolating because of COVID-19. If you are an employer I am asking all employers in Ontarians to facilitate virtual work arrangements to enable employees to work from home where possible to enable workers to limit their activities, care for children and to self isolate. However, I recognize that there are a number of workplaces where this is not possible. I would ask those employers to use their judgement to sustain operations in a manner that maintains social distancing. If need to seek health care for COVID-19 If you are unwell and need to seek health assessment for COVID-19 there are three options to available:    A Self Assessment Tool available at: https://www.ontario.ca/page/2019-novel-coronavirusTelehealth Ontario at: 1-866-797-0000 (24/7)Your primary care provider - you should call your primary care provider and they will provide virtual assessment by phone or other technology. You should not book an in-person visit for COVID-19 assessment without first having a virtual assessment.  If you require an in-person health assessment, you will be referred to an appropriate location for in-person health assessment.  Only people with COVID-19 symptoms will be tested.   I want to remind all Ontarians that there are important actions that they should be taking every day in order to protect your health. These include:       washing your hands often with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizersneezing and cough into your sleeveavoid touching your eyes, nose or mouthavoid contact with people who are sickstay at home if you are sick. In particular, do not visit a long-term care, retirement home or other congregate living situation.  Thank you for all of your support. These are difficult times, but together we will move through and protect the most vulnerable among us.""

Ministry of Finance


TORONTO — Today, Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance issued the following statement in response to the impact of COVID-19 on Ontario's finances and economy:
""The events of recent weeks have caused anxiety for individuals, families and businesses across our province and around the world. As I said last week, these developments are the latest reminder that Ontario is part of an integrated global economy. As Premier Ford has made clear, our government will ensure the necessary resources are in place to protect the health of people and our economy in this province. Circumstances have changed rapidly in recent days. Markets around the world are volatile.  Employers and workers are feeling the economic impacts. The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. During that time, I have been in frequent conversations with various experts, my fellow finance ministers, business and union leaders, and my colleagues at Queen's Park.  At the request of Premier Ford, I have convened a regular meeting of the ministers in our government who share economic responsibilities. The work of that committee includes reaching out on a daily basis to leaders at businesses big and small, including at our financial institutions, as well as unions, to ensure we have the latest information, and that there is an open line of communication as the government works to address COVID-19's impact on the economy.   In response to events here at home and around the world, private-sector economists have revised the economic outlook used to develop the 2020 Ontario Budget scheduled to be released next Wednesday.   As Ontario's Minister of Finance, it is important that I introduce a financial plan for the province that is as current as possible given the dynamic situation. So instead of a full Budget, I will release an economic and fiscal update on March 25 based on our best understanding of the current situation.  This update will include a realistic one-year outlook based on current economic projections. It will provide certainty to hospitals, schools, municipalities, and other partners for the year to come. Our approach will include increased resources for our healthcare system, direct support for people, and action to protect jobs and our economy. This is a responsible course that maintains confidence and stability, while providing the flexibility to respond quickly to changing events.  We will build on our record of transparency, with regular financial updates as the situation evolves.  We will ensure the people of Ontario are informed by the most up-to-date information that is available. And as you all know, that information is changing rapidly.  It will also allow for close collaboration with our partners, including the federal government, to protect Ontario's economy. Experience has shown this work is most effective when governments collaborate. This is exactly what I have proposed to the federal government.   I was pleased to sit down with my colleague, Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau in Ottawa last week. We have stayed in close contact over the weekend and I'll be participating in a call with all of the provincial finance ministers later today.  Our government will make additional resources available to ensure Ontario's health-care system is able to respond to any scenario.  Our health-care professionals have our backs. They can be confident their government has theirs. Finally, I want to reiterate Premier Ford's commitment to support people throughout this crisis. From washing your hands to checking in on the most vulnerable among us, the people of Ontario are acting responsibly and doing their part during this global pandemic. Their government will do its part as well. Premier Ford and Minister McNaughton just spoke about some important measures in that regard.  Ontario's has strong economic fundamentals. We have more fiscal flexibility to respond to these sort of global events through actions we've taken over the previous 18 months. I'm confident that by acting decisively, and working together with our partners, Ontario is well positioned to weather the challenges ahead.""

Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry


The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry would like to remind anglers that species-specific closures are in place to protect the fishery, and it is illegal to fish for those species during closed seasons.
An investigation has resulted in a Wisconsin man being fined $6,000 for fishing offences related to fishing out-of-season on Lake Nipigon. On June 8, 2019, conservation officers observed an individual fishing for, and keeping, walleye during the closed season on Tweed Creek, part of Lake Nipigon. They also observed the angler cleaning the walleye on his boat while still on the water. When approached by the conservation officers, the angler was in possession of walleye cut up into pieces. He admitted to angling with barbed hooks, which is prohibited tackle. Wayne Nasi, of Hurley, Wisconsin pleaded guilty to angling and keeping walleye with a barbed hook, as well as cutting the fish so the species could not be readily identified by a conservation officer. In the Thunder Bay Court on February 5, 2020, Justice of the Peace Bruce Leaman considered Nasi's previous convictions when fining the man $6,000 and suspending his fishing licence for four years. The part of the Tweed Creek where Nasi was fishing is in Zone 6 where the angling season for walleye is closed each year from April 14 to June 10 to protect walleye during their spawning season.  To report a natural resource violation or provide information about an unsolved case, members of the public can call the ministry TIPS line toll free at 1-877-847-7667 or contact your local ministry office.

Ministry of Long-Term Care


TORONTO — Today, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care, issued the following statement related to long-term care and COVID-19 in Ontario:
""Since we first learned of COVID-19, Ontario has been diligently monitoring the developing situation and taking decisive action to contain the spread of this new virus and ensure the province's health care system is ready for any scenario. As the situation continues to change, the province is actively working with our partners at all levels in the health care system to implement enhanced measures and update protocols and procedures as necessary. In order to ensure a safe and secure environment for residents, the Chief Medical Officer of Health recently advised long-term care homes to only allow essential visitors—people visiting residents who are very ill or require end-of-life care—until further notice. This decision was not made lightly. We recognize visits provide important social connections and improvements to quality of life for long-term care residents and families may feel frustration, sadness and even anger in light of this change. However, during the global COVID-19 pandemic, the health and well-being of Ontarians—especially long-term care residents who are more vulnerable to such diseases, as well as their families and staff—is our number one priority. We would like to assure families that we are closely monitoring the situation and will provide our homes across the province with an update on this guidance as the situation evolves. Our government is taking all the necessary precautions to ensure loved ones in Ontario's long-term care homes are safe and secure. Long-term care homes will continue to restrict non-essential visits and actively screen essential visitors, staff, students, volunteers, residents moving into a long-term care home and residents returning to a long-term care home. In addition, when long-term care homes submit samples for standard respiratory testing as part of their respiratory infection outbreak protocols currently in place for flu season, they are also being tested for COVID-19 automatically to ensure the province identifies potentially unknown cases. Our government is monitoring the situation closely with plans to re-evaluate in the coming weeks and will ensure consistency with other public health measures in effect. We also want to thank the staff working at long-term care homes in these challenging conditions. Their efforts and dedication during this time will go far to improve the lives of those residents in homes. Everyday actions that reduce exposure to the virus and help prevent the spread of germs should be continually practiced. For credible information on how to protect yourself, what to do if you're sick after you travel and how to recognize possible symptoms visit Ontario's website. Ontario has also established dedicated assessment centres in areas experiencing significant growth in COVID-19 testing, with additional centres being established across the province in the coming weeks. Before visiting an assessment centre, individuals should first seek guidance on whether it is appropriate for them to do so. Ontarians can do so by using a new online self-assessment tool, calling Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000 or calling their local public health unit. People should not go to an assessment centre unless they have symptoms of COVID-19.""

Premier Ford Announces Job Protection for Workers during the COVID-19 Situation
Ontario to Protect Workers who Take Leaves from Work

March 16, 2020 11:15 A.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Ontario is acting immediately to protect workers during the COVID-19 crisis. Today, Premier Doug Ford and Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development, announced that the government intends to introduce legislation that, if passed, would immediately provide job-protected leave to employees in isolation or quarantine due to COVID-19, or those who need to be away from work to care for children because of school or day care closures.
""While everyone's concerns about their health and safety is top of mind, the last thing we need is anyone worrying about job security as the COVID-19 situation evolves,"" said Premier Ford. ""That's why I directed the Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development to draft legislation that will protect workers and their families during this difficult period."" ""Mothers and fathers who need to care for children or dependants shouldn't have to worry about losing their job,"" said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""The same goes for people who receive medical or public health advice and are required to take precautions as a result. They shouldn't have to worry about losing their job. In this time of uncertainty, we need to support employees who must isolate or quarantine themselves, or who need to care for a loved one."" The proposed legislation would, if passed, provide job protection for employees unable to work for the following reasons: · The employee is under medical investigation, supervision or treatment for COVID-19. · The employee is acting in accordance with an order under the Health Protection and Promotion Act. · The employee is in isolation or quarantine. · The employee is acting in accordance with public health information or direction. · The employer directs the employee not to work. · The employee needs to provide care to a person for a reason related to COVID-19 such as a school or day-care closure. The proposed legislation would also make it clear that an employee will not be required to provide a medical note if they take the leave. The measures would be retroactive to January 25, 2020, the date that the first presumptive COVID-19 case was confirmed in Ontario. Many workers will be eligible for Employment Insurance sickness benefits. As well, we are reviewing current access and eligibility to emergency assistance which is available through the Ontario Works (OW) program to support individuals who are impacted by the coronavirus and who are not able to meet their basic living expenses. ""The health and well-being of Ontarians continues to be our government's number one priority,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""We are actively working with our partners at all levels in the health care system and implementing enhanced and comprehensive measures to prevent the spread of this virus and protect the health of all Ontarians."" ""These job protections could also contribute significantly to limiting the spread of COVID-19,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. ""We are giving everyone the tools they need to put their health and the health of others first, without fear of losing their jobs.""

TORONTO — Today, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services, provided an update on the measures being put into place across the social services and youth justice sectors:
“Protecting the health and well-being of all Ontarians, including the staff and clients in Ontario’s social services and youth justice sectors, is our government’s number one priority.  In line with the advice of Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, and to ensure a safe and secure environment for all, the province is recommending that, where feasible, our service providers consider only allowing essential visitors until further notice. We are also asking that they undertake a screening process at all locations. We have prepared a toolkit including a screening checklist and signage to aid in ensuring these measures can be implemented.  The following measures have been put into place in provincially operated youth justice centres:  Suspending all personal visitors and cancelling volunteer activities. Professional visits including legal counsel will continue however, though consideration should be given to alternative options such as the use of teleconferences. Approved personal visitors will be able to continue to maintain contact with youth by phone. Enhanced technology, such as video calling, where operationally available and operationally feasible, can be used to allow virtual visits with family. All non-essential reintegration leaves will be restricted until further notice. Reintegration leaves help youth in custody to reintegrate back into the community and support their rehabilitation by allowing them to leave a facility for medical, humanitarian/compassionate, employment and/or educational reasons for a specified time while following set terms and conditions, including staff escorts.   We have also provided each of our community partners the most recent update and recommendations for enhanced public health measures from Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. We encourage all community partners to also seek direction from their local public health units.  We will continue to actively monitor the situation and take any necessary steps to ensure the safety of staff and those in our care.”  Visit Ontario’s website to learn more about how the province continues to protect Ontarians from COVID-19.

Province Expanding Telehealth Ontario Resources
Ensuring Timely Responses for Ontarians

March 16, 2020  8:15 A.M.

Ministry of Health


TORONTO — As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve locally and globally, Ontario is taking further action to ensure the province's health care system is prepared to continue to protect the health and well-being of Ontarians.
Working closely with Telehealth Ontario, the province is rapidly expanding service capacity to ensure timely responses. This is a critical step to help address the increased daily call volumes and reduce call wait times. ""By immediately expanding Telehealth's resources, we can significantly reduce the time it takes for Ontarians to receive the information they need to stay safe and healthy,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""We are also initiating further discussions with our nursing partners to ensure there are Telehealth resources in place moving forward as COVID-19 continues to evolve. We will be ready for any scenario."" Phase 1: Immediately Increase Resources to Reduce Call Wait Times Yesterday, the province and Ontario Health started to deploy approximately 130 nurses to conduct symptom assessments and referrals among callers who request a callback. Nurses will work from existing regional offices to provide immediate support and respond to callers seeking a callback to help mitigate current wait times. To onboard these additional nursing resources, Telehealth has developed a specific training package for newly added nurses to expedite their ability to provide callback support immediately. Telehealth will also increase intake staff to reduce wait times for initial contact with a Telehealth representative. Telehealth has been providing valuable support to the Ministry's Emergency Operations Centre (MEOC) since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in mid-January. In February, Telehealth began to add additional resources to manage increased daily call volumes, including seven full-time Registered Nurses and 10 customer service representatives. Phase 2: Continue to Manage COVID-19 Call Volumes While implementation of Phase 1 is currently underway, Ontario and Telehealth have already begun planning rollout of Phase 2. To further increase intake and nursing capacity over the coming days and weeks, Ontario is actively working with the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario (RNAO) to identify support for Telehealth from its 44,000 registered nurse members. The province has also started to explore existing non-clinical resources within the Ontario Public Service and other broader public sector organizations to support Telehealth's call volumes. In order to be prepared to be nimble and effective in any scenario, Ontario is also exploring a partnership with organizations which have existing health care call centres to provide symptom assessment for COVID-19 to callers requesting a callback.  ""We understand that people are anxious to get the advice about next steps as soon as possible, which is why the capacity of Telehealth is being enhanced,"" says Dr. David Williams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health. ""But unless you are experiencing severe symptoms or a medical emergency, the best place for you to stay is at home until you receive advice, which will often be to stay home and self-monitor.""  In addition to enhancing capacity at Telehealth, Ontario has approved new physician billing codes to enable doctors to continue to provide routine health care services by video and telephone, including assessment of possible COVID-19 symptoms. This will help keep patients at home rather than in their doctor's office where they would be in close contact with others. Ontario has also established dedicated assessment centres in areas experiencing significant growth in COVID-19 testing, with additional centres being established across the province in the coming weeks. Before visiting an assessment centre, individuals should first seek guidance on whether it is appropriate for them to do so. Ontarians can do so by using a new online self-assessment tool, calling Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000 or calling their local public health unit. People should not go to an assessment centre unless they have symptoms of the COVID-19. 

Quick Facts

Telehealth Ontario is a free, confidential, provincial service that provides 24/7 access to health advice and information from a Registered Nurse to all Ontarians in 300 languages. 
During this COVID-19 outbreak, Telehealth triages callers, provides information, assessment and depending on symptoms will inform patients on how to self-isolate.
To date, there have been more than 8,000 COVID-19 related calls.

Actions aimed at preserving capacity as cases of COVID-19 continue to grow

March 15, 2020  5:59 P.M.

Ministry of Health


TORONTO — Today, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, released the following statement on elective surgeries and other non-emergent clinical activity:
""Since we first learned of COVID-19, Ontario has been diligently monitoring and taking decisive action to contain the spread of this new virus and ensure the province's health care system is ready for any scenario. At the same time, we must also carefully consider how to best maximize resources and prioritize services.   After consultation with the Ontario Hospital Association, and with the support of Dr. David Williams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, the province is requesting that all hospitals further implement pandemic plans by carefully ramping down elective surgeries and other non-emergent clinical activity. In doing so, hospitals can preserve capacity as cases of COVID-19 continue to grow in Ontario. As hospitals move forward with the implementation of their pandemic plans and decisions on their operations, we are asking them to follow three guiding principles:   Use an ethical framework to guide decision-making;Prevent high risk and occult transmission; and Develop and preserve capacity within our system. The approach that we are taking will provide the necessary discretion for hospitals to make decisions based on local circumstances, while preserving the ability for the province to take a more prescriptive approach, should it be warranted based on evidence.   I would once again like to thank all of Ontario's health care providers who are working tirelessly each day to ensure that the health and well-being of Ontarians is being protected.""

To reduce the possible transmission of COVID-19 in our correctional facilities, effective March 13, 2020 and until further notice, intermittent inmates who serve time on the weekends will be required to attend their reporting facility, where they will be given a temporary absence from custody and permitted to return home. Intermittent inmates have already been deemed low-risk by the courts and remain in the community Monday to Friday to live and work. In addition, we are temporarily suspending personal visits within our adult correctional facilities across the province. This suspension will come into effect on March 14, 2020 and remain until further notice. Professional visits including legal counsel will continue. These measures are necessary to reduce any potential transmission of COVID-19. We are taking immediate action to ensure the safety of both our staff and those in our custody.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Premier Doug Ford issued the following statement following today's First Ministers' Call: 
""On this afternoon's First Ministers' Call, I conveyed to the Prime Minister that his family are in our thoughts and the thoughts of all Canadians during this difficult time. I wished his wife, Sophie, a full recovery and thanked him for demonstrating the importance of taking the appropriate measures, including self-isolation, to prevent the further spread of COVID-19. I also want to thank Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, for providing an update on the current global and domestic situation. Our priority is ensuring coordination between the provinces, territories and the federal government to safeguard the health and well-being of Canadians and protect jobs in the short term and our economy in the long term. On the call, we discussed the federal government's $1 billion COVID-19 Response Fund, which includes $500 million in support for the provinces and territories. This funding will assist the provinces and territories with staying ahead of the situation in the short term. We applaud all federal parties for working together to ratify the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement in the House of Commons and Senate to provide businesses with certainty and protect Ontario and Canadian workers, particularly in our auto and steel sectors. I joined my fellow premiers to press the federal government on the need to provide reassurance to Canadian businesses and Canadian families during this time of economic uncertainty. While our government welcomes Minister Morneau's announcement that $10 billion in credit will be made available for businesses through Business Development Bank of Canada and Export Development Bank, and the Bank of Canada's decision to cut the overnight interest rate, we urge the federal government to work with the provinces to deliver the fiscal stimulus necessary to maintain stability and confidence in the Canadian economy. I further urged the Prime Minister to take action to address the ongoing supply chain issues we have been seeing across our province. All levels of government must also work together to make sure workers who follow the Prime Minister's example and self-isolate to prevent the further spread of COVID-19 can do so knowing that the jobs that provide for themselves and their families will still be there for them when they are ready to return to work. I look forward to hearing more about the federal government's plans to provide direct support to the most vulnerable. The next few months will be challenging, but I know the strength of Ontario, and Canada, is found in its people. Even as the First Ministers spoke this afternoon, communities across the country were rallying around our seniors and making sure they have what they need. Neighbours are staying connected and looking out for each other's well-being. The resiliency of everyday people, supported by coordinated action from all levels of government, is the bedrock of Ontario and Canada. From coast to coast, we are showing the world that Canadians will always have one another's backs.""

""The health and well-being of all Ontarians is our government's number one priority. Based on the advice of Dr. David Williams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, and the experts at the province's Command Table, Ontario is taking decisive steps to contain the virus and continue to protect the public. We continue to work with our public health partners at all levels, alongside our postsecondary partners, to protect students and faculty at this critical juncture by providing regular updates on COVID-19 and campus safety. In light of recent developments and based on strong guidance from Dr. David Williams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, and the experts at the COVID-19 Command Table, the Ministry of Colleges and Universities will work with Ontario's postsecondary institutions to ensure each campus has a COVID-19 response plan for academic continuity for students and faculty that does not put their health or personal well-being at risk, while ensuring students can continue to receive the world-class education our institutions provide. This action follows similar guidance by the Command Table earlier today requesting the province temporarily close all elementary schools and secondary schools in the 14-day period following March Break, effective March 23, 2020. Our government will continue to work with our postsecondary partners to provide updates to students and faculty as the situation evolves.""

Doug Downey, Attorney General of Ontario, announced the appointment of two new justices to the Ontario Court of Justice, effective March 26, 2020.
Justice Maureen Heather Bellmore was called to the bar in 2001. For the past two and a half years, she worked as a Crown counsel at the Director of Crown Operations Office, Toronto Region with a focus on criminal law. In this role, she prosecuted a number of cases before the Ontario Court of Justice and the Superior Court of Justice and provided advice on a wide array of legal issues to the director and deputy director, as well as Crown attorneys. Prior to her position in the Director's Office, for 12 years Justice Bellmore was an Assistant Crown Attorney at the Etobicoke Crown Attorney's Office practising exclusively criminal law. For the past year, she was director of the sexual violence course at the Ontario Crown Attorneys' Association Summer School, an educational conference for Crowns and stakeholders in the criminal justice system. Justice Bellmore has served as a regional representative on a number of committees, including the Toronto Region Domestic Violence Advisory Committee, where she also acted as co-chair. For six years she coached in a girls' softball league. Chief Justice Lise Maisonneuve has assigned Justice Bellmore to Toronto. Justice Michael Barry Joseph Carnegie was called to the bar in 2000. He has worked as the regional Crown counsel in the West Region Office of the Director of Crown Operations since 2016, where he specialized in criminal law. In this role, he prosecuted many major cases in and outside of the region and advised the director of Crown operations on a wide range of legal matters. Prior to this, he spent seven years working as embedded counsel on two high-profile murder prosecutions, which earned him an OPP Commissioner's Commendation and an Excelsior Award for outstanding achievement from the Ministry of the Attorney General. Justice Carnegie has directed the trial advocacy course at the Ontario Crown Attorneys' Association Summer School since 2012.

Office of the Premier


Today, Premier Doug Ford and Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, issued the following statement on the House of Commons and Senate of Canada ratifying the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement:
""Amidst global economic uncertainty, we applaud all federal parties in Ottawa for working together to ratify the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) in the House of Commons and the Senate. By approving this deal, businesses will be provided with certainty and workers in Ontario and Canada will be protected, particularly those in our auto and steel sectors. Our government is focused on protecting jobs in the short term and our economy in the long term. Nearly one in five Ontario jobs depend on trade, and approximately $397 billion in trade travels across the U.S. and Canadian border in Ontario every year.  We know that ensuring strong trade ties is vital to our economic stability. Together, we can now move forward with our North American partners to build a stronger trading relationship that will help businesses grow and protect jobs across the continent.  Our government's top priority throughout these negotiations was to protect jobs for the hard-working people of Ontario. We want to thank the leaders and negotiators from all three countries who worked long hours and reached across party lines to secure this critical deal. Ontario's strong relationship with our neighbours to the south is critically important. If Ontario were a country, we would be the third largest trading partner of the United States. We are the number one customer of 19 U.S. states and second for nine others. Ontario continues to play an important role in promoting Canada's trade interests and strengthening our historic ties with our U.S. partners for the benefit of the people of our province and our country. We are further committed to working with the federal government to ensure the supply managed agricultural sectors which are impacted by provisions made in the agreement will receive full and fair compensation, and that our farmers remain top of mind as CUSMA is ratified and implemented by all parties.""

Ministry of the Solicitor General


HAMILTON — Ontario is strengthening its correctional system and protecting communities with the addition of nine new probation and parole officers who graduated today from Ontario's Correctional Services Recruitment and Training Centre.
Graduates completed five weeks of extensive training covering topics such as assessment and case plans, motivational interviewing, report writing, enforcement and managing specialized cases. Probation and parole officers play an important role in helping to ensure public safety by managing offenders who are serving their sentences in the community. ""Ontario's probation and parole officers fulfill a vital and meaningful role in upholding public safety and facilitating the safe reintegration of offenders into communities,"" said Solicitor General Sylvia Jones. ""Our probation and parole officers are of the highest quality and their hard work and dedication make Ontario safer."" The supervision these officers provide helps strengthen community safety by ensuring offenders comply with their probation requirements set by a judge, such as undergoing substance abuse treatment, seeking gainful employment, and performing community service. Probation and parole officers regularly supervise, visit, and report on these individuals to ensure they are complying with their probation. ""Probation and parole officers protect communities and contribute valuable expertise to Ontario's correctional system,"" said Parliamentary Assistant Belinda Karahalios. ""I want to thank each and every one of them for choosing a career that makes a difference."" The officers are currently assigned across Ontario: three in the Northern region, three in the Western region, one in the Eastern region and two in the Central region. Each is assigned to an area near their home community to offer a local perspective.

TORONTO — Today, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Lisa MacLeod, Minister of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries, issued the following statement in response to the impact of COVID-19 on Ontario's heritage, sport, tourism and culture industries:
""The health and well-being of Ontarians is our government's number one priority. Based on the advice of Dr. David Williams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, and the experts at the province's Command Table, we have been taking decisive steps to contain the virus and continue to protect the public. We continue to work with our public health partners across all ministries to ensure that the appropriate plans are in place to respond to any scenario. As a measure of prudence, the Ministry of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries has convened a series of advisory groups with leading sector stakeholders in Ontario's $74-billion heritage, sport, tourism and culture industries to ensure the government is provided with the most up-to-date information on economic impacts. By working in partnership with professional and amateur sports organizations, airlines, hotels, restaurateurs, film and television producers, as well as other tourism and cultural attractions, the government will be supported with real-time information that includes attendance records, revenue and labour impacts. This information will help inform any action that may be required to protect Ontario jobs and support impacted businesses. We are also speaking regularly with our agencies and attractions to proactively initiate the latest health, safety, and cleanliness protocols to protect the public and staff members.

Ministry of Long-Term Care


WINCHESTER — Today, the Honourable Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care, was joined by Jim McDonell, MPP for Stormont—Dundas—South Glengarry, at Dundas Manor Long-Term Care Home to announce that funding has been approved for 30 new long-term care beds and the redevelopment of 98 existing beds at the home in Winchester, Ontario. 
 The funding approval is the next step towards getting shovels in the ground and getting beds built. These new and redeveloped beds will help take pressure off hospitals, allow doctors and nurses to work more efficiently, and provide better, faster health care for patients and their families in North and South Dundas.   ""We all have a family member, a loved one or friend who has needed long-term care, and many of us will one day need it ourselves. We will all be touched by it in some way,"" said Minister Fullerton. ""Our government is working hard to build long-term care beds faster and more efficiently so our province's most vulnerable can receive the care they need.""  Currently, too many Ontarians are unable to access the long-term care they need, when and where they need it. The government is investing in long-term care across the province to create new and modern spaces to help end hallway health care.  ""This is another example of how our government is acting swiftly to create 15,000 new long-term care beds in five years,"" said MPP McDonell. ""Creating new long-term care beds and redeveloping older beds in North and South Dundas is key to ensuring more seniors get the support and high-quality care they need close to home.""  ""Congratulations to Dundas Manor! We applaud the government for this important investment to expand access to long term care in rural Ontario where it is desperately needed,"" said Lisa Levin, CEO, AdvantAge Ontario. ""These new and redeveloped beds will help local seniors stay in their own community - where they want to be - for as long as possible.""

Quick Facts

To date, over 50 percent of the new beds have been allocated, totaling 7,889 beds. 
The government recently announced the launch of a study on staffing in long-term care led by an expert advisory panel that will inform the development and implementation of a staffing strategy by the end of 2020.
The government is now accepting applications from current and potential operators to build new long-term care beds and redevelop existing ones. Interested parties can submit an online application until March 31, 2020.

Minister releases final report on Peel District School Board 

March 13, 2020  9:04 A.M.

Ministry of Education


TORONTO — Today, Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education, released the final report on the Peel District School Board (PDSB) review. The Minister has responded to the findings of the review by issuing ministerial directions to PDSB aimed at addressing the systemic discrimination, specifically anti-Black racism; human resources practices; board leadership and governance issues. The Government of Ontario will consider this report, its recommendations and the resulting ministerial directions as it works to develop a broader province-wide strategy.
""The accounts of systemic racism and discrimination documented in the report are deeply troubling and will not be tolerated,"" said Minister Lecce. ""After decades of inaction, I want to see swift implementation of my directions to drive the necessary and positive change that students deserve. Students and the community have demanded change and I want to assure them that we will monitor Board implementation of the directions and hold them to account to deliver transformational change that will put every student on a path to success.""   In November 2019, the Minister of Education announced a review of the PDSB following a request from the former Chair and Vice-Chair of the Board of Trustees for assistance and intervention. The Minister later appointed Shawn Richard, Sue Herbert and Ena Chadha to conduct a review and provide recommendations. The final report released today follows the interim report, which was released in January 2020. ""It is clear that immediate and robust action is needed,"" said Jamil Jivani, Ontario's Advocate for Community Opportunities. ""Today's announcement by the Minister is an important step toward building a public school system that gives each child — regardless of race, background, or postal code — a fair start in life."" The final report outlines the Reviewers' observations and recommendations, while the ministerial directions include deliverables, timelines and expectations to ensure parents and community members can track progress and hold PDSB officials to account. With the announcement of 27 new ministerial directions, the Government of Ontario is positioning the PDSB to immediately strengthen its governance and leadership practices to focus its attention on ensuring that all PDSB students can realize their full potential in classrooms and schools where they are supported, respected, valued and welcomed.

Quick Facts

From December 2019 to February 2020, the reviewers heard from over 300 individuals in various locations in Peel and Toronto and considered over 160 written submissions.
The PDSB is responsible for 257 schools in Brampton, Mississauga and Caledon, and over 155,000 students representing a rich array of racial, ethnic, linguistic and religious backgrounds and sexual orientations.
83% of PDSB secondary students are racialized with more than 160 ethnic and cultural backgrounds and 110 languages spoken at home. Just under 10% of secondary students self-identify as 2SLGBTQ+.

TORONTO — Today, Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education, issued the following statement regarding a tentative agreement with the Ontario English Catholic Teachers' Association (OECTA):
""Our Government achieved our foremost priority - landing a good deal with a teachers' union that advances the priorities of students and parents.  We are pleased to announce a tentative agreement has been reached between the Crown, OECTA, and the Ontario Catholic School Trustees' Association, the first agreement with a teachers' union in this round of collective bargaining, that will ensure stability for our kids and their parents. As part of our Government's singular focus to ending this impasse, we took action to advance the priorities of students and parents and provide fairness to teachers. I would like to thank the mediator from the Ministry of Labour for their assistance in having all parties reach this tentative agreement. The time is now to drive deals with all remaining union partners as parents expect action, not delays. We agree and will remain a positive and driving force at the bargaining table, advancing the priorities of parents and students.""

Ontario Launches Consultations to Update Consumer Protection Act
Reviewing the Consumer Protection Act for the first time in 15 years 

March 12, 2020  4:00 P.M.

Ministry of Government and Consumer Services


Ontario is making government work smarter and rebuilding consumer confidence by conducting a comprehensive review of the Consumer Protection Act.  This review will ensure that consumers are protected in everyday transactions — from buying clothing in a store to renovating their home.
""The Consumer Protection Act has not been reviewed since it came into force in 2005, and the marketplace has drastically changed since then,"" said Lisa Thompson, Minister of Government and Consumer Services. ""The review is part of Ontario's plan to work smarter by putting consumers first and listening to their needs and concerns to help better protect them."" The review will consider opportunities to address changing technology, marketplace innovations, and streamlining requirements for businesses and consumers. As a first step, an online survey will gather information about consumers' understanding of the act and their experiences when engaging in consumer transactions. Ontarians can fill out the survey at ontario.ca/ConsumerReview until May 11, 2020. The government will also be conducting consultations with consumers and businesses through the regulatory registry later this year. ""Our government is committed to providing best-in-class protections so the people of Ontario have confidence when they spend their hard-earned money,"" said Thompson. ""We're building a foundation for a modern and equitable system that truly puts people at the centre of everything we do — both now and in the future. And we want to assure Ontarians that they have a voice in helping us create stronger rules to protect them and their families.""

Quick Facts

In Ontario, many of your rights as a consumer are set out by the Consumer Protection Act and other consumer protection legislation.
On December 5, 2019, the government introduced Bill 159, the Rebuilding Consumer Confidence Act, to strengthen protection and enhance business practices for the people of Ontario.
On December 19, 2019, the government released the Rebuilding Consumer Confidence Report, which includes a commitment to review the Consumer Protection Act.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Today, Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education, issued the following statement in response to the impact of COVID-19 on publicly funded schools as March Break approaches:
""The health and well-being of Ontarians is our government's number one priority. Since we first learned of COVID-19 as an emerging public health issue, Ontario has been diligently monitoring the developing situation to protect the health and well-being of all Ontarians.  We have also taken decisive action to ensure the province's health care system is positioned to be ready for any scenario. Given the latest developments both internationally and here at home, today we are taking further action. Based on advice from Dr. David Williams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, and the experts at the COVID-19 Command Table, the Minister of Education has issued a Ministerial Order to close all publicly funded schools in Ontario for two weeks following March break, in response to the emergence in Ontario of COVID-19. This order was approved by the Lieutenant Governor in Council. This means that Ontario schools have been ordered to remain closed from March 14 through to April 5, 2020. We recognize the significant impact this decision will have on families, students, schools, as well as the broader community, but this precaution is necessary to keep people safe. Today's steps build on a number of actions our government has taken in recent days to respond to COVID-19, including moving forward with additional public health measures, which include enhanced access to screening, expanding lab-testing capacity, and implementing new initiatives to keep the public and frontline workers safe. We are further setting aside up to $100 million in contingency funding in the upcoming 2020 budget to address challenges related to COVID-19. We are further mindful of those who work in other public institutions and buildings. As this situation evolves, Ontario's COVID-19 Command Table is prepared to respond quickly and effectively to any scenario and provide the government with advice on measures to keep the public and frontline workers safe. We are committed to working with partners to keep students safe and we expect to provide further information in the near future. Our public health system has demonstrated remarkable responsiveness to COVID-19 and these measures we are putting in place will ensure that we continue to contain the spread of COVID-19 in Ontario and thereby protect children and families across the province.""

Ontario Building a Better Transportation System to Connect People to Places

March 12, 2020  2:00 P.M.

Ministry of Transportation


Today, Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation, announced Ontario is investing $365.3 million to expand and improve local transportation across the province.
""Investing in public transit is part of our plan to get Ontario moving,"" said Minister Mulroney. ""From transit investment in the Greater Golden Horseshoe to adding more service in rural and northern communities - our government is committed to improving transit in every corner of the province."" This year's Gas Tax program benefits the most municipalities ever, with 111 receiving funding to improve public transit in 148 communities across the province. Gas Tax funding can be used to upgrade infrastructure, increase accessibility, purchase transit vehicles, add more routes and extend hours of service. ""We're making life easier for millions of people across Ontario by helping to build new and reliable transit faster,"" said Minister Mulroney. The Gas Tax program is in addition to the regional transportation plans Ontario is developing to help fight gridlock, improve outdated infrastructure and keep goods and services moving across the province.

Quick Facts

Funding for Ontario’s Gas Tax program is determined by the number of litres of gasoline sold in the province. Municipal allocations are based on two cents per litre of provincial Gas Tax revenues. 
This year, Ontario is making enhancements to the Gas Tax program that will cut burdensome red tape and make it easier and faster for municipalities to access funding. This includes removing the baseline spending requirement for municipalities and allowing them to submit a digital copy of their municipal by-law.
The province’s first draft regional transportation plan was released for southwestern Ontario in 2020. Regional planning is also underway for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, Northern and eastern Ontario.

Government Approves First Indigenous Institute to Deliver Apprenticeship Training

Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development


BRANTFORD — Ontario is helping people in Indigenous communities prepare for good jobs in the skilled trades.
Today, Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development, announced the approval of Six Nations Polytechnic as an apprenticeship Training Delivery Agent. The post-secondary institute is the first Indigenous Institute to be granted this status and can now deliver apprenticeship training for three trades: general machinist, cook and welder. ""One in five jobs is going to be in the skilled trades in the next five years,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""Those are paycheques that will be waiting to be collected, hopefully soon, by new apprentices from Six Nations of the Grand River. Today's announcement is a big step toward that goal.""  In the third quarter of 2019, there were 21,000 vacant jobs in the Hamilton-Niagara area, with demand for welders, millwrights, electricians and machinists. The government also renewed funding of $395,000 to Six Nations Polytechnic to continue delivering pre-apprenticeship training for general machinists, cooks and welders.  In the upcoming fiscal year, the funding will support: 18 pre-apprenticeship trainee general machinists, beginning April 138 pre-apprenticeship trainee cooks, beginning April 2015 pre-apprenticeship trainee welders, beginning July 6  ""It's great news that apprenticeship training is coming to Canada's most populous First Nation,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Indigenous Affairs. ""We're looking forward to seeing apprentice general machinists, cooks and welders from Six Nations Polytechnic take up rewarding positions in their fields.""  ""This investment is great news not only for the Indigenous community in Brantford-Brant but for the entire Grand River Basin,"" said Will Bouma, MPP for Brantford-Brant. ""It enables Six Nations Polytechnic to deliver apprenticeship training and helps prepare people for good jobs in the skilled trades."" ""Six Nations Polytechnic continues to respond to skilled trades shortages and labour market challenges,"" said Six Nation Polytechnic President and CEO Rebecca Jamieson. ""This pre-apprenticeship funding creates 41 opportunities for eligible learners to begin a successful career in one of three trades - welder, machinist and cook. Earning Training Delivery Agent status for these trades is a truly momentous occasion. Six Nations Polytechnic, together with area employers, can now offer local apprenticeship opportunities right here in the City of Brantford."" Six Nations Polytechnic will now work with the Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development to create in-class apprenticeship training programs. 

Quick Facts

Six Nations Polytechnic is an Indigenous Institute under Ontario’s 2017 Indigenous Institute Act. The legislation recognizes Indigenous Institutes as unique and complementary pillars of Ontario’s postsecondary education system overseen by Indigenous-controlled and -governed councils. 
Ontario is making a historic investment of $20.8 million into its Pre-Apprenticeship Program this year, an increase of $5 million from the previous year, to help introduce and provide free pre-trades training to over 1,800 people. Training is delivered by Ontario colleges, private career colleges, union and non-union training centres and other community organizations. 
To find out about pre-apprenticeship training programs, contact Employment Ontario by phone, e-mail or live chat. 
On May 29, 2019, Ontario passed the Modernizing the Skilled Trades and Apprenticeship Act, 2019 to help transform the skilled trades and apprenticeship system, reduce red tape, and make Ontario open for business and open for jobs.

Protecting Tenants and Strengthening Community Housing Act, 2020


March 12, 2020  1:15 P.M.

Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing


The proposed Protecting Tenants and Strengthening Community Housing Act, 2020 would update the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, the Housing Services Act, 2011, the Ontario Mortgage and Housing Corporation Act and the Building Code Act, 1992 to make life more affordable.
The proposed changes to the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 would strengthen protections for tenants, make it easier to be a landlord, and help both landlords and tenants resolve disputes. The proposed legislation would: Prevent unlawful evictions: If a landlord wanted to evict a tenant to use a unit themselves, they would have to tell the Landlord and Tenant Board if they have done it before, which would help adjudicators look for patterns and identify landlords who may be breaking the law. Landlords would also have to file an affidavit at the same time as they file for a no-fault eviction application so the tenant can obtain a copy in advance of a hearing.Compensate tenants for ""no fault"" evictions: When tenants are evicted for causes beyond their control most landlords must offer compensation. This requirement would be extended to landlords of buildings with one to four units who evict a tenant to renovate or repair the unit, and to landlords who evict a tenant on behalf of a home buyer who wants to use the unit themselves. These landlords would have to pay the tenant one month's rent.Increase maximum fines: Amounts would increase from $25,000 to $50,000 for an individual and from $100,000 to $250,000 for a corporation convicted of an offence under the Act.Increase tenant compensation for ""bad faith"" evictions: Landlords who evict tenants to repair or renovate a unit must give the tenant the opportunity to move back in (at the same rent) before offering it to others. If they don't, landlords can be ordered to compensate tenants. Currently, the landlord can be ordered to pay the difference between the old and new rent for up to a one-year period.   The proposed changes would give tenants two years to file a claim and increase the possible compensation by an additional full year's rent, up to a maximum of $35,000. The increased compensation would also apply to bad faith ""own use"" evictions (where the landlord/purchaser does not use the unit themselves).Streamline Landlord and Tenant Board processes: Being able to access alternative dispute resolution services like mediation instead of a formal hearing, where appropriate, would make it easier to resolve certain disputes. To encourage negotiated settlements, landlords who reach an agreement with a tenant on outstanding rent would not have to go back to the Landlord and Tenant Board for an eviction hearing, if the tenant breaches the repayment agreement. Similarly, requiring tenants to give advance notice of any new issues they want to raise at an eviction hearing would help everyone prepare and prevent hearings from being delayed or postponed. Make it easier to be a landlord: Landlords would not have to submit documents to the Landlord and Tenant Board on a CD-ROM, tell tenants how old the fridge is and how much energy it uses, or give tenants a printed pamphlet that duplicates information in the standard lease.   It would also allow landlords a grace period who inadvertently use an older version of the lease when it is updated. Landlords seeking compensation for unpaid utilities, rent and/or damages from current or former tenants would have their disputes handled by the Landlord and Tenant Board, rather than the Small Claims Court.   It would also clarify that a tenant has 12 months to dispute a potentially improper rent increase notice, similar to other disputes.Allow more tools for better enforcement of RTA offences: To improve enforcement processes, investigators would be allowed to get a court order to access financial records more easily in order to investigate offences relating to filing false or misleading information with the Landlord and Tenant Board. The admissibility in a prosecution of electronic documents retained by the Landlord and Tenant Board would be clarified. The ministry would also have more time to enforce the rules when a landlord fails to reimburse a tenant for a refundable key deposit.Allow landlords to recover costs: When bad behaviour costs landlords money, such as tenants pulling the fire alarm for no reason, landlords would be able to apply to the Landlord and Tenant Board to recover their costs, rather than resorting to eviction.Update land lease and mobile home rules: The proposed changes would allow landlords to maintain the health and safety of land lease communities and perform necessary maintenance by recovering the full cost of major infrastructure upgrades, like water and sewage systems, using above guideline rent increases without needing an order from a government authority. Changes would also ensure that these costs are paid within a reasonable timeframe. Since the maintenance requirements in a land lease community are different from other rentals, we will explore whether some types of maintenance costs should be treated separately from rent.Allow greater flexibility for employers to provide employee housing: To help them attract top talent, employers would be able to offer their employees an affordable housing option closer to where they work, and opportunity to build equity through a land lease agreement that meets their unique needs.A sustainable community housing system: Proposed changes to the Housing Services Act, 2011 would enable Ontario to update the community housing system to ensure it is sustainable over the long-term. If passed, we will consult with service managers and stakeholders on regulations to protect and grow community housing supply, improve the community housing access system and encourage innovative, business-like approaches. These changes build on the commitments in our Community Housing Renewal Strategy and the steps we've already taken to make life easier for tenants and housing providers, including:Removing rules that penalize people for working more hours or going back to school;Making rent-geared-to-income calculations easier for tenants and providers by using income tax information;Filling vacant community housing units faster;Protecting people who live in community housing by allowing housing providers to turn away tenants who have been previously evicted from community housing for serious criminal activities;And helping those in greatest need.Ontario Mortgage and Housing Corporation: Dissolving the Ontario Mortgage and Housing Corporation, through the Ontario Mortgage and Housing Corporation Repeal Act, would shift the financial responsibilities for various legacy housing programs from an agency to the ministry. The proposed change would have no impact on programs or the public, as the agency's work is already performed by ministry staff.Building Better: To help increase housing supply, the government is proposing amendments to the Building Code Act, 1992 to enable the creation of an administrative authority that would help deliver faster and better services. The proposed changes are enabling in nature and would allow for the future creation of an administrative authority to deliver delegated building code services. No decisions have been made at this time about what services a future administrative authority would deliver.As part of consultations in 2019, we heard broad support for the transformation and modernization of many building code services and other proposed changes. While no decisions have been made about what services a future administrative authority would deliver, based on consultation feedback, the government has decided not to pursue the development of a framework to enable the use of certified professionals. We will continue to consult on the governance and accountability requirements a future administrative authority would have to adhere to, how it would fund its operations, and what services it would deliver. Transforming and modernizing the delivery of building code services responds to the recommendations of the Elliot Lake Commission of Inquiry to protect public safety.

Ontario Strengthening Protections for Tenants and Landlords


March 12, 2020  1:15 P.M.

Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing


TORONTO ― Ontario is making life more affordable by introducing legislation that would make renting easier and fairer for both tenants and landlords.
The proposed changes to Ontario's rental rules would better protect tenants by preventing unlawful evictions and increasing tenant compensation for ""no fault"" and ""bad faith"" evictions by up to one month's rent and 12 month's rent, respectively. Changes would also double the maximum fine amounts for offences under the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006 - to $50,000 for an individual and $250,000 for a corporation - to discourage unlawful evictions. ""Our government cares about the well-being of Ontarians and we want to ensure the system is fair for both tenants and landlords,"" said Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. ""We've heard the concerns from tenants who've been forced to leave their homes due to renovations. That's why we are taking action to increase fines, raise tenant compensation and tighten the rules to encourage everyone to follow the law."" The proposed changes would also make it easier to be a landlord by modernizing and streamlining dispute resolution processes over time at the Landlord and Tenant Board and allowing alternatives to formal hearings to resolve certain issues and encourage negotiated settlements. The changes would also shift many disputes such as unpaid utility bills from the Small Claims Court to the Landlord and Tenant Board, making the resolution process simpler and more streamlined. The proposed changes build on More Homes, More Choice: Ontario's Housing Supply Action Plan by making renting easier for both landlords and tenants. ""Ontario needs more rental housing, and our members applaud Minister Clark for the steps he has taken to improve the climate for operating and building rental housing,"" said Tony Irwin, President and CEO of the Federation of Rental-housing Providers of Ontario. ""We look forward to continuing to work together to balance the needs of landlords and tenants by cutting red tape and promoting more rental construction in Ontario.""

Quick Facts

More Homes, More Choice: Ontario’s Housing Supply Action Plan, makes it faster and easier to build housing, including rental housing, and to build the right types of homes in the right places.
Last year, in August, new rental construction outpaced condominiums for the first time in 15 years.
Home builders had more than 57,000 new units of rental housing planned for the Toronto area as of the end of 2019, an increase of 40 per cent over 2018.
Ontario’s second suite and tiny home guides help people create more rental housing and navigate complex design and building processes.

Ontario Government Continues to Put a Stop to Wasteful Year End Spending 
Recent Initiatives are Embedding a Change in Culture and Directing Resources to Front-line Services 

March 12, 2020 12:45 P.M.

Treasury Board Secretariat


OTTAWA — Ontario is embedding a culture of fiscal responsibility across government, as it moves to further curb wasteful spending at the end of the fiscal year.
Known as ""March Madness,"" governments sometimes see expenses spike near the end of the fiscal year as ministries attempt to spend the remainder of their budgets. Last year, the province announced an end to March Madness spending, and saved Ontario taxpayers $153 million, as part of its plan to change the culture of government and restore respect for taxpayer dollars. Through force of a special Treasury Board minute in December, Minister Bethlenfalvy directed Cabinet colleagues to improve upon those measures and not enter into any new funding commitments and limit spending to commitments up to March 31st. Spending beyond these activities, including spending from within ministry allocations, must have prior approval from Treasury Board for the entire final fiscal quarter. ""Our government is implementing spending controls earlier in the fiscal year and directing precious resources to key, priority areas like healthcare, education and social services. This year, we've implemented these controls earlier in the fiscal cycle, so that March Madness in 2020 and moving forward doesn't turn into free-for-all February,"" said Bethlenfalvy. ""This action speaks directly to the idea that if we change the culture of government, we can change the way government works for people."" Bethlenfalvy noted the federal Parliamentary Budget Officer's (PBO) recent observation that while Canada's subnational debt is fiscally unsustainable, Ontario is ensuring fiscal sustainability over the long run. The PBO pointed to the government's changes in fiscal policy as a key component to the characterization. ""Our government is embedding a culture of fiscal responsibility in the province and putting us on a sustainable path to balance,"" Bethlenfalvy said. ""We are Building Smarter Government, under the leadership of Premier Doug Ford and our team, and freeing up more dollars to invest in front-line programs and services."" In a speech at the Economic Club of Ottawa today, attended by members of the provincial cabinet and hundreds of business and community leaders, Bethlenfalvy also pointed to progress made on the provincial government's Smart Initiatives - a suite of high-impact, cross-cutting policies - that are improving the user experience for Ontarians and saving taxpayer dollars. Bethlenfalvy expressed the Ontario government's commitment to working with their federal counterparts to deliver on key priorities for the people of Ontario. ""We need the federal government to step up in these areas to help support Ontario families. And I think we're getting our message across.""

Extensive Planning to Prepare Province for All Scenarios

March 12, 2020 12:12 P.M.

Ministry of Health


TORONTO — As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve globally, Ontario is taking further action to ensure the province's health care system is positioned to continue to safeguard the health and well-being of Ontarians.
Since being formally constituted, Ontario's new Command Table has been refining and finalizing plans for the implementation of enhanced measures to ensure the province is prepared to respond quickly and effectively to any scenario, including: Enhanced access to screening;Expanding lab-testing capacity; andImplementing new initiatives to keep the public and frontline workers safe. ""Ontario's public health system continues to demonstrate remarkable responsiveness to COVID-19,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""While we have so far effectively contained new cases of this virus, we are relentlessly focused on planning for any scenario. We are actively working with our partners at all levels in the health care system to implement enhanced measures to ensure that we are prepared to protect the health of all Ontarians.""  Enhanced Access to Screening To rapidly expand screening and ease pressures on hospital emergency departments, Ontario will immediately establish a number of dedicated assessment centres in areas experiencing significant growth in testing. Some of the first wave of assessment centres will open in the next several days, including at William Osler Health System - Peel Memorial site, The Ottawa Hospital, North York General Hospital, Mackenzie Health, Scarborough Health Network, and Trillium Health Partners. These centres are located in dedicated spaces that will facilitate high-quality care, to protect broader patient populations.  Additional assessment centres will be established across the province in the coming weeks. Regions without an assessment centre will continue to be serviced by their local hospital or primary care settings. Ontario has also approved new physician billing codes for telephone assessments, enabling doctors to conduct more assessments over the phone rather than in their clinic, helping to keep patients at home rather than in primary care settings where they would co-mingle with others. In the coming days, the province will also launch a new COVID-19 self-assessment tool on its dedicated web page (Ontario.ca/coronavirus). This new tool will take the public through a series of questions to help inform those who are concerned about having contracted COVID-19 about how they can seek care based on their needs. Ontario is working closely with Telehealth to ensure adequate support to handle increased call volumes and is committed to allocating additional resources as needed to ensure timely responses for Ontarians. In addition to continuing to review virtual care capacity, including further expanding Telehealth and encouraging virtual care uptake, the Command Table has initiated early planning for the implementation of at-home testing, all of which will support caring for people at home. Expanding Lab-Testing Capacity Working with Public Health Ontario and Ontario Health, the province is working to enhance laboratory testing capacity across the province to rapidly mobilize, monitor and coordinate COVID-19 testing. Laboratory testing is also being conducted on other respiratory samples from hospital emergency departments and long-term care homes in order to identify and quickly respond to any unknown cases of COVID-19. Protecting the Public and Frontline Workers To ensure Ontarians have access to credible and up-to-date information on how to maintain their health and the health of their families, Ontario has launched a provincewide public education campaign. The campaign, which includes search, social, print and radio ads on every-day steps Ontarians can take to keep themselves safe, is in addition to the resources available on Ontario.ca/coronavirus. This dedicated web page is now being updated twice a day (10:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. EST), seven days a week, with relevant information on any new cases and includes fact sheets translated in nearly 30 distinct languages. As the global and local situation evolves, the Command Table will continue to evaluate the latest evidence to provide ongoing guidance to the public and providers. Ontario has issued updated guidelines to long-term care homes to ensure active screening for all staff, volunteers, family members, as well as new and returning residents, and will do so for retirement homes shortly. Ontario will continue to update guidelines for other health care facilities in response to the evolving situation. In addition to these extensive planning measures, Ontario is providing stability to municipalities as they complete 2021 budget planning by committing to extending one-time mitigation funding for an additional calendar year for the province's public health units. This action ensures that historical municipal adjustments remain capped at 10 per cent, and recognizes the considerable time and resources necessary for public health units to effectively respond to COVID-19. Extending mitigation funding would keep municipal funding levels for public health units in calendar year 2021 at the same level as calendar year 2020. This is in addition to the up to $100 million COVID-19 Contingency Fund announced yesterday.  

Quick Facts

Last week, Ontario established a new Command Table to serve as a single point of oversight providing executive leadership and strategic direction to guide the ongoing response to this new virus.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more serious respiratory infections like bronchitis, pneumonia or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
There is no vaccine available to protect against COVID-19, but there are every-day actions that can help prevent the spread of germs that cause respiratory illnesses. To find out more visit Ontario's website.

Protocols in place to help keep the risk to Ontarians low

March 11, 2020  4:30 P.M.

Ministry of Long-Term Care


TORONTO — Today, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care, issued the following statement related to long-term care and COVID-19 in Ontario:
""The health and well-being of Ontarians, including long-term care residents, their families, and staff, is our number one priority. Ontario recently announced that the province is implementing an enhanced response structure to COVID-19 that brings together a wide range of partners to strengthen and implement provincial and regional plans. The structure involves the creation of a number of tables - or expert teams - including a new Command Table that will serve as a single point of oversight. Senior leadership from across government and the health sector are now providing clear strategic direction to guide Ontario's ongoing response to COVID-19. Through a Collaboration Table, stakeholders from the long-term care sector have the opportunity to provide valuable advice. Our government has also recently instructed long-term care homes to begin active screening of staff, students, volunteers, visitors, residents moving into a long-term care home and residents returning to a long-term care home. These individuals will now be proactively checked for symptoms and asked about recent travel history and contacts. Outbreaks can occur in long-term care homes throughout the year and, as it is flu season, homes currently have respiratory infection outbreak protocols in place. When long-term care homes submit samples for standard respiratory testing, they will now also be tested for COVID-19 automatically to ensure the province identifies potentially unknown cases. Ontario continues to work directly with our partners at the Public Health Agency of Canada and local public health units to monitor the situation closely. Newly strengthened protocols for identification and control are in place to keep the public safe. These protocols and processes continue to be effective and the risk to Ontarians taking precautions to keep themselves and their families safe remains low. There are everyday actions that residents, staff and family members should continue to take to reduce exposure to the virus and help prevent the spread of germs: wash your hands often with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer;sneeze and cough into your sleeve;avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth;avoid contact with people who are sick;stay home if you are sick; anddo not visit a long-term care home if you are feeling ill. Ontario's commitment to the safety, quality of care and quality of life of long-term care home residents is safeguarded by regulations and requirements in the Long-Term Care Homes Act, 2007. Long-term care homes enforce rigorous provincial standards for all public health concerns, including outbreak management systems for detecting, managing, and controlling infectious disease outbreaks. The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Long-Term Care are working together in close cooperation with our partners in both the long-term care and other health care sectors to ensure the continued safety and well-being of residents, families and staff.""

Convicted: Glencore Canada Corporation, Toronto ON.
Location of Workplace: Falconbridge, ON. Description of Offence: failure to ensure that a rail car had been depressurized before the transfer line was disconnected, resulting in an uncontrolled spray of 98 percent sulphuric acid, contrary to s. 56(b) of Ontario Regulation 854/90, Mines and Mining Plants, thereby contravening s. 25(1)(c) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act (Ontario).  Date of Offence: May 9, 2018. Date of Conviction: March 9, 2020. Penalty Imposed:  Following a guilty plea, Justice of the Peace Diane Lafleur, sitting in Provincial Offences Court in Sudbury fined the company $110,000. Crown Counsel: David McCaskill.The court also imposed a 25 percent victim fine surcharge as required by the Provincial Offences Act. The surcharge is credited to a special provincial government fund to assist victims of crime. Background:  On May 9, 2018, as part of the planned restart following a maintenance shutdown of the Falconbridge smelter, a 98 percent sulphuric acid solution was delivered in four rail cars. Two tank trucks from a third party contractor were on site to move the acid from the rail cars to the acid plant on a rotating basis.A worker was seen to be disconnecting the transfer line from the rail car out of sequence before the railcar had been depressurized. As a result, the 98 percent sulphuric acid began spraying out of the rail car, injuring three workers.

Ontario's Increased Speed Limit Pilot Finds Wide Public Support 
80 Percent of Survey Respondents Favour Raising the Speed Limit

March 11, 2020  3:15 P.M.

Ministry of Transportation


Today, the Ontario government announced that its pilot project to increase speed limits to 110km/h on three sections of 400-series highways in Southern Ontario is getting wide support.
""People are telling us loud and clear that they support a safe and moderate increase to speed limits on these highways,"" said Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation. ""The increased speed limit pilot is just one way that our government is improving our transportation network — bringing it in line with other jurisdictions to get people where they need to go when they want to get there."" More than 8,300 people responded to the survey that was launched at the same time as the pilot project in September 2019. The survey results show 80 per cent support for the government's speed limit pilot and an additional 82 per cent support for an increase to speed limits on more sections of 400-series highways. The two-year pilot project is operational on Highway 402 from London to Sarnia (90 km); Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) from St. Catharines/Lincoln to Hamilton (32 km); and Highway 417 from Ottawa/Gloucester to Ontario/Quebec border (102 km). The Ministry of Transportation is also planning to announce the opening of a fourth pilot location in northern Ontario in late spring 2020.

Quick Facts

Increased safety messaging and updated signs ensure motorists are aware of where speed limits change. 
The pilot sites were chosen because they required minimal to no upgrades, had an interchange spacing of 3 km or greater and could accommodate a 110 km/h speed limit.
There are currently six other provinces in Canada that have posted speed limits of 110 km/h or higher on certain highways.
Ontario’s highways are among the safest in North America and have ranked the lowest or second lowest in fatality rates among all jurisdictions for 18 consecutive years.

Ontario Launches Small Businesses Consultations 
Feedback will help shape the Small Business Success Strategy

March 11, 2020  9:30 A.M.

Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade


TORONTO — Ontario is continuing to take action to build a more competitive business environment. Today, Prabmeet Sarkaria, Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction joined by Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, Jill Dunlop, Associate Minister of Children and Women's Issues, and Parliamentary Assistant Donna Skelly, announced the next step in engaging with Ontarians by launching a new provincewide consultation to determine how the government can help small businesses grow, compete and succeed. 
The announcement occurred following a roundtable held in Toronto with 25 female entrepreneurs to highlight the fact that only 17% of small- and medium-sized businesses are owned or led by women in Ontario today. The consultations will help provide the foundation for the development of Ontario's Small Business Success Strategy.   ""Ontario is fortunate to have a vibrant small business community with hardworking entrepreneurs across our province who are willing to take chances and build competitive businesses,"" said Minister Sarkaria. ""Building a business from the ground up and guiding its growth is no easy feat. We know our small businesses face unique challenges, and we're determined to hear directly from them — to listen to their concerns and help them succeed in achieving their long-term goals. Their success is Ontario's success."" The consultations will focus on five key pillars:  Lowering costs - reducing red tape and streamlining government interactions for small businesses so they can spend less time filling out government forms and more time focused on serving their customers and growing their business.Increasing exports - helping small businesses across the province access domestic and international markets.New technologies - helping small businesses across the province build an online presence, as well as develop, adopt, and commercialize new technology. Talent development - ensuring small businesses in all regions and sectors can access and retain the talent they need to help start and grow their businesses.Succession planning and supporting entrepreneurship - helping retiring business owners across the province plan and support the next generation of business leaders, and helping to address the unique challenges facing specific entrepreneurs, such as women, minorities and people with disabilities. In the coming months, the government will be holding a series of provincewide small business roundtables — with participants ranging from manufacturers, agribusiness and professional service-providers, to tech and local community businesses. The government is also welcoming feedback from businesses online. Business owners can fill out an online survey and send in an email submission by September 1, 2020. Feedback received through the consultations will help shape the development of Ontario's Small Business Success Strategy. ""Every business starts small, and our government has a plan to create a more competitive landscape where all businesses and job creators can flourish,"" said Minister Fedeli. ""These consultations will provide business owners with the opportunity to directly tell the government about what matters most to them, and what additional steps the government can take to help their businesses succeed."" The consultations will support the government's continued efforts to deliver on its core commitment to create a more competitive business environment as part of its Plan to Build Ontario Together.

Quick Facts

To date, the government has taken over 200 actions to cut red tape for businesses, including exempting auto plants from being regulated as gas stations, to allowing restaurants to invite dogs onto patios, to combining emissions testing and safety inspections for trucks into a single inspection. These and other expected measures are saving businesses $338 million in costs. 
Ontario's small businesses will also save $2.3 billion this year through tax relief and other actions such as cancelling the cap‐and‐trade carbon tax, keeping the minimum wage at $14 per hour and supporting a reduction in Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) premiums.
The government has launched a new Regional Development Program for eastern and southwestern Ontario. Businesses can get financial support through the Eastern Ontario Development Fund (EODF) and Southwestern Ontario Development Fund (SWODF) and guided access to a range of complementary services and supports.
Ontario will create the Premier’s Advisory Council on Competitiveness to work with business leaders and workers across the province to find ways to improve competitiveness and report back with actionable recommendations.

Ontario Needs Skilled Immigrants


March 11, 2020  9:00 A.M.

Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development


Ottawa —Today, Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development, issued the following statement calling on the federal government to allow Ontario to nominate more immigrants who can bring the skills and experience needed to grow the economy and create jobs. 
""The Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program is a key step in addressing the province's skilled labour shortage by helping bring workers with the skills and experience required to solve our economic challenges. This program helps grow our booming technology sector, staff the skilled construction trades, and meet regional needs. In order to ensure a prosperous future for Ontario, our province requires immigrants with the skills and experience our economy needs. Under the leadership of Premier Ford, I am committed to attracting skilled workers to the province to fill gaps in the labour market, meet the needs of employers and help businesses grow, for the benefit of the people of Ontario. Ontario is only allowed to select a disproportionately small allocation of economic immigrants compared to other provinces, at around 15 per cent - no other province is below 40 per cent.  We have asked the federal government to significantly increase our allocation so we can nominate people who have the job skills and education employers need. We are asking our federal counterparts to, over the next two years, 2020-2022, double the current annual allocations through the program to 13,300.  Last year, our government requested an increased allocation and only received an additional 50 positions. This simply does not meet the needs of Ontario's economy, and does not support economic growth and job creation. Last week, Ontario started accepting applications for international students with job offers in our province. Within hours, not even days, the maximum number of applications allowed by the federal government had been reached. We need greater control to help ensure our specific economic needs are met. We need it to create jobs and prosperity for everyone as we build our province together.""

Province consulting with small and medium-sized businesses to develop a smarter government purchasing system

March 11, 2020  8:15 A.M.

Treasury Board Secretariat


TORONTO — The Ontario government is listening to businesses across the province as it develops a smarter procurement system that will save taxpayer money, drive back office efficiencies and help small and medium-sized businesses tap into new opportunities in government procurement.
Today, Ministers Peter Bethlenfalvy, President of the Treasury Board, and Lisa Thompson, Minister of Government and Consumer Services, led the second of a series of roundtables with business leaders and job creators at the MaRS Centre in Toronto. ""Ontario's Supply Chain Centralization Smart Initiative is already transforming how the public sector delivers services to businesses, families and people from all walks of life,"" said Peter Bethlenfalvy, President of the Treasury Board. ""A more streamlined and collaborative supply chain system will make sure taxpayer dollars are spent wisely, while making it easier for businesses to do business with the government.""  The province is working with small and medium-sized businesses to deliver high-quality programs and services to the people of Ontario and drive annual savings of approximately $1 billion in taxpayer dollars, which can be reinvested in front-line services. Small and medium-sized businesses will benefit from more opportunities to provide innovative products and services to Ontarians, driving economic growth and job creation.  Managing the provincial supply chain is a key part of Smart Initiatives, a cornerstone of the province's plan to build smarter government, achieve fiscal sustainability, and protect the programs and services people rely on every day. By working across the entire public sector, including school boards and hospitals, and leveraging its collective buying power, Ontario can adopt industry leading processes and practices to deliver projected savings of approximately $1 billion a year.  ""We are ensuring small and medium-sized businesses across the province, the drivers of our economy, are at the table,"" said Lisa Thompson, Minister of Government and Consumer Services. ""We are ensuring they are at the table, that their expertise is embedded in our approach and that their ideas will help us deliver better value for Ontarians. We also invite organizations across the public sector to reach out to us now to start benefiting from a wider and better selection of quality goods and services and better pricing."" An integrated, best-in-class centralized supply chain will leverage the purchasing power of the whole of government to get the best deal for the public and make Ontario one of the top supply chain leaders in the world. Supply chain centralization is part of Ontario's plan to Build Ontario Together by protecting core programs and services through smarter government. Our goal is to ensure opportunity and sustainability now and for future generations. 

Quick Facts

Ontario spends approximately $29 billion every year on goods and services to deliver programs and services to the people of Ontario.
Through the centralization of the province's public sector procurement and by creating more efficient delivery processes, the Ontario Government is projecting savings of $1 billion annually.
The Supply Chain Management Act was passed by the Ontario Legislature in December 2019. This legislation supports Ontario’s centralized supply chain initiative.
The province has placed a priority on engaging stakeholders, including suppliers, provincial agencies, broader public and health sector entities, to develop a successful centralized supply chain.

Province Improves Access to Second Career Program 

March 10, 2020 10:15 A.M.

Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development


CAMBRIDGE - The Ontario government is delivering on its promise to help people prepare for jobs by improving supports for manufacturing workers looking to train for a new career.
The changes include waiving certain eligibility requirements to give workers easier and faster access to training supports. The support program, known as Second Career, helps workers with retraining costs such as tuition, books and transportation. ""Ontario has some of the most talented and hard-working manufacturing specialists in the world, and it's important that government stands by them to help make sure they have the skills they need to find good jobs,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""That's why it's important to use every tool we have. Today I'm happy to say we're making changes to allow workers to access help more quickly."" Effective April 1, 2020, laid-off manufacturing workers will no longer be required to search for a job for 26 weeks to qualify for Second Career. They can also now apply regardless of how long they had been working in the manufacturing or auto industry. Since its launch, Second Career has helped approximately 110,900 people retrain for a new occupation, as of March 31, 2019.  ""We're ensuring our manufacturing workers are given every opportunity to be successful in their career,""' said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""Our government remains committed to providing supports that position the sector for the future of advanced manufacturing."" The Second Career program was launched in 2008 as a response to major layoffs in the wake of the 2007/2008 world financial crisis. The program helps laid-off workers pay for postsecondary education or training that they need to successfully rejoin the workforce.  In the third quarter of 2019, there were about 18,700 vacant jobs in the Kitchener-Waterloo-Barrie Economic Region, with demand for mechanics, cooks, carpenters, heavy equipment operators and millwrights. ""Employers are looking for workers, and workers are looking for jobs. With more responsive training programs, we can help both,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""Over this spring and summer we will work closely with business and training stakeholders to review all our employment and training programs to learn how to improve them."" 

Quick Facts

On average there were over 10,000 manufacturing workers per month in receipt of Employment Insurance across Ontario from January to November 2019.
The changes to Second Career will apply to manufacturing and auto workers who were permanently laid off on or after January 1, 2019. All other laid-off workers will be able to apply for Second Career under the previously established eligibility rules.
Popular occupations that Second Career clients train for include Transport Truck Driver, Heavy Equipment Operator (Except Crane) and Social and Community Service Worker.
Applying for the Second Career program is free, and Employment Ontario service providers help with the application process free of charge.
The Employment Ontario network offers a range of services and supports that help businesses find talent and connect job-seekers to training and job opportunities.

Progress on Priority Projects in the GTA Moving Full Speed Ahead

March 10, 2020  9:00 A.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO ― Today, Premier Doug Ford, along with Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation, and Kinga Surma, Associate Minister of Transportation, invited the federal government to join the province at the table and fund at least 40 per cent of the four subway projects being built in the Greater Toronto Area.
""Our government has a plan to build Ontario together and has joined a coalition of municipal partners to build some of the most ambitious, historic and nationally significant projects in the country"", said Premier Ford. ""We have made tremendous progress in the past working with our federal partners, and we can do it again with our rapid transit plan, which includes four subways. I firmly believe these projects will not only move Ontario forward, but will move the entire country forward."" In advance of the First Ministers Meeting this week, Premier Ford will be leading a Team Ontario delegation of Cabinet Ministers to Ottawa to discuss partnering with the federal government on transit funding and other provincial priorities. The invitation to the federal government comes as the Ontario government announced the first phase of construction and tunneling work for two priority transit projects ― the three-stop Scarborough Subway Extension and the Eglinton Crosstown West Extension with planned connection to Pearson International Airport, the second-largest employment zone in Canada. Two Requests for Qualifications (RFQs) were issued, through Infrastructure Ontario (IO) and Metrolinx, and mark the first step in the procurement process to deliver on the Province's commitment to build transit faster, eliminate gridlock, and connect people to places and jobs. ""We are building a modern, efficient rapid transit system that provides benefits for all transit riders and taxpayers,"" said Minister Mulroney. ""These subway projects in Scarborough and along Eglinton will strengthen our transit network and better connect us as a world-class province, region, and city."" ""We've worked diligently to make great strides in building transit, creating a transit plan, establishing a historic Ontario-Toronto Transit Partnership agreement with the city, and introducing legislation to build transit faster"", said Kinga Surma, Associate Minister of Transportation (GTA). ""Now it's time to get shovels in the ground and place orders for tunnel boring machines to expand our subway system by more than 50 per cent. Our Government is moving at an unprecedented pace to deliver on the Premier's transit vision for the Province."" ""Our government has made transit and transportation infrastructure a marquee part of our plan for Ontario,"" said Laurie Scott, Minister of Infrastructure. ""We are moving forward with the most significant transit projects the Greater Toronto Area has experienced in generations and all of these projects will be delivered using Ontario's world-class Public-Private Partnership (""P3"") model. Today marks an exciting milestone for two of the priority transit projects ― the three-stop Scarborough Subway Extension and the Eglinton Crosstown West Extension. It's another example that Ontario is getting shovels in the ground and we are delivering on our plan."" These RFQs outline the scope of work to design, build and finance the construction of tunnels for the three-stop Scarborough subway and Eglinton Crosstown West Extension. To expedite work on these projects, tunnelling will begin first, to be followed by separate contracts for the balance of the work on each project. Moving forward with tunnelling on Scarborough and Eglinton West marks significant progress for the Province's plan to build a world-class transportation network where new transit is built faster and at a lower cost, getting people where they want to go when they want to get there.

Quick Facts

The Scarborough Subway Extension is a nearly 8-kilometre extension of TTC’s Line 2 (Bloor-Danforth), from the existing Kennedy Station northeast to McCowan Road/Sheppard Avenue, with an expected service date by 2029-30. 
The Eglinton Crosstown West Extension is a 9.2-kilometre extension of the Eglinton Crosstown LRT (future TTC Line 5) from the future Mount Dennis station to Renforth Drive, with an expected service date by 2030-31. The extension will run underground, westward from Scarlett Road to Renforth Drive. Through future phases of this project, the Province is committed to establishing connectivity with Pearson International Airport.
Companies interested in bidding on these tunneling contracts must register with www.merx.com to download the respective RFQs. IO and Metrolinx will evaluate RFQ submissions and shortlist teams to be invited to respond to a Request for Proposals in summer 2020.
On February 18, Minister Mulroney introduced the Building Transit Faster Act, which would provide the province with the tools to expedite the planning, design and construction process of the four priority transit projects.
In November 2019, the Ontario-Toronto Transit Partnership was achieved between the Province of Ontario and the City of Toronto, confirming support for the advancement of the four priority transit projects. The Partnership also unlocked billions in state of good repair investments to make immediate improvements to the existing subway network.
In April 2019, the province announced its historic new transportation vision, with an estimated cost of $28.5 billion. This includes four priority transit projects: the all-new Ontario Line; a three-stop Scarborough Subway Extension; the Yonge North Subway Extension; and the Eglinton Crosstown West Extension.
These projects, featured in the recent winter market update, are part of the largest commitment to P3 infrastructure in Ontario’s history.

While ETFO has decided to escalate their withdrawal of service, our government is squarely focused on getting a deal - a positive deal that effectively freezes classroom sizes, provides full support for special education, maintains full-day kindergarten, and ensures merit-based hiring. Our focus is on negotiating so students can remain in class as opposed to being negatively impacted by continuing escalation by the teachers' unions. I remain fully committed to reaching a deal that keeps students in class, provides certainty to parents, and fairness to educators.""

Hot Docs investment will help advance film industry and build Ontario’s reputation as a cultural hub

March  9, 2020  6:30 P.M.

Ministry of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries


TORONTO - Ontario is supporting the province's world-class film and television industry with more than $525,000 in funding to Hot Docs, helping to drive local tourism spending, raise the profile of documentary filmmakers and build Ontario's reputation as a cultural hub. Hot Docs is an organization dedicated to advancing and celebrating the art of documentary film through its signature annual festival and year-round activities.
Today, Lisa MacLeod, Minister of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries, toured the Hot Docs Ted Rogers cinema and facility before speaking at an event at part of the Hot Docs - Curious Minds Series, an annual festival that includes a weeklong program of inspiring conversations with internationally renowned thinkers, tastemakers and bestselling authors. ""Hot Docs is a proud Ontario success story — reinforcing our reputation for innovation in the creative industries,"" said Minister MacLeod. ""Investing in Hot Docs is an investment in our province's spectacular double bottom line — boosting our financial bottom line through increased tourism and economic activity, as well as the equally important bottom line of our cultural identity and pride of place."" Hot Docs plays a key role in Ontario's film and television production industry and is a major economic driver for the Canadian documentary film sector. A recent economic impact study done by Hot Docs shows that the festival contributed over $39 million to Ontario's GDP. The study also found that business deals struck during the festival are worth just under $10 million. ""I know this year's selections will be eye-opening, inspiring, thought-provoking and educational,"" continued MacLeod. ""I want to thank Hot Docs for allowing new audiences to discover the wonder of documentary film, highlighting how Ontario truly offers the world in one province.""

Quick Facts

Since 2018, Ontario has provided more than $928,000 in funding to Hot Docs, including $525,000 in 2019-20.
On a year-round basis, Hot Docs’ activities, including non-festival activities, generated nearly 660 jobs and $19.4 million in tax revenue for the province.
Ontario’s film and television industry had a record-breaking year in 2019, with over 340 productions assisted by Ontario government incentives and services bringing in $2.16 billion in production spending for the economy and supporting more than 44,500 direct and spin-off jobs. 
The annual Hot Docs documentary film festival is the largest of its kind in North America. It runs this year from April 30 to May 10.

Province Reviewing Workforce Development and Training To Match Programs with the Needs of a Changing Economy

March  9, 2020  2:00 P.M.

Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development


TORONTO - As part of its commitment to prepare people for jobs, the Ontario government is launching a review of its slate of training programs to ensure workers are developing the in-demand skills that employers are looking for.
 The Workforce Development and Training Review, announced this afternoon by Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development Monte McNaughton, will include consultations with industry, employers and other partners who play a role in hiring, training and retraining talent.  The review will study how to improve existing skills training programs, including the Second Career and the Canada-Ontario Job Grant, as well as other workforce development system features, like local workforce planning.  ""In a world of global competition and rapid technological change, it is essential that Ontario's workers and businesses remain competitive,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""That is why we will work closely with experts from the labour, training and education sectors and from employers to learn how we can ensure that Ontario has the talent to prosper today and in the future."" The review will also provide the foundation for the province's first workforce development and training action plan, which will provide a roadmap for ensuring Ontario workers have the skills to find good, high-quality jobs in a changing economy. Ontario's approach follows other jurisdictions in Canada and around the world, who have responded to technological advancement and workforce changes by developing comprehensive workforce development strategies.  ""To make our economy fit for the future, we need to support all Ontario workers,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""Be it postsecondary education, apprenticeship, job training and retraining, employer-driven training, life-long learning, skilled immigration - we can't afford to leave any stone unturned if we want to make sure our economy remains competitive, and that Ontario workers are prepared for jobs and opportunities to come.""

“Labour and skills shortages are the manufacturers’ top concern. Two-thirds of manufacturers have issues today finding the workers they need and 75 per cent expect significant labour shortages in the next five years. Specifically, manufacturers struggle to retain and attract youth and to find workers with the right skills. We welcome the Government of Ontario’s review of workplace training programs to help address the labour and skills shortages and achieve economic prosperity in Ontario.”

“From skilled trades to production and sales staff, more than three quarters of Ontario’s small business owners report having trouble hiring the employees they need. Because of the lack of qualified labour, small employers across the province have been forced to turn down new business, limit investment and delay expansion plans. We are pleased that the ministry is reviewing workforce development and training programs to help ensure that employers and employees have the tools they need to keep Ontario open for business and look forward to participating in the coming consultations.”

March  9, 2020 10:45 A.M.

Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs


INGERSOLL - Today the Ontario government announced a major step in improving broadband access in Southwestern Ontario - moving forward with a combined $150 million investment to bring fast, reliable internet to thousands of homes and businesses.
Ernie Hardeman, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, announced that as part of this investment a Request for Proposals (RFP) for up to $8.2 million in broadband infrastructure in Oxford County is being issued today. The RFP will be issued by Southwestern Integrated Fibre Technology (SWIFT) Inc., a not-for-profit corporation initiated by local municipalities to address connectivity in Southwestern Ontario. ""Having high-speed internet is no longer a luxury, it's a necessity,"" said Minister Hardeman. ""Far too many families and businesses in our community are frustrated because they don't have a reliable internet connection. Our government's investment will help connect them and create new opportunities."" Increasing access to high-speed internet will better equip communities and businesses in Oxford County to compete in regional and global markets, attract new jobs and improve the quality of life for residents. Today's announcement builds on projects recently awarded in Norfolk, Lambton and Wellington. ""After successfully delivering positive results in our initial project regions, SWIFT is proud to be taking yet another step forward with the launch of a targeted broadband project dedicated to improving internet connectivity to the homes and businesses in Oxford County,"" said David Mayberry, SWIFT Board Chair and Mayor of South-West Oxford. Today's announcement marks the third phase of the SWIFT project. In total, the project will invest more than $190 million in expanding broadband in Ontario including funding from federal, provincial and municipal governments. ""Our government has a plan to connect all of Canada to high-speed internet by 2030,"" said the Honourable Maryam Monsef, Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Rural Economic Development. ""This plan is underway and it's working. Since 2017, we've invested to connect over 900 communities, including 190 Indigenous communities to high-speed internet. Through partnerships with the province, municipalities and service providers, we will continue to create jobs and a higher quality of life for those living in rural Canada."" ""We applaud the federal and Ontario governments for helping to bring fast, reliable and affordable broadband infrastructure to Rural Ontario,"" said Keith Currie, President of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture. ""This investment will significantly benefit our farms, homes and businesses rural communities who increasingly need access to high-speed internet for their work and everyday lives.""

Quick Facts

The Government of Ontario, in partnership with the federal government and private partners, recently announced a combined investment of up to $35 million through SWIFT to help provide high-speed internet for approximately 10,700 homes and businesses in Lambton, Wellington and Norfolk counties.
The Ontario Government’s Broadband and Cellular Action Plan is expected to generate up to $1 billion in total investment over five years, resulting in new connections for up to 220,000 homes and businesses. This will lead to community, social and economic benefits well beyond the provincial investment.

Ontario Improving OPP Workplace Culture
Creating a healthier, more supportive work environment for officers and civilian staff

March  9, 2020 10:33 A.M.

Ministry of the Solicitor General


ORILLIA — Today, Solicitor General Sylvia Jones, and Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) Commissioner Thomas Carrique, announced how Ontario is improving the workplace culture of the OPP to create a healthier, more inclusive work environment where members feel supported and are able to thrive.
The changes respond to recommendations outlined in the final report of the Ontario Provincial Police Independent Review Panel, which was established in April 2019 to examine the OPP's workplace culture and how the force addresses staff mental health, occupational stress injuries and suicide among its members.  Together, the Ontario government and the OPP have already taken steps to address some of the report's main recommendations, which include: Making health and wellness an organizational priority by:  Realigning both the Healthy Workplace Implementation Team and the Wellness Unit under the Field Operations Command this past December to create the Healthy Workplace Team to enable a more member-centred approach to workplace health.Establishing a provincial Commissioner's Healthy Workplace Advisory group in addition to regional engagement tables to provide guidance and input on policies and programming related to mental health. Fostering new leadership and leadership skills training by:  Making changes and enhancements to leadership training and activities so that teaching is focused on fostering a people-centred approach that promotes a healthy and inclusive workplace. Updating management performance plans so that they reflect these new expectations.Revising promotional practices to ensure a fair and transparent selection of individuals with proven leadership capacity. Developing programs that de-stigmatize stress and mental health issues by:  Establishing OPP-wide strategies to support members when they return to work after a leave of absence. Creating an organization-wide response to member suicide that includes supports to families and colleagues. ""No one should be apprehensive about going to work because they don't feel adequately supported. This is simply unacceptable,"" said Minister Jones. ""I'm confident the changes put in place and those currently underway will improve the workplace culture at the OPP, resulting in a healthier, more supportive work environment for everyone.""  ""The OPP is committed to making meaningful changes for our members, who are dedicated to ensuring the safety and security of our province. With an organization of nearly 9,000 members deployed across Ontario, it will take leadership, time and support to ensure we get things right,"" said Commissioner Thomas Carrique. ""We are pleased to work in partnership and with the support of the Ministry of the Solicitor General and the Ontario Provincial Police Association. Together, we can make effective changes to sustain a healthy and inclusive workplace."" This important work builds on steps taken by the Ontario government in March 2019 in partnership with the Ontario Provincial Police Association (OPPA) to create a new integrated mental health support program to help OPP personnel and their families deal with work-related stress and post-traumatic stress disorder. The program, fully funded by the government and run by the OPPA, is expected to be operational later this year. ""The OPPA would like to extend a sincere thank you to the panel for engaging in an open dialogue and permitting many of our recommendations to help shape this report. Working together with the employer to improve the mental health and wellness of our members, both active and retired, is of paramount importance,"" said Rob Jamieson, President of the OPPA. ""The initiation of this panel, in addition to fully funding the upcoming OPPA Mental Health Wellness Program, demonstrates this government's commitment to those who keep Ontarians safe every day."" ""The Commissioned Officers Association (COA) membership is a committed partner to effecting positive change to the OPP's workplace culture,"" said Inspector Mary Shannon, President of the COA. ""We will continue to collaborate with all stakeholders to ensure the health and well-being of all members as we continue to serve and protect our communities with pride."" ""The Civilian Association of Managers and Specialists (CAMS) would like to thank the panel members for their time and efforts over the past eight months,"" said Amanda Weaver, President of the CAMS. ""CAMS is encouraged by the panel's findings. We look forward to participating in the work towards positive change at the OPP and working closely with Commissioner Carrique, the Commissioner's Command Team, the OPPA, the COA and the Ontario Provincial Police Veterans' Association in moving forward together.""

Quick Facts

The creation of the Independent Review Panel was prompted by recent suicide deaths of OPP members as well as complaints about the workplace culture by active and former OPP staff.
The panel met with the OPP Commissioner, member associations and current and former OPP members who shared their personal experiences and insights, as well as families of members who died by suicide. In addition, the panel received over 5,000 surveys and 250 email submissions completed by current and former OPP members.
Of the panel’s 66 recommendations, 42 are already being implemented and 24 are being actively explored.
These recommendations complement those made in the OPP Suicide Review, the OPP Mental Health Roundtable Review as well as the Chief Coroner’s Expert Panel Report, which looked into the deaths of nine police officers from services across the province in 2018.

Ministry of Health


TORONTO — As COVID-19 evolves, Ontario is taking further steps to inform the public on the status of the virus across the province.
Ontario has been monitoring and reporting on the development of COVID-19 since initial cases of a viral pneumonia were reported in China in late December 2019. Every weekday at 10:30 a.m. Ontario has been updating its dedicated web page with the most up-to-date information on the status of cases in Ontario, including: the number of cases currently under investigation; and the number of confirmed positive, negative and resolved cases. To enhance these efforts, the web page will now be updated twice a day (10:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. EST), seven days a week. The web page will also now include general information on each new confirmed case of COVID-19, including gender, age, public health unit, hospital (if applicable), where acquired and status. The information provided will reflect what has been confirmed by local public health authorities at that time. This information will be provided in lieu of the news releases the province has been issuing and will be supplemented by additional details provided by individual public health units. ""The health and well-being of the people of Ontario is our top priority,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""Although the risk remains low, we are enhancing our reporting protocols as we continue to take decisive steps to protect the public. Ontarians can be fully confident that we are providing the information they need in order to protect themselves and their families."" Currently, the virus is not circulating locally. However, given the global circumstances, last week Ontario implemented an enhanced response structure to formally bring together experts across the health sector to provide clinical expertise and experience to implement provincial and regional plans. This will ensure the province is ready to contain and respond to a COVID-19 outbreak. In addition to the daily updates to the website, Dr. David Williams, Chief Medical Officer of Health, will continue to provide updates on COVID-19 at the regularly scheduled media briefings every Monday and Thursday at 3 p.m. at the Queen's Park media studio.

Associate Minister of Children and Women's Issues Marks International Women's Day


March  8, 2020  9:00 A.M.

Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services


Toronto, ON — Today, Jill Dunlop, Associate Minister of Children and Women's Issues, released the following statement to recognize International Women's Day:
""On International Women's Day, we celebrate the wonderful achievements of women around the world and right here in Ontario. It's a day to look back on how far women have come — and to look ahead and see how far we can go. We all have a role to play in bringing women's economic, social and political issues to the forefront. Every day we see in our own communities and networks remarkable women paving the way for the next generation of strong, determined and passionate female leaders. Despite our incredible progress, women are still facing significant barriers. In Canada, women are more likely to graduate from university, yet still are only represented in 35 per cent of management positions. A mere 18 per cent sit on boards. Women of colour, Indigenous women, LGBT women, and countless others face even greater barriers to success. We know for our economy to continue to grow and thrive, we need to create the conditions for women to succeed in all workplaces. This means breaking down gender stereotypes and biases in the home, at school and in the workplace. We need to address these head on and work to encourage more women and girls to get into non-traditional roles like the skilled trades, the automotive sector, as first responders, in the STEM field and in leadership roles. This is a change in culture that requires every person to shift their perspective on what women are capable of. In addition to having the right resources and supports in place, it is crucial we continue to raise awareness - that we continue to leverage every opportunity to break down barriers and bring to the surface all contributions women make to the economy and society overall. I encourage everyone, not just on International Women's Day but every day, to continue to challenge stereotypes and be advocates for gender equality.""

Ministry of Health


TORONTO — This afternoon, Dr. David Williams, Chief Medical Officer of Health, confirmed two new positive cases of COVID-19 bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Ontario to 28. Of these, four cases in the province are all resolved, with each of those patients having two consecutive negative tests at least 24 hours apart.  
A male in his 20s returned from Italy on March 3, 2020, and presented himself to Mount Sinai Hospital's emergency department in Toronto. The hospital took all necessary precautions and followed standard operating procedures, including testing and assessment. The patient was discharged home the same day where he remains in self-isolation. A female in her 60s returned from Iran on March 2, 2020. She presented herself to Mackenzie Richmond Hill Hospital's emergency department, in Richmond Hill. The hospital took all necessary precautions and followed standard operating procedures, including testing and assessment. The patient was discharged home the same day where she remains in self-isolation. As a result of the coordinated efforts of our health care and public health system, all individuals who have tested positive have been quickly assessed and isolated. At this time, the virus is not circulating locally. However, given the global circumstances, Ontario is actively working with city and health partners to plan for the potential of local spread. The province continues to carefully monitor this situation and encourage residents to stay informed by regularly reviewing credible information sources. Dr. Williams will provide an update on the situation at the regularly scheduled media briefing Monday, March 9, 2020, at 3:00 p.m. at the Queen's Park media studio. For more details please contact your local Public Health Unit and visit Ontario's website to learn more about how the province continues to protect Ontarians from COVID-19.

We are also working closely with our agencies and attractions to respond appropriately. This includes working with Destination Ontario to direct marketing efforts to domestic, national and other markets not impacted by COVID-19. Our attractions are also implementing appropriate protocols to be in-line with public health and safety recommendations. Finally, we are actively engaged with our federal government colleagues to ensure a coordinated response to tourism impacts. We want to assure all residents and tourists to Ontario that officials at the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries are working together in close cooperation with our partners to ensure public safety continues to be protected and our tourism industry continues to thrive."" To help educate Ontarians and visitors about COVID-19, how they can protect themselves and what to do if they suspect they may be at risk, the province has launched a dedicated webpage.

Corrections Officers Graduate from New Modernized Training Program 
Training includes greater focus on mental health and de-escalation

Ministry of the Solicitor General


HAMILTON - Ontario is making the correctional system safer by hiring 44 new correctional officers who have completed the Corrections Foundational Training program, a redesigned curriculum that educates and prepares officers to stay safe on the job and meet the everyday demands of the province's adult correctional institutions. 
""This new modernized training program is part of our government's efforts to help keep correctional officers and our communities safe,"" said Solicitor General Sylvia Jones. ""These men and women have a very difficult job and we are taking steps to ensure they are prepared to deal with any situation."" The newly designed eight-week program, which replaced the former Correctional Officer Training and Assessment program, offers an increased focus on key areas such as human rights, mental health, health and staff safety, and teamwork.  Training includes job specific case studies and scenario-based learning with an increased emphasis on de-escalation and communications skills. This approach builds critical-thinking, decision-making and problem-solving skills, so graduates are better prepared to quickly respond to real situations. The new training program also provides ongoing Indigenous training, inmate management techniques and report writing. The graduates will be assigned to nine different institutions across Ontario near their home regions:  Twenty-two graduates will work in the Central Region at Maplehurst Correctional Complex, Toronto East Detention Centre, and Toronto South Detention Centre.Eleven graduates will work in the Eastern Region at Ottawa-Carleton Detention Centre, Quinte Detention Centre and Central East Correctional Centre.Eight graduates will work in the Northern Region at Algoma Treatment and Remand Centre, Central North Correctional Centre and Monteith Correctional Centre.Three graduates will work in the Western Region at Stratford Jail.  ""I would like to express my appreciation to these graduates for their hard work and commitment to serving the people of Ontario,"" said Belinda Karahalios, Parliamentary Assistant to the Solicitor General. ""It is crucial that our corrections staff are safe on the job and the new training will help ensure both staff and inmate safety.""

Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade


TORONTO - Workers, businesses and communities are creating new jobs and new opportunities across the province as the government's plan to create a more competitive business environment and make Ontario open for jobs continues to deliver results.   
Statistics Canada announced this morning that employment in Ontario changed by 3,200 in February, including an increase of 14,800 in the manufacturing sector. Since June 2018, employment in Ontario has risen by over 300,000. ""Ontario continues to be an island of stability amidst a sea of global uncertainty,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""Our government is creating an open for business climate that is building a strong, resilient economy to benefit businesses, workers and families in every corner of the province."" The government has recently launched a Regional Development Program for eastern and southwestern Ontario. This program supports eligible small- and medium-sized businesses investing in new equipment and training to expand operations. Eligible applicants may also receive financial support and advisory services to help navigate other government programs, such as guidance on approvals, assistance with skills and talent, and information on available tax credits. According to Stokes Economics, eastern and southwestern Ontario accounted for over $184 billion or more than 23 per cent of Ontario's economy in 2018. The Ontario government is committed to growing Ontario's regional economy and creating good jobs in communities right across the province. Ontario has also cut the small business Corporate Income Tax (CIT) rate by 8.7 per cent and reduced the rate to 3.2 per cent. Supporting small businesses is part of the government's plan to attract investment and enable entrepreneurs and risk takers to grow their businesses and create high-paying, good quality jobs. Small businesses have benefited from accelerated write-offs of capital investments as well as the government's decision to not parallel a federal measure that would have increased taxes on some small businesses earning passive investment income. It is estimated that Ontario businesses could save $5.4 billion in 2020 through these actions. ""The steps we are taking demonstrate our ongoing commitment to supporting our entrepreneurs and risk takers,"" said Minister Fedeli. ""Our government will continue to build on our progress so we can attract more investment and create even more jobs.""

Quick Facts

Employment in Ontario grew by 210,200 in 2019.
Ontario is leading a business mission to Peru and Ecuador in April 2020 to promote Ontario’s world-class mining sector and drive export opportunities for Ontario’s mining companies.
In the coming months, the government will be consulting with small business owners and organizations to shape the development of Ontario’s Small Business Success Strategy, which will ensure small businesses across the province have what they need to reach their goals and set them up for success in the years to come.

Ontario Expanding Natural Gas to More Communities
Making Life More Affordable for Individuals, Families and Businesses on Scugog Island

March  6, 2020 11:00 A.M.

Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines


PORT PERRY — Ontario is expanding access to natural gas throughout rural, northern Ontario and Indigenous communities with the launch of the next phase of the Natural Gas Expansion Program.
Bill Walker, Associate Minister of Energy, announced today that construction work has officially started to build a natural gas distribution pipeline and facilities to serve Scugog Island after it was granted approval from the Ontario Energy Board (OEB). As part of the government's plan to make life more affordable for people and their families, the average household in Scugog Island could save $800 to $2,500 per year in energy costs as they switch from costlier fuel sources. An estimated 780 homes and 30 businesses are projected to be connected. ""By expanding access to natural gas, our government is putting more money in people's pockets,"" said Associate Minister Walker. ""Expanding natural gas access will help make Scugog Island more attractive for job creation and new business growth and sends the clear message that Ontario is open for business."" Building on the success of the Natural Gas Expansion Program, the OEB is now collecting information about natural gas expansion opportunities across Ontario to develop a report on eligible projects for the ministry. The OEB will deliver its report to the government by August 2020, after which a final decision will be made on future expansion projects eligible to receive support through the Ontario government's Natural Gas Expansion Program. ""Expanding access to natural gas on Scugog Island will provide our community with a more affordable and environmentally friendly way to heat our homes and businesses. I would like to thank Minister Walker and the provincial government for assisting rural areas and First Nations through their Natural Gas Expansion Program,"" said Chief Kelly LaRocca, Mississaugas of Scugog Island First Nation. ""Today we thank the Province and Enbridge for the Natural Gas Expansion Program to Scugog Island. We celebrate that the construction is now underway and that very soon residents and businesses on Scugog Island will have the opportunity to connect to natural gas, bringing lower energy prices to many,"" said Bobbie Drew, Mayor of the Township of Scugog. ""We are committed to providing the energy that Ontario residents want and need,"" said Jim Sanders, Senior Vice President, Operations, Enbridge Gas Inc. ""Natural gas is the most affordable way to heat buildings and water, and we're excited to have started construction on Scugog Island so residents can take advantage of the cost savings, and local businesses can be more competitive. We look forward to working with the government to continue to expand access to safe, reliable, and abundant natural gas, which is essential to Ontario's rural, northern and Indigenous communities.""

Quick Facts

The Natural Gas Expansion Program will allocate up to $130 million to support new natural gas expansion projects over a three-year period from 2021 to 2023.
Since its launch in 2019, the Natural Gas Expansion Program has made several projects eligible for financial support. These projects are expected to connect over 9,000 customers in 16 communities to natural gas.
The Scugog Island project, developed by Enbridge under the first phase of the program, will benefit from up to $6.42 million in eligible funding to expand natural gas access.

Ontario Releases a New and Comprehensive Strategy to Combat Human Trafficking 
$307 million invested to protect children and youth, crack down on offenders

March  6, 2020 10:30 A.M.

Office of the Premier


ST. CATHARINES  — The Government of Ontario is taking strong action to protect children and youth, support survivors, raise awareness and hold offenders accountable by releasing Ontario's new anti-human trafficking strategy today.
Premier Doug Ford, Jill Dunlop, Associate Minister of Children and Women's Issues, and Solicitor General Sylvia Jones released today a new, comprehensive five-year strategy to combat human trafficking and end child sexual exploitation across the province. The new strategy is the largest total investment in dedicated anti-human trafficking supports and services in the country and is a major step forward in Ontario's fight against human trafficking.  ""Human traffickers prey on the most vulnerable members of our society ― our children,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""We must put an end to this disgusting industry and take immediate steps to keep our kids safe. Our new strategy takes strong and decisive action to support survivors, raise awareness, and give our police the tools and resources they need to put these criminals behind bars.""  Ontario's Anti-Human Trafficking Strategy will invest $307 million over the next five years on a proactive, comprehensive action plan focused on four key areas: Raising awareness of the issue by launching a new, province-wide marketing campaign to educate children, youth, parents, and the broader public about what human trafficking is, how to recognize the signs, and where to get help.Holding offenders accountable by giving law enforcement more specialized Crown prosecution support for human trafficking cases, strengthening intelligence gathering in the correctional system, and investing in police services to help coordinate anti-human trafficking investigations and expand the Ontario Provincial Police Child Sexual Exploitation Unit.Protecting victims and intervening early by investing in specialized intervention teams involving police and child protection services, incorporating human trafficking awareness into the education curriculum, and establishing dedicated, licensed residences to support victims, including those under the age of 16.Supporting survivors by investing new funding in wrap-around, community-based supports and Indigenous-led initiatives to make more services available for survivors and by enhancing victim services to assist survivors throughout the court process.""Survivors of human trafficking require specific, ongoing supports to help them exit trafficking, heal from their trauma and rebuild their lives,"" said Jill Dunlop, Associate Minister of Children and Women's Issues. ""Our new strategy doubles the investment in community-based services for survivors, while also providing a range of new supports focused on children and youth, which has been a critical gap until now. It provides increased supports for Indigenous communities and takes a cross-government approach to reinforce Ontario as a leader in combatting human trafficking.""   To address the needs of First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities and organizations, and frontline workers, Indigenous-specific initiatives are integrated throughout Ontario's new strategy. Examples of these initiatives include targeted public awareness activities, Indigenous-led community-based supports for survivors such as counselling, cultural teachings and healing ceremonies, victim services delivered by Indigenous communities and organizations, and culturally-appropriate supports for at-risk youth. ""Human trafficking is a vastly under-reported crime often hidden in our communities,"" said Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General. ""A crucial component of our new strategy involves strengthening law enforcement and justice sector initiatives so we can better support victims, improve our ability to target and find perpetrators, intercept human trafficking networks and ultimately bring criminals to justice.""   Co-led by Solicitor General Jones and Associate Minister Dunlop, Ontario's new Anti-Human Trafficking Strategy demonstrates the government's commitment to ensure the fight against human trafficking becomes a national priority. The strategy reflects valuable input from survivors of human trafficking, Indigenous communities and organizations, law enforcement and frontline service providers. The government will continue to work collaboratively with these and other partners to ensure the strategy is meaningful and effective.

Quick Facts

Human trafficking is one of the fastest-growing crimes worldwide. Approximately two-thirds of police-reported human trafficking violations in Canada occur in Ontario. 
The average age of recruitment into sex trafficking is 13 years old.
Over 70 per cent of human trafficking victims identified by police are under the age of 25.
Young women and girls are particularly at risk, especially those from Indigenous communities and children and youth in care, though boys, men and people who are LGBTQ are also targeted.

Ontario's New Anti-Human Trafficking Strategy


March  6, 2020 10:30 A.M.

Office of the Premier


Ontario's Anti-Human Trafficking Strategy will invest $307 million over the next five years on a comprehensive action plan to combat human trafficking and child sexual exploitation. The strategy takes a proactive approach with initiatives across government focused on four key areas: 
Raising Awareness of the Issue A number of sectors have identified the need for training on human trafficking to equip frontline service providers  with the skills needed to respond to cases of trafficking. Raising general public awareness, especially among youth  and parents, is also key to helping prevent trafficking before it occurs. Initiatives in the new strategy to raise  awareness include:  Launching a new, provincewide marketing campaign targeted to teens, as well as parents of children and youth.  The campaign will build awareness about the dangers of sex trafficking, including how young people are lured,  signs that a person is being trafficked, and where to get help.   Developing new public education materials to respond to specific sector needs and expanding distribution of  existing awareness materials through partnerships across government ministries to include education partners,  highway service centres and the hospitality sector, for example.     Developing and delivering new multi-sectoral anti-human trafficking training, as well as culturally-responsive  and survivor-informed training, including Indigenous-specific components. Training will be supported by a range  of government ministries and delivered to sectors where the need has been identified, such as social services  and education.   Increasing awareness of available training on how to identify and support survivors of human trafficking at the  province's emergency departments and Sexual Assault/Domestic Violence Treatment Centres.   Continuing to engage at the Federal-Provincial-Territorial level through the Status of Women and Ministers of  Justice and Public Safety forums, as well as First Minister's Meetings and the Council of the Federation, to  share best practices and ensure that preventing and combatting human trafficking is a national priority.  Protecting Victims and Intervening Early Early intervention and prevention efforts are crucial to effectively combat trafficking. As the average age of  recruitment into sex trafficking is 13 years old, Ontario's new Anti-Human Trafficking strategy prioritizes  initiatives targeted to child and youth prevention and intervention, as well as supports for victims, such as new,  dedicated residences to serve children and youth under the age of 16. Initiatives in the new strategy to protect  victims and intervene early include:  Developing police and child protection services as part of new specialized intervention teams, focusing on  at-risk and exploited children and youth. The programs will leverage multi-disciplinary teams to provide a  collaborative, more targeted response to human trafficking from both child protection and enforcement.   Establishing dedicated residences to serve missing at-risk and exploited children and youth, including those  under the age of 16. The province will fund up to three new, licensed residences to provide specialized  programming, providing access to in-house supports to respond to the complex trauma experienced by children and  youth who are trafficked.   Expanding the Youth-in-Transition Worker program to include additional human trafficking workers (for a total of  12) dedicated to providing enhanced human trafficking supports to youth in and leaving the care of children's  aid societies. Youth-In-Transition Workers connect youth to services and resources in their communities, such as  employment services, life skills training and housing supports. Phasing in over the five-year strategy, the six  additional workers will expand the geographical reach of human trafficking supports through the program and  provide support to specific populations, such as Indigenous children and youth.   Continuing education and prevention efforts geared to children and youth through Ontario schools, building on  the school curriculum. Ontario's updated elementary Health and Physical Education curriculum now includes  learning that helps protect students from human trafficking, and White Ribbon is developing a new,  digitally-based resource on the prevention of sexual exploitation for delivery in Ontario secondary schools.  These and other resources will support broader education for students about human trafficking.  Supporting Survivors Survivors of human trafficking require specialized, trauma-informed, community-based supports to help them heal and  rebuild their lives, and to reduce the risk of re-exploitation. As Indigenous women and girls are particularly  targeted, Indigenous-led, culturally-appropriate approaches are critical to address the needs of First Nation, Inuit  and Métis communities. Initiatives in the new strategy to support survivors include:  Increasing community-focused anti-human trafficking services and supports designed for, and by Indigenous  people, by investing up to $4 million per year in new funding for the Indigenous-Led Initiatives Fund. This  increased funding will better meet the demand for dedicated services and enable frontline service providers to  reach targeted and underserved groups, including children and youth, as well as Inuit and 2SLGBTQ+ survivors.     Increasing funding for the Indigenous Anti-Human Trafficking Liaisons program to serve more communities and  build capacity to address trafficking and support Indigenous survivors. Liaisons provide targeted, ongoing  service planning and delivery supports to agencies and communities seeking to provide culturally-appropriate  services to Indigenous survivors.   Increasing community-based programs to support survivors and individuals at risk of being trafficked by  providing up to $6 million per year in new funding for the Anti-Human Trafficking Community-Supports Fund. This  increased funding will allow for new child-specific programming, improved ability to respond to service  pressures and more supports in northern, rural and Francophone communities. Examples of services include  emergency and transitional housing; trauma-informed counselling, and supports to foster healing and  rehabilitation; healthcare, mental health and addiction treatment, and to provide linkages to employment and job  training supports.   Enhancing access and supports for victims of human trafficking in the justice sector by expanding the Victim  Quick Response Program+ (VQRP+) and the Vulnerable Victims and Family Fund (VVFF), as well as increasing funding  for the Victim Crisis Assistance Ontario (VCAO) program to support delivery of community-based services. These  enhancements will help to more effectively meet victims' needs, both immediate and during court proceedings,  such as enhanced assistance related to meals, accommodation, tattoo/branding removal and counselling.   Increasing funding for Indigenous Victims Services to provide effective and culturally-appropriate supports and  services to Indigenous human trafficking victims. Services are designed, developed and delivered by Indigenous  communities and organizations in a culturally-appropriate and trauma-informed way, taking a holistic approach to  healing, including support for family members.   Expanding the Victim/Witness Assistance Program (V/WAP) by adding new court-based Victim/Witness Services  workers to better meet the needs of human trafficking victims while cases proceed through the criminal justice  system to support holding offenders accountable.   Expanding the current pilot program which provides free legal support for persons seeking specialized human  trafficking restraining orders.   Continuing to convene the Human Trafficking Lived Experience Roundtable to enable direct engagement with, and  input from, survivors of trafficking on Ontario's response to human trafficking. The Roundtable will serve to  provide an engagement forum on strategy initiatives, as well as broader related government efforts.  Holding Offenders Accountable To keep pace with the increasing volume and complexity of human trafficking cases across the province, Ontario's new  Anti-Human Trafficking Strategy provides a coordinated approach to law enforcement, with increased capacity for  policing, Crown prosecutors and intelligence gathering in the correctional system. Initiatives under the new  strategy to hold offenders accountable include:  Enhancing the use of Major Case Management for missing persons and human trafficking investigations by investing  in software development to assist in meeting specific needs of human trafficking investigators and analysts.  This will build on the use of MCM across all of Ontario's police services as an innovative approach to solving  major crimes and dealing with complex incidents.   Establishing a new Intelligence-led joint forces team from police agencies across Ontario, including the Ontario  Provincial Police (OPP), municipal police services and First Nations police services. This will provide capacity  to identify, investigate and disrupt human trafficking organizations operating in Ontario and address the threat  of organized crime.   Increasing the capacity of the OPP Child Sexual Exploitation Unit (CSEU) to investigate sexual offences against  children, including cases of child sex trafficking. This will ensure the CSEU has adequate resources to  investigate offences reported through OPP calls for service, other police service referrals, tips from the RCMP  National Child Exploitation Coordination Centre (NCECC) and Canadian Center for Child Protection's Cybertip.ca,  as well as Peer 2 Peer services.   Increasing the investment in Institutional Security Teams, Field Intelligence Officers and intelligence analysts  within correctional services to allow broader coverage of correctional institutions, as well as probations and  parole office locations in Ontario. This will strengthen information and intelligence gathering capacity to  better identify and monitor human traffickers within the correctional system and identify victims in support of  criminal investigations to more effectively bring offenders to justice.   Enhancing specialized Crown prosecution capacity to respond to existing and additional human trafficking cases.  These enhancements will support Crown prosecutors' ability to effectively hold offenders accountable through  vigorous prosecution of charges laid against members of organized human trafficking networks and other sexual  offences against children. This will also support their ability to provide pre-charge advice to police, as well  as additional victim supports to help survivors through complex, multi-jurisdictional investigations and lengthy  prosecutions.   Developing appropriate and consistent policing standards for human trafficking and missing persons  investigations as part of the Community Safety and Policing Act (CSPA), 2019 regulatory  framework.  In addition to the initiatives in each of the four focus areas, the province will be looking at policy, legislative  and regulatory changes as part of  Ontario's new Anti-Human Trafficking Strategy,   to strengthen a cross-sectoral  approach to combat human trafficking.

Convicted: Ball Construction Inc., 5 Shirley Ave., Kitchener, ON.
Location of Workplace: 530 Manitou Dr., Kitchener, ON. Description of Offence: On July 18, 2018, Ball Construction Inc. failed, as a constructor, to ensure the measures and procedures prescribed by section 26.1(1) of Ontario Regulation 213/91 were carried out at the project. Date of Offence: July 18, 2018. Date of Conviction: March 3, 2020. Penalty Imposed:  Following a guilty plea, Justice of the Peace Michael Cuthbertson, sitting in Provincial Offences Court in Kitchener fined the company $55,000. Crown Counsel: Indira Stewart and Graeme Adams.The court also imposed a 25-per-cent victim fine surcharge as required by the Provincial Offences Act. The surcharge is credited to a special provincial government fund to assist victims of crime. Background:  Ball Construction Inc. (""Ball"") is a construction business performing design build, construction management, general contracting and special project management services. Ball was engaged to renovate an existing factory, that was being decommissioned at the time, into an alternate type of facility.On July 18, 2018, prior to 9:00 a.m., two workers employed by a subcontractor to Ball commenced work near some abandoned press pits and trenches, which were behind caution tape.  While doing so, the subcontracted workers decided to use an elevated work platform, and in order to use the work platform, moved wooden wall sections which were on the floor, out of their way, to create space.  Unknown to the workers, the wall sections were covering an abandoned press pit approximately three meters deep.  When the two workers together picked up and attempted to push the wall sections out of the way, both fell into the pit and suffered injuries.Investigation by the Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development determined that caution tape and pylons did not meet the requirements for guardrails installed around the trenches or press pit.Section 26.1(1) of Ontario Regulation 213/91, as amended, the Regulation for Construction Projects, requires that a worker be protected by a guardrail system that meets the requirements of the Regulations. Ball Construction Inc. failed, as a constructor, to ensure the measures and procedures prescribed by section 26.1(1) of Ontario Regulation 213/91 were carried out at the project

Ontario Announces a Fair Plan to Keep Students in Class
Government Plan Freezes Classroom Sizes, Invests in Special Education, and Holds the Line on Wages and Benefits

March  3, 2020  4:30 P.M.

Ministry of Education


TORONTO — The Honourable Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education, today confirmed the Government has made additional, reasonable proposals at the negotiating table to fight for the priorities of students and parents, with a single focus on ending this impasse.
During the negotiation process, the Government tabled proposals with each of the teacher unions, which included substantive moves on lower than proposed but not lower than on the ground class sizes, support for students' unique learning needs, full-day kindergarten, as well as reasonable proposals on merit-based hiring and compensation. Despite these consistently reasonable moves, the teachers' unions continue to reject the Government's student-centric proposals while simultaneously focusing on significant increases in compensation, particularly enriching generous benefits schemes. Today, the Government is announcing the most recent proposal put forward to all teacher unions, with a focus on getting a deal:  A commitment to a funded maximum average class size of 23 in secondary schools - leaving them essentially the same as 2019-2020;Replace the previous Local Priorities Fund with a new, student-centric Supports for Students Fund, which allows boards more flexibility to address students' unique learning needs, including special education, mental health, and STEM education;The Supports for Students Fund would continue at the same funding amount of the Local Priorities Fund. A commitment to maintain full-day kindergarten; and Reasonable increases in wages and compensation. The Government is also announcing a policy to give parents the ability to opt their children out of the mandatory online courses required for graduation.  The Government is calling on the unions to cancel future strikes during this period to allow for good faith bargaining. Moreover, the Government continues to make the case for the advancement of merit-based hiring. ""The time to end this is now. Parents are frustrated, students are losing educational days, and teachers are uncertain about their future,"" said Minister Lecce. ""I am asking the teachers' unions to return to the table, in light of this reasonable offer, to reach the agreement parents want, and students deserve."" These proposals demonstrate the Government's commitment to getting students back in the classroom, investing in our students' potential while supporting the school boards' planning processes.   ""This is a balanced plan that reflects the priorities of students and parents, maintaining class sizes, investing in students' unique learning needs, and holds the line on the reasonable increase in wages and compensation we are offering."" ""If the unions reject this most recent, student-centric offer, parents should rightly be asking what exactly are the priorities of the unions,"" concluded Minister Lecce.

Quick Facts

The Government’s plan includes no changes to class size for our youngest learners in Junior Kindergarten through grade 3. There are no changes to class size for students in grades 4 to 8. Provincial funding, and legislated class size restrictions, would change for grades 9-12 to reflect an average class size of 23. This is effectively the same as 2019-20.
The Ministry of Education provides the framework, funding, and flexibility needed to support school boards in meeting class size requirements for all grades across the province. Local school boards are responsible for class organization.
The Ministry of Education will continue to move forward on a made-in-Ontario online learning program that will ensure student flexibility, technological literacy and a wide selection of courses. By expanding and modernizing online learning, students will have greater flexibility, more choice, and will graduate with the skills needed to enter the workforce.
The Ministry of Education understands that parents know best how their children can adapt and learn through online courses, by giving parents the option to opt out of the mandatory online courses required for graduation.  As students prepare to enter Grade 11 and 12, parents will have the opportunity to engage with their child’s guidance counsellor to determine whether online learning is appropriate and beneficial for their child.
The Supports for Students Fund will provide a total of $148 million, an amount equivalent to the remaining amount of the previously negotiated Local Priorities Fund, in the last round of bargaining.

Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade


TORONTO — Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, is leading a mining manufacturing and equipment focused business mission to Peru and Ecuador from April 13-17, 2020, exposing Ontario businesses to new markets in order for them to expand and create more jobs. 
In advance of the mission, the Minister participated in the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) convention in Toronto where he met with government representatives and senior executives from the mining sector in South America including the heads of the Peruvian delegation, Susana Vilca Achata, Minister of Energy and Mines of Peru and María Antonieta Alva, Minister of Economy and Finance of Peru as well as heads of the Ecuadorian delegation, Enrique Gallegos, Vice Minister of Mines of Ecuador and Freddy Villao, Undersecretary of Strategic Development in the Office of the Vice President of Ecuador. ""Peru and Ecuador represent an abundance of untapped potential, with their mining sectors offering high potential for Ontario suppliers to the mining industry,"" said Minister Fedeli. ""By diversifying Ontario's global trading partners, we are creating a climate for our province's businesses and economy to thrive.""  ""Our government is focused on bringing good jobs and investment to the province,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines. ""Ontario is a leading jurisdiction for mineral extraction and production and our government is making sure that the world knows that we are Open for Business and Open for Jobs.""  During the mission, Minister Fedeli will meet with government officials and corporate executives in the mining sector. Businesses from Ontario's mining sector will attend market and industry intelligence briefings and meet with local businesses to develop new opportunities. Delegates will also attend Expominas, an international trade fair for heavy construction and mining machinery, held annually in Quito, Ecuador.

Quick Facts

Nearly 1 in 5 jobs in Ontario depend on trade. With over 1.3 million jobs supported by exports, Ontario’s jobs are the most export-reliant across Canada.
With approximately 900 mining supply and service companies, Ontario's leading-edge mine supply and service sector produces more than $10 billion worth of mineral production, supplies and services every year.
With 40 operating mines in Ontario and about 150 companies actively exploring more than 200 mineral exploration projects, mining in Ontario supports 26,000 direct jobs, and approximately 50,000 indirect jobs associated with mineral manufacturing and processing.
Toronto is the mining finance capital of the world: the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and Toronto Venture Exchange (TSX-V) list more mining companies than any other exchange.
Peru has had one of the fastest-growing economies in Latin America, with GDP growth of 4 per cent in 2018. 
Peru is the world’s largest silver producer and second largest copper producer, making mineral exploration and extraction a key sector. Several mining projects are expected to begin in 2019 to 2022 with a focus on responsible extraction. 
Ecuador’s government aims to expand mining exports from $270 million in 2018 to $2 billion in 2021, which means opportunity for Ontario suppliers of mining equipment and services.
In June 2019, the Ecuadorian government announced the discovery of an underground mine that could be among the largest gold, copper and silver deposits in the world. The government also announced a public mining policy aimed at fostering a fairer commercial environment for the industry. Ontario exports to the country were $36 million in 2018.

Ontario Unveils Plan to Build Mental Health and Addictions System
New Publicly-Funded Therapy Program to Launch this Year

March  3, 2020 11:25 A.M.

Ministry of Health


WHITBY - Every year, more than one million Ontarians experience a mental health or addictions challenge, which can have a serious impact on their quality of life, including the ability to go to school or make a living. Following extensive consultations with experts, grassroots organizations, health care providers on the frontlines and first responders, as well as people with lived experience and their families and caregivers, Ontario is launching Roadmap to Wellness: A Plan to Build Ontario's Mental Health and Addictions System.
Today, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Michael Tibollo, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, were at Ontario Shores Centre for Mental Health Sciences to unveil the new roadmap, which provides a clear path forward toward offering Ontarians easier access to higher-quality care and supports in communities across the province. ""We know how important it is for Ontarians and their families to have access to high-quality services when and where they need them,"" said Elliott. ""By improving the availability and quality of mental health and addictions supports, and by better connecting Ontarians with these services, this new roadmap will help us build healthier communities by alleviating growing pressures on our hospitals and, in doing so, significantly support our goal of ending hallway health care."" The new Mental Health and Addictions Centre of Excellence within Ontario Health will serve as the foundation on which Roadmap to Wellness is built. Historically, Ontario has had great success in building a world-class system of care, such as cancer care. The centre will be the coordinating, central provincial body that will leverage this experience to enable and drive the effective implementation of the plan's four pillars:   Improving quality;Expanding existing services;Implementing innovative solutions; and Improving access. Taken together, along with a comprehensive wait times strategy, these pillars will help build a system that puts the patient at the centre of care and drives down unacceptably high wait times for services.   As part of the third pillar, implementing innovative solutions, Ontario will launch Mindability, a first-of-its-kind in Canada program that will provide evidence-based cognitive behavioural therapy to equip Ontarians aged 10 and up with the lifelong skills they need to manage their mental health and overall well-being.  After receiving an assessment from a trained mental health clinician, an eligible individual will be offered a therapy program that addresses their level of need to support their recovery. The types of services available will include internet-based modules, personal workbooks, telephone coaching and clinical counseling, as well as face-to-face, group and individual therapy. Mindability will be funded just like OHIP with no out-of-pocket costs for patients. It will roll out starting in spring 2020 with further expansion planned in the fall. ""Our government continues to fulfill our promise of making mental health and addictions a priority,"" said Michael Tibollo, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. ""Roadmap to Wellness moves us in the right direction toward building a comprehensive and connected mental health and addictions system that works for all Ontarians across the lifespan. This is a plan that is client-centred, data-driven and evidence-based. Most of all, it is a plan that will ensure that all Ontarians are able to access high-quality services and supports, where and when they need them."" As part of the fourth pillar, improving access, any person living in Ontario will be able to call, text or go online to learn more or get help by using:  One easy-to-remember and toll-free phone number accessible across the province; andAn easy-to-use website with an online chat function and client resources. Ontario is in the process of finalizing plans for the implementation of one number to call. As a first step, in spring 2020 a single number will provide streamlined access to Telehealth Ontario's nine health information and advice programs. The province expects to begin expansion to include other services, including certain mental health services, in fall 2020, with phased expansion thereafter.  Ontarians will also have access to in-person mental health and addictions navigation support through regional access points established across Ontario and through their local Ontario Health Team, which will better integrate mental health and addictions supports between hospitals, primary care providers and community service providers. Building on the extensive consultations that informed the development of Roadmap to Wellness, Ontario will continue to engage with system partners to help guide the effective implementation of this plan. As these long overdue improvements are made, Ontario will invest to fill urgent gaps in care to address the significant and debilitating wait times that currently exist in the system.  

Quick Facts

The government will invest $20 million in 2020 to launch Mindability. This program will build on the work over the last three years by four regional network hubs, including the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Ontario Shores Centre for Mental Health Sciences, Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre and Waypoint Centre for Mental Health Care, as well as a provincial bibliotherapy centre administered by the Canadian Mental Health Association Ontario that offers Ontarians self-directed mental health support materials and books with complementary coaching and clinical support.
To enable Roadmap to Wellness, Ontario is investing $3.8 billion over 10 years to create new services and expand programs. The province has started to fill urgent gaps in care as identified by system partners through immediate investments, including $174 million more in annualized funding for mental health and addictions programs in 2019-20.
To develop Roadmap to Wellness, the government is listening to clients, caregivers and sector experts. The province has had conversations with hundreds of Ontarians, including discussion sessions in communities across the province and input from people with experience and expertise in Indigenous mental health and addictions, Francophones, municipalities, associations and justice system representatives. Continuing to engage with system partners, including Indigenous communities and other communities with unique needs, will help guide the effective implementation of the plan.

New Plan to Build Mental Health and Addictions System Will Provide Ontarians Easier Access to Higher-Quality Care


March  3, 2020 11:25 A.M.

Ministry of Health


Ontario is launching Roadmap to Wellness: A Plan to Build Ontario's Mental Health and Addictions System. This roadmap is built from the ground up and based on extensive consultations with families and people with lived experience, grassroots organizations and frontline health service providers to ensure Ontario can provide a clear path forward to offer people easier access to higher-quality care in communities across the province.
Building on a Strong Foundation The new Mental Health and Addictions Centre of Excellence within Ontario Health will serve as the foundation on which Roadmap to Wellness is built. Responding to recommendations made in 2010 by the Select Committee on Mental Health and Addictions, for which Christine Elliott was vice-chair and which was established through a motion she presented that was unanimously supported by the Ontario legislature, the centre will:  Establish a central point of oversight for mental health and addictions care;Be responsible for standardizing and monitoring the quality and delivery of evidence-based services and clinical care across the province to provide a better and more consistent patient experience; andProvide support and resources to Ontario Health Teams as they connect patients to the different types of mental health and addictions care they need and help them navigate the complex system. Roadmap to Wellness  As the Mental Health and Addictions Centre of Excellence standardizes and better organizes the system, it will enable and drive the effective implementation of the roadmap's four pillars:  Improving quality: The Mental Health and Addictions Centre of Excellence will develop a consistent set of evidence-based standards and monitor and manage the quality of care against these standards to ensure an improved client experience in communities across the province.  The province will work alongside technical experts and community-based providers to develop a new core services framework, which will identify a set of core services based on an assessment of population health needs and existing capacity on the ground. In doing so, the province will ensure that, over time, all Ontarians have equal access to a common set of high-quality services no matter where they call home. Core service standards will also be developed to set expectations for providers on how each core service should be delivered so that Ontarians can be assured of a consistent experience no matter where they go. The core services framework and its accompanying core service standards will provide an evidence-based framework that will guide future funding decisions.  Expanding existing services: Informed by the province's extensive consultations, Ontario will continue to invest in the expansion of priority programs and services: children and youth and youth wellness hubs to promote early identification and prevention; the justice sector, including adding more mobile crisis teams, and providing more training for police and corrections staff; housing supports for people who are homeless and face mental health and addictions issues; and continued support for grassroots-driven solutions for communities with unique needs, including Indigenous communities and Francophones. Over time, future funding decisions will be informed by the core services framework, which will help identify gaps in care.  Implementing innovative solutions: As evidenced by the launch of Mindability, a new publicly-funded cognitive behavioural therapy program, Ontario recognizes there are gaps in care that require urgent attention. This program will increase access to care for Ontarians with anxiety and depression, the two most common mental health conditions. Additionally, in response to the recommendations made by the Ontario Autism Panel, the province will develop and pilot an integrated mental health training program in 2020 for autism service providers to adapt cognitive behavioural therapy for autism spectrum disorder child and youth clients.  Through the new Consumption and Treatment Services model, as well as other investments in the system, Ontario will continue to expand comprehensive, wrap-around addictions treatment services that save lives and connect Ontarians with treatment and rehabilitation services. Finally, through youth wellness hubs, Ontario will offer increased support for youths and young adults transitioning into adult mental health and addictions programs by providing increased care for clients aged 12 to 25.  Improving access: The province will ensure easier access to improved services. At maturity, any person living in Ontario will be able to call, text or go online to find services or get help by using one toll-free phone number, an easy-to-use website with an online chat option and/or regional access centres where screening, referral and service navigation supports are provided.   Ontario is also improving transitions between providers by better connecting health care providers and mental health and addiction services through Ontario Health Teams. To help Ontarians more easily identify and access core mental health and addictions services in their communities, health service providers will be given a new icon for use on websites and on storefronts when they meet certain service standards, as established by the Mental Health and Addictions Centre of Excellence. To monitor success, the Mental Health and Addictions Centre of Excellence will work with sector experts, service providers, people with lived experience, families, caregivers and clinical researchers to create a consistent set of evidence-based service and quality standards, building on the best practices that led to meaningful quality improvements to cancer treatment in the province. Similarly, Ontario will work collaboratively with the Mental Health and Additions Centre of Excellence and system partners, experts and clinical researchers to create a performance measurement framework to help drive system improvements. This data will guide future planning for the province and will support increased transparency and accountability.

Ontario Implementing Enhanced Measures to Safeguard Public from COVID-19
Although Risk in Ontario Remains Low, New Structure will Ensure Health System Readiness

March  2, 2020  2:20 P.M.

Ministry of Health


TORONTO — As the scope of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to increase internationally, Ontario is taking action to ensure the province's readiness to contain and respond to a range of outbreak scenarios. 
Today, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, announced Ontario is implementing an enhanced response structure that formally brings together a wide range of partners to review, strengthen and implement provincial and regional plans and ensure their responsiveness to the specifics of COVID-19.  ""Our local public health units, hospitals, emergency health services, nurses and primary care providers, among others, have been critical in managing the early phases of this new coronavirus,"" said Elliott. ""This new structure will tap into an even broader network of clinical expertise, experience and capacity across the health sector to ensure extensive plans are in place to quickly and effectively respond to any and every possible scenario."" The new response structure will comprise a number of tables with specific mandates:  A new Command Table will be the single point of oversight providing executive leadership and strategic direction to guide Ontario's response to COVID-19. The Command Table reports to the Minister of Health. The table will be chaired by the Deputy Minister of Health, Helen Angus, and include Dr. David Williams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Heath; Matthew Anderson, Ontario Health's President and Chief Executive Officer; with representation from Public Health Ontario, the Ministry of Long-Term Care and Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development.Five regional planning and implementation tables, led by Ontario Health with support from local public health units, will be responsible for reviewing regional plans to proactively ensure local readiness and implementing provincial strategies in areas such as assessment, testing and care, supplies and equipment, surveillance and communications. The Ministry's Emergency Operations Centre, also known as MEOC, will continue to provide situational awareness and perform an overall coordination function among the components of the response structure.A Scientific Table, led by Public Health Ontario, will support the provincial and regional components of the response structure with the provision of evidence, and scientific and technical advice to inform planning and response.An Ethics Table, led by the University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics, will assist in providing ethical guidance and representation at both provincial and regional tables to support decision-making throughout the response.Sector or Issues Specific Tables, which would have a specific focus like supporting the coordination of repatriated Canadians or local case and contact management as well as sector-specific coordination such as paramedic services, First Nations health partners and others as needed.A Collaboration Table with members from key health sector organizations which will provide advice to the Command Table. This new response structure will build on the definitive steps that Ontario has already taken to address COVID-19, including:  Designating novel coronavirus as a disease reportable under Ontario's public health legislation to strengthen the province's ability to detect, monitor and contain potential cases; Creating a dedicated web page, with links and resources, to help Ontarians learn how to protect themselves, what to do if they are sick after they travel and how to recognize possible symptoms;Developing guidance for the health system to guide actions during the initial stages of the containment phase; and,Deploying Ontario's Emergency Medical Assistance Team to support repatriation efforts at CFB Trenton and the NAV Centre.""Although the risk to Ontarians remains low, it is important that we take decisive steps to prepare for any scenario as this is a quickly evolving situation globally,"" said Elliott. ""As we enter this next phase of preparedness, every Ontarian should have full confidence that these efforts by our dedicated public health professionals and health care leaders will continue to keep them safe.""

Moving Forward with Road Access to the Ring of Fire
Ontario and First Nations Working Together to Create Jobs and Prosperity for the North

March  2, 2020 12:30 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Government of Ontario, Marten Falls First Nation and Webequie First Nation are taking a major step forward in unlocking jobs and opportunity in Northern Ontario's Ring of Fire region by entering into a historic agreement to advance the planning and development of a proposed Northern Road Link. 
Premier Doug Ford and Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines and Minister of Indigenous Affairs, were joined by Chief Bruce Achneepineskum of Marten Falls First Nation and Chief Cornelius Wabasse of Webequie First Nation at the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) convention today for a signing ceremony. The government is delivering on its promise to move forward with the development of the Ring of Fire with willing partners, including Indigenous groups and Northern communities. ""After 15 years of delay by the previous government, we said we would build a road to the Ring of Fire, and we are working with our incredible partners in the Marten Falls First Nation and Webequie First Nation to do just that and make sure we do it right,"" said Premier Ford. ""Together, we can bring jobs and prosperity to communities across the Far North. Promises made, promises kept."" Today's signing marks a new partnership between the government, Marten Falls First Nation and Webequie First Nation to advance planning of critical road infrastructure that would provide reliable, all-season road access to potential mine sites and connect First Nation communities to Ontario's provincial highway network. ""Our government is proud to partner with Marten Falls and Webequie First Nations to support the development of reliable, all-season road infrastructure and move forward with our shared goal of bringing economic prosperity to the region,"" said Minister Rickford. ""Together, with First Nations partners, we are creating a clear path forward to unlock unprecedented social and economic prosperity in the Far North."" The all-season road project would also improve access to health and social services and put in place improved infrastructure, such as high-speed Internet and reliable cellular service, for the First Nations and other communities nearby. ""We look forward to working together with Ontario to ensure the sustainable development of our ancestral territories,"" said Chief Bruce Achneepineskum, Marten Falls First Nation. ""Marten Falls First Nation takes seriously our right to make decisions for the betterment of our community. We are moving ahead with this agreement so all communities in the region can connect to the next phase, which is to secure and bring good-paying jobs in mining, construction and other skilled trades to our communities."" ""Webequie First Nation supports responsible development in our territory,"" said Chief Cornelius Wabasse, Webequie First Nation. ""We have been working together with Ontario for many years to reach this point. We believe that road development will help bring prosperity to communities across the region and better infrastructure - both on and off-reserve. We understand that road development will impact our traditional territories but believe this is a positive step forward to unlocking new opportunities that will benefit all surrounding First Nation communities.""

Quick Facts

The Northern Road Link would connect to the proposed Marten Falls Community Access Road at the south end and to the proposed Webequie Supply Road at the north end.
The agreement outlines Ontario’s support for respective First Nations to advance environmental assessments for their all-season road projects and to initiate the planning and development of the proposed Northern Road Link. 
Both First Nations are firm in their resolve to meet all regulatory requirements and fulfil their role as environmental stewards. The use of traditional knowledge will guide business and environmental decision making. Ontario continues to be committed to meeting its duty to consult for all road infrastructure development.
Current estimates on the Ring of Fire, located approximately 500 kilometres northeast of Thunder Bay and covering about 5,000 square kilometres, suggest multi-generational potential for chromite production, as well as production of nickel, copper and platinum.
In October 2019, Ontario announced an investment of $30 million in the Matawa broadband project to provide modern and scalable telecommunication services to five Matawa-member communities: Nibinamik, Neskantaga, Eabametoong, Marten Falls and Webequie First Nations
Modern broadband infrastructure will provide these communities with improved access to social, health, education and training resources as well as support economic development opportunities, including Ring of Fire development.

Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development


Convicted: Great Northern Insulation (GNI), a Woodstock ON insulation company
Location of Workplace: Gravenhurst, ON. Description of Offence: Failing to take reasonable precautions in the circumstances for the protection of a worker from the hazard of being struck by a moving vehicle not adequately immobilized when installing tire chains contrary to section 25(2)(h) of the OHSA. Date of Offence: November 23, 2018. Date of Conviction: February 25, 2020. Penalty Imposed: Following a guilty plea, Justice of the Peace J. McMahon, sitting in Provincial Offences Court in Parry Sound fined the company $125,000. Crown Counsel: Tom Schneider. The court also imposed a 25-per-cent victim fine surcharge as required by the Provincial Offences Act. The surcharge is credited to a special provincial government fund to assist victims of crime. Background: The young worker (25 and younger) worked out of GNI's Gravenhurst location. On the morning of November 23, 2018,  the worker and a coworker had just left a work site in Magnetawan in their truck. The worker was driving.  They had left the worksite because there was no room to park their truck. They we're going to head to another job site.  They were in the process of turning around at an intersection in Magnetewan when the driving conditions convinced them to install tire chains as the road was very slippery. The workers were installing chains on the front driver side tire when the truck, which had not been properly immobilized,  started rolling and sliding forward and fatally ran the first worker over, before coming to a stop in a snowbank.

Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing


TORONTO — Ontario is investing up to $8.1 million to support projects that will help 115 small and rural municipalities find savings and improve services for their residents and businesses. Projects range from broad reviews that will look at a number of municipal services, to more targeted opportunities for savings such as energy audits and fleet services reviews.
""By making these investments we are helping small and rural municipalities find better ways to deliver important municipal services like roads, waste management and fire services,"" said Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. ""There is only one taxpayer. That's why we are helping to ensure every dollar is invested wisely and we are getting good value for money."" The Municipal Modernization Program funding will be used to conduct service delivery reviews. Some municipalities plan to conduct line-by-line reviews of their entire operating budgets, while others will look for ways to lower costs and improve services in specific areas, such as road maintenance or information technology services. For example, the Municipality of Brockton will examine its municipal facilities, including energy and water use and space requirements, to identify ways to better meet community needs while saving money. Helping municipalities deliver better and more efficient services supports our government's commitments to make government services smarter and make life more affordable. QUICK FACTSOntario is also investing up to:$3.9 million to help 42 municipalities streamline their local housing and commercial development approvals processes.$2.6 million for 27 joint projects that will help approximately 130 small and rural municipalities improve services for residents and businesses and lower costs in the longer term.Up to $125 million is available through 2022-23 through the Municipal Modernization Program to help small and rural municipalities lower costs and improve services."

KINGSTON - Ontario is supporting Canada's national men's curling championship with investments that boost tourism in Kingston and provide athletes a chance to compete close to home.  
Lisa MacLeod, Minister of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries, attended the opening ceremonies of the 2020 Tim Hortons Brier to cheer on Ontario's athletes. The province provided more than $282,000 in funding to support the entertainment at the Brier Patch, where curling fans can come together between events and enjoy live performances every day of the eight-day competition. ""Ontario offers the world in one province, and large festivals and events like the Brier allow athletes and visitors to experience all Ontario has to offer,"" said Minister MacLeod. ""Some of the best athletes come from Ontario and I'm proud that the Brier will showcase their talent to visitors from across Canada."" The 2020 Tim Hortons Brier will be held at the Leon's Centre in Kingston, Ontario from February 29 to March 8, 2020. The winning team will represent Canada at the 2020 World Men's Curling Championship in Glasgow, Scotland later this spring. ""We are pleased to again be working with the Ontario government and its Celebrate Ontario program, which will contribute to making the 2020 Tim Hortons Brier a success in Kingston,"" said Katherine Henderson, Chief Executive Officer of Curling Canada. ""We've seen endless examples of how Curling Canada Season of Champions events such as the Tim Hortons Brier benefit their host communities and provinces, and it's gratifying to see that the government shares that vision and belief.""

Quick Facts

This funding was provided through the Celebrate Ontario program’s Blockbuster fund. Blockbuster funding supports municipalities and organizations in Ontario to host large-scale, high-impact one-time events that do not recur annually or biennially in Ontario. 
In 2019, the government invested more than $17 million in over 270 festivals and events in communities across the province through the Celebrate Ontario program.
Every year, festivals and events support tens of thousands of jobs in Ontario and generate millions of dollars in revenue.
According to past recipients of Celebrate Ontario funding, every $1 of provincial funding results in almost $21 of visitor spending.

February 28, 2020  3:45 P.M.

Ministry of Colleges and Universities


Brantford — Ontario is putting students first by investing in Indigenous students and their potential with increased funding to Indigenous Institutes to provide postsecondary education and training for hundreds of learners.
Today, David Piccini, Parliamentary Assistant, Ministry of Colleges and Universities was at Six Nations Polytechnic to announce that the government is increasing funding by $1.8 million this year to Indigenous Institutes in Ontario to help them provide high-quality education that responds to community and local labour market needs. ""Indigenous Institutes are a critical part of our public education system because they provide a culturally holistic learning environment that prepares learners for success in the workforce,"" said Minister Romano. ""By increasing support to Indigenous Institutes, we will help hundreds of Indigenous learners access the education and training they need to get good jobs and make Ontario open for business."" Indigenous Institutes are a pillar of Ontario's postsecondary education system. In partnership with publicly assisted colleges and universities, the Institutes offer a variety of provincially recognized postsecondary education programs. ""Indigenous Institutes like Six Nations Polytechnic are doing an excellent job preparing the next generation of talent to support the province's growing economy,"" said PA Piccini. ""So, in turn, our government is more than happy to support the important work they do."" ""Indigenous Institutes play a significant role in serving the learners, communities and regional areas in which they operate,"" said Rebecca Jamieson, President/CEO, Six Nations Polytechnic. ""Additional funding for our Institutes will undoubtedly help us to better support student success and provide greater access to educational opportunities.""

Quick Facts

Ontario supports nine Indigenous Institutes with operating funding to provide postsecondary education and training for more than 1,200 Indigenous learners. 
The government is providing $22.8 million in total operating funding to Indigenous Institutes in 2019-20.
Indigenous Institutes are Indigenous-governed and operated institutions that receive their mandate from Indigenous communities and provide postsecondary education and training to Indigenous learners. Indigenous Institutes currently partner with colleges and universities to offer degree, certificate, and diploma programs. 
Ontario is directing a greater proportion of the increased funding to Indigenous Institutes in northern communities to help them address the additional challenges and costs of travel, heating and snow removal.

Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines


OTTAWA - Following successful meetings with officials and nuclear industry leaders at the Canadian Nuclear Association's annual conference, Greg Rickford, Ontario Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines, issued the following statement:
""I would like to thank the Canadian Nuclear Association for hosting an exciting and productive conference. CNA2020 Nuclear Now: Achieving Our Clean Energy Future provided an important forum that showcased Ontario's nuclear advantage and continued important discussions about our commitment to develop small modular reactor (SMR) technology. This follows the December 2019 agreement between Ontario, New Brunswick and Saskatchewan to collaborate on the development and deployment of SMRs through a Memorandum of Understanding. I was pleased to join Dustin Duncan, Saskatchewan Minister of Environment, and senior officials from New Brunswick's Department of Energy and Resource Development, in a panel discussion providing provincial perspectives on SMRs. Ontario, in partnership with Saskatchewan and New Brunswick, is proud to lead the way on SMR development in Canada. SMRs have the potential to generate clean, low-cost and reliable energy and Ontario is fortunate to be home to a world-class nuclear industry to leverage as we lead the development of this innovative technology. Following productive conversations, Ontario Power Generation and Bruce Power will continue working closely with SaskPower and NB Power to develop a feasibility report and business case for SMR development and deployment in their provinces. This work will include identifying viable technologies for near-term and longer-term SMR deployment in the three provinces and providing a full market analysis for those technologies. I was also pleased to deliver the conference's closing remarks to reiterate the importance of nuclear power generation in our province. Nuclear energy serves as the backbone of our electricity system, providing more than 60 per cent of Ontario's power. Ontario's nuclear industry is also a major world supplier of medical isotopes that are used to sterilize medical equipment and treat diseases. Our nuclear industry, with its extensive expertise, technology and infrastructure, will support the development of next-generation technologies and the creation of new opportunities for growth and jobs. Ontario's robust nuclear supply chain and experienced nuclear workers are uniquely positioned to support SMR development and deployment in Ontario, Canada and globally.

Record-breaking Year for Ontario's Film and Television Industry
More than 340 productions help boost economy and create jobs for the province

February 28, 2020  2:00 P.M.

Ministry of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries


TORONTO — Ontario's film and television industry had a record-breaking year in 2019, with 343 productions bringing in $2.16 billion in production spending for the economy and supporting 44,540 full-time equivalent direct and spin-off jobs. This represents an increase in production by almost 15 per cent from 2018 and more than 7,500 new jobs for Ontarians. 
Lisa MacLeod, Minister of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries joined award-winning actress Wendy Crewson, award-winning director Sergio Navarretta, as well as industry leaders Jim Mirkopoulos (Cinespace Toronto), Justin Cutler (Ontario Creates), Theresa Tova (ACTRA), Peggy Kyriakidou and Jayson Mosek (UNIFOR), Angela Mastronardi and Monty Montgomerie (IATSE), and Michael Cerenzie and Jonathan Ahee (Stratagem Group) earlier this week to discuss the results. ""Ontario is open for business, open for jobs, and open to the film and television industry,"" said Minister MacLeod. ""These results show that we're building a business-friendly climate where production companies and production service companies can grow."" ""In 2020, we are continuing to work with Ontario Creates and the industry to ensure producers at home and around the globe know that there's no better place to create content than right here in Ontario,"" added MacLeod. Ontario is a leader in domestic film and television production, and is home to a booming foreign production sector. The economic and employment benefits of Ontario's vibrant film and television industry are felt across the province, with popular and critically acclaimed productions like Cardinal and Letterkenny produced in Northern Ontario; Hilda in Ottawa; and Workin' Moms, Kim's Convenience and Star Trek: Discovery in the Greater Toronto Area. The Umbrella Academy, Schitt's Creek and many others are filmed across Central and Southwestern Ontario. ""The government's commitment to growing Ontario's film and television industry means big business for Ontario and a globally competitive production scene,"" says Karen Thorne-Stone, President & CEO, Ontario Creates. ""Our suite of financial incentives, over 10,000 locations, world-class crews, diverse talent, award-winning post-production facilities, and expanding studio space are a huge draw for producers from Canada, the U.S. and around the world.""

Quick Facts

There was a healthy balance between domestic and foreign production in 2019, with $1.1 billion in foreign production and $1 billion in domestic production. 
Jobs created by film and TV production in the province include: technicians (such as lighting, make-up, carpenters, set designers, set dressers and wardrobe experts), production managers and coordinators, location managers, craft services, post-production experts, accountants, performers and drivers. 
Ontario offers tax credits to support film and television production. These incentives play an important role in increasing economic activity and job creation in Ontario while also enhancing the province’s cultural profile.
In February 2020, the government announced a Ministers’ Film and Television Advisory Panel which will provide evidence and advice to the government on industry trends, challenges and opportunities to grow high‐value film and television production in Ontario and maximize benefits for the province.

Bill 145 Will Update the Law For Real Estate Professionals In Today’s Market

February 28, 2020  1:30 P.M.

Ministry of Government and Consumer Services


TORONTO — Yesterday, the Trust in Real Estate Services Act, 2020 passed Third Reading in the Ontario legislature with unanimous support.

Ontario Protecting Children and Youth from Dangers of Vaping
Province Building Healthier and Safer Communities by Expanding Prevention Initiatives and Services to Help Quit Vaping

February 28, 2020  1:05 P.M.

Ministry of Health


TORONTO — Following extensive consultation, Ontario is taking further action to protect children and youth from the health risks of vaping, while maintaining adults' access to smoking cessation options.
 Today, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, announced that Ontario is proposing regulatory changes that, if approved, would limit where flavoured and high nicotine vapour products are sold at retail. At the same time, the province will expand prevention initiatives and services to quit vaping.  ""Young Ontarians are increasingly using and becoming addicted to nicotine vaping products, putting their health at risk,"" said Elliott. ""I've heard directly from concerned parents who grow more worried each and every day about the health of their kids. As a mother myself, I know there's a clear case for action to curb the alarming increase in youth vaping. That's why we are taking a balanced approach that protects our children and youth while also avoiding fuelling an underground market for unsafe vapour products."" Ontario has consulted with health care experts, industry partners, parents and youth to develop protective measures to help keep children and youth safe. The proposed changes include:  Increasing access to services to help people quit vaping by expanding Telehealth Ontario;Restricting the retail sale of flavoured vapour products to specialty vape stores and cannabis retail stores, which are restricted to people aged 19 and over, with the exception of menthol, mint and tobacco flavours;Restricting the retail sale of high nicotine vapour products (more than 20mg/ml) to specialty vape stores;Working with major online retailers of vapour products and stakeholders to ensure compliance with age-based sales restrictions for online sales;Requiring specialty vape stores to ensure that vapour product displays, and promotions are not visible from outside their stores;Enhancing mental health and addiction services and resources to include vaping and nicotine addiction; and Establishing a Youth Advisory Committee to provide advice on vaping issues. Ontario is also calling on the federal government to implement a national tax on vaping products.  ""Vaping and the associated risks are a national health concern,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. ""I have strongly advocated to the federal government to work with Ontario and other provinces and territories on a national approach to taxing vapour products. Keeping kids safe is a national health concern and the evidence is clear - a tax could be an effective way to deter young people from vaping."" A national vaping tax would minimize regulatory burden and ensure a consistent tax treatment across the country.  Ontario expects the proposed regulation changes, if approved, would come into effect on May 1, 2020, except for the regulatory amendment to restrict the retail sale of high nicotine vapour products, which the province expects would come into effect on July 1, 2020, if approved, to align with the federal changes to labelling of nicotine on products.

Quick Facts

These proposals are in addition to previous action to ban the promotion of vapour products in non-specialty stores, as well as a Minister’s Order requiring public hospitals in Ontario to report statistical, non-identifying information related to incidences of vaping-related severe pulmonary disease.
Evidence indicates there has been a 74 per cent increase in vaping among Canadian youth between the ages of 16 to 19 from 2017 to 2018 (Hammond et al, 2019).
In 2017, nearly 11 per cent of Ontario youth between grades 7 to 12 used e-cigarettes in the past year, with 19 per cent in grade 12 (Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey, 2017).
Experience suggests increasing costs could be an effective way to reduce vaping use by young people as they are more price-sensitive than other consumers. Higher prices would further deter those who have never smoked from trying these products in the first place, helping to reduce the risks of nicotine addiction and unknown long-term health effects.

Ontario Protecting Children and Youth from Vaping


February 28, 2020  1:05 P.M.

Ministry of Health


In response to increases in rates of vaping among youth, Ontario is taking further action to protect children and youth from the health risks of vaping. 
The next phase of Ontario's comprehensive approach to protect youth from vaping would address parental, public and health stakeholder concerns about youth access to vapour products. It includes seven key actions designed to reduce the prevalence of youth vaping.  The proposed actions include:   Increasing access to services to help people quit vaping through Telehealth Ontario. Telehealth Ontario will offer one number to call for counselling and referrals to community cessation services to help Ontarians of all ages easily access services to help quit vaping.  Restricting the retail sale of flavoured vapour products to specialty vape stores and cannabis retail stores. If approved, as of May 1, 2020, the retail sale of flavoured vapour products would only be available in specialty vape stores and cannabis retail stores, which are restricted to people aged 19 and over, with the exception of menthol, mint and tobacco flavours. Unflavoured vapour products and menthol, mint and tobacco flavoured vapour products would continue to be available at non-specialty stores such as convenience stores and gas stations. Cannabis retail stores would only sell cannabis vapour products.  In Ontario, specialty vape stores are required to register with their local board of health. Local boards of health are responsible for enforcing the Smoke-Free Ontario Act, 2017 and monitoring specialty vape store compliance with the act.  Restricting the retail sale of high nicotine vapour products (more than 20mg/ml) to specialty vape stores. Nicotine is highly addictive, especially for young people, and can cause adverse health effects. If approved, as of July 1, 2020, the sale of high nicotine vapour products (more than 20mg/ml) would only be available in specialty vape stores, which are restricted to people aged 19 and over. This timeline aligns with the federal requirement for labelling of nicotine on products. Vapour products with lower nicotine concentrations (under 20mg/ml) would continue to be available in all other allowable retail settings, such as convenience stores and gas stations.  Working with major online retailers of vapour products and stakeholders to ensure compliance with age-based sales restrictions for online sales. Under the Smoke-Free Ontario Act, 2017, it is illegal to sell or supply persons under the age of 19 years with vapour products, which also applies to online sales and deliveries. Ontario would work collaboratively with major courier companies and the vapour product industry to help ensure that products are only delivered to people aged 19 and over.    Requiring specialty vape stores to ensure that vapour product displays and promotions are not visible from outside their stores. Restricting the visibility of vaping products and promotions protects the public and vulnerable groups like children and youth from being exposed to these products. If approved, as of May 1, 2020, specialty vape stores would need to ensure that vapour product displays and promotions are not visible from outside their stores.  Enhancing mental health and addiction services and resources to include vaping and nicotine addiction. Many vapour products contain nicotine, which can cause addiction and physical dependence. Addiction to nicotine in youth can lead to prolonged use of cigarettes or vaping and has associated negative health impacts. Ontario will provide frontline providers such as schools, universities, colleges and health care providers with tools and resources to better support Ontario's youth struggling with vaping and nicotine addiction. This is part of the cross-government approach to build a better mental health and addictions system.   Establishing a Youth Advisory Committee to provide advice on vaping. If approved, the Youth Advisory Committee would provide advice on current and future vaping initiatives. A youth-informed approach will help ensure programs and policies are effective and impactful for youth. Ontario would include representation from existing youth networks such as Ontario Lung Association, Canadian Cancer Society and public health units. Ontario is also calling on the federal government to implement a national tax on vaping products. A national vaping tax would minimize regulatory burden and ensure a consistent tax treatment across the country. Recently Ontario strengthened vaping laws under the Smoke-Free Ontario Act, 2017 by banning the promotion of vapour products in non-specialty retail stores such as convenience stores and gas stations. As of January 1, 2020, the promotion of vapour products in retail establishments is only allowed in specialty vape stores and cannabis retail stores, which are restricted to people aged 19 and over. To better understand the emergence of vaping-related severe lung disease, a Minister's Order was issued in September 2019, requiring public hospitals in Ontario to report statistical, non-identifying information related to incidences of vaping-related severe pulmonary disease.  The potential long-term effects of vaping, including potential physical and mental health effects on youth, remain uncertain. Ontario will continue to monitor the current situation to identify solutions to protect the public from the potential dangers of vaping. The government will continue to work collaboratively with experts, parents, youth and stakeholders to build healthier and safer communities for our children and youth. Quotes: ""We are pleased to hear that candy- and dessert-flavoured vaping products will be removed from retail environments where they are sold alongside actual candy, soft drinks and other kid-friendly treats. While it is the flavours that entice kids, the nicotine is what hooks them. We are encouraged to see the Government of Ontario address both issues with these new regulations."" - Avril Goffredo, Executive Vice President, Ontario and Nunavut, Heart & Stroke ""We are very pleased at the steps the Government of Ontario is taking to protect the lungs of our youth from the harms of vaping. As we have seen, rates continue to rise and respiratory illness continues to take a toll on our future generation. Putting measures in place that will restrict access to vapour products is critical to safeguarding the lung health of our youth and ensuring they don't suffer the debilitating effects of lung disease."" - Peter Glazier, Vice President, Marketing, Development and Public Affairs, Lung Health Foundation  ""I applaud Minister Elliott's continuing determination to protect Ontario's kids from flavoured nicotine-based vaping products. Her recent retail vaping promotion ban, and now today's restrictions on high-nicotine and nearly all flavoured vaping products, both show the Minister clearly has the protection of Ontario kids' health at heart."" - Michael Perley, Director, Ontario Campaign for Action on Tobacco ""I applaud today's announcement by Health Minister Christine Elliott that will ban most flavoured vaping products and limit the levels of nicotine contained in products sold in gas stations and convenience stores. This is an important continuation of the work the government has been engaged in to address the critical issue of vaping in youth."" - Dr. Sohail Gandhi, President, Ontario Medical Association ""We support the new Ontario measures to restrict youth access to e-cigarettes with flavours and high nicotine levels, among other initiatives. The Canadian Cancer Society will continue to work with the government to build on this announcement and ensure that we don't see a new generation of young people addicted to nicotine through e-cigarettes."" - Helena Sonea, Senior Manager of Public Issues, Canadian Cancer Society ""Ontario's Registered Practical Nurses commend the government for taking steps to curb vaping among youth. With the long term health impacts of vaping still unclear, we are pleased to see the government taking a proactive approach to safeguard the health of Ontario youth, while at the same time preserving access for those adult Ontarians who have benefited from vaping as a smoking cessation tool."" - Dianne Martin, CEO, Registered Practical Nurses Association of Ontario (WeRPN)  ""Ontario's pharmacy professionals applaud the bold yet necessary stance on child and youth vaping taken today by Deputy Premier Christine Elliott and the Ontario government. It's the lives of our children and youth that are at stake - they have been exposed for far too long to targeted marketing campaigns and misinformation on the dangers of vaping and nicotine. As a mother myself, I am comforted in the knowledge that this government is taking steps to protect the health of my child and that of all Ontario children and youth. Limiting access to flavoured and high nicotine vaping products, increasing supports for those who want to quit vaping and bringing youth to the discussion table with the establishment of a Youth Advisory Committee, amongst the other initiatives being proposed, demonstrate the seriousness by which this government sees the issues of vaping. OPA was honoured to be part of the Minister's Roundtable on Youth Vaping in the fall of 2019 and offers its continued support in helping the government to build healthier and safer communities now and into the future."" - Jen Baker, Chair of the Ontario Pharmacists Association (OPA)

WHITBY — Ontario is continuing to work towards an inclusive and barrier-free province through its comprehensive accessibility framework, with four key areas:
Breaking down barriers in the built environmentGovernment leading by example in its role as a policy maker, service provider and employerIncreasing participation in the economy for people with disabilitiesImproving understanding and awareness about accessibilityToday, Raymond Cho, Minister for Seniors and Accessibility, announced the second area of focus under the Advancing Accessibility in Ontario framework - government leading by example - at the Abilities Centre in Whitby. This area demonstrates the government's commitment and leadership in improving accessibility in its role as a policy maker, service provider and employer. ""Our government is committed to protecting what matters most, and this means removing barriers in Ontario so we can empower people with disabilities,"" said Minister Cho. ""We are continuing to develop and enforce accessibility laws to help deliver critical services to Ontarians. It's crucial that we set a strong example of moving accessibility forward to make a positive difference in the daily lives of people with disabilities."" The government is taking leadership on this issue by applying an accessibility lens when evaluating capital project applications and spending public tax dollars. For example, while developing the provincial criteria for the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program (ICIP), the Ministry for Seniors and Accessibility worked closely with the Ministry of Infrastructure to establish accessibility as one of the four main objectives that applications will be evaluated on under the program's Community, Culture and Recreation stream. Projects will additionally be evaluated based on exceeding minimum standards; use of Universal Design Principles, accessible guidelines and innovative solutions to increasing accessibility. ""We are extremely pleased with the direction the Government of Ontario is taking with its Advancing Accessibility in Ontario framework,"" said Stuart McReynolds, President and Chief Executive Officer of Abilities Centre. ""We must all work together as partners to advance inclusion and accessibility throughout the province.""  As part of Ontario's work towards creating a more accessible and inclusive province today and for future generations, the government formed a dedicated Ministry for Seniors and Accessibility in June 2018.

Province Updates Land Use Planning Rules

February 28, 2020 11:30 A.M.

Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing


QUINTE WEST — Ontario is reducing red tape to help communities across the province build more homes for families and create a more competitive business environment. We are taking these steps to help fix the affordable housing crisis left by the previous government.
Today, Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, was in Quinte West to launch the new Provincial Policy Statement (PPS). The PPS sets the rules for land use planning in Ontario and guides decision-making to manage growth and development, while protecting the environment, public health and safety. Changes to the PPS were informed by feedback from municipalities, stakeholders and the public. The changes will: give municipalities greater flexibility and control over local decision-making to support new housing and economic developmentencourage more and different types of housinghelp ensure an adequate supply of land on which to build more housing.These changes will not impact the Greenbelt, ensuring that it will continue to be protected for future generations. ""We are making it easier for families to find homes that meet their needs and their budgets in vibrant, thriving communities,"" said Minister Clark. ""Over the past 15 years, home ownership and housing that is affordable have become out of reach for far too many people and our government is taking decisive steps to change that."" ""This new Provincial Policy Statement will give municipalities in Bay of Quinte and across Ontario flexible land use planning tools that will allow them to find the right mix of housing development and business opportunities,"" said Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services and Member of Provincial Parliament for Bay of Quinte. ""Our government has listened to our municipal partners. We will continue to work alongside them to develop an environment that fosters continued economic growth and prosperity."" The Provincial Policy Statement was updated following a 90-day consultation with municipalities and stakeholders including development and business, aggregates and resources, agriculture, environment and planning sectors, as well as the public. The government also undertook direct engagement with Indigenous communities. ""I am thankful for Minister Clark and the provincial government's continued engagement with municipalities.  It is evident that they are listening and giving us more flexibility and control over local decision-making to support new housing and economic development,"" said Jim Harrison, Mayor of Quinte West. In addition to updating the PPS, the government is continuing consultations on the new community benefits charge that will provide a new way for municipalities to fund community benefits, such as parks, daycares and affordable housing, making the costs of building homes more predictable and ensuring that growth continues to pay for growth. Feedback is due by March 30, 2020. ""As the collective voice of Ontario's public libraries, the Federation of Ontario Public Libraries (FOPL) applauds the Ontario Government's proposal to include public library capital costs as a fully cost-recoverable eligible service under the Development Charges Act,"" said Julie Merritt, Chair of the Federation of Ontario Public Libraries. ""We welcome the Ontario Government's unequivocal recognition of the role that public libraries perform as critical community infrastructure in municipalities of all sizes across the province, and the importance of ensuring that municipalities are able to collect the development charges needed to help maintain strong, sustainable public libraries for current and future residents alike.""

Quick Facts

As a part of More Homes, More Choice: Ontario’s Housing Supply Action Plan, the government committed to reviewing the PPS and the way municipalities collect funds for community benefits, such as parks, daycares and affordable housing, in growing communities.
Updates to the PPS align with A Place to Grow: Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, the Made-in-Ontario Environment Plan and recommendations from the province’s Special Advisor on Flooding. 
The Provincial Policy Statement, 2020 will come into effect on May 1, 2020.
In June 2019, Ontario launched over 140 days of consultation to gather input from municipalities, builders and the public on the new approach to funding community services. The first round of consultations on the community benefits charge also included technical working groups with municipalities and home builders.

Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing


The Provincial Policy Statement (PPS) establishes province-wide standards for how we use land and resources and guides decision-making on key land use issues across Ontario. These initiatives will help Ontario deal with the affordable housing crisis that has been created over the past 15 years.
The release of Provincial Policy Statement, 2020 is part of the government's plan to build healthier, safer communities, make life more affordable and create a more competitive business environment. It does this while continuing to protect the environment, including the Greenbelt, for future generations. The PPS, 2020 has new policies across five themes. 1. Increasing Housing Supply and Mix  Make more land available for housing to help people find homes close to where they work.Give clear direction to municipalities to plan for the right range and mix of housing to meet local needs.Give greater certainty to home builders to encourage more housing.Give municipalities greater flexibility and control over local planning decisions, including settlement area boundary expansions and rural residential development that is appropriate for the community.2.

Ministry for Seniors and Accessibility


Enhancing accessibility is a priority for the government. The province has elevated accessibility as a commitment by creating a dedicated Ministry for Seniors and Accessibility to work towards a more accessible and inclusive Ontario today and for future generations.
 Advancing Accessibility in Ontario is a cross-government framework that will help focus the government's work in four key areas: breaking down barriers in the built environmentgovernment leading by example in its role as a policy maker, service provider and employerincreasing participation in the economy for people with disabilities andimproving understanding and awareness about accessibilityThe government leading by example demonstrates Ontario's leadership in improving accessibility in its role as a policy maker, service provider and employer. In its role as a policy maker, the government is making significant progress in implementing the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA) and as an organization is leading the way by: Ensuring ministries are taking accessibility into account as a key consideration when developing policies.Addressing barriers in the health care sector, such as a greater need for sensitivity when communicating with people with disabilities, by resuming the Health Care Standards Development Committee to develop recommendations for proposed accessibility standards for hospitals in regulation under the AODA. This committee is comprised of people with disabilities, disability organizations and sector experts.  Making sure students with disabilities have the supports they need to transition from one school system to another by resuming the K-12 and Post-Secondary Education Standards Development Committees to provide recommendations on how to make the education sector more inclusive. These committees will develop recommendations for proposed accessibility standards in regulation under the AODA.Considering recommendations from the Information and Communications Standards Development Committee to assess how to make information and digital communications more accessible.Creating more inclusive learning environments by providing educators with accessibility training, lesson plans and resources through the TeachAble Project website. The site was created with funding from the government's EnAbling Change Program and gives people who work with students ways to create awareness about accessibility in the classroom.Providing clearer and more transparent processes for families requesting service animals accompany their children to school, no matter where they live in Ontario. As of January 1, 2020, Ontario school boards are required to implement their service animal policies. This support will help all students be successful.Providing organizations and the public with practical tips on how to be more accessible by delivering regular free webinars on various topics, such as accessible transit and creating accessible tourism experiences and customer service in Ontario.Improving accessibility as part of broader efforts being made with the federal government and other provinces.In its role as a service provider, the government is working to provide barrier-free services through initiatives including: Better serving transit users and commuters by investing in improvements to the GO transit experience as part of the GO Expansion program. Progress continues at the five remaining GO stations in the Greater Toronto Area that are not yet accessible, including installing ramps and platform elevators as needed.Continuing to improve accessibility on trails, beaches and provincial parks in Ontario by adding features like mobility mats to make it easier for everyone to use public spaces.Streamlining the Accessible Parking Permit process to reduce misuse while ensuring access by making it easier for people 80 years of age and older, Canadian veterans of any age and certain people with disabilities to apply for an accessible parking permit. Investing $1.07 million in 2019-20 to support Abilities Centre in Whitby to advance inclusion and accessibility for people of all ages and abilities. Initiatives include:researching social inclusion and social enterprisedeveloping a pre-employment skills programpiloting a 12-week pan-disability program for adults with disabilitiessupporting local private and non-profit sector organizations to develop inclusion and accessibility plansImproving community agencies across Ontario through the annual Partner Facility Renewal program, which includes an investment totalling $11.5 million that goes towards more than 350 upgrade and repair projects. This program includes an investment of more than $1.6 million for building repairs and upgrades at community agencies across northern Ontario so they can continue providing services to children and families. For example, a new elevator will be installed at Ontario Native Women's Association, helping to make the building more accessible.Continuing to help Ontario residents with long-term mobility disabilities remain in their homes and participate in their communities by funding the Home & Vehicle Modification Program, which is administered by March of Dimes Canada. With an annual investment of $10.6 million, this program reduces safety risks by approving grants up to $15,000 to make basic home and vehicle modifications.Addressing barriers in the digital environment to move towards a modern digital approach so that our accessibility resources, reports and publicly available data are easier to access. For example: We're making it easier for people who are blind to use Ontario GeoHub, a website that provides descriptive information about the characteristics, quality and context of Ontario's geospatial data. For this project, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry collaborated with the Canadian National Institute of the Blind, which led to helpful adjustments to the site that make it more user friendly for people with disabilities. The ministry will use these learnings to inform how it delivers digital services moving forward.In its role as an employer and as an organization, the government is working to establish a more inclusive employment culture in the OPS by: Supporting OPS employees - roughly 12 per cent of which self-identify as having a disability - and ministries to meet the requirements of the AODA and embed accessibility into internal activities through the Ontario Public Service Accessibility Office, which serves as an accessibility centre of excellence.Addressing systemic barriers and gaps through Deputy Ministers' committees within the OPS. These groups work on accessibility planning and implementation across government, as well as ensure accessibility is meaningfully reflected in government policies, programs and initiatives. This helps to improve access to government services for the public, which enhances health, employment and social inclusion.Using the OPS' annual Multi-Year Accessibility Plan Report to summarize the OPS' work to prevent and remove barriers to accessibility. The OPS also works to help foster a culture of inclusion both within the organization and across the province.Increasing opportunities for hands-on work experience and training in the OPS for youth with disabilities by expanding eligibility for the Ontario Internship Program. The criteria have recently changed so that students with disabilities that have graduated within the last five years - rather than two years - can now apply to the year-long program.Expanding the professional networks of youth with disabilities by connecting them with mentors across the OPS and broader public sector through Connexions, an annual session that helps post-secondary students and graduates with disabilities prepare for the job market by practicing job-seeking skills."

Ontario to Fill Judicial Vacancies Faster
Changes to Address Delays for People Waiting for their Day in Court

February 27, 2020 12:00 P.M.

Ministry of the Attorney General


Attorney General Doug Downey is proposing changes to fill judicial vacancies faster and more transparently to address delays for Ontarians waiting to resolve legal issues in front of a judge or justice of the peace.
Judges are currently selected through a recruitment process that can take over a year and allows judicial vacancies to languish and multiply. Typically, as few as two names are put forward at a time for the Attorney General's consideration, and candidates often have to reapply to be considered for the same vacancy that they just applied for. ""Judicial vacancies are sitting unfilled for far too long while people are left waiting for their day in court to resolve their legal matters,"" said Attorney General Doug Downey. ""After months of consultation with justice partners, I am proposing changes to allow more qualified candidates to be appointed faster. To be clear, the mandatory qualifications will not be compromised and Attorneys General would continue to only appoint recommended candidates."" While the current legislated qualifications to become a judge or justice of the peace would stay the same, proposed changes would provide the Attorney General with a larger, more diverse list of candidates. To help ensure Ontario's courts reflect the diverse communities of the province, the committees would be required to publish diversity statistics about candidates at each stage of the recruitment process. Changes will also be made to move the application process online. The proposed changes include:  Requiring the Judicial Appointments Advisory Committee to consider candidates already vetted for the same vacancy within the past year, rather than having to redo the entire application process. Increasing the minimum number of candidates the committee presents to the Attorney General from two to six to allow for a larger, more diverse list of candidates to be considered for appointment. Improving transparency around candidate diversity by requiring the committees to publish more detailed diversity statistics in their annual reports (the disclosure of this information would be voluntary during the application process). Allowing greater flexibility for the committee to consider additional selection criteria if it chooses to do so, such as technology literacy and awareness in victims rights. Changing the composition of the justices of the peace committee to make the committee leaner and more efficient while continuing to ensure local voices are present and that committees represent the diversity of the communities they serve. Expanding the role of the committees from solely providing recommendations to the Attorney General on appointments to now leveraging the committee's collective expertise to provide advice on the appointments process. Allowing the committees to hold meetings and interviews online, saving time and resources for both the committee and candidates. An online application system will also be introduced that would eliminate the need for candidates to submit approximately 200 paper pages by mail, as they are required to do now.  There would be no changes to the current mandatory qualifications set out in legislation and no changes to the existing rule that the Attorney General is not able to ask the committee to reconsider judicial or justice of the peace candidates who were not recommended. The Attorney General will not be able to appoint a candidate who was deemed not recommended by the respective committee. Quotes ""The Ontario Trial Lawyers Association thanks the Attorney General for his continued commitment to consult with interested legal organizations regarding issues of common concern with the justice system. We agree with the Minister that the list of judicial candidates he can consider for appointment should be expanded to a minimum of six, and we also agree that candidates who are classified 'recommended' or 'highly recommended' by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Committee for a particular vacancy should automatically form part of a pool of eligible candidates for appointment for a minimum of one year, without having to reapply. We appreciate that the Minister's proposal addresses the need to achieve diversity and efficiency of technology."" - Allen Wynperle, President, Ontario Trial Lawyers Association ""The Ontario Crown Attorneys' Association appreciates the Attorney General providing us with the opportunity to consult about the JAAC and JPAAC process. We support the movement towards increased transparency in the selection process."" - Tony Loparco, President, Ontario Crown Attorneys' Association ""The Ontario Paralegal Association anticipates these changes will fill vacancies faster, produce qualified candidates and provide more transparency for candidates and the general public. The OPA is happy to continue to work on these changes and future changes with the Attorney General to advance access to justice for all Ontarians."" - Colleen Wansborough, Vice President, Ontario Paralegal Association ""The County of Carleton Law Association appreciates the extensive consultations undertaken by the Attorney General towards improving the provincial judicial appointment process. We particularly value the candour and openness shown by the Attorney General and his staff in the collective effort to improve the efficiency and transparency of the process, while ensuring that the independence of the Ontario judiciary is maintained. The CCLA notes that some aspects of our feedback have been incorporated into the Attorney General's proposals and we hope that the dialogue can continue."" - Ted Mann, President, County of Carleton Law Association

Ontario's Current and Proposed Judicial Appointments Process


February 27, 2020 12:00 P.M.

Ministry of the Attorney General


Following extensive consultation with justice partners, Ontario is proposing changes to the appointments process for judges and justices of the peace to increase transparency and address delays for people waiting to resolve legal issues faster in front of a judge or justice of the peace.
Overview In Ontario, the Attorney General can recommend to the Lieutenant Governor in Council the appointment of judicial and justice of the peace candidates recommended by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Committee (JAAC) or the Justices of the Peace Appointments Advisory Committee (JPAAC). The two committees would continue to independently assess and provide recommended candidates to the Attorney General.   Candidate Qualifications and Selection Criteria  The current mandatory qualifications (e.g. education and number of years of experience required) for judicial and justice of the peace candidates are set out in legislation and will not change.  The JAAC and JPAAC would continue to establish and apply selection criteria to evaluate candidates. Under the proposed changes, the Attorney General would have the ability to recommend additional selection criteria such as an awareness of victims' issues. The JAAC and JPAAC may choose to accept the criteria recommended by the Attorney General. To ensure transparency, the committees would be required to make the recommended selection criteria public with the rest of the selection criteria established by the committee. Diversity Reporting  The JAAC and JPAAC are currently not required to share information about the diversity of candidates who apply for appointment. The proposed change would require the committees to publish diversity statistics in their publicly available annual report, which would include candidates' gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, cultural identity, disability and identification as an Indigenous person or a member of the Francophone community.  Diversity statistics would be collected and published to reflect various stages of the recruitment process (e.g. application and interview stage) as directed by the Attorney General. The disclosure of any diversity information by candidates would be voluntary.   Modernizing the Process The current process to apply to be a judge or justice of the peace requires candidates to send applications in the mail. The government will be working with both committees to move to an online application system. This would eliminate the need for candidates to print and mail hundreds of pages when applying for a vacancy, allowing candidates to quickly update their application with new information (e.g. if they want to be considered for a different vacancy by using a previously-filed application, within a two-year time period).  The proposed changes would also authorize the JAAC and JPAAC to hold interviews and conduct meetings electronically when appropriate. Committee Composition JAAC The current committee includes:  Two provincial judges appointed by the Chief Justice of the Ontario Court of Justice. Three lawyers (one appointed by the Law Society of Ontario, one appointed by the Ontario Bar Association and one appointed by the Federation of Ontario Law Associations). Seven people who are not a judge or lawyer appointed by the Attorney General. A member of the Ontario Judicial Council appointed by the Ontario Judicial Council.   The proposed changes would allow the Attorney General to appoint the three lawyer members from lists of recommended names provided by the Law Society of Ontario, the Ontario Bar Association and the Federation of Ontario Law Associations. JPAAC To improve efficiency, the proposed changes would reduce the Justices of the Peace Appointments Advisory Committee from 63 to 38 members. This would make the committee leaner and more efficient while continuing to ensure local voices are present and that committees represent the diversity of the communities they serve. The core committee currently has seven members including:   A judge of the Ontario Court of Justice appointed by the Chief Justice of the Ontario Court of Justice. A justice of the peace appointed by the Chief Justice of the Ontario Court of Justice. A justice of the peace appointed by the Chief Justice of the Ontario Court of Justice who is either the Senior Justice of the Peace Responsible for the Ontario Native Justice of the Peace Program or another justice of the peace familiar with aboriginal issues. Four people appointed by the Attorney General.  The revised core committee would have three members including:   A provincial judge or justice of the peace appointed by the Chief Justice of the Ontario Court of Justice. A justice of the peace appointed by the Chief Justice of the Ontario Court of Justice who is either the Senior Indigenous Justice of the Peace or another justice of the peace familiar with Indigenous issues.  One person appointed by the Attorney General.  There are currently up to eight members in each of the seven regions including:  The regional senior judge of the Ontario Court of Justice for the region or another judge of the Ontario Court of Justice from the same region. The regional senior justice of the peace for the region or, when he or she is not available to act as a member of the Advisory Committee, another justice of the peace from the same region. Up to five other people appointed by the Attorney General. A local lawyer appointed by the Attorney General from a list of three names submitted by the Law Society of Ontario.  The revised regional membership would be reduced to five people including:   The regional senior justice of the peace for the region.  A licensee (lawyer or paralegal) appointed by the Attorney General from a list of three names provided by the Law Society of Ontario. Up to three other people appointed by the Attorney General.  Members on both the JAAC and JPAAC would be prohibited from being appointed as a judge or justice of the peace, respectively, for three years following them sitting on the JAAC and JPAAC. Candidate Recommendations  JAAC The JAAC will continue to be required to present candidates for a judicial appointment to the Attorney General, and the minimum number of candidates on the list will increase from two to six. The Attorney General will only be able to appoint candidates who have been recommended and will not be able to ask for any candidates to be reclassified.  At the time of recommendation, the JAAC would also provide the Attorney General with a full list of candidates considered for that vacancy that the JAAC has classified as ""recommended"" or ""highly recommended."" The Attorney General would not be able to see the list of candidates who are ""not recommended.""  The Attorney General would continue to be able to reject the list of candidates and ask the committee to provide a new list. The new list would be pulled from the existing pool of ""recommended"" or ""highly recommended"" candidates.   The new application process would allow candidates to be automatically considered for future vacancies for the same court location/practice area for which they have already applied within one year prior, without having to reapply. JPAAC The JPAAC recruitment and selection process will be improved, making it faster and more efficient. The JPAAC will classify candidates as ""not recommended,"" ""recommended"" and ""highly recommended"" and provide that list to the Attorney General. The Attorney General would only be able to recommend the appointment of a justice of the peace who is classified as ""recommended"" or ""highly recommended"" by the JPAAC.

Ontario's Emergency Management System Made Stronger Following False Alarm at Pickering Nuclear Plant


February 27, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Ministry of the Solicitor General


TORONTO — Today, Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General, issued the following statement about the investigation into the emergency alert error:
""On the morning of January 12th, an emergency alert regarding the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station was sent across Ontario in error. Our government regrets the serious concern many people felt as a result of the alert. In response, I called for a thorough and timely investigation into the circumstances of the error. The investigation is now complete, and the report has been received and reviewed. A copy of the report and an action plan, addressing its findings, are available on the ministry website. As noted in the report, the Provincial Emergency Operations Centre performs routine testing of the public alerting system twice daily to ensure the alerting system is functional and available to issue an alert in the event of an emergency. On January 12th, one of these test messages was sent via the live public alerting system rather than the test system. The investigation concluded that while the immediate cause was human error, there were several systemic issues that contributed to both the false alert and the delay in issuing a cancellation. As I did on January 12th, I unreservedly apologize for the alarm and anxiety caused to people across the province and I want to assure the public that everything possible is being done to prevent a similar event in the future. Emergency Management Ontario has already taken significant corrective action in key areas, including planning, procedures, operations, communications and staff training. Ontario's emergency response experts and its network of front-line emergency responders are world class and stand ready to respond to emergencies on any scale. I am confident the actions taken to address the gaps brought to light by this investigation will make Ontario's emergency management system even stronger. Everyone contributes to a safe, secure and resilient Ontario and I encourage everyone to review their emergency plan and refresh their 72-hour emergency kit, so you are prepared in the event of an emergency. Get to know your community's emergency response plan as well. More information on preparations to keep your family safe in an emergency are available at Ontario.ca/beprepared.""

Ministry of Transportation


Today, the province took the next step to deliver on its commitment to improve safety on Highway 401 between Tilbury and London. Ontario is proceeding with an Expression of Interest to procure a contractor to widen and install concrete median barriers on the first 11 km of the project between Tilbury and Merlin Road in Chatham-Kent. This is part of the government's plan to build safer and better highways to get people and goods moving to support Ontario's economy and quality of life. 
""We are committed to making sure that our transportation system works for all Ontarians,"" said Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation. ""Ontario's roads are among the safest in North America - and our government intends to keep it that way.""  The project involves widening 11 km of Highway 401 from four to six lanes, a new storm sewer system, safety improvements, and the construction of the concrete median barrier. Building a concrete median barrier will help improve safety and reduce the likelihood of cross median collisions. ""People's safety on Ontario's roads and highways, especially on Highway 401, is one of our government's top priorities,"" said Jeff Yurek, MPP for Elgin-Middlesex-London. ""Our government continues to take real action on our commitment to widen and install concrete barriers on this dangerous stretch of highway to make our roads safer for drivers and get people where they want to go across southwestern Ontario faster.""

The province released its first regional transportation plan, Connecting the Southwest, to address the unique needs of the region and get people where they want to go, when they want to get there.

Quick Facts

Connecting the Southwest: A Draft Transportation Plan for Southwestern Ontario was released in January 2020. It includes real, practical improvements to connect people to places and ensure a seamless transit experience. 
Highway 401 is part of the Windsor/Sarnia–Quebec corridor, which includes two-thirds of the freight transported by commercial vehicles between Ontario and the United States.

STRATFORD—Strategic investments in public transit infrastructure support efficient, affordable and sustainable transportation services that help Stratford residents get to work, school and essential services on time and safely back home at the end of the day.
The Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities; Randy Pettapiece, MPP, Perth—Wellington on behalf of the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure; and his Worship Dan Mathieson, Mayor of the City of Stratford, today announced funding for 10 public transit infrastructure projects in the City. All of the projects will improve Stratford's public transit fleet and supporting infrastructure. Five new conventional buses and two mobility buses will replace the aging fleet, improving the accessibility, reliability and safety of the system for users.  An additional bus will be purchased to meet the City's growing demand for public transit. The bus routes will also see improvements with the installation of eight new accessible shelters. Stratford's transit fleet will be equipped with an automated voice and signage system on buses that will notify passengers when each stop is approaching. Transit users will also be able to track their bus locations using a real-time arrival smartphone application.  To encourage an increase in ridership on Sundays and improve access to public transit, the City of Stratford will pilot the design of new bus routes using an application-based, ""on-demand"" software. On Sundays, transit users will be able to request pick-up and drop-off locations at selected stops by using a smart phone app or by accessing the internet from their phone or a computer. Together, these investments will provide residents with a more accessible and reliable bus service.  The Government of Canada is investing over $1.6 million in these projects through the Public Transit Infrastructure Stream (PTIS) of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Ontario is providing approximately $1.4 million to the projects, while the City of Stratford is contributing more than $1 million.

Quick Facts

Through the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities. $28.7 billion of this funding is supporting public transit projects, including $5 billion available for investment through the Canada Infrastructure Bank.  More than $10.1 billion of this funding is supporting trade and transportation projects, including $5 billion available for investment through the Canada Infrastructure Bank.
The Government of Ontario is providing approximately $1.4 million to ten public transit projects in Stratford. 
To date, the Province has nominated more than 350 projects and continues to work closely with the federal government to secure approvals under this program.  Ontario has committed to investing $144 billion in infrastructure across the province over the ten years. Use the Ontario Builds map  to find projects in your community.

Ontario Combatting Bullying in Schools through Student Survey
New initiative aimed at improving student safety and wellbeing

February 26, 2020  9:30 A.M.

Ministry of Education


 TORONTO — Today, on Pink Shirt Day, Education Minister Stephen Lecce announced the launch of an online survey to hear from students, parents and guardians and school staff about their experiences with bullying in Ontario schools. 
According to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, 21% of Ontario students in Grades 7-12 have reported being bullied at school. This new survey seeks to gain a better understanding of the issue, ideas on how to better prevent and report bullying and new ways to make schools safer. ""Bullying is far too common in our playgrounds, schools and communities across Ontario,"" said Minister Lecce. ""That is why our government is taking decisive action to ensure every person regardless of their faith, heritage, orientation, race or income, is protected and respected. Every child deserves to learn in a safe and inclusive school, that is why we are empowering students to have a voice."" ""In order to prevent bullying in our schools, we need to be aware of what's happening at the classroom level,"" said MPP Christina Mitas. ""The online survey will help us better understand the ways in which bullying manifests in classroom settings. This will assist us in framing the problem and designing more effective programs - ones that will keep our children safe."" Students, parents and guardians and school staff are encouraged to participate in the survey, which is posted at https://www.ontario.ca/page/consultation-bullying-ontario-schools and Information for Parents/Guardians about Ontario's Survey on Bullying is also available online.  

Quick Facts

	In November 2019, the government announced five new initiatives to combat bullying in schools, including the student survey, as well as:

The assignment of Christina Mitas, MPP for Scarborough Centre and former teacher, to advise the Minister on education matters with a focus on bullying prevention;
Training for educators in anti-bullying and de-escalation techniques;
A review of school reporting practices on bullying; and
A review of the definition of bullying in ministry policies to ensure it reflects the realities of today.

The government has updated the Health and Physical Education curriculum for Grades 1 to 8 to now include mandatory learning about online safety in all grades, including learning about cyberbullying, cyber security and privacy. Students also learn how to build and support healthy relationships, and develop skills to identify, prevent, and resolve issues that may lead to bullying. Implementation of the updated curriculum began in September 2019.
The government has invested $3.18 million in the 2019-20 fiscal year towards various programs, partnerships and services that help to promote a positive school climate, support healthy relationships, build empathy and address bullying and cyberbullying.
In October, Ontario announced an investment of nearly $40 million in the 2019-20 fiscal year to advance student mental health in partnership with education groups. It also committed to permanently fund approximately 180 frontline mental health workers in secondary schools.
Ontario is investing $3.8 billion over 10 years to create new mental health and addictions services and expand existing programs.

New Plan to Modernize Home and Community Care in Ontario


February 25, 2020  2:08 P.M.

Ministry of Health


Ontario is modernizing home and community care services to enable the introduction of integrated and innovative models of care. Since its initial introduction, the Home Care and Community Services Act, 1994 and the delivery model it supports have not kept pace with a number of changing dynamics, including:
 An aging population; Changing client expectations on the different types of care;Increasing opportunities for care at home; andInnovation in technology and delivery options. At the same time, the act has created long-standing barriers that have restricted innovation in the delivery of home and community care, including:  Rigid care coordination: Decisions about patient care are often made away from frontline care.Siloed care: Patients often interact with home care separately from primary and hospital care, which often includes multiple assessments leading to delays in care. Restrictive care plans: Patients have care plans with a set number of hours or visits with service maximums that can curtail care. In response, Ontario is introducing the Connecting People to Home and Community Care Act and posting proposed new regulations under the Connecting Care Act, 2019 to bring an outdated system into the 21st century.      Current Framework   Proposed Framework      Requires all care coordination functions (intake, assessing and determining eligibility, care  planning, service allocation and case management) to be performed by an approved  agency.   Adaptable care  coordination functions that can  be embedded in frontline care within Ontario Health Teams, promoting  integration between sectors, reducing duplication and ensuring care is more responsive  to patient needs.     Places restrictions  on changing  care plans without formal re-assessments, limiting the ability to make  changes to care plans that meet patient needs.    Flexibility in care  planning requirements to support more  responsive care delivery based on patient outcomes.     Reinforces a per  hour/visit based approach to delivery of care.   More flexibility for  innovative models of care by supporting care to be provided virtually and  removing the emphasis on visit-based care.      Places restrictions on amount of services, reducing  capacity to care for certain clients.    No service maximums, enabling provision  of care to be based on identified needs and resources.        Provides limited clarity/oversight to enable new  settings and methods of delivering care.    An oversight model for  residential congregate services, which would support patients  with needs too high to be met at home - but do not require the intensive  level of care provided by a hospital or long-term care home.    At the same time, the new framework will maintain many elements, including the following:  Definition of home and community care services and eligibility criteria. Ability to fund Indigenous organizations directly through the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care Act. This will maintain the nation to nation relationship between the parties. Ability for approved organizations to deliver home care indirectly through contracts. Provisions regarding funding clients and families for self-directed care. Restrictions on client co-payments for services, to preserve the existing approach where only community services can have co-payments.Restrictions limiting the delivery of community services to non-profit corporations. Requirements for a complaints process. Right to appeal certain decisions to the Health Services Appeal and Review Board.Inclusion of home care in the jurisdiction of the Patient Ombudsman.The Bill of Rights for home and community care would continue in regulation, updated to reflect the realities of modern home and community care. If passed, the new legislation will:     Make it easier for people to access home and community care in hospital, primary care or community settings. Hospitals and primary care settings and others will be able to arrange home care directly for patients, instead of referring people to a separate home care organization. Doing so will reduce administration and transitions for patients.Help people connect with their care providers through secure video conferencing and remote monitoring devices. People with chronic conditions will be monitored at home, with a nurse checking in as needed. Nurses or therapists can use video conferencing to work with a personal support worker in the home to provide more specialized care.Provide more choice for people with high care needs to get care in new community settings. People will be discharged from hospital into a transitional care setting to gain strength and functionality to return home.Keep people healthier at home by empowering care teams to work together. Enabling frontline care providers to make more decisions about care, integrating home care into primary care and acute care, and breaking barriers to access to information will create teams that work together to support patients. About Home and Community Care Support Services  To ensure the ongoing stability of services while home and community care transitions into Ontario Health Teams, Local Health Integration Networks (LHINs) are being refocused into interim and transitional organizations with a singular mandate of delivering home and community care, as well as long-term care home placement. To reflect this focused mandate, they are being rebranded as Home and Community Care Support Services.  The province expects the transition to Home and Community Care Support Services to occur on April 1, 2020 and exist for the next few years as home and community care transitions into Ontario Health Teams and other points of care. It is anticipated that the non-home and community care functions of the LHINs will transfer to Ontario Health in the near future. During the transition, patients and caregivers will continue to access home and community care services in the same way and use the same contacts. To help promote continued patient familiarity with these services, Home and Community Care Support Services will maintain the same regional identifiers as existing LHINs (e.g., Erie St. Clair, Central, Champlain and North Simcoe Muskoka). Each of the Home and Community Care Support Services organizations will be governed by a common set of cross-appointed board members with a streamlined leadership team. Quotes: ""Home Care Ontario welcomes the government's move to modernize home and community care. Today's changes will allow patients to better access the right care, at the right time, and in the right place. These changes will make the system work more efficiently, and ultimately will allow local health teams to better work together to keep people healthier at home."" - Sue VanderBent, CEO of Home Care Ontario ""OCSA thanks the government for their collaborative approach towards modernizing home and community care legislation for all Ontarians. We look forward to seeing the details of the legislative and regulatory changes being proposed. We believe a system that works to ensure Ontarians can receive the services that they need with fewer barriers will successfully allow more people to live well at home."" - Deborah Simon, CEO of Ontario Community Support Association ""The proposed changes announced for home and community care in Ontario will provide personal support workers (PSW), patients and clients a new opportunity to work together to make Ontario Health Teams a success. Streamlining and modernizing the scheduling and funding process will offer Ontarians greater access to supports while also promoting continuity of care. The OPSWA hopes that these changes will work to stabilize and modernize the PSW profession."" - Miranda Ferrier, President of Ontario Personal Support Workers Association ""To deliver the care Ontario patients and their families deserve, providers from across the continuum need to work together seamlessly to provide the right care in the right place. Home and community care is a key part of the solution to hospital overcrowding and hallway medicine, especially as our population ages and grows. Modernizing the complex home and community care system requires increased flexibility and openness to innovation, and today's announcement is an important first step in that direction. We look forward to examining the legislation and its regulations in detail, and to working with the government and our health system partners to shape care as we evolve toward a better-integrated health care system in Ontario."" - Anthony Dale, President and CEO of the Ontario Hospital Association  ""Regardless of the comforts and programming we put in place in hospitals, we know that most patients don't want to be hospitalized; they want to recover at home with the right supports. Today's announcement will no doubt help make transition points safer, smoother and more coordinated for patients and families. I am looking forward to working in collaboration with Home and Community Care Support Services, our Ontario Health Team partners and patient and family representatives to coordinate home care services locally."" - Sarah Downey, President and CEO of Michael Garron Hospital ""On behalf of VON Canada, Ontario's longest-serving home and community care provider, I'd like to thank the Government of Ontario for recognizing the need to modernize the rules governing this vital component of health care delivery. They have listened to feedback, including the imperative to ensure that gaps in home and community care are addressed. We look forward to participating in the consultation process, with a focus on strengthening capacity in the home and community care system to better enable the delivery of patient-focused health care in Ontario. This is an important next step toward achieving the vision of the government's Ontario Health Team transformation initiative."" - Jo-Anne Poirier, President and CEO of VON Canada ""This is a really encouraging direction for home and community care in Ontario: the Guelph Family Health Team has advocated for a new model that better integrates home care with primary care. In our experience, people are better served when their care team members are enabled to work as a team. The coordination and delivery of home care needs to be better linked to the care provided by family doctors and other primary care providers. Modernization of Home and Community Care is foundational to enabling the Guelph and Area Ontario Health Team to deliver on our commitment to integrating health care in our community."" - Ross Kirkconnell, Executive Director of Guelph Family Health Team and Diabetes Care Guelph ""As a physician works with frail older adults, who often rely on publicly-funded home care to stay at home, the legislative changes being introduced today are long overdue and welcomed. By ensuring that the home care that Ontarians need can be delivered in a more flexible and integrated way, will ensure that the hundreds of thousands of Ontario families who depend on it can be better supported by a more responsive system that puts their needs first."" - Dr. Samir Sinha, Director of Geriatrics at Sinai Health System and University Health Network, Toronto

Ontario Modernizing Delivery of Home and Community Care
Province Building Healthier Communities through Ontario Health Teams 

February 25, 2020  2:08 P.M.

Ministry of Health


TORONTO — As part of the province's comprehensive plan to build healthier communities and end hallway health care, Ontario is modernizing the delivery of home and community care services by bringing an outdated system into the 21st century. 
Today, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, was at Michael Garron Hospital, a member of the East Toronto Health Partners Ontario Health Team, to announce Ontario's plan to enable integrated and innovative models of home and community care through the introduction of the Connecting People to Home and Community Care Act.  ""Today, patients receive home and community care based on outdated models first developed in the 1990s,"" said Elliott. ""We are breaking down long-standing barriers that have separated home care from primary care and, in doing so, allowing for the seamless coordination of services for patients, while maintaining and strengthening oversight and accountability measures."" If passed, the legislation will allow Ontario Health Teams to deliver more innovative models of home and community care. Patients will benefit from primary care, hospitals, home and community care and long-term care providers being able to collaborate directly to provide care that best meets individual care needs. Ontario Health Teams will work together to understand a patient's full health care history, directly connect them to the different types of care they need and help patients 24/7 in navigating the health care system.  To ensure the ongoing stability of services while home and community care transitions into Ontario Health Teams, Local Health Integration Networks (LHINs) will be refocused into interim and transitional organizations called Home and Community Care Support Services, to reflect their singular mandate of delivering home and community care, as well as long-term care home placement.  Ontario will be winding down LHINs in a phased way as home and community care services are transitioned to Ontario Health Teams over time. During the transition, patients and caregivers will continue to access home and community care services in the same way and use the same contacts. ""By moving home and community care out of administrative siloes and into Ontario Health Teams, patients will receive the home care they need as quickly and conveniently as possible, without having to tell their story over and over,"" said Elliott. ""As we make these thoughtful but long overdue changes, there will be no disruptions in patient care.""  Ontario has a comprehensive plan to end hallway health care, which includes making investments and advancing new initiatives across four pillars:   Prevention and health promotion: keeping patients as healthy as possible in their communities and out of hospitals. Providing the right care in the right place: when patients need care, ensure that they receive it in the most appropriate setting, not always the hospital. This includes expanding access to home and community care.Integration and improved patient flow: better integrate care providers to ensure patients spend less time waiting in hospitals when they are ready to be discharged. Ontario Health Teams will play a critical role in connecting care providers and, in doing so, helping to end hallway health care. Building capacity: build new hospital and long-term care beds while increasing community-based services across Ontario. 

Quick Facts

This year, Ontario is investing an additional $155 million more to expand frontline home and community care services. 
The ministry is also taking steps to expand the capacity of the home care workforce through client-partnered scheduling, an initiative that lets service providers schedule visits directly with home care clients to better match available personal support workers with client preferences.
Patients and caregivers can continue to access home and community care and long-term care placement services in the same ways, using the same contacts. For information and referrals, people can continue to call 310-2222 (English) or 310-2272 (French), no area code is required.

 Ontario Improving Moose Management Approach 
Changes will improve sustainability and fairness

February 25, 2020 11:00 A.M.

Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry


Today, John Yakabuski, Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry, announced Ontario is taking action to improve the system for moose harvest management and ensure a sustainable moose population.
""We're taking a smarter approach to moose harvest management to deliver on our commitment to make moose hunting fairer and more accessible while ensuring the sustainability of our moose population,"" said Minister Yakabuski. ""Our government recognizes the importance of moose hunting to Ontario families and communities, and we want to ensure Ontarians have opportunities to get outdoors and enjoy our natural resources today and long into the future."" The changes were informed through consultation with the Big Game and Management Advisory Committee (BGMAC) and include:  further restrictions on calf hunting so more calves have a better chance of reaching adulthood moving from a draw to a points-based system that will give preference to applicants who have been unsuccessful in getting a tag for the greatest number of years fee restructuring for licences and tags  Ontario will continue to conduct moose aerial inventory surveys in specific areas each winter, which will help estimate moose population status and trends to ensure continued sustainability of moose in the province. ""We know a healthy and sustainable moose population is critical to support continued hunting opportunities for generations to come,"" said Mike Harris, Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry. ""Decisions on moose hunting are based on what we know of the current population numbers to ensure sustainability across the province."" ""We are pleased to see the government moving forward with changes to Ontario's moose management program,"" said John Kaplanis, Chair of BGMAC. ""We feel the changes will strengthen moose harvest management in Ontario and provide latitude to adapt to the variety of challenges that are inherent in moose management. We look forward to continuing our work with the government and providing valuable advice to the Minister on the management of big game in Ontario.""

Quick Facts

Hunting contributes more than $560 million to Ontario’s economy annually and creates jobs in many rural and northern communities; moose hunting accounts for more than $205 million of that total.
BGMAC hosted seven listening sessions and heard from more than 600 interested hunters, members of Indigenous communities, the public, and organizations. In addition, over 2,000 individuals provided comments through a survey on hunting habits and options to address their concerns.

Improving Moose Management


February 25, 2020 11:00 A.M.

Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry


Ontario is taking action to ensure a sustainable moose population, while making moose harvest management and tag allocation fairer and more consistent for hunters.
2020 changes:  Calf harvest controls: Calf tag quotas will be implemented in Wildlife Management Units (WMUs) 37, 40, 41, 42 and 47. A hunter must apply for and receive a calf tag through the draw to hunt a calf in one of these WMUs.The hunting season for calf moose is being extended in all 9 WMUs with a calf tag quota (37, 40, 41, 42, 47, 48, 55A, 55B and 57). Calf tags issued through the tag draw will be valid for the full length of both the bow and gun seasons. New bow season and quotas:New bow hunting seasons and quotas have been created in WMUs 46, 47, 49, 50, 53, 54, 56, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62 and 63. The southern Ontario bow hunting season for moose will be seven days long and begin the first Saturday in October (WMUs 46-50, 53-63).Separate tag quotas for bow and gun are being created in WMUs 27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40, 41 and 42 where separate bow hunting seasons already exist. 2021 changes:  New selective harvest approach: Moose harvest will be managed with bull tags, cow/calf tags, and calf tags, with WMU-specific calf tag quotas across the province. A cow/calf tag could be used to harvest either a cow or a calf, a bull tag could only be used to harvest a bull moose, and a calf-specific tag could only be used to harvest a calf. Bull and cow/calf tags will be season-specific (i.e. bow or gun season), but calf tags could be used over the full length of the season within that WMU. Moose hunting licence: The moose hunting licence will change to a product that allows hunting of moose but does not come with a tag that would allow the harvest of a moose. The resident moose hunting licence fee will be reduced to $35. A hunter can purchase a moose hunting licence to party hunt with another tag holder but won't be required to purchase a moose hunting licence to apply for a tag. Preference point system for distributing tags:  A new point-based moose tag allocation approach will be implemented. The current moose tag draw will be replaced with a new point-based process. A detailed description of the process will be available later in 2020 at Ontario.ca/moose. Hunters will apply to the moose tag allocation process with a $15 application fee.A hunter's draw history will be used to determine the number of points they have accumulated (Note: this information will be made available to hunters later in 2020).Points will be awarded based on the total number of years a hunter has applied and been unsuccessful in the draw. Continuous applications aren't required. Being issued a bull or cow tag through the draw or receiving a tag transfer will reset a hunter's points to zero in that year.If hunters claim a tag they are awarded through the allocation process, they would be required to purchase a licence ($35) and their tag. Moose tags will be priced at $30 for calf tags, $150 for cow/calf tags and $200 for bull tags. These prices reflect hunter demand and ensure continued support for the management of this valuable resource. Non-residents will pay a higher moose licence fee and the same tag costs.  Elimination of special non-resident moose hunting opportunities:Non-resident landowners and immediate relatives of Ontario residents will only be able to acquire their own tag to hunt moose by purchasing a hunt from a tourist outfitter. A non-resident who is an immediate relative of an Ontario resident who holds a moose tag may purchase a non-resident moose hunting licence to party hunt with their relative. Southern Ontario Gun Hunting Season:Hunters have expressed concerns about the timing of the gun hunting season for moose in southern Ontario since it was changed in 2017. These concerns were reiterated during consultation on the Moose Management Review changes and since. With the implementation of calf tag quotas across the province, the season will be shifted back to its previous start, to begin the third Monday in October.

Ontario Confirms Presumptive Case of COVID-19
All Protocols Followed and Risk to Ontarians Remains Low

February 23, 2020  5:35 P.M.

Ministry of Health


TORONTO — Today, Dr. David Williams, Chief Medical Officer of Health, confirmed a new  presumptive positive case of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in Toronto. Ontario's first three cases are all resolved, with each of those patients having two consecutive negative tests at least 24 hours apart.
On February 21, an adult woman arrived to Canada from China and presented at North York General Hospital's emergency department at the advice of Telehealth Ontario with an intermittent cough that was improving.  As per established infection, prevention and control protocols, the patient was cared for at North York General Hospital using all appropriate precautions including being isolated and was tested for COVID-19. Being mildly ill, the woman was discharged home and, per protocols, went into self-isolation. Toronto Public Health was notified and has been following up with the patient since. The Public Health Ontario Laboratory confirmed today (February 23) that the laboratory testing for COVID-19 is presumptive positive, with the sample now having been sent to the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg for confirmation.  Given the individual's clinical assessment and history, there is a low risk that she was infectious. The individual followed all protocols and wore a mask throughout her travels back to Toronto and, since landing, the woman has had very limited exposure to other individuals. The province is coordinating with local public health units to ensure that passengers in close proximity to the woman on the plane are contacted and monitored. ""Because of all the proper protocols and procedures that are in place to contain this virus and exposure to others was limited, I want to assure the public that the risk to Ontarians remains low,"" said Dr. Williams. ""Protecting the health and well-being of individuals and families across the province remains our top priority and we continue to vigilantly monitor for and contain any and all new cases.""  Dr. David Williams and Dr. Barbara Yaffe, Associate Chief Medical Officer of Health, will be joined by Dr. Eileen de Villa, Medical Officer of Health for Toronto, to provide an update on the situation at a 9:00 a.m. briefing tomorrow (February 24) at the Queen's Park media studio.

TORONTO — Today, Premier Doug Ford, Solicitor General Sylvia Jones, and Jill Dunlop, Associate Minister of Children and Women's Issues, made the following statement in recognition of Human Trafficking Awareness Day:
""Today we have a valuable opportunity to raise awareness and continue the fight against human trafficking to protect children and women. This heinous crime robs victims of their dignity and safety, and has a devastating impact on their lives, their families and their communities. Human traffickers target the most vulnerable in our communities, predominantly young women and girls. Two-thirds of all human trafficking cases in Canada occur in Ontario and the average age of recruitment is 13 years old. Our government is committed to keeping children and women safe. We are building stronger, safer communities and providing police services with the resources they need to combat this horrible crime. As a result, we are investing $20 million annually to support survivors and to get tough on offenders with anti-human trafficking law enforcement initiatives. We've heard from survivors, law enforcement, Indigenous communities and frontline service providers. Their insights and perspectives are helping us develop a new province-wide anti-human trafficking strategy that we will launch in the coming weeks. As parents ourselves, ending human trafficking remains a top priority for our government as we work to keep communities and families safe. We will continue the fight against human trafficking, and work towards a day where everyone can live free from exploitation and violence.""

Days where students should have been in class preparing for math tests, practising for hockey games or music competitions, and learning the skills needed to succeed in their educational journey and beyond. While OSSTF demands a $1.5 billion increase in wages and benefits, we will advance the case for investment in our kids. I'd rather see us reduce classroom sizes or invest further in improving math performance, as opposed to spending over $600 million (sector-wide) on a hike to an already generous benefits plan. With over 80 cents to the dollar spent on compensation and over 60% increase in spending since 2003, taxpayers and parents rightfully expect more and better for our students. We agree.  We have always been ready to meet at the negotiating table to reach a deal that keeps students in class.""

TORONTO — Today, Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education, issued the following statement in response to tomorrow's strike action by the four teachers' unions (OSSTF, ETFO, OECTA, AEFO): 
""Your child should be in class; they should not be the casualty of union-led escalation. The focus of union leaders ought to be on negotiating a deal that keeps students in class. Our government will remain squarely focused on providing stability to students who face escalation by teacher unions far too often throughout their educational journey. We have demonstrated this focus on students during the negotiation process, by advancing educational priorities that matter: merit-based hiring, enhanced investments in student priorities and special education over union demands for more generous wages and benefits and committed - in writing - to protecting all-day kindergarten.  Parents are losing patience with the union-caused disruption in their lives, the inconsistency in their children's education, and the financial impact of scrambling for alternate care. That is why we will continue to stand with parents and offer financial assistance through the Support for Parents initiative, which is providing financial support directly in the pockets of working parents.  While union leaders are continuing to organize further disruption, our government remains focused on getting deals that ensure students are learning each and every day.""

Investing in Innovative Models to Build Healthier Communities and Help End Hallway Health Care

February 20, 2020  3:34 P.M.

Ministry of Health


TORONTO — As part of its comprehensive plan to end hallway health care, Ontario is expanding innovative and proven reactivation care models to help ease growing pressures on hospitals. Reactivation care models provide the right level of care for patients who no longer need to be in a hospital but are waiting to transition to home, community or long-term care.
Today, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, was joined by local caucus members at the North York General Hospital - Branson Ambulatory Care Centre, to announce Ontario is investing up to $1.5 million to support early planning to redevelop the facility to become a reactivation care centre. The proposed project would add up to 130 new transitional care beds to help patients across the Greater Toronto Area access the right care at the right place once hospital services are no longer needed. Upgrades to the Branson site are expected to be completed by Winter 2020-2021. ""Ontario is continuing to deliver on its plan to end hallway health care by expanding innovative patient-centred care models across the province like the Branson Site Reactivation Care Centre,"" said Elliott. ""The centre will support patients and their families in their health care journey by providing patients with appropriate therapy and rehabilitation care while they are waiting to transition back home, to the community or to long-term care homes."" These new beds will help ease hospital capacity pressures and allow health care providers to support patients in the most appropriate care setting suited for their individual needs. Patients at the reactivation care centre will benefit from activity and social interaction and be able to focus on restorative care to help improve their health outcomes. ""I am proud that our government took the opportunity to revitalize the Branson site,"" said Roman Baber, MPP for York Centre. ""This investment will provide much needed relief to the people of North Toronto, while leveraging an existing health care asset. Committing to a Reactivation Care Centre at Branson is an important step in ending hallway health care in Ontario."" ""This type of investment, in addition to the establishment of Ontario Health Teams, is putting the health care system on the right track to eliminating hallway health care and providing patients with timely, seamless care,"" says Dr. Joshua Tepper, President and CEO of North York General Hospital. ""We have first-hand experience with the reactivation care model and the benefits it provides patients and families, as well as to the overall health system."" Ontario has a comprehensive plan to end hallway health care, which includes making investments and advancing new initiatives across four pillars:  Prevention and health promotion: keeping patients as healthy as possible in their communities and out of hospitals.Providing the right care in the right place: when patients need care, ensure that they receive it in the most appropriate setting, not always the hospital. This includes expanding innovative and proven reactivation care spaces.Integration and improved patient flow: better integrate care providers to ensure patients spend less time waiting in hospitals when they are ready to be discharged. Building capacity: build new hospital and long-term care beds while increasing community-based services across Ontario, including this investment to upgrade the Branson site to bring more beds into operation.   

Quick Facts

This project is a part of Ontario’s investment of $27 billion over 10 years to build new and expanded hospital infrastructure.

The funding will allow participants to get their start in high-demand trades such as carpentry, welding, and drywall, acoustic and lathing application.   MPP Rickford also announced an additional investment of $250,000 for AETS through the Indigenous Economic Development Fund. This application-based funding will go towards preparing participants for apprenticeship opportunities in the construction and carpentry sectors. This includes job readiness training, level one construction/carpentry training and an eight-week placement.  ""Our government knows employers are looking for people ready to help fill vacancies in the Thunder Bay area,"" said MPP Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines and Indigenous Affairs. ""By funding projects like this, we're giving people in this community the chance to put their skills to work in good, permanent jobs.""   ""These apprenticeship training opportunities along with our partnerships, will provide First Nation citizens with the stepping stones to build skills and gain knowledge needed to realize their career goals,"" said John DeGiacomo, Executive Director of AETS.  Pre-apprenticeship training promotes careers in the trades for all Ontario residents. These programs are free, last up to one year and often combine classroom training with an eight to 12-week work placement.  On Thursday, MPP Rickford was at Supercom Industries to announce the province is investing close to $1.5 million through SkillsAdvance Ontario over the next three years. This funding will go towards training and upskilling 172 new and current Indigenous employees in heavy equipment operation, mechanical harvesting, AZ truck driving, tower assembly and construction.   Supercom Industries is partnering with Nextbridge Infrastructure to build and maintain the 450-kilometer East-West Tie Transmission Line being built outside of Thunder Bay. The Province's funding will help the six First Nations and the communities around the East-West Tie Line build a skilled labour force for this and future energy projects.  ""The East West Tie continues to bring economic and training opportunities to Thunder Bay and the surrounding region,"" said Rickford. ""I am proud to announce Ontario's support for Supercom and commend the hard work and dedication of all involved to get this project up and running, while seeing hundreds of local residents receive valuable skills training and education.""   ""This SkillsAdvance Ontario project will offer multiple training opportunities to job seekers, and re-skilling chances to the incumbent workers, consequently changing their and their families' lives, and overall positively impacting the economy and communities' well-being in Northern Ontario,"" said Cris Serban, President and CEO of Supercom Industries.  ""These projects are designed to help both businesses and job seekers in a region,"" said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""When you tailor a training curriculum around the needs of local employers and offer effective employment supports for the participating trainees, you can achieve outcomes that make a difference.""

Following the signing of Memoranda of Understanding with select utility companies, Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation issued the following statement:
""As a key step that supports the objectives of the Building Transit Faster Act, the Province of Ontario and Toronto Hydro, Hydro One and Enbridge, signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) to improve coordination as we move forward in implementing the four priority transit projects outlined in our New Subway Transit Plan for the Greater Toronto Area (GTA).  The MOUs with the Province reflect a shared commitment to work together to deliver transit faster for the people in the GTA by making it easier to find, move and reinstate utility infrastructure, such as structures and other works required for electricity and natural gas transmission and distribution.  Transit projects can be delayed if utilities are not relocated in coordination with the project schedule, leading to increased project costs. That is why improving utilities coordination to support on-time delivery was a key objective of our plan to deliver transit faster. Through these MOUs - and other collaborative partnerships, including that with the City of Toronto - we are making Premier Ford's plan for expanding Ontario's transportation network, reducing congestion, and connecting people to places and jobs a reality.""

Projects to Strengthen Provincially Licensed Abattoirs and Help Find New Markets for Beef

February 19, 2020  1:30 P.M.

Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs


TORONTO - The governments of Canada and Ontario are helping the province's beef sector grow and develop new markets by investing up to $2 million in projects that enhance operations at provincially licensed abattoirs.
Through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership (the Partnership), the governments are providing cost-share funding to provincially licensed abattoirs for a variety of projects to improve food safety, animal welfare and biosecurity measures at their operations. Examples of eligible projects include: capital upgrades for enhanced food safety, improvements in the safe handling and housing of animals, and new equipment for safe and efficient animal-hides disposal. The governments are also investing up to $292,600 under the Places to Grow initiative to help the Beef Farmers of Ontario with marketing efforts to access emerging markets in Vietnam, Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines and the European Union. The cost-shared project will encourage export-market diversification and support efforts to increase volume and sales through trade missions, promotional events and the development of new brands.  ""These investments will help the beef industry continue to meet the growing consumer demand for our safe, high-quality beef products,"" said the Honourable Marie-Claude Bibeau, federal Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. ""With these business improvements to Ontario's provincially-licenced abattoirs, along with our efforts to diversify into new markets, we are ensuring our sector is competitive at home and around the world."" ""By making these investments, our government will strengthen and grow provincially licensed abattoirs while further improving on our already high food safety standards,"" said the Honourable Ernie Hardeman, Ontario Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. ""We're also working with the province's beef industry in seeking out new markets, which will help secure future economic growth opportunities for Ontario's beef farmers. Looking to diversify and build new markets is an important step to ensure the success of the industry."" ""Meat & Poultry Ontario would like to thank both the federal and provincial governments for their continued support of the 123 provincially inspected abattoir family businesses,"" said Carol Goriup, president of Meat & Poultry Ontario. ""Today's announcement of funding couldn't have come at a better time. Abattoirs are the lynchpin of our local food system, and this critical investment will enable improved efficiencies and expanded capacities, ultimately helping farmers grow."" ""Beef Farmers of Ontario welcomes the announcement of Canadian Agricultural Partnership funding for provincial abattoirs, which are an integral part of Ontario's beef industry,"" said Joe Hill, president of Beef Farmers of Ontario. ""This funding comes at a time of critical challenges in the beef industry due to shortages in beef processing capacity. Support for abattoirs will help enable investment in equipment and infrastructure that assists businesses in remaining competitive and adapting to market-driven demands."" Since June 2018, both the federal and provincial governments have committed cost-share support to approximately 2,500 projects through the Partnership, to help eligible Ontario farmers, processors, businesses and sector organizations innovate and grow.

Quick Facts

This cost-share intake for abattoirs opens on February 19, 2020 and applications will be accepted until April 30, 2020, as long as funding for the initiative is available. Eligible projects must be completed on or before December 31, 2020.

This programming adds to several recent initiatives Ontario has undertaken to support growth in the province’s meat sector such as its work to enhance antimicrobial controls at provincially licensed abattoirs. Input received from a new meat industry engagement panel was incorporated into the list of eligible projects.
The Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs delivers cost-share funding under the Partnership to food processors and other businesses, including animal health, commercialization and primary agri-food businesses.
Ontario’s beef industry contributes $2.69 billion to Ontario’s GDP annually from primary production, processing and retail.

February 19, 2020  9:00 A.M.

Ministry of Health


Ontario continues to make meaningful improvements to the province's mental health and addictions system so that all Ontarians can easily access high-quality mental health and addictions services.
Yesterday, with the proclamation of the Mental Health and Addictions Centre of Excellence Act, the new Mental Health and Addictions Centre of Excellence has been formally established within Ontario Health. This new centre will serve as the foundation on which the province will build a comprehensive and connected mental health and addictions system. ""For the past year, we've been travelling the province to hear about the changes Ontarians expect to see in our mental health and addictions system,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""Serving as the foundation for Ontario's new mental health and addictions plan, which will be announced in the near future, the new Mental Health and Addictions Centre of Excellence will have a key role in improving the availability and quality of mental health and addictions services for all Ontarians, where and when they need them."" The Mental Health and Addictions Centre of Excellence will for the first time in Ontario's history drive the broad, systemic transformation necessary to enable real and significant improvements to the quality and availability of services. The centre will do so by:   Acting as a central point of oversight for mental health and addictions care;Being responsible for standardizing and monitoring the quality and delivery of evidence-based services and clinical care, to provide a better and more consistent patient experience in communities across the province;Working together with sector experts, community-based providers, people with lived experience, families, caregivers and clinical researchers to create a consistent set of services and standards; andProviding support and resources to Ontario Health Teams as they help patients navigate the system and connect patients to the mental health and addictions services they need. The Mental Health and Addictions Centre of Excellence will play a critical role to help standardize and organize the mental health and addictions sector by providing the tools, data, performance indicators and common infrastructure to disseminate evidence and set service expectations. This will support the implementation of the new mental health and addictions roadmap and the province's cross-government approach to meaningfully improve the care and services provided to Ontarians. ""With more than one million people in Ontario experiencing a mental health or addictions challenge every year, our government knows how important it is to fulfill our promise of making mental health and addictions a priority,"" said Michael Tibollo, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. ""By establishing a new Mental Health and Addictions Centre of Excellence, we're continuing to move in the right direction toward building a comprehensive and connected system of services that works for all Ontarians.""   ""We are extremely excited to have the new Mental Health and Addictions Centre of Excellence as a part of Ontario Health,"" said Matthew Anderson, President and CEO, Ontario Health. ""We look forward to adapting what we know has worked to improve care for cancer and cardiac patients. In partnership with the many committed professionals working on the frontline, we can set evidence-based provincial standards to improve access and outcomes, establish routine reporting on how well the system is performing, and foster strong clinical leadership to champion targeted improvements for patients and their families."" Ontario has a comprehensive plan to end hallway health care, which includes making investments and advancing new initiatives across four pillars:  Prevention and health promotion: keeping patients as healthy as possible in their communities and out of hospitals, including increasing access to early-intervention mental health and addictions services.Providing the right care in the right place: when patients need care, ensure that they receive it in the most appropriate setting, not always the hospital. This includes expanding community-based mental health and addictions services to alleviate pressures on hospital emergency departments.   Integration and improved patient flow: better integrate care providers to ensure patients spend less time waiting in hospitals when they are ready to be discharged. Building capacity: build new hospital and long-term care beds while increasing community-based services across Ontario, including expanding community-based mental health and addictions services.

""It will not only generate years of employment, it will allow us to better connect a world-class city and develop transit-oriented communities."" The Building Transit Faster Act would provide the province with the tools to expedite the planning, design and construction process that has delayed major projects in the past. If passed, the legislation would remove roadblocks and give the Province the ability needed to deliver projects faster by:  Relocating utilities more efficiently while treating businesses fairly, and ensuring costs are not passed on to consumers; Ensuring the assembly of land required to construct stations, conduct tunneling and prepare sites, while treating property owners fairly; Ensuring timely access to municipal services and rights-of-way; Allowing Ontario to inspect and remove physical barriers with appropriate notification to property owners; Ensuring nearby developments or construction projects are coordinated so they do not delay the four priority subway projects.  The projects include the all-new Ontario Line, the Yonge North Subway Extension, the three-stop Scarborough Subway Extension, and the Eglinton Crosstown West Extension, and will address the increasing demand for safe and reliable transportation options. ""Not only will this proposed legislation get people riding the trains earlier, but it will ensure that the province is best positioned to attract new business and keep our best and brightest here in Ontario,"" said Kinga Surma, Associate Minister of Transportation (GTA). Ontario remains committed to partnering with the City of Toronto to remove roadblocks, engaging with local residents and businesses on each project, and consulting with Indigenous communities to ensure Aboriginal and treaty rights and interests are considered in the decision-making process.  The proposed changes support the government's commitment to making public transit an attractive, affordable and low-stress alternative to get people where they want to go, when they want to get there.

Quick Facts

In April 2019, the province announced its historic new transportation vision, with an estimated cost of $28.5 billion. This includes four priority transit projects: the all-new Ontario Line; a three-stop Scarborough Subway Extension; the Yonge North Subway Extension; and the Eglinton Crosstown West Extension.
In June 2019, the Getting Ontario Moving Act was enacted to enable provincial ownership of the subway extensions and new lines envisioned in Ontario’s new subway transit plan for the Greater Toronto Area (GTA).
The proposed legislation includes steps to make the relocation of utilities, such as gas or electrical, more efficient by requiring their infrastructure to be moved within a set timeframe and introduces a structured and consistent process for engaging and coordinating work.

Here's what industry partners are saying about the proposed Building Transit Faster Act, legislation that will help deliver Ontario's four priority subway projects on-time and on-budget, ensuring that people and businesses get the transit they need sooner.
""We are committed to delivering transit as efficiently and effectively as possible so we can get more people moving sooner. It will be important to work closely with our city partners in order to minimize the disruption and inconvenience for residents along these lines."" Phil Verster, President and CEO, Metrolinx ""We look forward to working with our public and private sector partners to deliver these priority transit projects efficiently and responsibly. Streamlining processes that lead to frequent delays will help reduce risk, control costs, and accelerate the delivery of new transit projects."" Ehren Cory, President and CEO, Infrastructure Ontario ""Building transit more quickly is a key priority, not just for the business community but for residents as well. Clearing unnecessary roadblocks to ensure key transit projects are delivered on time and on budget is critical."" Jan De Silva, President and CEO, Toronto Region Board of Trade ""LiUNA supports the accelerated transit proposal that will help expedite the much-needed transit infrastructure on time, on schedule and on budget. Cost certainty is essential to create confidence in the market which will translate into needed construction jobs for our workers."" Anthony Primerano, Director of Government Relations, LiUNA ""I am encouraged by the Provincial Government's move to streamline processes to build critical infrastructure and ensure priority transit projects like Yonge North Subway Extension are built on time, eliminating unnecessary and costly delays."" Mayor Frank Scarpitti, City of Markham

The Building Transit Faster Act


February 18, 2020  4:10 P.M.

Ministry of Transportation


The Building Transit Faster Act targets steps in the planning, design and construction process that have unnecessarily delayed major projects in the past. If passed, the legislation would remove roadblocks and give the Province the tools needed for Metrolinx and Infrastructure Ontario to deliver the following four priority transit projects faster within the committed timeframes:
 Ontario Line Subway with 15 stations, as early as 2027. The 15.5 km Ontario Line will run between Exhibition/Ontario Place through downtown Toronto to the Ontario Science Centre, bringing rapid transit to neighbourhoods such as Liberty Village and Flemingdon Park. It will help address dangerous overcrowding and provide needed relief on the TTC's Line 1 and Bloor-Yonge station. Scarborough Subway Extension with three stations, by 2029-30. The nearly 8 km extension of TTC's Line 2 (Bloor-Danforth), from the existing Kennedy Station northeast to McCowan Road/Sheppard Avenue, will improve transit access to the residents of Scarborough. Yonge North Subway Extension with approximately five stations, by 2029-30. The 7.4 km extension of TTC's Line 1 (Yonge-University) will connect north from Finch Station to Highway 7, connecting Toronto and Richmond Hill. Eglinton Crosstown West Extension with multiple stops along the Eglinton West corridor, by 2030-31. The western extension of the Eglinton Crosstown LRT (future Line 5) will increase connectivity along Eglinton Avenue from the future Mount Dennis station to Renforth Drive. Ultimately, through future phases of this project, the Province is committed to establishing connectivity with Pearson International Airport.  The Act would help get transit built faster by:   Relocating utilities more efficiently while treating businesses fairly, and ensuring costs are not passed on to consumers.  Allow for Metrolinx to require a utility company to relocate its infrastructure within a prescribed timeframe. Introduce a clear process for managing disputes and allow Metrolinx to seek compensation from a utility company if timelines are not met. This is similar to the process used for highway projects. Amendments to the Ontario Energy Board Act, 1998 would prohibit the Ontario Energy Board from allowing provincially regulated utilities (electricity and natural gas) to pass compensation costs incurred from delays on to ratepayers.    Ensuring Ontario has easier access to the land required to construct transit projects, while still treating property owners fairly.  Currently, redundant steps require Ontario to repeatedly demonstrate the need for land related to infrastructure projects one at a time. This would remove Hearings of Necessity for any property related to the four priority transit projects and avoid unnecessary delays. The province would continue to treat people fairly and compensate people whose properties are required. For municipal properties needed, municipalities will be given reasonable time limits for internal review to help keep the process on schedule.    Ensuring timely access to municipal services and rights-of-way.  Ontario will continue to work closely with municipalities, including the City of Toronto to negotiate and secure permits. In cases where an agreement cannot be reached, the Minister of Transportation could use a new legislative provision to issue an order that outlines the terms and conditions under which Metrolinx could use or modify a municipal road or service, if needed. Ontario will remain committed to working in partnership with municipalities and reducing the disruption to local communities as much as possible throughout the construction process.    Allowing Ontario to inspect and remove physical barriers, such as trees, without permission from property owners but with appropriate notification.  Anyone entering private property would be required to provide notice, abide by time of day restrictions, and show identification. Similar provisions exist for highway projects.    Ensuring nearby developments or construction projects do not interfere with or delay the four priority subway projects.  A permit would be required to construct or change any building, structure, road, underground utility infrastructure, as well as to perform any dewatering or excavation near a subway corridor. This would apply to new and some existing developments. For existing approved developments that are identified as potential conflicts, there must be at least six months of negotiation before a permit decision can be imposed. This would give Ontario the ability to coordinate activities in and around the subway corridors and stations, and manage the timing of construction activities to prioritize the subway projects.

Province Kicks Off Ontario Heritage Week
Government continuing to support and conserve Ontario’s history through investments in community museums and heritage organizations

February 18, 2020  1:30 P.M.

Ministry of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries


TORONTO - The province is celebrating Ontario Heritage Week, highlighting the important history of local communities and the diverse heritage of Ontario. 
Lisa MacLeod, Minister of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries, was at the Ontario Heritage Trust today to kick off the week and highlight the government's more than $5-million investment in community museums and heritage organizations across the province. ""Community museums and heritage organizations support local tourism, community well-being and learning,"" said Minister MacLeod. ""They also contribute to a spectacular double bottom line — the financial bottom line of the province as well as the equally important bottom line of our cultural fabric and identity."" Through the Community Museum Operating Grant, 166 eligible community museums receive just over $4.8 million annually. The grant provides operating funding to community museums that may fund staff salaries, museum maintenance, building and preserving collections, exhibitions and educational programs. In addition, 176 heritage organizations receive a total of nearly $240,000 in funding through the Heritage Organization Development Grant. This grant provides annual operating funding to not-for-profit heritage organizations and historical societies, and supports community engagement activities such as exhibits, public programs, lecture series and walking tours. ""Our financial support for heritage organizations and community museums helps ensure that current and future generations can continue to learn about our province's rich history and culture — and that's what Ontario Heritage week is all about,"" continued Minister MacLeod. ""Ontario offers the world in one province. Let's all come together this week to celebrate the places, landscapes, traditions and stories that embody our heritage and unite us all."" The province's annual Heritage Week celebrations are led by the Ontario Heritage Trust. Ontario Heritage Week 2020 runs from February 17 to 23. Ontarians can learn more about the Ontario Heritage Trust's calendar of events and listings in their communities during Heritage Week and all year long. 

Quick Facts

Community museums throughout Ontario are custodians and interpreters of the province's irreplaceable heritage collections. They contribute to Ontario communities' economic well-being, attracting more than 3 million visitors annually.
Many heritage organizations are operated exclusively by volunteers. Each year, thousands of community volunteers contribute tens of thousands of service hours for these organizations. 
The Ontario Heritage Trust is an agency of the Ministry of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries. The Trust’s mandate is to identify, protect, promote and conserve Ontario’s heritage. 
In the 2019 Fall Economic Statement, the government proposed a new program to provide free admission for children and youth to cultural sites and attractions across the province.

Today, Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation, issued the following statement after the Council of Ministers Responsible for Transportation and Highway Safety annual meeting:
""Today, Transportation and Highway Safety Ministers from across Canada met to discuss how we will work together to enhance transportation safety, improve our roads, bridges and transit, and get the people of Ontario and Canada to work on time and home to their loved ones faster. There is broad agreement that we need to build the critical infrastructure that will help communities thrive, get people and goods moving, and drive business investment and job creation.  Our government remains committed to working together with federal partners to build a better transportation network for the people of Ontario. To deliver on this, we are making the single largest capital investment in new subway builds and extensions in Canadian history with our New Subway Transit Plan for the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Just earlier today, the Province of Ontario and the City of Toronto signed the ""Ontario-Toronto Transit Partnership Preliminary Agreement"". Through this partnership, we are making Premier Ford's plan for expanding Ontario's transportation network a reality. During the discussions today and in meeting with Minister Garneau yesterday, I formally requested that the federal government provide a minimum 40 per cent contribution to Ontario's four historic and nationally significant subway projects in the forthcoming federal budget. Based on preliminary cost estimates for Ontario's subway projects and Ottawa's role to make a minimum 40 per cent contribution to these major infrastructure projects, we call on the federal government to contribute the approximate $6 billion in additional funding beyond what has already been allocated. Working with our partners, the delivery of the subway expansion will get people moving in Canada's largest city, while providing lasting benefits to the regional economy of the GTA. Ontario is also in the process of developing comprehensive regional transportation plans to connect families and businesses in the Greater Golden Horseshoe and northern, eastern and southwestern Ontario. Our first transportation plan, Connecting the Southwest, was released in January 2020. These plans will address the unique needs of each region to improve Ontario's highways, airports, marine and rail infrastructure, and will require federal collaboration to be fully realized. In addition, the province has approved funding for more than 350 projects under the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program, 120 of which have been approved by the federal government. We encourage the federal government to continue to review, approve and fund their share of these projects as soon as possible so we can get shovels in the ground and keep our province moving. While the provinces and the federal government may not agree on everything, we have much in common and need to work together. As Premier Ford has said, we are ready and willing to roll up our sleeves and get to work for the people of Ontario, and the people of Canada. Building new transit faster and developing regional transportation plans that connect people to places is part of our plan to get people where they want to go across the province, when they want to get there.""

SAULT STE. MARIE — Ontario is expanding mental health, addictions and well-being services for First Nations and Indigenous organizations, helping to provide culturally-appropriate services closer to home.
 Today, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, was joined by Ross Romano, Minister of Colleges and Universities and MPP for Sault Ste. Marie, and Michael Tibollo, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, at The Indian Friendship Centre in Sault Ste. Marie to announce the government is investing $1.2 million in additional funding to expand community-based mental health and addictions services provided by First Nations and Indigenous organizations. ""For the past year, we've been travelling the province to hear about the changes Ontarians expect to see in our mental health and addictions system,"" said Elliott. ""Investing in culturally-appropriate, community-based services for First Nations and Indigenous people is another example of how our government is listening and delivering more accessible mental health and addictions services to meet the specific needs of communities."" This investment will help nearly 1,100 Indigenous clients by supporting:  Batchewana First Nation to expand existing mental health and wellness programs to offer a combination of clinical care and traditional healing and operate a new mental health and addictions aftercare program for post-treatment clients.Sioux Lookout First Nations Health Authority to establish a team of specialized mental health professionals including counsellors, an expressive arts therapist and clinical psychologist, to provide care to First Nations youth in northwestern Ontario with acute mental health needs.The Ontario Federation of Indigenous Friendship Centres to expand mental health and wellness programs that will serve more community members. ""This investment is a demonstration of our government's commitment to improving front-line mental health and addictions services for First Nations and Indigenous communities across northern Ontario,"" said Romano. ""I want to thank front-line workers for supporting this effort and look forward to working closely with community partners to ensure residents receive the services and supports they need to live happy and healthy lives."" Ontario continues to take a cross-government approach to build a better mental health and addictions system and will soon launch a new mental health and addictions roadmap that will meaningfully improve the care and services provided to all Ontarians, including First Nation, Métis, and Inuit people. ""Our government is continuing to fulfill on our promise of making mental health and addictions a priority,"" said Tibollo. ""It is critical to respond to the gaps in service that affect Indigenous people across the province and continue working to meaningfully improve Ontario's mental health and addictions system and help build healthier communities."" ""The leadership of Batchewana First Nation are thrilled about the fiscal support for the facilitation of our continuum of care by the Crown Government,"" said Dean Sayers, Chief of Batchewana First Nation. ""There are many facets to this delicate issue that need to be addressed and having these additional resources to help expand our community-based mental health and addictions services is essential."" Ontario has a comprehensive plan to end hallway health care, which includes making investments and advancing new initiatives across four pillars:  Prevention and health promotion: keeping patients as healthy as possible in their communities and out of hospitals, including by increasing access to early-intervention mental health and addictions services.Providing the right care in the right place: when patients need care, ensure that they receive it in the most appropriate setting, not always the hospital. This includes expanding community-based mental health and addictions services to alleviate pressures on hospital emergency departments.Integration and improved patient flow: better integrate care providers to ensure patients spend less time waiting in hospitals when they are ready to be discharged.Building capacity: build new hospital and long-term care beds while increasing community-based services across Ontario, including expanding community-based mental health and addiction services for Indigenous communities. 

Quick Facts

Investments were based on priorities identified by Indigenous partners. Ontario continues to work with Indigenous partners to design and deliver programs and services that address community-identified needs.
For 2019-20, the government is investing a total of $174 million more in annualized funding for mental health and addictions programs, to fill urgent gaps in care.
Ontario is investing $3.8 billion over 10 years to create new mental health and addictions services and expand existing programs.

HAMILTON — The Ontario government is adopting a new locally-focused model that will better connect people with jobs and reward high-performance organizationsin the Hamilton-Niagara Region, Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development, announced today. 
As part of this work, the government is making changes to shape a more seamless and effective employment service system that achieves better results for jobseekers, social assistance clients and employers. Prototype projects in Peel, Hamilton-Niagara and Muskoka-Kawarthas will bring together employment services which were previously delivered separately through Ontario Works, the Ontario Disability Support Program and Employment Ontario Employment Service.  In the three regions, new service system managers have been selected to lead the implementation of local service improvements, and will be paid based on their results. Hamilton-Niagara is one of the regions in the province where a new service system manager will begin operating this year. After an open, competitive process that was overseen by Supply Chain Ontario, Ontario selected a consortium led by Fedcap as the new service system manager for Hamilton-Niagara.  ""This change to the process will go largely unnoticed by job seekers and employers,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""At the ground level, things will work better, move faster. But from a system perspective, the shift is a big one. Government is getting out of the way, and allowing local communities to tailor the program to their specific needs."" ""We are working to develop smarter ways our government can assist people, including those on social assistance and people with disabilities who are looking for employment opportunities,"" said Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services. ""These changes will help connect more people to meaningful, lasting employment and ensure that job seekers have the support and training they need to contribute to our province's growing labour market.""  ""In our rapidly-changing economy, our competitiveness depends on connecting people and businesses and maximizing economic opportunity for all Ontarians,"" said Jan De Silva, President and CEO of the Toronto Board of Trade.  Beginning April 1, 2020, the consortium led by Fedcap will establish a presence in the Hamilton-Niagara region. The government will provide regular, timely communications to help people understand and prepare for any changes which would begin in October 2020.

Quick Facts

The competitive process to select the new service system managers was open to all public, not-for-profit and private sector organizations. Supply Chain Ontario supported and facilitated the process to ensure confidentiality, consistency and fairness. Successful proponents were chosen because they were best positioned to deliver results.
On February 12, 2019, the government announced its plan to modernize Ontario’s employment services.

Prototype projects in Peel, Hamilton-Niagara and Muskoka-Kawarthas will bring together employment services which were previously delivered separately through Ontario Works, the Ontario Disability Support Program and Employment Ontario Employment Service.  In the three regions, new service system managers have been selected to lead the implementation of local service improvements, and will be paid based on their results. Muskoka-Kawarthas is one of the regions in the province where a new service system manager will begin operating this year. After an open, competitive process that was overseen by Supply Chain Ontario, Ontario selected Fleming College as the new service system manager for Muskoka-Kawarthas.  ""This is a big change to the process that ordinary job seekers and employers may not notice,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""At the ground level, things will work better, move faster. But from a system perspective, the shift is a big one. Government is getting out of the way, and allowing local communities to tailor the program to their specific needs."" ""We are rethinking ways our government assists people, including those on social assistance and people with disabilities who are looking for employment opportunities,"" said Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services. ""We must help connect more people to meaningful, lasting employment and ensure that job seekers have the support and training they need to contribute to our province's growing labour market.""  ""In our rapidly-changing economy, our competitiveness depends on connecting people and businesses and maximizing economic opportunity for all Ontarians,"" said Jan De Silva, President and CEO of the Toronto Board of Trade.  Beginning April 1, 2020, Fleming College will establish a presence in the Muskoka-Kawarthas region. The government will provide regular, timely communications to help people understand and prepare for any changes which would begin in October 2020.

Quick Facts

The competitive process to select the new service system managers was open to all public, not-for-profit and private sector organizations. Supply Chain Ontario supported and facilitated the process to ensure confidentiality, consistency and fairness. Successful proponents were chosen because they were best positioned to deliver results.
On February 12, 2019, the government announced its plan to modernize Ontario’s employment services.

Ontario Moving Ahead with the Reform of Employment Services 


February 14, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development


Ontario's Government is moving ahead with the reform of the employment services system by introducing new Service System Managers in three prototype regions across Ontario. This approach will:
 Create an efficient employment service to meet the needs of all clients, including those on social assistance or with a disability.Be more responsive to local labour market needs.Drive results for job seekers, employers and communities. Milestones of the reform  Winter 2019 - Announced plan to modernize employment services In 2016, the Auditor General reported that Ontario's employment and training programs were not effectively helping people find and keep full-time jobs. On February 12, 2019 the government announced its plan to modernize Ontario's employment services by creating a new service delivery model that integrates social assistance employment services into Employment Ontario. Service System Managers would also be selected to plan and deliver more locally-responsive employment services starting in three prototype regions. Spring/Summer 2019 - Engaged with stakeholders and partner To ensure the new employment services system meets the needs of job seekers and employers, the government engaged with nearly 200 stakeholders and partners in spring/summer 2019.  Summer/Fall 2019 - Announced prototype regions and opened Service System Manager competition On July 2, 2019, the government announced that the new employment services model would first be implemented in three prototype regions: Region of Peel, Hamilton-Niagara and Muskoka-Kawarthas.A new competitive process open to any public, not-for-profit and private sector organization was launched to select Service System Managers for the three prototype regions.  January 2020 - Service System Managers selected The government evaluated all qualified proposals and selected a Service System Manager for each prototype region that is best positioned to manage the employment system and deliver results: For Region of Peel: WCG, part of the APM Group.   WCG is a Canadian subsidiary of The International APM Group Pty Ltd (APM), a  global human service organization based in Australia. In the last year, APM  supported more than 350,000 people across 10 countries by designing and  delivering employment, health and rehabilitation services.For Hamilton-Niagara: A consortium led by Fedcap.      The consortium led by Fedcap includes two current  Employment Ontario service providers (Canadian Council on Rehabilitation  and Work, Operation Springboard) and two current providers of Ontario  Disability Support Program Employment Supports (Corbrook, Community  Living Toronto).    For the Muskoka-Kawarthas region: Fleming College.      Fleming College has more than 50 years of experience delivering  education, skills training and employment services to students, job  seekers and employers. Each year, 3,000 job seekers access Employment  Ontario services via Fleming College.     Next steps of the reform The new Service System Managers will start establishing a presence in their prototype region and familiarizing themselves with the existing employment service provider network. However, clients will not experience any changes to how they access employment services and supports at this time.Lessons learned from the prototype regions will be applied to the future roll out across the province (expected to start in 2022). As the new system is implemented in the prototype regions, the government will continue to work with service delivery partners across Ontario to plan and deliver stronger, more localized employment and social assistance services.The changes that will be introduced in the prototype phase will not apply to the services delivered on-reserve by First Nations, including Ontario Works Employment Assistance and Employment Ontario employment services.

Treasury Board Secretariat


TORONTO — Ontario is delivering on its commitment to build smarter government through the creation of an Office of the Comptroller General. The office will be tasked with identifying and mitigating potential financial and policy risks before they take hold, protecting taxpayer dollars in the process.
Enterprise risk management, a best practice in the private sector, includes forecasting and managing operational risk, enhancing internal oversight of the province's finances and embedding respect for taxpayer money into the province's decision-making process.The Comptroller General will lead risk management practices across government, which will include the analysis of fiscal impacts and the overall viability of policy decisions. ""Our government is committed to building a smarter, more efficient government that puts people at the centre of everything we do,"" said Peter Bethlenfalvy, President of the Treasury Board. ""Creating an Office of the Comptroller General will help the government root out potential problems before they take hold, while better protecting frontline programs. By utilizing these best practices from the private sector, we are bringing the rigour of business to the business of government."" The first among Canadian provinces to be a Deputy Minister level position, the Office of the Comptroller General will be responsible for working with ministries and provincial agencies to provide advice, share information on effective enterprise risk management and ensure risks are properly identified and managed before public money is spent, providing increased value for the people of Ontario. Reinforced by EY Canada in its line by line review of government spending, integrating enterprise risk management across all ministries and provincial agencies will build a culture that manages public resources responsibly, while improving the government programs and services the people of Ontario depend on every day. The Comptroller General role will align and streamline practices across government, where appropriate, to ensure a smarter, more coordinated risk management landscape. The government is also creating an Enterprise Risk Office, headed by the Chief Risk Officer, which will work under the purview of the Comptroller General to coordinate risk functions across government. The search for a Comptroller General begins in mid-February and the successful candidate is expected to be announced in spring/summer 2020.   The announcement of the Office of the Comptroller General is part of Ontario's plan to Build Ontario Together by protecting core programs and services through smarter government. Our goal is to ensure opportunity and sustainability, now and for future generations

Ontario and Saskatchewan take a hard line on wildlife trafficking 


February 13, 2020 10:30 A.M.

Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry


A two-and-a-half-year joint investigation between the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources (MNRF) and Forestry and the Saskatchewan Ministry of Environment has resulted in one Ontario resident and four Saskatchewan residents being convicted for unlawfully trafficking in wildlife.
The Saskatchewan Special Investigations Unit (SSIU) received information in early 2017 that a Sandy Bay, Saskatchewan-area restaurant was buying black bear parts. Officers in Saskatchewan investigated and learned that individuals from Saskatoon and Toronto were involved in the illegal possession and buying of bear gall bladders.  The Saskatchewan SSIU contacted the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources Intelligence and Investigations Service (IIS) in July of 2017 regarding the trafficking of bear parts from Saskatchewan to Toronto. Based on the information from Saskatchewan, MNRF conducted a joint investigation with the SSIU into the illegal buying and selling of black bear gall bladders and paws. Following the investigation, Saskatchewan conservation officers charged four Saskatchewan residents under the Saskatchewan Wildlife Act with unlawfully trafficking in bear parts. Ontario conservation officers charged one Ontario resident under the Ontario Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act with unlawful possession of black bear gall bladders.  Justice of the Peace Paula Liu heard the case against Shun Ji Xue of Toronto in Toronto Old City Hall Court, convicted her of unlawfully possessing black bear gall bladders and fined her $3,250. The following people in Saskatchewan were charged and convicted:  Li Gen Han of Sandy Bay was convicted of seven counts and fined $23,800 Luanshun Li of Sandy Bay was convicted of three counts and fined $8,400 Marcel Sewap of Sandy Bay was convicted of one count and fined $2,800 Launhua Chi of Saskatoon was convicted of seven counts and fined $29,120  In addition to fines totaling $67,370, all of the accused Saskatchewan residents were given a five-year suspension from purchasing hunting licences. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry wants to remind the public that buying and selling bear parts is illegal in Ontario, and that Ontario's conservation officers work cooperatively with conservation officers throughout Canada to stop the illegal wildlife trade. Ministry conservation officers work tirelessly to help make sure we can all enjoy Ontario's natural resources in a safe and respectful manner. To report a natural resource violation, call the ministry TIPS line at 1-877-847-7667 toll-free, or contact your local ministry office. You can also call Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-TIPS. We need your help to solve cases. Please visit ontario.ca/mnrftips to view an interactive, searchable map of unsolved cases. You may have valuable information that can help.

Ontario Continues to Take Action Against Invasive Species
These steps would further protect the environment and the economy

February 13, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry


TORONTO — The Ontario government is protecting the province's environment and economy by taking action to prevent the introduction and spread of 13 invasive species. These species can cause significant harm to biodiversity and navigation in waterways, and affect recreational activities and tourism.
The invasive species for consideration are: Wild PigsMarmorkreb (marbled crayfish)Tench (fish)New Zealand mud snailEuropean Frog-bit (plant)Yellow Floating Heart (plant)Prussian Carp (fish)Red Swamp CrayfishFanwort (plant)Bohemian Knotweed (plant)Giant Knotweed (plant)Himalayan Knotweed (plant)Mountain Pine BeetleThe government is seeking feedback from stakeholders, Indigenous communities and the public on the ecological, social and economic impacts of these invasive species, as well as the spread of invasive species through the movement of watercraft. ""Our government is committed to protecting Ontario's environment for future generations,"" said John Yakabuski, Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry. ""It is important to prevent new invasive species from arriving or surviving in the province in order to protect our lakes, streams and native plants and animals. In addition, by taking these steps we will preserve and enhance the economic opportunities that ecosystems provide for our communities and industries."" The province is also working with partners in nearby jurisdictions to improve regulatory consistency in the Great Lakes basin. The ministry is conducting a two-stage approach to public engagement. The initial posting is now available on the Environmental Registry of Ontario for public feedback until March 30, 2020. Information gathered will be considered in developing a regulatory proposal to prevent the spread of these species in the province. The Ontario government will continue to work with conservation partners to coordinate prevention, management, and research activities to help address the serious threat while promoting public education on the negative impacts of invasive species.

Quick Facts

Ontario is also gathering feedback on proposed Prevention and Response Plans for the invasive European water chestnut and water soldier on the Environmental Registry of Ontario, which closes March 30, 2020. The plans will support monitoring, controlling and eradication of these harmful species.
The Invasive Species Act was established in 2015 and currently lists 20 species.
Ontario is the only jurisdiction in Canada that has standalone invasive species legislation. The Invasive Species Act provides legislative tools to prohibit and restrict certain invasive species and carriers that facilitate the movement of invasive species.
In 2019-2020, Ontario invested over $2 million to support ongoing research, monitoring, and management of invasive species across the province.
Protecting our natural environment from invasive species by working with partners and other governments and using tools to prevent, detect and respond to invasions is a commitment under the Made-in-Ontario Environment Plan.

Ontario Seeking to Regulate 13 Invasive Species


February 13, 2020  9:55 A.M.

Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry


The Ontario government is collecting feedback from stakeholders, Indigenous communities and the public that will support the development of a proposal to regulate 13 new invasive species. These species are:
Wild Pigs  Native to Europe and Asia. Eurasian wild boar were first introduced to Canada from Europe beginning in the 1980s as exotic livestock for meat The term ""wild pig"" refers to any pig ""outside of a fence"" and includes: 		 domestic pigs that have become wild (or 'feral') and ownership cannot be determined Eurasian wild boar hybrids of domestic pigs and Eurasian wild boar   Wild pigs can exhibit many colour phases, ranging from very dark to light, and may have spots. Escaped domestic pigs can grow a dense undercoat to help them to survive cold winter climates Wild pigs have high reproductive potential which means that populations can increase in number and spread rapidly, making their impacts more severe. Impacts to the natural environment include: 		 preying upon native plants and wildlife competing with native wildlife for food, water, and space rooting into the ground with their tusks and snouts to dig for roots, tubers, bulbs, worms, insects, slugs, and snails trampling and wallowing habits can cause erosion, impact water quality, and degrade natural areas spreading disease to wildlife.    Marmorkreb (marbled crayfish) A pet trade species created through selective breeding that has no known native populations; it is a descendant of the slough crayfishOnly one individual of the species is needed to establish a viable population as it reproduces through cloningPathways for introduction: intentional or accidental aquarium releasePotential impacts: transmission of diseases to native crayfish and destruction of aquatic plant communities.Tench (fish) Native to Europe and western AsiaEstablished populations in St. Lawrence River between Quebec City and Ontario-Quebec border; multiple individuals captured in Ontario's portion of Lake St. FrancisPathways for introduction: intentional release, natural spread, possible illegal use as baitPotential impacts: parasite transmission, competition with native fishes, reduced water clarity, destruction of aquatic macrophytes, reduced diversity of fish communities in western and central United States.New Zealand mud snail Native to streams and lakes of New ZealandEstablished populations in Lake Ontario (1991), Lake Erie (2005), and likely Lake Superior (2001); detected in Lake Michigan (2006)Able to reproduce sexually or through cloning (all invasive North American populations are all female clones)Pathways for introduction: recreational equipment, fish culture practices, transport of water; spread by fishesPotential impacts: competitive exclusion of native snails and food web disruption.European Frog-bit (plant) Native to Europe and some areas of Asia and AfricaEstablished populations in Lake Ontario and Lake Erie, and some rivers and inland lakesPathways for introduction: transportation of seeds, winter buds and stem fragments by recreational gear and waterfowl, and through improper disposalPotential impacts: dense colonies outcompete native vegetation, create anoxic conditions during large-scale decay, impede recreational activities.Yellow Floating Heart (plant) Native to Europe and AsiaIntroduced to North America in late 1800s, populations have established in Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and some US statesPathways for introduction: intentional or accidental release of water garden specimens, transport by waterfowl, flooding, and contaminated recreational gearPotential impacts: dense colonies outcompete native vegetation, create anoxic conditions during large-scale decay, and impede recreational activities.Prussian Carp (fish) Native to central Europe to SiberiaIntroduced to Alberta, Saskatchewan and parts of EuropeAble to reproduce by gynogenesis, a process that gives rise to new females (male not required for reproduction)Pathways for introduction: intentional or accidental aquarium releasePotential impacts: may lead to decline of native fish, invertebrate and plant populations, and may alter habitats by increasing the cloudiness of water.Red Swamp Crayfish Native to Gulf coastal plain from the Florida panhandle to Mexico and from southern Mississippi River drainage to IllinoisIntroduced range includes: California, Delaware, Maryland, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin, not currently known to occur in OntarioPathways for introduction: aquarium trade, food fish release, accidental or intentional releasePotential impacts: compete with native crayfish species for food and habitat, feeding behavior reduces the amount of available habitat for amphibians, invertebrates, and juvenile fish.Fanwort (plant) Native to the southeastern United States and parts of South AmericaEstablished populations in Kasshabog Lake, and other parts of the Crowe River watershed in central Ontario; also established in waters of the northern United States, Asia and AustraliaPathways for introduction: aquarium use (improper disposal of aquarium plants), movement of boats, natural spreadPotential Impacts: Crowds out native plants, blocks sunlight to submerged plants, disrupts fish communities and clogs drainage canals and streams.Bohemian Knotweed (plant) Hybrid species of Japanese and Giant KnotweedIt has been reported in British Columbia, Quebec, Newfoundland and New BrunswickIt is possible that it exists in Ontario, since both parent plants are present here, although it has not been reportedPathways of introduction: planting in gardens, ornamental plantingsPotential impacts: The knotweeds (bohemian, giant, Himalayan and Japanese) can aggressively outcompete native plants threatening biodiversity and degrade stream and river habitats by contributing to sediment erosion (roots do not hold the soil). Vigorous stems and rhizomes can also push through concrete and asphalt, damaging infrastructure and building foundations.Giant Knotweed (plant) Native to northern JapanHas been found in Southern Ontario, mostly in the southeast (i.e. Leeds County, Ottawa-Carleton) and in the Niagara RegionPathways of introduction: planting in gardens, ornamental plantings. Soil, gravel, and other fill material from infested areas, may spread knotweeds to new locationsPotential impacts: The knotweeds (bohemian, giant, Himalayan, and Japanese) can aggressively outcompete native plants threatening biodiversity as well as degrade stream and river habitats by contributing to sediment erosion (roots do not hold the soil). Vigorous stems and rhizomes can also push through concrete and asphalt, damaging infrastructure and building foundations.Himalayan Knotweed (plant) Native to the Himalayan mountain region in southern AsiaThere are no known populations in Ontario, however, it has been reported in British Columbia, Nova Scotia and NewfoundlandPotential impacts: The knotweeds (Bohemian, Giant, Himalayan, and Japanese) have similar impacts. They can aggressively outcompete native plants threatening biodiversity as well as degrade stream and river habitats by contributing to sediment erosion (roots do not hold the soil). Vigorous stems and rhizomes can also push through concrete and asphalt, damaging infrastructure and building foundations.Mountain Pine Beetle Native to western Canada but has expanded beyond its historical range into north-central AlbertaThe jack pine tree, which grows across the Canadian Shield into Ontario, is susceptible to mountain pine beetleThe mountain pine beetle has not yet been detected in Ontario but poses a significant threat to the area. If introduced to Ontario, it will affect forest management plans, wood supply planning, fire frequency and severity, wildlife habitat, biodiversity, watershed management, recreation and property values."

Long-Term Care Home Public Inquiry Report Recommendations


February 13, 2020  9:30 A.M.

Ministry of Long-Term Care


The government and long-term care sector partners have been comprehensively reviewing the recommendations from the Public Inquiry into the Safety and Security of Residents in the Long-Term Care Homes System and have completed a total of 18 recommendations, with another 40 recommendations underway.
  The Public Inquiry recommendations address systemic issues in Ontario's long-term care system. The recommendations are based on four key themes: Prevention, Awareness, Deterrence and Detection.  The completed recommendations, which both the government and sector partners are responsible for implementing are listed below.  Theme 1 - Prevention: Building capacity and excellence in long-term care will improve quality of care, and the safety and security of residents. Recommendation 42 The College of Nurses of Ontario has reviewed and improved its policies and procedures to reflect the possibility that a nurse or other healthcare provider might intentionally harm those for whom they provide care. Recommendation 63 The Ministry of Long-Term Care is collaborating with the Ministry of Health's Home and Community Care Branch in providing healthcare services to older Ontarians. Theme 2 - Awareness: By building awareness throughout the healthcare system about possible harm and abuse of the residents and patients we can prevent, deter and detect concerns about the quality of care/safety and security of residents. Recommendation 2   The Ministry of the Attorney General is funding counselling services to victims and their loved ones until 2021. Recommendation 40 The College of Nurses of Ontario educates its membership and staff on nurses or other healthcare providers who may intentionally harm those for whom they provide care. Recommendation 41 The College of Nurses of Ontario has reviewed and improved its intake investigation process, following receipt of termination and other reports, by training intake investigators on various topics such as the serial killer phenomenon, identifying all relevant contacts in an investigation and assessing risk levels. Recommendation 47 The College of Nurses of Ontario launched a revised version of their mandatory reporting guide to include easy-to-understand information about what, when and how to report a concern to them. Recommendation 48 The College of Nurses of Ontario has revised its mandatory reporting form and process for submitting reports, including clearer instructions and the ability to submit the form electronically. Recommendation 74 The Minister of Long-Term Care has issued a policy directive ensuring that a long-term care home's written policy for the destruction and disposal of drugs covers insulin cartridges. Recommendation 75 During resident quality inspections in long-term care homes, inspectors will confirm that the home's written policy on drug destruction and disposal includes the destruction and disposal of insulin cartridges and that the registered staff in the home are complying with that policy. Theme 3 - Deterrence: Utilize a variety of tools and professions to strengthen medication management and deter intentional medication errors.    Recommendation 80 The Minister of Long-Term Care has issued a policy directive requiring long-term care homes to treat the use of glucagon as a medication incident. Recommendation 81 The Long-Term Care Homes Division of the Ministry of Long-Term Care has advised long-term care homes that the use of glucagon constitutes a medication incident.   Recommendation 84  The Minister of Long-Term Care has issued a policy directive requiring long-term care homes to treat severe or unresponsive hypoglycemia as a medication incident. Theme 4 - Detection: The Commissioner recognized that Ontario has a strong death investigation system with excellent leadership. The government will build on those strengths by tailoring the death investigation process as it applies to deaths in long-term care homes. Recommendation 25 The Ministry of Long-Term Care has refined its Long-Term Care Home Quality Inspection Program to better identify homes struggling to provide a safe and secure environment for residents. After consulting with the long-term care sector and advocacy groups, the ministry modernized the Long-Term Care Performance Report. Recommendation 26 Long-term care inspectors ensure that all Critical Incident reports and complaints relating to high-risk incidents are given the highest priority and inspected as quickly as possible to ensure that any ongoing risk to residents is immediately remedied.   Recommendation 27 When conducting inspections and establishing inspection priorities, the Ministry of Long-Term Care is guided by the Long-Term Care Home Quality Inspection Program Performance Assessments and data produced by the Information Management, Data and Analytics Branch showing homes with higher than expected mortality rates. Recommendation 28 The Ministry of Long-Term Care uses the Long-Term Care Home Quality Inspection Program Performance Assessment to identify long-term care homes struggling to provide a safe and secure environment for their residents. Recommendation 30 Before beginning an inspection involving either missing narcotics or allegations of staff-to-resident abuse, the Ministry of Long-Term Care ensures that the assigned inspector reviews previous Critical Incident reports to determine whether the staff member involved in those incidents is named in earlier reports. Recommendation 82 The Minister of Long-Term Care has issued a policy directive requiring long-term care homes to document and track the use of glucagon to identify patterns and trends, and flag where further investigation should be undertaken.

Ministry of Education


TORONTO — Today, Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education, issued the following statement in response to strike escalation by the four teachers' unions (OSSTF, ETFO, OECTA, AEFO): 
""Our focus is on keeping students in class, as they deserve better. That is why I am calling on the teachers' union leaders to accept private mediation today and end this needless escalation.  Parents are losing patience with the disruption in their lives, the inconsistency in their children's education, and the financial impact of scrambling for child care. That is why we have offered financial assistance through the Support for Parents initiative, which has seen an immense uptake of more than 575,000 applications. While union leaders are organizing further disruption, our government remains focused on getting deals at the bargaining table through private mediation. We've made very significant moves on our position, but union leadership hasn't moved on substantial items - like their already generous benefits packages and maintaining hiring based on seniority rather than on merit. Parents and students deserve no less.""

THUNDER BAY — Ontario is helping community agencies repair and renovate their buildings so they can continue providing services to children and families.
Today, Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services, joined by Greg Rickford, Minister of Indigenous Affairs announced at Ontario Native Women's Association that Ontario is investing over $1.6 million for repairs and upgrades at agencies across northern Ontario. This includes an investment of $678,500 at Ontario Native Women's Association (ONWA). This investment, primarily in a new elevator, will make ONWA fully accessible and help with the development and delivery of services for Indigenous women and children. ""Helping our community partners maintain and upgrade their buildings just makes sense,"" said Minister Rickford. ""Our local agencies work hard every day to help people who need extra support. We want to make sure their buildings are safe and in good shape so they can provide quality services and programming for years to come."" ""I'm proud that our government continues to support important services people rely on,"" said Minister Smith. ""When community agencies are able to make necessary repairs to their buildings, they can better focus on the people they serve."" These investments help agencies maintain building capacity, while providing better services for people with developmental disabilities, women and children experiencing domestic violence, Indigenous people and children with mental health needs. Helping community partners maintain and upgrade their buildings is part of the government's plan to build healthier and safer communities.

There are more than 70,000 adults with a developmental disability in Ontario and about 18,000 receive residential supports in communities across the province.
In 2017-18, almost 109,000 families across Ontario were served by 49 children’s aid societies, including 11 Indigenous societies and three faith-based societies.

Convicted: Vixman Construction Ltd., 4919 7th Line, RR#4 Rockwood, ON.
Location of Workplace: Billy Bishop Airport, Toronto, ON. Description of Offence: failing as employer to ensure measures and procedures prescribed in section 26.6 (2) and 26.6(3) of O. Reg. 213/91 were carried out, contrary to section 25(1)(c) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act. Date of Offences: March 27, 2018. Date of Conviction: January 16, 2020. Penalty Imposed:  Following trial, Vixman Construction Ltd was sentenced to a fine of $125,000 and 18 months probation in provincial offences court in Toronto by Justice of the Peace G. Fantino; Crown Counsel Wes Wilson.The court also imposed a 25-per-cent victim fine surcharge as required by the Provincial Offences Act. The surcharge is credited to a special provincial government fund to assist victims of crime. Background:  On March 27, 2018, Vixman Construction Ltd., an Ontario corporation, was contracted to install corrugated steel sheeting to form a roof over several new walkways at Billy Bishop Airport from the gates onto the tarmac.  On March 27, two workers were working on a walkway. They were using self-retracting lifelines (SRLs) for fall protection, attached to full body harnesses.  All of the fall protection equipment was appropriate for the tasks involved and functioning properly.The two workers were working close to each other and advancing along the walkway attaching the steel roof sheeting.  They were moving the anchorage of their SRLs as they advanced.  The first worker, with his supervisor standing beside him, anchored his SRL by choking a cable around an upright column supporting the roof structure.  The worker was approximately 3.5 metres above the ground.  The SRL block was lying on the already installed roof sheeting.  He extended his lifeline approximately 6 metres from the anchored SRL block, across an open area.The worker was working with his back to the SRL block.  His movements pulled the SRL block over the edge of the installed sheeting.  As it was attached to a vertical column, and not to a horizontal member, the block dropped until its mechanism engaged.  This exerted a pulling force on the worker's body and he fell from the work surface.  As he was working at a distance farther away from the SRL block than the distance of the height of the work surface, he hit the ground, and suffered fatal injuries.The Court found that the SRL had not been attached to a fixed support, and that the length of the extended lifeline, over an open area, was not a safe configuration of the fall protection equipment."

New Policy Empowers Institutions to Offer Nursing Degrees Independently

February 11, 2020 11:30 A.M.

Ministry of Colleges and Universities


OWEN SOUND - The Ontario government is making changes to permit colleges and universities to offer Bachelor nursing degree programs on a stand-alone basis. For colleges, this will be the first time they would be able to offer the Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BScN) degree independently of a university partner.
Today, Ross Romano, Minister of Colleges and Universities, was at Georgian College to announce a new nursing education policy that will give students more choice around accessing a high-quality education to pursue a rewarding career in registered nursing. ""Building Ontario's economy means ensuring our postsecondary institutions are training students for the jobs of today and the future,"" said Minister Romano. ""This new pathway for nursing education will offer students greater choice and make it easier for them to pursue rewarding nursing careers.""   Since the collaborative nursing model was implemented in 2000, postsecondary education and health systems have grown and evolved. Many colleges now have experience in offering stand-alone degree programs in other areas of study. And both colleges and universities are able and willing to offer their own degrees independent of a partner institution. This new policy will expand choice for students and give institutions greater autonomy and flexibility over their programming, while maintaining excellence in nursing education. Institutions will be able to choose whether to deliver their programs collaboratively or on a stand-alone basis. ""This will give Ontarians the opportunity for more choices, while ensuring we maintain the highest quality nursing workforce,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""Nurses play a vital role in the delivery of health care as we continue to build a connected and sustainable health care system centred around the needs of patients."" ""This is an important step forward in ensuring communities, such as the ones we serve in central Ontario, have the talented nurses who are so integral to Ontario's health care system,"" said MaryLynn West-Moynes, President and CEO of Georgian College. ""I want to thank the government for making this important policy decision so colleges throughout Ontario can deliver degree nursing programs."" ""We have heard that students entering nursing programs wish to complete their studies right here at home,"" said the Hon. Bill Walker, MPP for Bruce-Grey-Owen Sound. ""This announcement is incredibly important to rural areas like Bruce-Grey-Owen Sound to encourage more local students to enter nursing which will also significantly benefit our local hospitals."" Maintaining excellence in nursing education continues to be a priority for Ontario. By having safeguards in place, Ontario is ensuring we maintain excellence in nursing education, while expanding choice for students and providing greater autonomy to institutions.

Quick Facts

To become a registered nurse in Ontario (and a member of the College of Nurses of Ontario), students must obtain a BScN degree.
Most institutions in Ontario currently offer nursing programs for future registered nurses through a collaborative partnership. 
Successful implementation of this new policy is dependent on the Ministry of Health working with the College of Nurses of Ontario to amend a regulation made under the Nursing Act, 1991.  
Providing institutions with the option to continue a collaborative partnership or offer a stand-alone program for future registered nurses allows greater flexibility, while continuing to equip students with the skills and training necessary to meet the standards of care Ontarians deserve from our health care professionals.

Ontario Cutting Red Tape to Create Jobs and Bring More Housing to York Region 


February 10, 2020 12:00 P.M.

Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing


Vaughan ― The Ontario government is cutting red tape in York Region to help create more housing and employment in downtown Vaughan.  
Today, Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing attended a groundbreaking for a 36-storey apartment building with 450 rental units in SmartVMC, the first purpose-built apartment in the Vaughan Metropolitan Centre. A Minister's Zoning Order has helped complete the vision for the centre, through the relocation of an existing retail store. This will allow a new community to take shape in short order, bringing more homes and employment to a major transit station area. ""This project supports our government's plan to connect people to places and to build healthier, safer communities. It shows the great results that can be achieved for communities when local partners and government work together,"" said Minister Clark. ""I'm pleased to have made a Minister's Zoning Order to make it faster and easier for the City of Vaughan to develop more housing and employment, which is a priority for our government.""   The relocation project also supports Ontario's priorities and plans in A Place to Grow: Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, which directs more housing to be built around major transit hubs in communities that are growing quickly. And through More Homes, More Choice: Ontario's Housing Supply Action Plan, the government is encouraging building different types of housing, such as condos, townhouses and rental apartments, to give people more options that meet their needs. ""I want to thank the Province of Ontario and Minister Steve Clark for their partnership. We worked collaboratively in the process towards a minister's zoning order ― a key element to unleash the full potential of the Vaughan Metropolitan Centre (VMC) as a powerful economic driver in the province,"" said Maurizio Bevilacqua, Mayor of the City of Vaughan. ""Today's groundbreaking is in alignment with Vaughan's commitment to meet provincial density targets and find a complete range of housing solutions for our diverse and rapidly expanding city.""

Quick Facts

The relocation will add 50 new retail jobs to the retail store. It would also make approximately four million square feet available for redevelopment of the existing site into new homes and other uses, creating approximately  2,000 construction jobs.
The Planning Act authorizes the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing to make zoning orders for regulating the use of land and the location, use, height, size and spacing of buildings and structures. This zoning order was requested, and has the support of the retailer, Vaughan City Council and York Region Council.
To encourage the construction of more rentals, the government has allowed development charges for rental housing to be paid over a five-year period instead of up front. 
Urbanation’s research has shown that there were 17,082 new purpose-built rentals submitted for approvals in the Greater Toronto Area – a 43 per cent increase from 2018.

Ontario Launches Consultations on Expanding Cannabis Business Opportunities
Province Looking to Offer More Choice for Consumers and More Business Opportunities

February 10, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Ministry of the Attorney General


The Ontario government is launching consultations in order to provide consumers more choice and convenience on cannabis while giving the private sector enhanced ability to compete against and combat the criminal market.
""Ontario continues to take a responsible approach to cannabis retail sales across Ontario, allowing private sector businesses to build a safe and convenient retail system to combat the illegal market while keeping our kids and communities safe,"" said Attorney General Doug Downey. ""We are asking Ontarians to share their feedback as we explore certain expanded cannabis-related business opportunities as part of our responsible approach to protecting families and communities. What we hear from the public and expert groups will help to inform possible next steps."" The online consultation asks the public, businesses, health and other stakeholders to comment on potential new cannabis opportunities, including consumption venues and special occasion permits for events such as outdoor festivals and concerts. The government will also meet with key groups, including industry representatives, public health and safety organizations, education stakeholders and Indigenous representatives, to ensure their expertise and advice help to inform next steps. People interested in participating in the consultations can submit their feedback online by visiting the Ontario Regulatory Registry.

Quick Facts

On December 12, 2019, the Ontario government announced next steps to move to an open market for retail cannabis sales to provide consumers more choice and convenience and a safe, reliable supply of cannabis.
These consultations are part of Ontario’s ongoing work to establish a strong, well-considered legal cannabis market in Ontario. 
Smoking and vaping cannabis are prohibited in indoor public places and other designated areas under the Smoke-Free Ontario Act, 2017.
Consumers must be 19 and older to buy, use, possess and grow recreational cannabis. This is the same as the minimum age for the sale of tobacco and alcohol in Ontario.
Cannabis stores are tightly regulated and rules are strictly enforced by the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO).
Since Ontario announced it would open the legal cannabis market, the AGCO has received more than 700 applications for retail operator licences.

New 9-1-1 Models of Care Part of Plan to Build Healthier Communities and End Hallway Health Care

February 10, 2020  9:41 A.M.

Ministry of Health


OTTAWA — As part of the province's comprehensive plan to end hallway health care, Ontario is improving patient access to the right care in the right place by launching new 9-1-1 models of care so that paramedics have more options to provide safe and appropriate treatment for patients.
Today, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, was joined by local MPPs at Ottawa Paramedic Service Headquarters to announce a new patient care model. Starting in April 2020, eligible palliative care patients who call 9-1-1 in the Ottawa region will have the option to be treated on-scene for pain and symptom management by trained paramedics. Paramedics will then send a referral back to the patient's primary palliative care team for follow-up instead of taking them to an emergency department. Currently, paramedics are required to bring 9-1-1 patients to overcrowded hospital emergency departments, even when there are appropriate care and treatment options available. ""By providing palliative care patients and their families with more options to receive treatment in their home or community, we're improving patients' access to the right care in the right place, a key pillar of our comprehensive plan to end hallway health care,"" said Elliott. ""This new innovative model of care will help reduce unnecessary hospital visits to crowded emergency departments."" Under this new care model, Ottawa paramedics that have received special training will assess the patient's condition when they arrive on scene. They will be able to provide treatment, including administering medication for pain relief, shortness of breath, hallucinations, agitation, nausea, vomiting and terminal congested breathing. The patient will remain in ultimate control of the care they receive and can at any time insist on being taken to the hospital. Other pilot projects will include additional care options, including mental health and addictions crisis centres. ""By establishing new models of care, we're ensuring palliative care patients get the proper assistance, dignity and respect they deserve,"" said Elliott. ""Enabling our world-class health care workers to use their skills effectively, while ensuring patients remain in control of the care they receive, is another way we're improving patient care in our communities.""  Ontario has a comprehensive plan to end hallway health care, which includes making investments and advancing new initiatives across four pillars: Prevention and health promotion: keeping patients as healthy as possible in their communities and out of hospitals. Providing the right care in the right place: when patients need care, ensure that they receive it in the most appropriate setting, not always the hospital. This new model of care will provide select mental health and addictions patients with the appropriate services they need. Integration and improved patient flow: better integrate care providers to ensure patients spend less time waiting in hospitals when they are ready to be discharged. Building capacity: build new hospital and long-term care beds while increasing community-based services across Ontario. "

Office of the Premier


WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, Premier Doug Ford and Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, wrapped up two days of successful meetings at the Winter Meeting of the National Governors Association, where they advanced discussions with key U.S. governors and business leaders to promote investment and trade.
""Our close economic ties have proven time and time again to be a benefit to people in Ontario and the U.S. by creating new jobs and new opportunities,"" said Premier Ford. ""I took that message to my colleagues in Washington, D.C. — we will continue to work together to create the right conditions for businesses to invest and grow on both sides of the border."" At a roundtable event with business leaders, Premier Ford unveiled the Ontario government's new strategy for trade with the U.S., which will expand opportunities for businesses to grow and create jobs on both sides of the border. The strategy includes pursuing Strategic Investment and Procurement Agreements (SIPAs) with U.S. states, which would seek to secure improved access to government procurement opportunities in U.S. states for Ontario businesses. Premier Ford also had productive discussions with key officials, including U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland and Acting Ambassador of Canada to the United States Kirsten Hillman. He also met with a number of U.S. state governors, including Wisconsin, Maryland, Kentucky, Indiana, Arizona, Ohio and Illinois, as well as governors from the Mexican states of Querétaro and Baja California Sur. They discussed shared priorities such as how they could work together to remove trade barriers, create good jobs and strengthen economic ties. At a National Governors Association plenary session, Premier Ford highlighted Ontario's leadership in infrastructure procurement and using public-private partnerships to deliver large, complex projects in front of an audience which included U.S. state governors. He welcomed the opportunity to share Ontario's knowledge by inviting governors to participate in the upcoming NGA Infrastructure Study Tour to Toronto. Premier Ford also met with Ford Motor Company to discuss the implementation of CUSMA and the potential to create new opportunities for Ontario's auto industry, as well as with leaders from Google to thank them for their recently announced investments in our province that will spur new jobs in Toronto and Waterloo. ""Trade and investment are essential for Ontario's growth, competitiveness, and job creation,"" said Minister Fedeli. ""By travelling to Washington, our government is ensuring Ontario is well-positioned to increase trade and unlock opportunities for Ontario businesses, making it easier to succeed in today's globally competitive world."" After departing Washington, D.C., Premier Ford and Minister Fedeli will travel to Dallas, Texas to meet with business leaders to further the province's important trading and investment relationship with the U.S. state.

Quick Facts

Since taking office, Premier Ford has spoken with 26 U.S. state governors and has led visits to Washington, D.C., Maryland, Ohio, New York and Detroit.
Strategic Investment and Procurement Agreements (SIPAs) with U.S. states would seek to secure improved access to government procurement opportunities in U.S. states for Ontario businesses, and identify key actions to enhance and promote overall investment flows between Ontario and U.S. states.
If Ontario were a country, it would be the U.S.’ third largest trading partner.

The new centre, an Indigenous educational institute, will accommodate the Shingwauk Kinoomaage Gamig, one of Ontario's nine Indigenous Institutes that form part of Ontario's post-secondary education sector. It will feature classrooms, a state-of-the-art library, archives and gallery. ""Our government is proud to help the Shingwauk Education Trust enhance its learning environment to better prepare Indigenous people for success in a growing economy,"" said Minister Romano. ""With this investment, we are reinforcing the north's competitive advantage and sending a signal to the world that Northern Ontario is open for business, open for jobs and open for lifelong learning."" The NOHFC promotes and supports economic development across Northern Ontario by providing financial assistance to projects - big and small, rural and urban - that stimulate growth, job creation and develop a skilled workforce. That's why Ontario is working to develop new NOHFC programs that will:  make it easier for more people and businesses to applysupport more projects in rural northern communitiestarget both existing and emerging market opportunitiesprovide more work opportunities for Indigenous peopleaddress the skilled labour shortage in the north.

""Through these proposed changes, Ontario's government will continue to build strong and resilient communities while supporting an environment where businesses can thrive, grow and create good jobs."" Strengthening the north's post-secondary institutions is part of the government's plan to build Ontario together. Ontario's plan is creating more good-paying jobs and opportunities in the North, and attracting new and expanded investment so northern communities can grow and thrive.

Quick Facts

Government Investing in New Training Partnership for 35 Personal Support Workers in Eastern Ontario 

February  7, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development


HAWKESBURY — Ontario is helping prepare people in Eastern Ontario for in-demand jobs in the health care sector. To help overcome a local and provincewide shortage of personal support workers (PSW), the Prescott-Russell Employment Services Centre based in Hawkesbury, Ont., is receiving funding to lead an innovative skills training project in close co-operation with local employers.
The project, called SkillsAdvance Ontario: Become a Personal Support Worker, will help 30 local jobseekers and five currently employed personal support workers gain or upgrade the skills needed by long-term health care employers in Eastern Ontario by offering a fully funded 36-week job preparation course. The government is providing more than $600,000 in training, including essential and technical skills training, as well as job-matching, job-placement and retention services.  ""Our Government knows that employers are looking for job-ready people to help fill vacancies in Eastern Ontario,"" Merrilee Fullerton, MPP for Kanata-Carleton and Minister of Long-Term Care, said today on behalf of Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""By funding projects like this, we're giving people the chance to put their skills to work in good, permanent jobs."" Training begins in March and will include supervisor-specific tools for combating compassion fatigue. ""SkillsAdvance Ontario projects are designed to help both businesses and jobseekers in a region,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""When you tailor a training curriculum around the needs of local employers and offer effective employment supports for the participating trainees, you can achieve outcomes that make a difference.""

Quick Facts

Ontario is supporting the SkillsAdvance Ontario project for personal support worker training at the Prescott-Russell Employment Services Centre with $617,815 over 12 months, giving 35 people the chance to put their skills to work in good, permanent jobs.
There are currently 28 active SkillsAdvance Ontario projects across Ontario, dedicated to sector-specific training for jobs in steel and aluminum, manufacturing, logistics, tourism and hospitality, forestry, and other sectors.
PSWs are vital for Ontario’s economy, especially as the population ages. Among Statistics Canada occupational groupings that include personal support workers, there was a 24 per cent increase in vacancies across Ontario in the third quarter of 2019 compared to the third quarter of 2018, rising by 1,225 to 6,320. 
The Employment Ontario network offers a range of services and supports that help businesses find talent and connect jobseekers to training and job opportunities.

Open for Jobs Plan is Working

February  7, 2020  9:30 A.M.

Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade


TORONTO - Ontario's government continues to deliver on its core commitment to create and protect good jobs as part of its plan to build Ontario together through a thriving and growing economy.
Statistics Canada announced this morning that employment in Ontario increased by 15,900 in January. Since June 2018, employment in Ontario has risen by 307,800. ""We've been working hard to create the best conditions for our job creators,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""It's imperative that we create the conditions to make it faster, easier and more cost effective to do business in Ontario and we are seeing the positive results."" The government's efforts to reduce red tape and remove unnecessary business burden were recognized last month by The Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB). Ontario received an A- on its 2020 Red Tape Report Card. The grade matches Ontario's highest grade on the annual report card, achieved last year, that evaluates governments across Canada on their progress in easing regulatory burdens on job-creating businesses.  Ontario's progress includes making it easier for community programs to provide food to those in need; conducting multiple inspections at once so truck drivers spend less time waiting and more time delivering goods or home with their families; and protecting seniors and families from drug shortages by easing burdens on drug makers. Throughout 2020, the government remains committed to continuing to find ways to reduce the regulatory burden on people and businesses. Ontario has cut the small business Corporate Income Tax (CIT) rate by 8.7 per cent and reduced the rate to 3.2 per cent. Supporting small businesses is part of the government's plan to attract investment and enable entrepreneurs and risk takers to grow their businesses and create high-paying, good quality jobs. Small businesses have benefited from accelerated write-offs of capital investments as well as the government's decision to not parallel a federal measure that would have increased taxes on some small businesses earning passive investment income. These government actions are lowering costs for businesses in Ontario, allowing them to grow and create jobs, and creating a competitive environment to attract new investment. It is estimated that Ontario businesses could save $5.4 billion in 2020 through these actions. ""We are sending a message to Canada, and the world, that Ontario is committed to being open for business and open for jobs,"" said Fedeli. ""By reducing red tape and cutting small business taxes, we are giving job creators the tools they need to build a more prosperous Ontario.""

Quick Facts

Employment in Ontario grew by 210,200 in 2019.
Since 2011, the CFIB has published an annual Red Tape Report Card to hold Canada’s federal, provincial and territorial governments accountable for what CFIB’s surveys show is one of its members’ biggest headaches: excessive regulations.
Ontario will create the Premier’s Advisory Council on Competitiveness to work with business leaders and workers across the province to find ways to improve competitiveness and report back with recommendations.

Strategic Investment and Procurement Agreements (SIPAs) with U.S. States


February  7, 2020  9:00 A.M.

Office of the Premier


Ontario's longstanding trade relationship with the United States has benefited businesses, workers and communities on both sides of the border.
Strategic Investment and Procurement Agreements (SIPAs) with U.S. states would seek to secure improved access to government procurement opportunities for businesses and identify key actions to enhance and promote overall trade and investment. By increasing openness and competition in government procurement markets, businesses and governments can deliver better value for taxpayer dollars in sectors like infrastructure and transportation. Pursuing SIPAs in the U.S. supports the government's commitment to remove barriers to trade and aligns with the government's plan to make Ontario Open for Business and Open for Jobs. Ontario — along with 37 U.S. states — has procurement obligations under the World Trade Organization Government Procurement Agreement (GPA), which provide for open and non-discriminatory procurement access to goods and services suppliers of other GPA parties. Some states have exemptions to the GPA, in sectors such as construction services, motor vehicles, and steel. 13 U.S. states are not covered by the GPA. As part of its trade strategy, Ontario will pursue opportunities to make it easier for businesses to work with each other across the border, according to the specific circumstances of each state. Other opportunities to enhance investments could be explored through these agreements, including further harmonizing of regulations, and promotion of joint business visits and research and development collaboration. If finalized, the proposed SIPAs would be the first sub-national agreements between Ontario and U.S. states to improve market access to U.S. state-level procurement for Ontario businesses.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, Ontario Premier Doug Ford unveiled an important pillar in the government's new U.S. trade strategy that will create more opportunities and jobs on both sides of the border. 
As part of the government's new trade engagement strategy, Ontario will pursue Strategic Investment and Procurement Agreements (SIPAs) with U.S. states which, if signed, will give businesses improved access to government procurement opportunities and further promote two-way investment. Ontario is continuing its discussions with Ohio and other states on a potential agreement that will make it easier for businesses in the province and the states to do business with one another. ""With this bold strategy for trade with the U.S., we are delivering on our promise to further open up trade and create jobs for the hardworking people of Ontario and for our neighbours to the south,"" said Premier Ford. ""Anti-trade policies negatively impact businesses and jobs in Ontario and the United States. By pursuing these new strategic agreements, we can build on our strong partnerships and unlock tremendous mutual economic potential.""  Premier Ford and Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, will discuss the trade strategy at a roundtable hosted by the Canadian American Business Council in Washington, D.C. If finalized, these agreements would create opportunities for businesses in a wide range of sectors and deliver real improvements in market access, job creation and investment. ""Our government must help make it easier for Ontario businesses to compete and succeed globally,"" said Minister Fedeli. ""Open and competitive contracting benefits businesses on both sides of the border. That's the message we brought to Washington, and that's the message we'll continue to bring to our American partners."" ""Ontario is the largest province in Canada and has the largest government procurement market in the country after the federal government,"" said Premier Ford. ""Our new approach to trade engagement would create significant job creation and investment opportunities for businesses in Ontario, and in the United States.""

Quick Facts

Ontario and the U.S. conducted about CAD$390 billion in two-way trade in 2018. 
Ontario is the #1 trading partner with 19 states and the 2nd largest trading partner with nine others.
Nearly 1 in 5 jobs in Ontario depend on trade. With over 1.3 million jobs supported by exports, Ontario’s jobs are the most export-reliant across Canada.

Ministry of Health


BOWMANVILLE — Ontario is expanding compassionate end-of-life care services for patients and their families by creating more palliative care options outside of hospital, which helps to end hallway health care and build safer and healthier communities. 
Today, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, was at the Bowmanville Older Adult Association to announce up to $800,000 in additional one-time capital funding to support the construction of four additional beds at Durham Hospice. This funding will bring the total number of hospice beds to nine. Once open, the province will provide $945,000 annually in operational funding to support end-of-life care for about 138 patients per year.  ""Our government is building more hospice beds to help patients and families receive the compassionate end-of-life care they expect and deserve as part of our plan to end hallway health care,"" said Elliott. ""Durham Hospice will provide patients in Durham Region with palliative care in a comfortable home-like space, where they can be close to loved ones."" In December 2018, Ontario announced up to $1 million in one-time capital funding for Durham Hospice to support the construction of five beds. The total combined capital funding is now up to $1.8 million. Durham Hospice will provide 24/7 professional nursing and personal support services, caregiver supports, grief and bereavement services, and pain and symptom management.  ""We are tremendously grateful to the Ministry of Health for their investment in new hospice beds in Clarington that will serve all residents of Durham Region,"" said Melodie Zarzeczny, Chair of Durham Hospice Clarington. ""With support from the ministry, elected officials at all levels, business leaders, businesses and residents across the region, we will soon be able to offer patients the end-of-life comfort, care and compassion that hospices encompass."" Ontario has a comprehensive plan to end hallway health care, which includes making investments and advancing new initiatives across four pillars: Prevention and health promotion: keeping patients as healthy as possible in their communities and out of hospitals. Providing the right care in the right place: when patients need care, ensure that they receive it in the most appropriate setting, not always the hospital. This includes expanding access to end-of-life, palliative care in communities across Ontario.Integration and improved patient flow: better integrate care providers to ensure patients spend less time waiting in hospitals when they are ready to move to more appropriate care settings, including hospicesBuilding capacity: build new hospital and long-term care beds while increasing community-based services across Ontario, including building and funding new hospice beds in Durham region.  "

Capital Markets Modernization Review 


February  6, 2020 12:00 P.M.

Ministry of Finance


Ontario's market participants have indicated that regulatory burden is stifling innovation and competitiveness in the province's capital markets.
Since the last review of the Securities Act in  2003, the global financial system has undergone significant changes,  particularly in response to the 2008 global financial crisis. There has also  been a rise of innovative financial technology (fintech) companies over the  last decade.  Market participants have long called for a more flexible regulatory approach in order to enable Ontario to compete globally. To move forward on the long-overdue review, the Ontario government is establishing the Capital Markets Modernization Taskforce. Ontario will undertake measures to modernize  and streamline securities regulation in a way that encourages innovation and  keeps pace with a rapidly evolving marketplace.  As almost 70  per cent of Ontario's capital market participants are small and medium-sized businesses,  a responsive regulatory framework is crucial to encouraging competitiveness and  innovation in capital markets.  The volunteer  members of the Capital Markets Modernization Taskforce will provide the  government with recommendations to reduce regulatory burden and ensure a level  playing-field for all market participants, while improving investor experience  and protection. The Taskforce will publish a public consultation document this  summer. Feedback will help inform the final report, which will be submitted to  the Minister this fall. This is part  of the government's plan to position Ontario as a leading capital markets  jurisdiction. The Taskforce will be  composed of the following members: Rupert Duchesne, former CEO and Director of Aimia Mr. Duchesne retired in 2017 from Aimia Inc, where he was the founding CEO and a Director.

Government taking steps to strengthen Ontario’s economy

February  6, 2020 12:00 P.M.

Ministry of Finance


TORONTO — Today, the Ontario government announced the Capital Markets Modernization Taskforce members who will review and modernize the province's capital markets regulations.
""Competitive capital markets are essential for a strong Ontario economy that benefits everyone. Ontario's Securities Act has not been updated in over 15 years and has not kept pace with rapid change in global capital markets,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. ""Ontario needs capital markets to attract and grow businesses that support and sustain an innovation economy that can compete for investment and talent worldwide."" First announced in the 2019 Fall Economic Statement, the Taskforce will help transform the regulatory landscape for the capital markets sector and advise the Minister on how to best help build Ontario's economy to benefit people across the province.  The Capital Markets Modernization Taskforce will seek input from stakeholders and provide the government with recommendations on: Fostering innovation in capital markets by improving regulatory structure;Reducing duplicative regulatory burden;Building a competitive economy for Ontarians by ensuring a level playing-field between large and small market players; andImproving investor protection. The Taskforce will have the support of an advisory group of experts with specialties in various areas of capital markets. The Taskforce will also build on the extensive burden reduction work already undertaken by the Ontario Securities Commission, Ontario's capital markets regulator. ""The industry has long called for a review of capital markets regulation,"" said Phillips. ""I thank members for volunteering their time and look forward to receiving the Taskforce's recommendations this fall on how the government can help ensure capital markets better support a growing and dynamic economy.""

Investing in Youth Wellness Hubs to Build Healthier Communities and End Hallway Health Care

February  6, 2020 11:16 A.M.

Ministry of Health


HALIBURTON — Ontario is expanding community-based mental health and addictions services for youth and young adults, so hospital emergency departments are not the only option for someone in crisis. 
Today, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, was joined by Laurie Scott, Minister of Infrastructure and MPP for Haliburton-Kawartha Lakes-Brock, to celebrate the grand opening of the Haliburton Youth Wellness Hub. The new hub will provide people between the ages of 12 and 25 with easy access to walk-in services such as mental health, addictions and crisis support, counselling, primary care and social supports related to employment, income and housing.   ""For the past year, we've been travelling the province to hear about the changes Ontarians expect to see in our province's mental health and addictions system,"" said Elliott. ""Investing in innovative solutions like the Haliburton Youth Wellness Hub, which fills an urgent gap in care, is another example of how our government is listening and delivering more accessible, coordinated mental health and addictions services for our youth and young adults. Our government is building a system that ensures every person in Ontario is supported throughout their journey towards mental wellness.""  The Haliburton Youth Wellness Hub will provide one-stop-shop support for 750 youth and young adults per year in Haliburton with coordinated mental health, addictions and social services, early identification and prevention, and seamless access to more specialized care and treatment, if needed.  ""The Haliburton Youth Wellness Hub will give area youth and young adults a safe and reliable place to get the mental health, addictions and social supports they need, and more importantly, a place to belong and call their own,"" said Scott. ""Every year, more than one million Ontarians experience a mental health or addictions challenge, which can impact their quality of life, including the ability to go to school or make a living."" Ontario continues to take a cross-government approach to build a better mental health and addictions system and will soon launch a new mental health and addictions roadmap that will meaningfully improve the care and services provided to Ontarians.  ""Working alongside service providers, parents and the community every step of the way has been and will continue to be a pivotal component to the success of the Haliburton Youth Wellness Hub,"" said Marg Cox, Executive Director at Point in Time - a partner organization of the Haliburton Youth Wellness Hub. ""Youth have been involved in writing the proposal, governance, choosing the space, the wall colours, outreaching to the community and their peers, and co-designing service pathways and programming options to ensure that this is truly a place that they have ownership of; that is relevant, welcoming and meeting their needs. Fostering a sense of belonging and community is especially important in a region as rural as ours. It has definitely taken more than a village to make this a reality."" Ontario has a comprehensive plan to end hallway health care, which includes making investments and advancing new initiatives across four pillars:  Prevention and health promotion: keep patients as healthy as possible in their communities and out of hospitals. Providing the right care in the right place: when patients need care, ensure that they receive it in the most appropriate setting, not always the hospital. This includes expanding community-based mental health and addictions services to alleviate pressures on hospital emergency departments.   Integration and improved patient flow: better integrate care providers to ensure patients spend less time waiting in hospitals when they are ready to be discharged. Building capacity: build new hospital and long-term care beds while increasing community-based services across Ontario, including expanding innovative, one-stop-shop models of community-based mental health and addiction services for youth and young adults in Haliburton.    

Quick Facts

The Haliburton Youth Wellness Hub is located at 12 Dysart Avenue in Haliburton. Youth between the ages of 12 and 25 can access walk-in services on Mondays from 1:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., and on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.  
The Haliburton Youth Wellness Hub has 29 partners to provide coordinated, wrap-around services for youth and young adults, including Point in Time Centre for Children, Youth, and Parents, Haliburton Highlands Health Services, Fleming Crew Employment Services and the Kawartha North Family Health Team. 
Ten youth wellness hubs have been established across Ontario and are located in Chatham-Kent, Eastern Champlain, Kenora, Malton, Niagara, North Simcoe, Scarborough and Toronto. These hubs are expected to support up to 12,000 young people experiencing mental health or addictions challenges.
For 2019-20, Ontario’s investment in youth wellness hubs is part of the $174 million more in annualized funding that the government has invested for mental health and addictions services, to fill urgent gaps in care. 
Ontario is investing $3.8 billion over 10 years to create new mental health and addictions services and expand existing programs.

Province Signs Memorandum of Understanding with Niiwin Wendaanimok (Four Winds Group)

February  5, 2020  4:00 P.M.

Ministry of Transportation


KENORA — Today, Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation, and Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines and Indigenous Affairs took further steps to deliver on the government's commitment to widen and twin Highway 17 between Kenora and the Manitoba border by signing a Memorandum of Understanding with Niiwin Wendaanimok, a partnership of four First Nations with interests in the project area. Widening Highway 17 will reduce travel times through highway corridors, critical trade links and international gateways, while promoting economic development and safety.
Under the guidance of Elders from the four First Nations, the Ministers participated in a Manito Aki Inakonigaawin (Great Earth Law) ceremony with Ogichidaa Francis Kavanaugh, Chief Marilyn Sinclair, Washagamis Bay First Nation; Councillor Billy Wahpay, Shoal Lake 40 First Nation designate; Chief Chris Skead, Wauzhushk Onigum First Nation; and Chief Lorraine Cobiness, Niisaachewan Anishinaabe Nation. This memorandum of understanding will guide the relationship and the engagement processes for the project in the spirit of co-operation and collaboration. ""The signing of today's agreement with Niiwin Wendaanimok is a key milestone for this important project,"" said Minister Mulroney. ""We are committed to maintaining a long-term working relationship with Indigenous communities in the Kenora area to ensure the successful completion of the project. We have a shared goal to create meaningful economic opportunities for local Indigenous communities and build better transportation in Northern Ontario."" ""Today, we are one step closer to twinning Highway 17 and improving road safety for the people of Kenora-Rainy River,"" said Minister Rickford. ""Twinning Highway 17 is a top priority for our government and I am proud to announce that significant progress is being made. Today's signing ceremony with the Four Winds Group marks an important milestone in the project, and we have a clear path forward to completion.""   The agreement on a collaborative relationship and process is an important and timely step for the Highway 17 project and a critical part of the province's continued inclusive and respectful consultation with First Nation communities. Ontario remains committed to targeting shovels in the ground on section 1 of the project by summer 2020, while taking the time to hear and address any affected rights and interests and mitigate impacts related to the project. Widening Highway 17 is part of the government's plan to build safer and better highways to get people and goods moving.

Quick Facts

The Niiwin Wendaanimok (Four Winds) Group is a partnership among the governments of Shoal Lake 40 First Nation, Washagamis Bay First Nation, Wauzhushk Onigum First Nation and Niisaachewan Anishinaabe First Nation.
Ontario is also engaged with Iskatewizaagegan #39 Independent First Nation on the project and continues to move forward with them.
Ontario is also engaging with the Métis Nation of Ontario and the public as part of the planning process for this project.
Ontario has also been engaging with Iskatewizaagegan #39 Independent First Nation about improving safety on sections of Highway 673. The upgrades involve improvements to horizontal curves along four sections of Highway 673.
The twinning/widening of Highway 17 between Manitoba/Ontario border and Kenora will be carried out through three sections: Manitoba/Ontario border to Highway 673 (6.5 km); Highway 673 to Rush Bay Road (8.5 km); Rush Bay Road to Highway 17A (25 km).

The project is entirely within the Treaty #3 (1873) territory.
Highway 17 is a strategic link in the Trans-Canada Highway system. There is no alternate route when there are collisions or road closures. Closures can significantly affect local, regional and national economic interests.
Approximately 5,000 to 7,500 vehicles travel each day on Highway 17 between the Manitoba border and Highway 673.
For the 2019-20 fiscal year, Ontario has committed more than $580 million towards the Northern Highways Program.

Education Workers' Alliance of Ontario Central Agreement Now Ratified


February  4, 2020 12:00 P.M.

Ministry of Education


The central agreement with the Education Workers' Alliance of Ontario (EWAO) representing 3,975 education workers across the province, including education assistants, early childhood educators, professional services, custodial and maintenance staff, has been ratified by school boards and the unions, and agreed to by the Government of Ontario. 
As the government did with the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) in November 2019, this central agreement with EWAO demonstrates the government's commitment to reaching deals that protect our children's futures and invest in their potential. The agreement was reached while respecting taxpayers, students and families, and recognizing the important contributions of front-line education workers. It reflects the government's commitment to a fiscally sustainable publicly funded education system.  Collective agreements between school boards and EWAO include both central and local terms. The central terms are now resolved. In order to complete the collective bargaining process, local terms need to be reached between each school board and its EWAO bargaining units. The three-year collective agreements will be effective September 1, 2019, through August 31, 2022.  HIGHLIGHTS OF THE CENTRAL AGREEMENT  Compensation and benefits: Under the agreement, EWAO education workers will receive a one per cent wage increase and one per cent benefits funding increase per year for three years.  Local Priorities Fund: Reinstatement of the fund that provides system priorities investments of $6.34 million annually for three years — of which, $5.76 million is for the special education staff in each year. This delivers on the government's promise to protect front-line services by restoring about 100 full-time equivalent EWAO positions, including education assistants, child and youth workers/counsellors, professional student services personnel, office, clerical and technical, custodial and maintenance education workers. Reducing absenteeism and reduce sick leave usage: The agreement includes a requirement stating that a medical certificate may be requested by the school board, and shall be provided by the employee, for access to short-term disability leave. Measures also give school boards the ability to seek additional medical information relating to sick leave or short-term disability leave usage.   Continued support for Community Use of Schools: School boards will continue to receive approximately $18,405 per year for three years to keep schools open outside of class hours for community use.

TORONTO — Today, Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education, issued the following statement in response to the ratification of the central agreement with the Education Workers' Alliance of Ontario (EWAO) and the Council of Trustees' Associations (CTA):  
""I would like to congratulate EWAO and the CTA for the ratification of the 2019-22 central agreement and express my gratitude to them for being reasonable at the negotiating table — a prerequisite to any deal. Like our deal with the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), our primary objective was to keep students in class and provide predictability and certainty to parents, students and educators alike.  Education workers play a critical role in promoting positive learning environments for students in all corners of our province — they help keep our schools clean and students safe. We have now delivered two ratified deals to date and will continue to work on securing deals with our remaining education labour partners to ensure students remain in class.""

Ministry of Colleges and Universities


The Honourable Elizabeth Dowdeswell, Lieutenant Governor of Ontario and the Honourable Ross Romano, Minister of Colleges and Universities presented the 2019 Polanyi Prizes to five young researchers pursuing post-doctoral studies at Ontario universities in recognition of their achievements in chemistry, literature, physics, economic science and physiology/medicine:
Chemistry Dr. Ramon Alain Miranda Quintana, Postdoctoral Science Fellow, Department of Chemistry, York University By studying compounds and materials, Dr. Quintana's research focuses on the design of new organometallic catalysts and superconductors and facilitates more efficient energy conversion processes. The research will shed light on innovative ways to process nuclear waste to preserve and protect the environment and support healthier and safer communities in Ontario.  Literature Dr. Audrey Walton, Assistant Professor, Department of English and Centre for Medieval Studies, University of Toronto In her research study, New Wine in Old Skins: Early Medieval Theories of Language and the Invention of Vernacular Literature, Dr. Walton examines sacred language, dialects and world religions and rewrites the first chapter in the history of spoken language in the European Middle Ages. Her research argues that the birth of popular religious literature in England took place, not in the 13th or 14th century, as is commonly supposed, but in the 7th. This research contributes to a recent scholarly conversation about the history of sacred languages and the rise of local speech.  Physics Dr. Maria Drout, Assistant Professor, Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of Toronto Dr. Drout is an observational astronomer who studies the lifecycle of massive stars and the origin of peculiar astronomical explosions. Through their intense radiation, powerful stellar winds and deaths as supernova explosions, massive stars create neutron stars and black holes, and produce the very elements of life. She uses ground- and space-based telescopes to study both stellar explosions and populations of stars in nearby galaxies. Her research exposes the origin of the heaviest elements on the periodic table and brings new discoveries in astrophysics to help Ontarians further understand the galaxy and their place within it.  Economic Science Dr. Abel Brodeur, Assistant Professor, Department of Economics, University of Ottawa Dr. Brodeur's research interests centre around the economics of crime and labour markets. His projects examine the economic causes and consequences of terrorism, as well as gender issues and female economic empowerment. His project on terrorism will shed light on whether media attention amplifies the economic consequences of terror attacks in the United States and whether poverty causes terrorism. The results will help him document the socio-economic characteristics of homegrown terrorists and test whether poverty and unemployment increase the likelihood to become a terrorist.   The second study on gender issues will explore the persistent effects of historical shocks on female economic empowerment.    Physiology/Medicine Dr. Mamatha Bhat, Assistant Professor, Medicine, University of Toronto Dr. Bhat's research aims to better understand the long-term survival rates of liver disease patients who undergo transplants. Short-term survival after liver transplantation has improved dramatically over time, however long-term survival has not. Transplant patients may develop other illnesses and complications post-transplantation such as liver cancer, fatty liver disease and post-transplant diabetes. Dr. Bhat's research has the potential to benefit the care of liver transplant recipients

Ontario Construction Safety Blitz Begins 
Inspectors Targeting Personal Protective Equipment as Part of Safety Push 

February  4, 2020  9:00 A.M.

Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development


TORONTO - Ontario workplace inspectors are launching a safety blitz focusing on construction sites, Monte McNaughton, the Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development announced. 
""We're doing this to save lives,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""One death on a jobsite is one too many. I want everyone in this province to know we're doing our best to ensure that their loved ones come home safe after a hard day's work.""  Inspectors will focus on personal protective equipment, which can include high visibility clothing, skin protection (like gloves), face shields, eye protection, and hearing protectors. Without this equipment, workers can suffer cuts, punctures, chemical burns, electric shocks, exposure to excessive noise or vibration, and many other harmful risks. The blitz, which runs until March 13, 2020, follows four weeks of outreach to the construction sector to educate and assist in safety compliance.  In addition to construction sites, Ministry inspectors will also visit roadwork projects.  ""Everyone has a role here,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""Employers have to provide equipment to their workers and workers have to wear it properly."" The blitz is part of the government's Safe At Work Ontario strategy. The goal is to improve worker health and safety by helping employers comply with the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) and its regulations.  

Quick Facts

The ministry issued 7,483 orders from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017 for lack of personal protective equipment on projects. This was the second highest Occupational Health and Safety Act violation in construction workplaces for 2017.
Twenty-five per cent of Ontario workers in the construction industry felt their workplace was not safe during the previous 12 months compared to 19 per cent across all sectors, according to a recent survey.

TORONTO - Ontario's government is putting students first by increasing funding to expand mental health services for postsecondary students across the province.
Today, Ross Romano, Minister of Colleges and Universities, at Ryerson University announced an additional investment of $1 million to help Kids Help Phone to expand Good2Talk/Allo J'écoute services in order to reach and support more postsecondary students.  Good2Talk is Ontario's bilingual mental health support service, providing professional counselling, information and referrals, and is available to all postsecondary students 24/7, 365 days a year. This investment will enable Good2Talk to offer help through Crisis Text Line powered by Kids Help Phone, a platform that provides trained volunteer support through text message, and will ensure students at Indigenous Institutes in Ontario are aware of this free service for all postsecondary students. ""Helping all Ontario's students maintain their mental health is critical to supporting student resilience and success. We know that over the last several years the mental health needs of postsecondary students have increased dramatically in Ontario,"" said Minister Romano, ""Expanding mental health supports will help reach more postsecondary students so they can succeed in their studies and set themselves up for future success in the workforce."" This investment builds on other investments made in the postsecondary sector to provide students with the supports and services they need and enables a more seamless partnership between the postsecondary sector and community mental health service providers. ""For the past year, we've been travelling the province to hear about the changes Ontarians expect to see in our province's mental health and addictions system,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""Expanding programs like Good2Talk is another example of how our government is listening and delivering more options for mental health services for Ontario students. We are taking a cross-government approach to build a mental health and addictions system and will soon launch Ontario's mental health and addictions strategy - a roadmap toward meaningfully improving the care Ontarians receive."" ""Our government is continuing to fulfill our commitment to make mental health and addictions a priority,"" said Michael Tibollo, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. ""Investing in students' mental wellness is part of a broader plan to build a comprehensive, connected and integrated mental health and addictions system that works for Ontarians throughout all stages of their lives. We look forward to working closely with our partners, like Kids Help Phone, to ensure that every Ontarian across the province can be fully supported in their journey towards mental wellness."" ""We are incredibly excited to be offering this critical service to postsecondary students across the province, knowing it has the potential to reach thousands of students looking for immediate support,"" said Alisa Simon, Senior Vice-President, Innovation and Chief Youth Officer, Kids Help Phone. ""We are proud of the tremendous difference Good2Talk has made over the years and know that by adding Crisis Text Line powered by Kids Help Phone to the suite of available services we can end the epidemic of emotional crisis that's affecting millions of young people every single year."" ""At Ryerson University, we know that a flourishing university community is one that supports its students in developing and managing their mental well-being,"" said Ryerson University President and Vice Chancellor Mohamed Lachemi. ""We are pleased to see this significant investment into important student focussed resources that will support our students, and all postsecondary students in this province, in managing their mental wellbeing."" Supporting mental health and wellness on campus is part of Ontario's plan to build healthier communities and a comprehensive and connected mental health and addictions system that ensures children, youth and adults have access to supports where and when they need them.

Today's announcement is a good next step.""  The funding will support: 16 pre-apprenticeship trainees for general carpenter and electrical trades at Canadore College.17 machine operator trainees for the local manufacturing sector through an Ontario SkillsAdvance Partnership between Canadore College, Yes Employment Services Inc. and eight local employers.30 personal support workers for the local health-care sector through an Ontario SkillsAdvance Partnership between Canadore College, District of Nipissing Social Services Administration Board and local employers. ""These funds will help people in this city and region - including young people, Indigenous people and women - find careers in industries where they are badly needed,"" Minister McNaughton said at Canadore College's Commerce Court Campus. The announcement comes amid a government marketing campaign highlighting the skilled trades as a viable career path. The ads, which use the slogan 'Find a Career You Wouldn't Trade,' are currently running online, in movie theatres and on Tim Hortons TV.  ""Careers in the trades are exciting, fulfilling and often very lucrative,"" said Vic Fedeli, Nipissing MPP and Minister for Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""We need to let young people know they are a viable first career choice. This is especially crucial as Ontario faces the looming problem of our existing skilled tradespeople retiring faster than we can replace them.""

""Over the past few days, the Government has further demonstrated our focus on keeping kids in class through a voluntary agreement. As part of that commitment, and to further underscore my public statements, we have affirmed in writing that we will be maintaining Ontario's world-class kindergarten program.  I have long said that compensation, pay, and benefits, remain a top priority for teachers' union leaders, and that remains true today. Even following our formal commitment to one of their publicly-stated priorities, ETFO leadership continues to advance compensation for their members over the protection of the education system for our youngest learners.  The Government has continued to signal reasonableness on issues from special education supports to efforts to counter violence in schools. Yet, the teachers' union leadership push for compensation that comes with a substantial cost to the taxpayer.   While the mediator has called off discussions for now, the Government stands ready to meet at any time, to reach a deal that keeps students in class.""

Ontario Confirms Third Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus 
Province Adds New Reporting Category to More Accurately Reflect Current Status

January 31, 2020  2:59 P.M.

Ministry of Health


TORONTO - Today, Dr. David Williams, Chief Medical Officer of Health, confirmed Ontario's third case of 2019 novel coronavirus. The case is located in London, Ontario.
Given the newness of the 2019 novel coronavirus and as part of the continuing cooperative efforts between Public Health Ontario (PHO) and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), Ontario has been sharing all test samples with the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg. As part of the National Microbiology Lab's efforts to ensure quality control, additional testing was performed on the samples provided. As a result of this additional testing, a case that was previously deemed negative by PHO's lab has now been found to be positive by the National Microbiology Lab, which uses a more sensitive test that can identify the smallest trace presence of the virus. The majority of cases previously considered negative have been confirmed as negative by the National Microbiology Lab.  To provide the public with the greatest certainty, Ontario's reporting will now include a new category that more accurately reflects the province's status: presumptive negative. That said, for any person found presumptively negative by the PHO lab, there is an extremely low risk of transmitting the virus. The newly confirmed case, a female in her 20s, arrived asymptomatic in Toronto on January 23, 2020 and was transported to London by way of a private vehicle. On January 24, 2020, the individual started to exhibit symptoms and that same day was assessed and tested at London Health Sciences Centre. She was released with follow up by the Middlesex-London Health Unit. This individual has had limited exposure to other individuals and has otherwise been in isolation since January 24, 2020, with regular contact by the Middlesex-London Health Unit to monitor her condition. She is now recovered and is well.  ""I want to re-emphasize that the risk to Ontarians remains low,"" said Dr. Williams. ""It is clear that we are learning more and more about the coronavirus each day, and our testing procedures are evolving and getting more and more precise, which is good news for everyone throughout Ontario and Canada. By working hand-in-hand with our partners across the health care system we are in a very good position to contain the virus and better protect the health and wellbeing of individuals and families across the province.""  While requiring validation by the National Microbiology Lab, PHO's lab will continue to offer the province's public health system an early indication of a case's status, allowing the province and local public health officials to quickly and effectively implement all necessary protocols to contain and treat any individuals who have 2019 novel coronavirus.

Today, Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines issued the following update on Ontario Energy Board (OEB) modernization:
""I am pleased to announce that the government intends to propose Mr. Richard Dicerni as the new Chair of the OEB Board of Directors. This appointment, if approved, will become effective when amendments to the Ontario Energy Board Act, 1998 under the Fixing the Hydro Mess Act, 2019 are proclaimed into force. These amendments will establish a new governance structure for the OEB. The government intends for this to take place in Spring 2020. In the interim, Mr. Dicerni will take on a Special Advisor role at the OEB. Mr. Dicerni will support the organization transitioning to the new governance structure, focusing on recruitment and organizational governance. Mr. Dicerni was previously the Head of the Alberta Public Service, and is a seasoned public sector leader. A Member of the Order of Canada, he has served on the board of Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd., led Ontario Power Generation, and provided leadership as a Deputy Minister for the Ontario and Canadian governments. Mr. Dicerni also served as Chair of the OEB Modernization Review Panel, which recommended the organization's new governance structure following extensive stakeholder engagement and thorough review of best practices from other jurisdictions. Strong leadership is critical to ensuring we have a modern, viable and sustainable energy sector. This is an important step towards ensuring the OEB continues to serve Ontarians effectively and efficiently while protecting consumers. Modernizing the OEB is part of our government's plan to build Ontario up by strengthening trust and transparency in the energy sector.""

Government Helping Over 6,000 People Explore Skilled Trades Careers at Conestoga College

January 31, 2020 12:15 P.M.

Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development


KITCHENER-WATERLOO - Ontario is addressing a potential skilled trades shortage by providing new funding to help people in the Kitchener-Waterloo area prepare for good jobs and careers in the trades. 
""On any given day, there are more than 18,000 vacant jobs in the Kitchener-Waterloo-Barrie region,"" said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""Those are paycheques waiting to be collected. But the workers aren't there. My mission is to bridge that skills gap in Kitchener-Waterloo and throughout the province. Today's announcement is the next step."" The government is investing $9.2 million through Conestoga College to provide in-class training to 6,200 apprentices in 21 trades in 2020-21. The increase of $1 million over last year will help an extra 632 people prepare for jobs. Classroom training complements the on-the-job work that apprentices do. Training will occur in four locations in Kitchener, Waterloo, Guelph, and Cambridge.  In addition, the government is investing almost $750,000 through Conestoga College to fund three pre-apprenticeship training projects for 60 young people. The funding will allow them to get started in trades such as Industrial Mechanic Millwright, Truck and Coach Technician, and Cabinetmaker.  Minister McNaughton made the funding announcement at Conestoga College today as part of a province-wide listening tour to hear from employers, skilled tradespeople and others in the sector.  Pre-apprenticeship training promotes careers in the trades for all Ontario residents. The training programs are free, last up to one year, and often combine classroom training with an 8-12 week work placement.   ""Ontario is facing a looming problem,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""Our skilled tradespeople are retiring faster than we can replace them. We need to let young people know that careers in the trades are a viable first choice. They're exciting, fulfilling and often very lucrative."" Today's funding announcement follows the unveiling of Ontario's new marketing campaign highlighting the skilled trades as a viable career path. The ads, with the slogan 'Find a Career You Wouldn't Trade,' are currently running online, in movie theatres and on Tim Hortons TV.  ""About one in five new jobs in Ontario over the next five years is expected to be in trades-related occupations,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""Exposing people to careers in the skilled trades and getting them the in-class training they need makes good sense: It helps businesses find talent and opens the doors for people who want to work.""

Quick Facts

For Statistics Canada’s Job Vacancy and Wage Survey, Kitchener-Waterloo is grouped with Barrie as an economic region. 
The government is investing $20.8 million this year into the pre-apprenticeship program to create training opportunities for over 1,800 people in the skilled trades. The program is delivered by Ontario colleges, private career colleges, union and non-union training centres and other community organizations. 
To find out about pre-apprenticeship training programs, contact Employment Ontario by phone, e-mail or live chat. 
On May 29, 2019, Ontario passed the Modernizing the Skilled Trades and Apprenticeship Act, 2019 to help transform the skilled trades and apprenticeship system, reduce red tape, and make Ontario open for business and open for jobs.

Ontario Receives Recommendations to Help Credit Unions Better Serve Members
Recommendations aim to reduce regulatory burden and modernize the credit union sector

January 31, 2020 10:30 A.M.

Ministry of Finance


GUELPH — The Ontario government is reviewing recommendations to help credit unions and caisses populaires better serve their communities. 
MPP Stan Cho, Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Finance, was at the Meridian Credit Union in Guelph today to announce recommendations to reduce regulatory burden and drive competitiveness and innovation in the credit union sector.  ""Credit unions and caisses populaires play an important role in communities across Ontario by helping families and businesses invest in their future,"" said MPP Cho. ""The legislation governing credit unions is outdated. A new framework would help credit unions be more agile and competitive, and better positioned to meet the needs of their members.""  A legislative review of the Credit Unions and Caisses Populaires Act was led by MPP Cho. Based on consultations with the public and industry groups, MPP Cho recommends that a modern framework for credit unions would aim to drive competitiveness and innovation while enhancing customer experience by:  Moving to a principles-based approach to reduce regulatory burden and enable credit unions to be more agile. Expanding business and investment powers to allow credit unions to offer more services. Improving consumer protection, by having the legislation reflect adoption of an industry-led Market Conduct Code.  The government is considering the Parliamentary Assistant's recommendations.  ""I want to thank everyone who participated in the review for their valuable feedback on making sure the unique and diverse needs of credit unions and their members are better represented,"" said MPP Cho. ""Modernizing financial services is part of our government's plan to foster economic growth and build a more competitive business environment in Ontario.""

Quick Facts

About 1.7 million Ontarians are members of a credit union or caisses populaires. 
Credit unions and caisses populaires are regulated by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario, the new, independent financial regulator.
The Credit Unions and Caisses Populaires Act requires a review of the legislation and regulations every five years and that the recommendations be made public.
The government released a consultation paper and engaged extensively with industry groups to receive feedback on reducing regulatory burden, increasing investment and improving consumer experience.

With this announcement, we're preparing our young people for the jobs of tomorrow, today."" ""In Brampton and throughout the province, there are thousands of jobs that go unfilled each day,"" said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development.

""Tomorrow marks the beginning of Black History Month. This is a time  to honour the legacy of all Ontarians of African descent, past and  present, and their remarkable contributions to our province's history,  culture, and social fabric. We join the African and Caribbean  community across the province in remembering and recognizing the many  achievements of Ontario's Black leaders. Their accomplishments are  inspiring the next generation of young Black leaders to help shape a  prosperous and thriving future for Ontario. Black History Month  also offers us an opportunity to heal wounds and shine a light on the  injustices committed against the Black community. Racism and intolerance  have no place in Ontario. Our strength as a province comes from our  diversity and inclusiveness, and we will continue to build an Ontario  free of discrimination and hate. From leaders in business, athletics,  the arts and research to trailblazers in public service like Lincoln  Alexander and Addie Aylestock, their tireless work on anti-racism has  broken down barriers for all visible minorities. I encourage  everyone to participate in the many events celebrating Black History  Month in their communities across the province and learn more about the  incredible contributions made by Ontarians and Canadians of African  descent — because Black history is our history.""

Ontario Maintains Commitment to Balanced Budget
Province Releases Third Quarter Finances

January 30, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Ministry of Finance


Today, the Government of Ontario reported that the province is still on track to a balanced budget while making life more affordable for individuals and families and helping businesses create good jobs with the release of the 2019-20 Third Quarter Finances.
The 2019-20 Third Quarter Finances provides an update on Ontario's fiscal outlook as of December 31, 2019. It is the first fiscal report since the 2019 Ontario Economic Outlook and Fiscal Review: A Plan to Build Ontario Together and the last fiscal report before the 2020 Budget. Each quarter, the government has delivered on its commitment to transparency and accountability in the government's finances by publicly releasing the province's quarterly fiscal update.  Key updates in the report include:  A deficit projection of $9.0 billion in 2019-20, consistent with the Fall Economic Statement and a $1.3 billion improvement from the 2019 Budget. Total revenue is projected to increase by $3.1 billion over the 2019 Budget, reflecting strong job growth, rising household incomes and strengthening home resales. Ontario's economy continued to grow in the third quarter of 2019. Real GDP grew by 0.6 per cent, following a gain of 0.8 per cent in the second quarter. Third quarter growth was supported by higher consumer spending, investment in residential structures and stronger exports. Interest on debt expense is projected to be $630 million lower in 2019-20 than forecasted in the 2019 Budget. Every dollar saved on servicing the debt is one more dollar that can go to ensuring the sustainability of services that the people of Ontario rely on.  Program expense is projected to increase by $2.5 billion higher than the 2019 Budget projection, demonstrating that the government is continuing to make life more affordable by helping Ontarians manage electricity costs and investing in health care, education and other social services.  Ontario's credit ratings were confirmed by all four credit rating agencies (Moody's, DBRS, S&P and Fitch), and Fitch also improved the outlook on the Province's rating to Stable from Negative. ""Ontario is making strategic investments in healthcare and education while ensuring tax dollars are spent responsibly and creating a more competitive environment for businesses and job creation,"" Phillips said. ""Ontario's plan to grow the economy is working. This fiscal update shows the Province is becoming more adaptable and stable in a sometimes uncertain world.""  The next fiscal update will be the 2020 Ontario Budget on or before March 31, 2020.

Quick Facts

The government’s Fiscal Sustainability, Transparency and Accountability Act, 2019 (FSTAA), requires that quarterly updates of Ontario’s finances be released on or before August 15th and February 15th of each year. 
Ontario’s net debt-to-GDP ratio for 2019-20 is projected to be 39.9 per cent, 0.8 percentage points lower than the 40.7 per cent 2019 Budget forecast. 
Since June 2018, 291,900 net new jobs have been created in Ontario.

Ontario Government Releases Winter 2020 P3 Market Update


January 30, 2020  9:00 A.M.

Ministry of Infrastructure


The Ontario government is using the public-private partnership (P3) model to make major infrastructure investments in projects across the province.  
In September 2019, Minister of Infrastructure Laurie Scott committed to increasing the frequency of P3 Market Updates (known in the market as updates to the ""P3 Pipeline""). ""Major"" updates in the spring and autumn will list new projects to be delivered using the P3 model, as well as revised procurement timelines. ""Minor"" updates in the winter and summer will not introduce new projects to the list but will provide the market with revised procurement timelines and project status updates. ""We know that our private sector partners in the infrastructure industry rely on the P3 Market Update to marshal their resources and organize their teams to deliver projects critical to the lives of people of Ontario,"" said Minister Scott. ""I look forward to working with them to build new hospitals, roads, courthouses and transit systems."" Today, Ontario released the Winter 2020 P3 Market Update. Changes reflected in the Market Update include: Grandview Children's Treatment Centre has advanced from planning to pre-procurement;As previously announced, the GO Expansion: Union Station Upgrade - Platform Expansion project now shows the project will be delivered using the ""Alliance"" model; and,There are procurement timeline updates to four projects.Changes to the P3 Pipeline are highlighted in accordance with the colour coding scheme shown at the bottom of the first page of the Market Update. The next update will occur following the provincial budget this Spring. ""I look forward to the release of the Spring 2020 P3 Market Update, which will contain new P3 projects to be delivered across the province,"" said Minister Scott. The public-private partnership (P3) model is part of the government's plan to build new infrastructure including transit, highways, schools and hospitals faster, improve productivity and help businesses get goods to markets.

Quick Facts

The P3 Market Update is a list of P3 projects to which Ontario has committed in the coming decade. The list helps potential local and global private sector partners organize their time and resources to make sure Ontario gets robust, innovative and competitive bids for its P3 infrastructure projects. 
The 2019 Market Update was the largest commitment to P3 infrastructure in Ontario’s history and included the marquee GTHA transit projects: the Ontario Line subway, the Scarborough Subway Extension (an extension of the TTC Line 2), the Yonge North Subway Extension (an extension of the TTC Line 1) and the westward extension of the Eglinton Crosstown LRT. 
Projects included in the market update will generate thousands of jobs in the skilled trades as well as in engineering, design and finance sectors.

While in Washington, Premier Ford and Minister Fedeli will meet with key American partners, including state governors.

""If Ontario were a country, we would be the U.S.'s third largest trading partner. Our government is advocating for Ontario businesses as we work to increase opportunities for trade, making it easier for our job creators to succeed.""

TORONTO — Today, Premier Doug Ford issued the following statement on the ratification of the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement by the U.S.:
""I welcome today's news that the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) has received final approval in the United States.

That's why we will be showing our support for Bell Let's Talk Day and encouraging people across the province to help end the stigma and start a conversation.  Let's talk about mental health. Let's talk about how we can take action personally, locally and provincially to help those who may be struggling. Throughout the day we will be listening to what the people of Ontario have to say, as we build a comprehensive and connected mental health and addictions system that makes it easier for people to get the services and supports they need. We know we can build a system that ensures every person in Ontario is supported throughout their journey towards mental wellness. That's why we'll soon launch Ontario's mental health and addictions strategy - a roadmap toward meaningfully improving the care the people of Ontario receive and building healthier communities.

Ontario is working closely with the Public Health Agency of Canada and local public health units to continue to actively monitor and respond to this emerging situation. Existing protocols have been strengthened surrounding the identification and control of the 2019 novel coronavirus in Ontario. Everyone should take comfort in knowing that our skilled health care providers are bringing their considerable experience to effectively monitor and respond to any reported cases, including the two confirmed cases in Toronto. To students who may be concerned about false information circulating online, the province has put in place new and trusted resources for you to stay informed, including a dedicated web page on the 2019 novel coronavirus. We want to assure everyone that the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Colleges and Universities are working in cooperation with our partners in both the health care and postsecondary sectors to ensure the continued safety and well-being of our college and university communities."" To help educate Ontarians about the 2019 novel coronavirus, how they can protect themselves and what to do if they suspect they may be at risk, the province has launched a dedicated web page.

Province Encouraging Postsecondary Students, Graduates and Apprentices to Consider Careers in Ontario’s Auto Sector 

January 28, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development


WINDSOR — Ontario's Government is investing $19 million in the next generation of talent for the auto manufacturing and advanced manufacturing industries to create more hands-on learning opportunities for postsecondary students, recent graduates and apprentices.
""Ontario's auto sector needs highly skilled people to master the challenges of economic change and stiff global competition,"" said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""Through this investment, we not only help our future engineers, designers, managers, technicians and tradespeople to apply their studies to real world problems, we also allow them to explore the auto industry as a career option."" As part of its Driving Prosperity Plan, the provincial government has released a call for proposals for a second round of hands-on learning projects. We are creating as many as 4,000 paid work placements between 10 weeks and 4 months. Automotive manufacturing and advanced manufacturing companies with a footprint in the auto sector, industry associations, postsecondary institutions, and other not-for-profit organizations are encouraged to submit proposals through the Transfer Payment Ontario website. The first round of the Career Ready Fund's Auto Stream created more than 1,000 learning opportunities for postsecondary students, recent grads and apprentices through projects by Toyota, Honda, Ford and Fiat Chrysler, as well as from the broader supply chain through Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association and the Canadian Tooling and Machining Association. ""Hands-on, experience-based learning is a critical part of educating the next generation of workers,"" said Ross Romano, Minister of Colleges and Universities. ""It provides employers and students the opportunity to build connections and ensure that our students are given the training and tools they need to be successful in their careers."" Today's announcement is another example of how the government is supporting Ontario's economy and creating more opportunities for people across the province.  ""Once again, Ontario's automotive and tool, mold and die sectors have demonstrated their steadfast commitment to skills training and we're delighted to continue this productive partnership as part of our Driving Prosperity auto plan,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""Ontario's highly skilled and productive auto workers are among the province's greatest assets as we advocate for new industry investment and production mandates with global auto makers."" ""The Career Ready Fund's Auto Stream helped to create permanent connections between the next generation of Ontario leaders and the limitless potential of its automotive sector,"" said Flavio Volpe, President of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association. ""This Fund bridges the most acute gap we all have to a sustainable future for our sector, and it ensures that the brightest talent finds a home within the province's biggest industry."" ""The core of any manufacturing operation is the skilled workforce. We are all aware of the current skilled trade shortages, and the demographic reality that it will get worse. This needs to change,"" said Tim Galbraith, Sales Manager at Cavalier Tool and Manufacturing. ""It has been refreshing to hear that Premier Ford's administration has made this a priority of the government. Access to, and funding of, the resources required to bolster the numbers of trades is imperative if Ontario is to maintain its leadership role as the manufacturing heart of Canada.""  The call for new proposals under the Career Ready Fund's Auto Stream will be open until February 25, 2020. Ontario expects to announce the successful proposals in Spring 2020.

Quick Facts

The first round of the Career Ready Fund’s Auto Stream provided $5 million in funding to recipients. Ontario is now investing $14 million in the second round. 
The fund will provide incentives to employers of up to $3,000 per placement or up to $5,000 for placements for participants with disabilities.
Experiential learning, sometimes also called work-integrated learning, increases the employability of postsecondary students because it gives them meaningful opportunities to apply their academic knowledge to real workplace problems.
The Career Ready Fund Auto Stream aims to create structured, meaningful work-integrated learning opportunities like internships.  
Increasing the pipeline of qualified individuals in the trades benefits the provincial economy by helping businesses in the sector meet their demands for talent, ultimately improving competitiveness and productivity of the industry.
More than 100,000 people are directly employed in Ontario’s auto assembly and parts industry with thousands more in spin-off jobs in communities across the province.
The auto industry contributes almost $14 billion to Ontario’s economy, representing around 2% of provincial GDP.

Ontario Establishes a New Framework to Continue Progress on Accessibility
Applying Cross-Government Actions to Advance Accessibility

January 28, 2020  9:00 A.M.

Ministry for Seniors and Accessibility


TORONTO — When a society is inclusive and barrier-free, people can fully participate in their communities. Making Ontario a province where communities and businesses are accessible for everyone benefits us all.
The government continues to build momentum in creating a barrier-free Ontario, but a lot of work still needs to be done to make the province accessible for everyone. That is why Ontario has developed a new framework informed by the recommendations made by the Honourable David C. Onley in the third legislative review of the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA), as well as input from key partners, organizations and people with disabilities. The new framework will make a positive difference in the daily lives of people with disabilities. Today, Raymond Cho, Minister for Seniors and Accessibility, announced Advancing Accessibility in Ontario at the Toronto Pan Am Sports Centre. This cross-government framework will help focus the province's work in four key areas: breaking down barriers in the built environmentgovernment leading by exampleincreasing participation in the economy for people with disabilities andimproving understanding and awareness about accessibility""We know that making Ontario accessible is a journey that cannot be completed overnight or alone. The Advancing Accessibility in Ontario framework will support our work with all of our partners across government and beyond to remove barriers for people with disabilities,"" said Minister Cho. ""Our government created a dedicated Ministry for Seniors and Accessibility because we are working towards a more accessible and inclusive province today and for future generations."" ""As I conducted the third legislative review of the AODA, it became increasingly clear that the people of Ontario wanted an all-of-government commitment to making Ontario far more accessible. This could not be achieved with a single stand-alone ministry attempting to resolve the problem alone,"" said David C. Onley. ""That is why I am pleased that the government is coordinating access activities and programs with multiple ministries in an all-of-government commitment."" The first area in Advancing Accessibility in Ontario - breaking down barriers in the built environment - shows how government is working with partner ministries and businesses to reduce barriers to accessibility for people with disabilities in the built environment and housing. For example, the Ontario Building Officials Association is receiving funding from the government's EnAbling Change Program to enhance its curriculum and training on accessibility. By making building officials more aware of the challenges people with disabilities face in accessing buildings and training them about areas of improvement, new and existing buildings can be planned and built to be more accessible.  There are several additional examples that illustrate progress and upcoming initiatives as the government continues its work towards making Ontario accessible. Ontario is committed to protecting what matters most to people with disabilities.

Quick Facts

There are 2.6 million people in Ontario that have a disability.


The government is investing $1.3 million over two years for the Rick Hansen Foundation to launch the Rick Hansen Foundation Accessibility Certification program in Ontario to help remove barriers in buildings. An update on the program will be announced shortly.
Further information on the other key areas in Advancing Accessibility in Ontario will be announced in the coming weeks.

That's why Ontario is working to develop new NOHFC programs that will:  make it easier for more people and businesses to applysupport more projects in rural northern communitiestarget both existing and emerging market opportunitiesprovide more work opportunities for Indigenous peopleaddress the skilled labour shortage in the north. ""We have heard from northerners who want NOHFC programs to be open to a broader range of businesses and workers so that the unique needs of Northern Ontario communities are met,"" said Minister Rickford. ""Through these proposed changes, Ontario's government will continue to build strong and resilient communities while supporting an environment where businesses can thrive, grow and create good jobs.""

""Teacher union leaders once again are breaking their promise to parents as they proceed with a full one-day withdrawal of services, province-wide. The consequences of union-led escalation are real, as families are forced to find child care on short notice.  Repeated escalation at the expense of our students, to advance higher compensation, higher wages, and even more generous benefits, is unacceptable for parents and students in our province. We firmly believe students should be in class, which is why we continue to stand ready to negotiate to reach a deal Ontario students deserve.""

""Throughout this review process I have been firm in saying that we want Black and racialized families in Peel and across Ontario to know that their government is listening and is fully committed to combating racism and improving equity and opportunity for their children.  I have met with Peel students to hear first hand their lived experience, and to better understand the challenges they face to an inclusive and positive educational experience. I have also met with the reviewers earlier this month to better understand their immediate observations of systemic anti-Black racism, and lack of adherence to governance, leadership, trustee conduct, and human resources practices. I believe students and families deserve better. It is my hope that the final report will build momentum for the transformational change racialized families are seeking, after a period of inaction.  I will continue to empower students - notably from racialized communities - to be a part of the solution, to have a voice, and to work collaboratively to eliminate obstacles to academic success and well-being.""

SARNIA — Ontario is addressing a potential labour shortage in the skilled trades by investing in programs that will prepare people in Sarnia for careers in the petrochemical, nuclear and other local sectors.
The funding supports more than 380 students in Lambton College's six in-class training programs, including its newly accredited construction boilermaker apprenticeship program. ""People in Sarnia and the surrounding region should take note. There is demand here for welders, millwrights, steamfitters, concrete finishers and boilermakers,"" said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""These are exciting, fulfilling and often well-paying careers. They are for people who want challenging, hands-on work that provides security, advancement and freedom to travel or become an entrepreneur.""  The programs that will benefit from the government's investment of $926,416 this fiscal year are: Instrumentation and Control Technician, receiving funding to train 37 apprentices.General Carpenter, receiving funding to train 112 apprentices.Steamfitter, receiving funding to train 102 apprentices.Construction Maintenance Electrician, receiving funding to train 94 apprentices.Welder, receiving funding to train 17 apprentices.Construction Boilermaker, receiving funding to train 24 apprentices. Minister McNaughton made the announcement at Lambton College to an audience of educators, administrators and boilermaker apprentices, one of Ontario's high-demand trades. He also announced that the college has been approved as a new provider for construction boilermaker training. The announcement comes amid a government marketing campaign highlighting the skilled trades as a viable career path. The ads, which use the slogan 'Find a Career You Wouldn't Trade,' are currently running online, in movie theatres and on Tim Hortons TV.  ""Ontario is facing a looming problem,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""Our skilled tradespeople are retiring faster than we can replace them. The funding for this new program will help alleviate the strain our trades sector is experiencing and keep Ontario Open for Business and Open for Jobs."" ""I'm proud of our government's announcement here today in Sarnia,"" said Bob Bailey, MPP for Sarnia-Lambton. ""We're doing our part to get people ready for jobs, quickly and efficiently.""

Quick Facts

Boilermakers build, install, maintain and repair boilers, tanks and pressure vessels in residential and industrial settings, including the local petrochemical industry in southwestern Ontario and at the province’s two nuclear generating stations. These tradespeople make up just one part of the province’s booming construction sector, and up to 40 per cent of current boilermakers are expected to retire in the next few years.  
The 2018 Ontario Auditor General’s Annual Report stated that between 2021-2025 Ontario will require 1,000 boilermakers for the refurbishment of Ontario Power Generation’s Darlington Nuclear Generating Station and Bruce Power’s Bruce Nuclear Generating Station, two of the biggest infrastructure projects in Canada.
Ontario recently announced a historic investment of $20.8 million into its Pre-Apprenticeship Program, an increase of $5 million from the previous year, to help introduce and provide free pre-trades training to over 1,800 people. Training is delivered by Ontario colleges, private career colleges, union and non-union training centres and other community organizations. To find out about programs in your area, contact Employment Ontario by phone, e-mail or live chat. 
Ontario also recently announced $12.7 million in funding for the Ontario Youth Apprenticeship Program, aimed at encouraging more high school students to consider the skilled trades as a viable career.

Today, Premier Doug Ford issued the following statement on International Holocaust Remembrance Day and the 75th Anniversary of the Liberation of Auschwitz:
""On this solemn day, the people of Ontario stand with Holocaust survivors and the Jewish community everywhere in remembering one of the darkest chapters in human history. Six million innocent men, women, and children were systematically murdered by the brutal Nazi regime. We pledge never to forget such atrocities. We stand watch to ensure such crimes never happen again. On this day, we find strength and comfort in knowing such evils were not allowed to triumph. We celebrate the many contributions of Holocaust survivors and the Jewish community to our province and to our country. We also remember those who fought for freedom, saved countless lives, and ultimately liberated those persecuted by the Nazi regime. To honour the memory of those we lost, we will remain vigilant against anti-Semitism, hatred, and intolerance in all its forms. We will continue to defend the right of every person in Ontario to speak, to worship, and to live without fear or threat of violence. Never again.""

Ontario Reviews Student Transportation to Improve School Bus Service for Students and Families 
Review Focuses on More Effective, Equitable and Accountable Transportation Service

January 27, 2020  9:00 A.M.

Ministry of Education


TORONTO — Sam Oosterhoff, the Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Education, today announced that the Government of Ontario is moving forward with a review of the student transportation funding formula to achieve a more efficient and accountable student transportation system and improve the transportation experience for students across the province. 
First announced in March 2019, the review responds to calls from student transportation partners to improve the funding formula, which could be more responsive to the changing needs and costs encountered by school boards. The review is also a follow-up to the Auditor General's 2015 value-for-money audit that recommended the government revisit the funding formula.  ""Parents and taxpayers deserve the most reliable and effective bus service possible, where every tax dollar we invest is maximized to benefit Ontario's students,"" said Parliamentary Assistant Oosterhoff. ""With student transportation costs projected to be over $1 billion this school year, it's critically important that we ensure value for money so we are better serving students in rural and urban communities.""    In order to allow student transportation sector partners to share their expertise, experience and ideas for the review, the ministry is establishing a Student Transportation Advisory Group that will meet with the Parliamentary Assistant and ministry staff over the coming months. Stakeholders and ministry officials will discuss the funding formula, as well as other topics, including consortia models and operations, and student transportation procurement. The government is approaching the review with three goals to guide decision-making:   Equity;Fiscal responsibility and accountability; and Evidence-based decision making. ""Every day, more than 830,000 students are transported back and forth from school safely, and on time, thanks to the terrific work of school bus drivers and the hard-working staff who support them,"" said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education. ""By launching this funding review with our sector partners, we are taking action to achieve a more efficient and accountable student transportation system that continues to deliver the high-quality service that students and parents can depend on.""

Quick Facts

In August 2019, the province announced the continuation of the school bus driver retention program which provides funding incentives for school bus drivers that provide continuous service throughout the year.
In the 2019-20 school year, funding for student transportation is projected to be more than $1 billion.
More than 830,000 students are transported each school day in Ontario.

TORONTO — Today, Dr. David Williams, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, announced Ontario's first presumptive confirmed case of Wuhan novel coronavirus in Toronto.
On Thursday, January 23, 2020, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre admitted a patient brought in by paramedics who presented with fever and respiratory symptoms. The patient was screened, recent travel history to Wuhan, China, was confirmed and the patient was immediately put under isolation. The hospital and paramedic service took all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of staff and other patients. Diagnostic testing was conducted, and specimens were sent to the Public Health Ontario Laboratory to confirm the diagnosis. On Saturday, January 25, 2020, the Public Health Lab confirmed the case as a presumptive positive case. ""All appropriate infection prevention and control measures were followed by both paramedics and the hospital,"" said Dr. Williams. ""Toronto Public Health is conducting case and contact management and Ontario is in touch with our federal counterparts to help determine exposure to other individuals on the flights."" Recently, to strengthen the province's ability to monitor any coronavirus cases, the Ministry of Health added novel coronavirus as a designated disease reportable under Ontario's public health legislation. Because of this, and other protocol and procedures that Ontario has in effect, the case was quickly identified and protocols for protection of health care workers and the public was immediately enacted. ""Although there is now a presumptive confirmed case of novel coronavirus in Ontario, I want Ontarians to know that the province is prepared to actively identify, prevent and control the spread of this serious infectious disease in Ontario."" said Elliott. ""I want Ontarians to know that their health and wellbeing is my top concern. Ontario has robust processes in place, skilled clinicians and dedicated health workers to identify and manage this and any future cases safely and effectively. We have specialized units within our hospitals to deal specifically with these types of cases when they arise."" The ministry has been and will remain in constant contact with the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and other jurisdictions to monitor the developing situation and safeguard the health of all Ontarians, as well as to ensure our shared efforts to protect the public are coordinated and effective. To help educate Ontarians about Wuhan novel coronavirus, how they can protect themselves and what to do if they suspect they may be at risk, the province has launched a dedicated webpage. Moving forward, each weekday this web page will be updated with the most up-to-date information on the number of cases under investigation and those that have been confirmed.

Ministry of Health


TORONTO — Today, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and co-chair of the federal-provincial-territorial health table, released the following statement on Ontario's preparedness for the Wuhan novel coronavirus following a joint call with her federal and provincial counterparts:
 ""While there remain no confirmed cases of the virus in Canada, the federal government is putting in place enhanced screening and detection measures at Toronto Pearson International Airport to further protect the health of the public from the Wuhan novel coronavirus. Today, I joined Patty Hajdu, Minister of Health for Canada, and my ministerial colleagues from each of the provinces and territories to share important information and further coordinate our joint efforts to protect the health and well being of all Canadians, including Ontarians, from the emerging issues of the Wuhan novel coronavirus. The federal government outlined their enhanced measures, which now include:  Screening questions at border kiosks will now include questions about previous travel to Wuhan, China in the past 14 days. A positive response would trigger an enhanced screening process, including sending the traveller to a Canadian border agent for further questioning about their health status. The border agent will determine whether the traveller needs to seek immediate medical assessment and treatment and, if so, EMS will transport the traveller from the airport directly to hospital. This screening will be done in Vancouver and Montreal as well.Fact sheets are also being developed in English, French and Chinese for people who have travelled to China and are not currently exhibiting signs of illness. These fact sheets will outline the symptoms that individuals should watch for and any next steps should they experience symptoms, including seeking an immediate medical assessment. The federal government's enhanced screening measures build on Ontario's robust and comprehensive protocols in place to actively monitor for, detect and contain any suspected cases of Wuhan novel coronavirus. The federal government's measures will further support my ministry, in collaboration with Public Health Ontario, local health units, hospitals and health care providers, to monitor the Wuhan novel coronavirus and contain any cases, should one present in Ontario. While the risk to Ontarians remains low, we will continue to be in close contact with the Public Health Agency of Canada and other jurisdictions to monitor this developing situation and safeguard the health of all Ontarians.  I'd like to thank all our partners for their on-going efforts in responding to this emerging situation. I want to reiterate our top priority will always remain safeguarding the health of the public, patients and care providers.""

Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines


Ontario's government is supporting Algoma University as it expands its facilities and programming to increase enrolment at its campuses in Timmins and Sault Ste. Marie.
Today, Ross Romano, Minister of Colleges and Universities and MPP for Sault Ste. Marie, on behalf of Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines, announced an investment of $97,125 through the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation (NOHFC) for Algoma University to develop a Campus Master Strategic Plan. The plan will help guide the university as it develops innovative programming and better infrastructure that supports education and research activities that align with today's industry needs. ""Our government is proud to help Algoma University enhance its learning environment to better support the development of a highly educated workforce,"" said Minister Romano. ""With this investment, we are reinforcing the north's competitive advantage and sending a signal to the world that Northern Ontario is open for business and open for jobs."" ""Today's announcement reinforces the ongoing commitment of the provincial government and the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation to support the efforts of Algoma University to position itself as a national leader in Truth and Reconciliation, as well as our efforts to quantify our economic impact and plan for future growth that will benefit the Algoma region and beyond,"" said Asima Vezina, President and Vice-Chancellor, Algoma University. The NOHFC promotes and supports economic development across Northern Ontario by providing financial assistance to projects - big and small, rural and urban - that stimulate growth, job creation and develop a skilled workforce. That's why Ontario is working to develop new NOHFC programs that will:  make it easier for more people and businesses to applysupport more projects in rural northern communitiestarget both existing and emerging market opportunitiesprovide more work opportunities for Indigenous peopleaddress the skilled labour shortage in the north. ""We have heard from northerners who want NOHFC programs to be open to a broader range of businesses and workers so that the unique needs of Northern Ontario communities are met,"" said Minister Rickford. ""Through these proposed changes, Ontario's government will continue to build strong and resilient communities while supporting an environment where businesses can thrive, grow and create good jobs."" Strengthening the north's post-secondary institutions is part of the government's plan to build Ontario together. Ontario's plan is creating more good paying jobs and opportunities in the North, and attracting new and expanded investment so northern communities can grow and thrive.

Quick Facts

Algoma University also received $25,000 through the NOHFC to host the fifth annual National Building Reconciliation Forum last October in Sault Ste. Marie, in partnership with Nipissing University, the University of Northern British Columbia, Cape Breton University and Shingwauk Kinoomaage Gamig. The forum brings together senior university officials and Indigenous leaders from across Canada to create meaningful and lasting institutional change in the higher education sector to advance reconciliation.
Since June 2018, the NOHFC has invested more than $148 million in 1,073 projects in Northern Ontario. This has leveraged more than $699 million in investment and created or retained 3,116 jobs.

Convicted: Magna International Inc. operating as Karmax Heavy Stamping, 337 Magna Drive, Aurora, Ontario, a manufacturer  of automotive parts.
Location of Workplace: The company's plant facility at 333 Market Drive, Milton, Ontario. Description of Offence: A worker fell and was injured while simultaneously carrying a part and climbing stairs to reach the top of a platform. Date of Offence: March 23, 2018. Date of Conviction: January 23, 2020. Penalty Imposed: Following a guilty plea,  Karmax was fined $60,000 in provincial offences court in Burlington by Justice of the Peace Karen Murphy; Crown Counsel Nicole Sylvester.The court also imposed a 25-per-cent victim fine surcharge as required by the Provincial Offences Act. The surcharge is credited to a special provincial government fund to assist victims of crime.    Background: On March 23, 2018, a worker was assisting another in carrying an automation feeder part while ascending two stairs to reach the top of a platform. The worker fell while ascending the second step, just prior to reaching the platform, sustaining an injury. A (then) Ministry of Labour investigation determined that the stairs were inconsistent in their rise. The height variances between adjacent stairs indicated that the worker would have stepped onto each step with a 1 inch (2.54 cm) or greater height difference. The riser height of the ground to the first stair measured 23.8 cm, the riser height between the first and the second step measured 17.78 cm, and the riser height between the second step and the platform ranged between 20.3 to 21.6 cm. A Ministry of Labour ergonomist concluded that the two-person lift-and-carry task required the workers' attention to be split between the safe handling of the automation feeder, lifting as a team, and ascending onto the platform. The attention required when performing a team lift - combined with the variances between adjacent steps - was a hazard with respect to tripping and falling on the stairs.      Given these circumstance, Karmax failed as an employer to ensure that the carrying of the automation feeder in tandem on the stairs did not endanger the safety of any worker as prescribed by section 45(a) of the Ontario Regulation 851/90 at the workplace, contrary to section 25(1)(c) of the Ontario Occupational Health and Safety Act.

Convicted - Quantex Technologies Inc.
Court Location - Kitchener Court Description of Offence -  In two separate matters, Quantex was convicted of violations related to permitting waste to pass from its control without accurately completing a manifest, for transferring waste subject to land disposal restrictions without giving notice to the receiver, and for permitting the emission of an air contaminant to an extent that it may cause personal discomfort. Date of Offence - On or about January 20, 2016 and August 15, 2016. Date of Conviction - June 26, 2018, with sentence varied on appeal on September 26, 2019.  Penalty Imposed - On September 26, 2019, the Ontario Court of Justice granted the Crown's appeal of the sentence that had been imposed on June 26, 2018 after a guilty plea, and increased the fine from $140,000 to $170,000, plus victim fine surcharge. On June 26, 2018, Quantex was convicted of three violations and was fined a total of $140,000 plus a victim fine surcharge of $35,000 with 2 years to pay.  The court also issued a probation order requiring the company to retain an independent auditor to conduct an embedded audit of some of the company's waste management practices. In December 2018, when the embedded audit was to begin, Quantex advised the Crown that it had sold the facility.  It subsequently became apparent that the company had sold the facility prior to being sentenced in June 2018 and that Quantex had provided inaccurate information to the sentencing court.  Therefore, the earlier sentencing had been conducted on the basis of inaccurate information.   As a result, the Crown appealed the sentence.  The appeal was resolved on consent when the appeal court varied the sentence to increase the fine from $140,000 to $170,000. The $30,000 fine increase reflected the anticipated cost of the embedded audit. The victim fine surcharge also increased from $35,000 to $42,500. The sentencing court also vacated the Order requirement that the company conduct the embedded audit. Background: At the time of the violations, Quantex Technologies Inc. operated a hazardous and liquid industrial waste transferring/processing site in Kitchener under ministry approval.In the first matter, between November 2015 and January 2016, Quantex accepted hazardous wastes which were bulked together and shipped to another waste processing/transfer facility. Ministry inspection indicated that the waste manifest did not accurately reflect the waste classifications and that Quantex had not notified the receiver that some of the waste was  subject to land disposal restrictions. As a consequence, the receiving facility was not aware that some of the waste had classifications that were not approved under the company's ministry approval.In the second matter, in August 2016, Quantex employees were transferring liquid industrial and/or hazardous wastes from storage totes into a tanker trailer on-site, and the truck's vacuum pump and exhaust was being discharged into the air. During the transfer period, neighbours experienced burning and irritated eyes, a chlorine-like odour and difficulty breathing. The occurrence was reported to Quantex, which ceased the operation immediately.The ministry's Investigations and Enforcement Branch investigated and laid charges resulting in three convictions."

LONDON - Ontario is tackling shortages in the skilled trades by supporting pre-apprenticeship projects that will prepare over 100 people in London for good jobs and careers. 
""In London and throughout the province, there are thousands of jobs that go unfilled,"" said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""Those are paycheques waiting to be collected. But the workers aren't there. My mission is to bridge that skills gap in London and throughout the province. Today's announcement is the next step.""  The Ontario government is investing in four London-based training programs for a variety of trades, including baker-pâtissier, construction worker, brick and stone mason and educational assistant.   Pre-apprenticeship training promotes careers in the trades as an option for all Ontario residents, including youth at risk, new Canadians, women and Indigenous people. The training programs are free, last up to one year and often combine classroom training with an 8-12 week work placement.  Today's funding announcement follows the unveiling of Ontario's new marketing campaign highlighting the skilled trades as a viable career path. The ads, with the slogan 'Find a Career You Wouldn't Trade,' are currently running online, in movie theatres and on Tim Hortons TV.  ""Ontario is facing a looming problem,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""Our skilled tradespeople are retiring faster than we can replace them. We need to let young people and their parents know that careers in the trades are a viable first choice. They're exciting, fulfilling and often very lucrative.""  The government recently announced a $20.8 million investment into pre-apprenticeship programs for 2019-20 to create training opportunities for more than 1,800 people across Ontario. The funding is an increase of $5 million from the previous year. Training is delivered by Ontario colleges, private career colleges, union and non-union training centres and other community organizations.   ""By investing in pre-apprenticeship training, we tap additional talent pools and give more people a chance to prepare for well-paying careers in the trades,"" Minister McNaughton said during an event at the LiUNA Local 1059 Regional Training Centre.  ""Careers in the skilled trades have been stigmatized for far too long — especially for women,"" said Jill Dunlop, Associate Minister for Children and Women's Issues. ""Only four per cent of those in the skilled trades are women. This funding will help us do better, and open up the skilled trades to a broader range of people.""    Local projects announced today for London include:  An  investment of $144,000 to help the Brick and Allied Craft Union of Canada  Local 5 offer 12 participants trades training for valuable careers as  brick and stone masons and construction craft workers.  An  investment of $549,580 to support LiUNA Local 1059 in offering a  combination of classroom training and work placements to help prepare 72  participants for jobs in the construction craft worker and cement finisher  trades.  An  investment of $131,135 to help Collège Boréal provide training for 11 people  in the London area and help them explore career opportunities as child  development practitioners and education assistants in schools and  daycares. An  investment of $99,888 to help the London Training Centre provide 12  participants with Smart Serve training, trade-readiness training and work  placements to prepare them for jobs as cooks, bakers and chefs.   ""About one in five new jobs in Ontario over the next five years is expected to be in trades-related occupations,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""Exposing people to careers in the skilled trades makes good sense: It helps businesses find talent and opens new doors for people who want to work.""

Quick Facts

There were approximately 9,600 jobs vacant in the London Economic Region and 23,600 in Southwestern Ontario in the third quarter of 2019, according to Statistics Canada’s Job Vacancy and Wage Survey. 
To find out about pre-apprenticeship training programs, contact Employment Ontario by phone, e-mail or live chat. 
There are over 140 skilled trades in Ontario. Retirements in the skilled trades are driving the shortage of skilled workers. In 2016, nearly one in three journeypersons were aged 55 years and over. 
On May 29, 2019, Ontario passed the Modernizing the Skilled Trades and Apprenticeship Act to help transform the skilled trades and apprenticeship system, reduce red tape and make Ontario open for business and open for jobs.

Investing Over $20 Million to Strengthen Community Safety in Peel
Funds will help build safer communities and support the fight against gun and gang violence

January 24, 2020  8:30 A.M.

Office of the Premier


MISSISSAUGA — The Ontario government is providing $20.5 million to Peel Regional Police to give police officers the tools and resources they need to increase community policing, combat gun and gang violence, and keep streets safe.
""Our government is doing everything in its power to fight gun and gang violence and build safer communities,"" Premier Doug Ford said. ""Today we are giving our men and women in uniform even more resources to target violent criminals and put them behind bars - where they belong."" Part of the funding will go towards Peel Regional Police's Community Mobilization Program. This initiative assigns police officers to small teams that work directly with members of the community on projects to improve public safety including neighbourhood watches, town hall meetings, and cultural community outreach. This initiative is part of the $195 million total investment the province is making over the next three years through the province's new Community Safety and Policing (CSP) Grant program announced last month. ""Our police services and their partners know best what they need to combat crime in their communities,"" said Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General. ""The investment we are making today in Peel Region will help deploy additional frontline officers and take action where and when it is needed most."" In addition, the stable and consistent funding will help support Peel Regional Police's fight against gun and gang violence as part of Ontario's Guns, Gangs and Violence Reduction Strategy. Both initiatives build on the investment Ontario has already committed to create an Intensive Firearm Bail Team in Peel Region to focus on prosecuting those involved in firearms offences in the Greater Toronto Area starting this year. ""We are escalating the local fight against gangs who prey on young and vulnerable people in Peel Region and other communities across Ontario,"" said Attorney General Doug Downey. ""Together, we are determined to keep families and communities safe by supporting local police and specialized prosecutors."" ""Public safety is the number one priority of Peel Regional Police,"" said Peel Regional Police Chief Nishan Duraiappah. ""This provincial funding will support our comprehensive approach to mitigating and ending gun and gang violence. We look forward to enhancing our response to this serious risk in our community."" ""On behalf of my Board colleagues, I want to thank the Premier and the provincial government for their investment in the resources required by Peel Regional Police to tackle escalating gun and gang violence in our Region,"" said Nando Iannicca, Peel Regional Chair. ""Today's announcement is another example of how we are working with our provincial partners to ensure we provide a safe and healthy community for all our residents.""

""Students across the province are continuously being hurt by union-led escalation. The withdrawal of services is impacting our students negatively and causing uncertainty and frustration for parents.  By withdrawing services, Ontario's students do not get the valuable support they need to be successful in their educational journeys. We continue to call on the teachers' unions to cease escalation, end these strikes, and focus on reaching a deal that keeps our students in the classroom where they belong.""

Convicted - Titus Ijsseldijk 
Court Location - St. Thomas Court Description of Offence -  The conviction relates to discharging or causing or permitting the discharge of a material, namely manure, into a watercourse, namely the West Shively Drain, which may impair the quality of the water. Date of Offence -  During the period on or about March 19, 2018 and ending on or about March 19, 2018.  Date of Conviction - October 28, 2019  Penalty Imposed - On October 28, 2019, Titus Ijsseldijk was convicted on one violation under the Ontario Water Resources Act and was fined $40,000 plus a victim surcharge of $10,000 and was given 90 days to pay the fine.   Background:   Ijsseldijk Dairy is owned/operated by brothers Titus (""Tino"") and Petrus Paulis Maria (""Paul"") Ijsseldijk and is located in the County of Elgin.    In the summer of 2017, Ijsseldijk Dairy constructed a new earthen storage lagoon for liquid manure at the property.  Under legislation, lagoons are required to meet specific requirements for design, construction and usage and be supervised by a professional engineer.  In March 2018, the ministry received an anonymous call that manure was entering Catfish Creek near the town of Aylmer. Ministry staff responded to the area and took water discharge samples.  Surface water testing at the discharge from the tile to the drain found levels of e. coli that exceeded the ministry's provincial water quality objectives, thus confirming impact to the quality of the water.  The discharge was traced to a recently constructed earthen manure lagoon at the Ijsseldijk farm.  Subsequent excavation uncovered six drainage tiles that were connected to the earthen lagoon, in contravention of design and usage requirements.  Evidence indicated that the defendants had failed to obtain the services of a qualified engineer and to have the lagoon properly designed, sited and constructed.  A ministry investigation resulted "

AURORA — The Ontario government is putting people's safety first by investing $450,000 over two years to ensure the Crime Stoppers toll-free telephone tip line can continue to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
""For decades, Crime Stoppers has played an important role in making sure anyone can share information about criminal activity with the police at any time, on any day,"" said Christine Hogarth, Parliamentary Assistant to Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General. ""Public safety is our priority. Our government will continue providing our community safety partners, like Crime Stoppers, with the supports they need to help us keep Ontario communities safe.""

""The funding support provided by the Province of Ontario is appreciated and will assist in making all Crime Stoppers programs more accessible to citizens.""  ""The financial support provided by the province is critical to Crime Stoppers programs across Ontario,"" said David Forster, Past President of the Ontario Association of Crime Stoppers. ""The ability to contract services to allow for 24/7 monitoring of phone and web tips ensures that the public has the ability to report information on criminal activity at any time.""  ""Everyone has a role when it comes to community safety,"" said Minister Jones. ""Sharing tips with the police through Crime Stoppers is just one way individuals can help keep our communities safe. Our society is at its best when we work together and collaborate, so everyone should do their part.""

January 22, 2020  3:37 P.M.

Ministry of Health


TORONTO — Today, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, released the following statement on Ontario's preparedness for the new coronavirus in Ontario:
""I want Ontarians to know that their health and wellbeing is my top concern. While the risks posed by this new coronavirus to Ontarians remain low, the province is actively monitoring and is fully prepared to respond. To date, there have been no confirmed cases in Canada. Today, to strengthen the ministry's ability to monitor any coronavirus cases, our government is adding novel coronavirus as a designated disease reportable under Ontario's public health legislation. Now, physicians, hospitals and other care facilities will be required to report a suspected or confirmed case of the new coronavirus to their local medical officer of health. The local public health unit can then quickly and effectively take all necessary measures to investigate, complete lab tests, and do case and contact management to prevent and control further spread of the infection. Ontario's reporting requirements now align with British Columbia and Alberta. Given the recent media coverage, it is also important to note that Ontario's integrated health system today is far more prepared to respond to any potential health risks than in the past. We now have mechanisms in place, which have strengthened how health care providers work together and coordinate responses to emerging public health issues, such as this new virus. Significant investments in our public health and infection prevention and control systems have been made, including the creation of Public Health Ontario. All Ontarians should take comfort in knowing that our skilled health care providers are bringing their considerable experience to effectively monitor and, should it be needed, respond to this emerging situation. My ministry, in collaboration with Public Health Ontario, local public health units, hospitals and other health care providers, will continue to diligently monitor this emerging situation to ensure that Ontario is prepared to identify, contain and treat any potential cases of this virus so that we can continue to build and protect healthy and safe communities. Again, I want to reiterate our top priority will always remain safeguarding the health of the public, patients and providers. These changes announced today support this commitment to protecting Ontarians.""

Convicted - Andrew Martin
Court Location - Kitchener Court Description of Offence - The conviction relates to permitting the discharge of silage seepage into or in a roadside ditch that ultimately flowed into Boomer Creek, which may have impaired the quality of the waters.  Date of Offence - On or about August 3, 2017.  Date of Conviction - December 4, 2019 Penalty Imposed - The defendant was convicted of one violation under the Ontario Water Resources Act and was fined $10,000 plus victim fine surcharge of $1,500 with 120 days to pay. Background:   Andrew Martin is the owner of a rural agricultural property on Manser Road in Waterloo. During the period when the violation occurred, Mr. Martin was growing crops on-site to produce silage to feed cattle.   In August 2017 the ministry was notified of a fish kill and the presence of a black sludge in Boomer Creek in the Township of Wellesley. Officers and members of the public observed dead fish, sludge and there was a rotting odour. Water samples were taken for laboratory analysis.    Officers traced the source of the black sludge to Mr. Martin's farm, and upon site inspection observed seepage leaking from a silo and into barn floor drains. The drain output was later traced to a field drain that eventually flowed into Boomer Creek.    According to evidence , Mr. Martin had deposited fresh cut plants into the on-site silo on July 28 and 29, 2017 without being field wilted to allow for drainage of excess moisture.    The discharge was stopped on August 3, 2017.    Laboratory testing results indicated that the discharge initiated a series of responses within the waters, that allowed for accelerated plant growth resulting in an algal bloom. This impaired the habitat for fish, invertebrates and other aquatic life in the creek.       The ministry's Investigations and Enforcement Branch investigated and laid charges resulting in the conviction.

Death of Worker, Injuries to Others Result in $175,000 Fine to Windsor Concrete Manufacturer

Convicted: Prestressed Systems Inc. (PSI Inc.), 4955 Walker Road, Windsor, Ontario, a manufacturer of pre-stressed and pre-cast concrete products.
Location of workplace: 5058 Walker Road, Windsor, Ontario. Description of Offence: One worker was killed and another seriously injured when anchor plates being used in the construction of a bridge girder slid from their supports and failed, striking the workers.  Date of Offence: April 12, 2018.  Date of Conviction: January 20, 2020.  Penalty Imposed:  Following a guilty plea, PSI Inc. was fined $175,000 in provincial offences court in Windsor by Justice of the Peace Susan Hoffman; Crown Counsel Steven Succi.The court also imposed a 25-per-cent victim fine surcharge as required by the Provincial Offences Act. The surcharge is credited to a special provincial government fund to assist victims of crime.  Background:  Workers were working on the concrete form for a large pre-stressed bridge girder that PSI had been hired to manufacture for the Nagagami River Bridge project. The process of pre-stressing concrete is a means of increasing the strength of a concrete structure, using tensioned steel cable strands embedded inside the concrete.Strands of cable are passed through a concrete form and secured to anchor plates and anchor grips. After the concrete cures around the stressed cables, the exposed ends of the cables are relaxed (de-tensioned) and released (cut).To take the tension off the cables, hydraulically powered cylinders are used, and support sleeves are manually removed by workers. During this process, the cable strands act like big elastic bands; when the cable strands are stretched and held, they hold a large amount of stored energy, and proper de-tensioning equipment and procedures are needed to safely remove the tension from the cable strands.Four workers were removing the support sleeves from the cylinders when anchor plates - to which the still-stressed cable strands were attached - suddenly failed and struck two of the workers. One of the workers died, another sustained multiple injuries and two others survived without significant physical injury.The (then) Ministry of Labour's investigation determined that one of the key contributing factors to the incident was the company's failure to use a wire guide on the de-tensioning end of the cable strands as required by the manufacturer of the de-tensioning equipment. Because no wire guide was in place, the anchor plates slid from their supports and catastrophically failed.Failure to use the required wire guide constitutes a contravention of section 25(2)(h) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, which states that ""an employer shall take every precaution reasonable in the circumstances for the protection of a worker.""

Statement from the Minister of Infrastructure


January 22, 2020 12:30 P.M.

Ministry of Infrastructure


On behalf of the Government of Ontario, I would like to thank Ehren Cory for his outstanding service to the people of Ontario as the CEO of Infrastructure Ontario over the past three years. Ehren announced earlier today that he will be leaving Infrastructure Ontario this spring to return to the private sector. While his appointment was set to expire next month, he has agreed to stay on until April 30th. This will allow time for our Government and IO's Board of Directors to put in place next steps.
Infrastructure Ontario is internationally recognized for its track record in successfully delivering large, complex projects. Its lending program has advanced more than $10 billion in affordable, long-term financing to municipalities, universities and other eligible public sector and non-profit organizations. IO also modernizes and enhances the government real estate portfolio through asset planning, facilities contract management, and real estate advisory services. I am proud of the strong leadership that Mr. Cory has provided since our government was elected in 2018. Under his watch, IO has continued to grow its impact and value as a Government agency and has successfully delivered billions of dollars of public infrastructure that is critical to the lives of the people of Ontario. Ehren has also been critical to ensuring that IO is well positioned to succeed on the next generation of infrastructure projects, including the hospitals, roads, courthouses and subway projects on the $65B ""P3 Pipeline"" that Ehren and I announced last fall - the largest in Ontario's history. On a personal note, I would like to thank Ehren for being a trusted partner and advisor as I took on the privilege of serving as Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure. His in-depth knowledge of Ontario's infrastructure market and ability to bring a private sector perspective to government has been indispensable. He should be proud of the work he has done for the people of Ontario and I wish him all the best in his future endeavours.

Historic Agreement for French-Language in Ontario
Joint Federal-Provincial Funding Agreement for the Université de l’Ontario français

January 22, 2020 12:00 P.M.

Ministry of Colleges and Universities


TORONTO — Today, Ross Romano, Minister of Colleges and Universities, Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Francophone Affairs and Mélanie Joly, Federal Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages, signed a historic funding agreement on behalf of the governments of Ontario and Canada to support the Université de l'Ontario français, the first French-language university governed by and for Ontario Francophones.
The Université de l'Ontario français will be supported by an investment of $126 million over eight years. The agreement confirms that the Government of Canada will assume up to 50 per cent of the total investment in the project, a total of $63 million over five years. The Government of Ontario has committed to matching this amount. ""We are excited to be able to move forward with full implementation of the Université de l'Ontario français,"" said Minister Romano. ""Our government has always been committed to the university and to supporting access to the education and training needed for rewarding careers and meeting labour market demands for Ontario's Francophone students."" In early September 2019, the governments of Canada and Ontario signed a Memorandum of Understanding formally committing to work together to establish the Université de l'Ontario français. Since then, the governments have continued discussions to successfully complete an eight-year funding agreement. With this agreement both governments affirm their commitment to addressing the needs of the more than 620,000 Francophones in Ontario. ""The Université de l'Ontario français is an important and long awaited-for project, critical to future generations of Franco-Ontarians,"" said Minister Mulroney. ""The new university is a great example of our government's commitment to strengthening the Francophone community, investing in its future and ensuring the community's continued contribution to Ontario's prosperity."" ""This is an historic day for Franco-Ontarians and Francophones all across Canada,"" said Minister Joly. ""It is an unprecedented step that will make a difference in the lives of thousands of Canadians who will now have the opportunity to pursue higher education in French here in Ontario and will unite francophones from all regions of our country."" ""We are delighted to achieve this historic milestone and to welcome, as planned, the first cohorts in the fall 2021,"" said Dyane Adam, Chair of the Board of Governors for Université de l'Ontario français. ""I want to thank the provincial and federal governments for their leadership and support and look forward to welcoming Ontario's Francophone students to the Université de l'Ontario français.""

Quick Facts

The Université de l’Ontario français will be located in Toronto and will open for its first cohort of students in September 2021.

Funding will help small, rural municipalities deliver smarter government services

January 21, 2020  3:00 P.M.

Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing


TORONTO — Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, announced 27 joint projects to be funded through the Municipal Modernization Program at the 2020 Rural Ontario Municipal Association (ROMA) conference which wrapped up in Toronto today.
""Our government is working with our municipal partners to make life more affordable, deliver smarter government services, create a more competitive business climate and build rural Ontario together,"" said Clark. ""I'm pleased so many municipalities are working together on these joint projects that will help deliver more efficient services for local people and businesses in Ontario's small and rural communities."" The application-based Municipal Modernization Program is open to Ontario's 405 small and rural municipalities to help them find better, more efficient ways to operate and serve their residents. More than 300 projects were submitted in the first intake of the program and proposals are currently being reviewed. The initial government investment will support 27 joint projects involving over 130 municipalities to conduct service delivery reviews aimed at finding efficiencies and lowering costs in the longer term.  These reviews will help municipalities work together to identify opportunities for shared services and other ways to modernize local services to ensure taxpayers dollars are being used effectively and efficiently. For example, the Municipality of Charlton and Dack and the Township of Chamberlain used previous modernization funding to consolidate their offices. They now share space, equipment and an IT server and rent out the unused Chamberlain office to create revenue. Premier Doug Ford, ministers and parliamentary assistants joined hundreds of municipal officials at the annual ROMA conference to discuss shared priorities, including health care, infrastructure, and improving internet access and cell connectivity in rural communities. This year, government officials met with more than 350 delegations. At the conference, Premier Ford also announced a new intake of the Rural Economic Development program to help create jobs and support economic growth in rural Ontario. The province also hosted a roundtable discussion with rural stakeholders on economic development in their regions - the first in a series to be held across rural Ontario. ""Ontario's rural communities are an integral part of our province and make incredible contributions to our economy,"" said Ernie Hardeman, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. ""I'm proud our government is constantly striving to help rural Ontario succeed, including protecting farmland, improving broadband access and encouraging economic development.""    The government is also supporting small and rural municipalities by: Maintaining the funding envelope for the 2021 Ontario Municipal Partnership Fund at $500 million. Investing $200 million through the Ontario Community Infrastructure Fund to repair local roads, bridges, water and wastewater infrastructure.Releasing Connecting the Southwest: A Transportation Plan for Southwestern Ontario - our government's plan to deliver an integrated transportation system for the region.Providing up to $130 million for new projects under the Natural Gas Expansion Program.Investing $175 million through the Health Infrastructure Renewal Fund to help repair and upgrade 131 hospitals across the province.""Rural and northern municipal governments welcome additional provincial funding to invest in joint modernization efforts,"" said Allan Thompson, ROMA Chair. ""With limited staff and resources, these funds will go a long way to help make municipal services better and more efficient.""

Quick Facts

Ontario is providing up to $125 million through 2022/23 through the Municipal Modernization Program to help small and rural municipalities lower costs and improve services. 
Ontario is investing more than $480  million in rural, northern and public transit infrastructure projects under the Investing  in Canada Infrastructure Program. The province also nominated  350 rural, northern and public transit infrastructure projects to the  federal government for funding.

Highest Grade on Removing Regulatory Obstacles the Province Has Ever Received, Second Year in a Row

January 21, 2020 10:30 A.M.

Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade


TORONTO — For the second straight year, Ontario has received the province's highest grade ever in an annual report card that evaluates governments across Canada on their progress in easing regulatory burdens on job-creating businesses.
Ontario's progress includes making it easier for community programs to provide food to those in need; conducting multiple inspections at once so truck drivers spend less time waiting and more time delivering goods or home with their families; and protecting seniors and families from drug shortages by easing burdens on drug makers. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) gave Ontario an A- in its 2020 Red Tape Report Card. The CFIB praises the Government of Ontario for maintaining red tape reduction as a top priority under the leadership of Premier Doug Ford. It commends the appointment last June of Prabmeet Sarkaria to a newly created position as Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction, with a clear mandate to reduce red tape and update regulations across government. ""I'm proud that the CFIB has recognized our work in providing regulatory relief to Ontario businesses. More importantly, I am pleased for the thousands of job-creating businesses our work is enabling to grow and extend new opportunities and higher wages to hard-working Ontarians,"" said Sarkaria. ""We need regulations to keep people safe and healthy and protect the environment, but that doesn't mean businesses should have to jump through unnecessary hoops to comply with them. That's why we've been working hard to eliminate regulations that are outdated, cumbersome or no longer needed, while making the rules that we do need clear, focused and effective."" The CFIB recognized Ontario's launch last October of a dedicated webpage that allows businesses and Ontarians to submit ideas and propose solutions on how the province can reduce red tape and modernize regulations. It also highlighted the government's work in passing two high-impact burden reduction bills: the Restoring Ontario's Competitiveness Act and the Better for People, Smarter for Business Act. All of these measures have been taken to restore Ontario's competitive advantage, welcome investment and give job creators the boost they need to continue to grow Ontario's economy. ""We congratulate the Ontario government for achieving two consecutive A- grades,"" said Julie Kwiecinski, Director of Provincial Affairs for Ontario at CFIB. ""This outstanding accomplishment is a testament to the government's continued leadership and commitment to making it easier to do business in Ontario. Maintaining such a high grade isn't easy. The report card evaluates red tape reduction efforts using very stringent criteria, including strong political leadership, a comprehensive public measure of regulatory burden and a clear cap on government rules.""

Quick Facts

CFIB is Canada’s largest association of small and medium-sized businesses. It has 110,000 members, including over 42,000 in Ontario.
Since 2011, CFIB has published an annual Red Tape Report Card to hold Canada’s federal, provincial and territorial governments accountable for what CFIB’s surveys show is one of its members’ biggest headaches: excessive regulations.
Ontario’s 2020 A- grade continues the progress from the 2019 A- grade — a marked improvement from the C+ grade Ontario earned in 2018 under the previous government.
The Ontario government has taken over 200 actions to reduce regulatory burdens.
Ontario’s Better for People, Smarter for Business Act and other changes announced previously are projected to save Ontario businesses over $338 million per year in costs once fully implemented — well on the way to meeting the June 2020 target of $400 million.
Since June 2018, Ontario has added more than 296,000 jobs by creating a competitive businesses environment with low taxes and greater investment opportunities.

Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing


Check against delivery
Good afternoon. Thank you, Allan [Thompson, ROMA Chair and Mayor of Caledon]. It's a pleasure to be here with you today. My parliamentary assistants, Parm Gill and Jim McDonell, have been helping with some of the delegations, and I want to thank them for that ... and for their ongoing support. I'd also like to thank my Cabinet colleagues who are here ... and for taking part in so many delegations. This is an important opportunity for us to stay connected with you. The advice and input we receive here — and from ROMA and AMO throughout the year — is invaluable. So, thank you for the ongoing conversations and the new ideas ... And for helping to keep the concerns and daily realities of Ontario's rural communities top of mind. In November, we released our Fall Economic Statement. In it, my colleague, Rod Phillips, our Minister of Finance, outlined our plan to Build Ontario Together by... Connecting people to places ... building healthier, safer communities ... making life more affordable ... preparing people for jobs ... creating a more competitive business climate ... and making government services smarter. Those are our government's priorities, and things I know we can all support. When it comes to turning government plans into reality, you know better than anyone that municipalities play a key role because you are at the front lines serving people in communities across Ontario. To help, we announced 2020 Ontario Municipal Partnership Fund allocations earlier than ever — in time for your budget cycle. And earlier today, Minister Phillips announced we will maintain the $500-million funding envelope for 2021. Last March, we announced $200 million to help Ontario's 405 small and rural municipalities improve local service delivery and find efficiencies. I remember what it's like to work for a small municipality — you have great ideas, but they can be challenging to implement without some help. Your capacity can be limited. So, we provided that funding to help turn your ideas into reality. And there are already great examples across the province. For example, the Township of Warwick used their modernization funding to install a new system at their arena so they can use tap-temperature water to make and maintain ice — instead of hot water. By reducing greenhouse gas emissions and saving on energy, this means the system will pay for itself in four years. Results like these are fantastic — and I'd like to encourage all of you to make sure the modernization funding you received is put to good use. And because we know municipalities are important partners... ... in October, we expanded both the Audit and Accountability Fund for large municipalities and the Municipal Modernization Program for smaller ones. In fact, since ROMA last January, we have announced $350 million in new money to help municipalities find efficiencies, reduce costs and improve services. This includes an extra $125 million for Ontario's small and rural municipalities. This time, the funding is application-based and will help you conduct new service delivery reviews ... implement recommendations ... and undertake projects that will help you operate effectively and better serve your residents. Our government is investing in local governments so that you can better serve your communities and keep taxes low. Some of you are already taking up the challenge — we received more than 300 projects in this first intake — including 27 joint projects. Today I am pleased to announce that, as a first step, all 27 of the joint projects will receive funding. We will invest up to $2.6 million so more than 130 small and rural municipalities can begin working together — immediately — to conduct service delivery reviews, find efficiencies and lower costs. I'm excited to see collaboration between municipalities and I look forward to seeing these joint projects get underway and produce results as soon as possible. As you know, the financial situation our government inherited was a real challenge. But investing in our municipal partners is a key priority for us... And, I'm calling on you to demonstrate results ... and make sure every dollar counts. Another key challenge smaller and rural communities face is Connecting People to Places. And we want to help to address that concern. To date, Ontario has nominated more than 350 projects to the federal government worth $480 million in provincial funding for rural, northern, and public transit infrastructure projects under the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program.   And through Connecting Links we're providing another $30 million this year to help repair or rebuild municipal roads and bridges. We're covering up to 90 per cent of the costs — and successful applicants for the next round will be announced in the spring. We're also working with you to Build Healthier, Safer Rural Communities. Last fall — in response to requests from municipal officials and service organizations — we helped clear the way for the construction of what will be one of the largest retirement and long-term care facilities in Simcoe County ... by issuing a Minister's Zoning Order to streamline the development. It will give hundreds of seniors in Barrie and Innisfil a safe, healthy and affordable place to live ... and provide 200 full-time jobs. And in Clarington — at the request of long-term care advocates and community leaders — and with the help of an MZO, we cut an estimated three years from the approval process for a long-term care facility. It will be home to more than 220 people and employ 450 full- and part-time staff. I remain committed to helping municipalities expedite important projects like these. We're also taking steps to help municipalities build back better through a $1-million pilot project under the Municipal Disaster Recovery Assistance program... ... this will help eligible municipalities rebuild flood damaged roads, bridges and other infrastructure to a higher standard, so it can better withstand extreme weather. From day one, we've been committed to Making Life More Affordable for Ontarians. By making it quicker and easier for municipalities to unlock development, it will be easier for people to find homes that meet their needs and their budgets. Last fall, my ministry completed a consultation on the Provincial Policy Statement. As you know, it sets the ground rules for land use planning in the province. We heard we need to make it easier to expand settlement area boundaries to reflect local needs. Rural areas told us we need to support residential development. And from the agricultural sector, we heard that converting farm buildings into housing supports local economies, increases housing supply and helps farmers. I want you to know that the changes we made through Bill 108 to permit additional residential units on urban and suburban properties also applies on rural properties, including farms. The updated PPS will support this change. We are taking a careful look at the feedback we heard through the consultation, and I hope to release the new PPS this winter.  Of course, the PPS is an important part of More Homes, More Choice — our housing supply action plan. We're following through on that plan, and we've issued four guides to support innovation in housing — they cover tiny homes, second suites, co-ownership and life leases. We know we need to make it easier to build different types of housing to ensure people have a range of options that meet their needs — and our guides help do that. Since we last met at ROMA, we also released A Place to Grow... the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe. It recognizes that one size doesn't fit all ... and our plan is already helping rural municipalities. For example, the City of Kawartha Lakes and many other counties in the Greater Golden Horseshoe have new intensification and density targets that better reflect the amount of growth expected in their communities. This brings me to our commitment to Creating a More Competitive Business Environment ... one where entrepreneurs and risk-takers are supported, so businesses can grow and create good jobs for the people of Ontario. Last fall, I issued a Minister's Zoning Order in Oro-Medonte... ... to unlock vacant industrial land and cut red tape that was holding up an Automotive Innovation Park. This will create 700 new full-time jobs, plus 1,800 construction jobs to build the facility. And I'm calling on all municipalities to bring forward other opportunities like that across the province. As you know, we will be holding a series of roundtable discussions with rural stakeholders on economic development challenges and opportunities, and what we can do to help you succeed. And we're investing $315 million over five years to expand broadband and cellular access.   This will leverage funding from the private sector and other levels of government to result in access for up to 220,000 households and businesses across Ontario. We're also launching the next intake of our Regional Economic Development program to support business growth in eastern and southwestern Ontario.   Meanwhile, I know you are working hard and going after new businesses and investment, too. Just like the Town of Halton Hills did. It used its modernization funding to set up a business concierge approach to help investors and entrepreneurs, and to implement an economic development and tourism strategy ... and a strategy to attract foreign direct investment. This is a great way to leverage our funding to build prosperity and a stronger local economy for the future. One of the most important things all levels of government must do is get spending under control. We need to transform how we work by Making Government Services Smarter. I want to thank my parliamentary assistant Jim McDonell — and his counterpart Jane McKenna from the Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development... They recently completed a Regional Listening Tour to hear your perspectives. There are some fantastic ideas out there... Including when it comes to the great Canadian sport of hockey! The Township of Lanark Highlands is updating its website so people can book the arena online, saving staff time and making the system more efficient for its residents. And the Municipality of Charlton and Dack, and the Township of Chamberlain used their modernization funding to consolidate their offices. Now they share space, equipment and an IT server. And they didn't stop there. They're renting out the unused Chamberlain office to create revenue. These are just a few of the ways you are working smarter and I encourage you to keep up the good work. I'm proud of what you are doing to make life more affordable ... strengthen your communities ... find efficiencies ... and deliver smarter, modern services. This is hard work. But our government will keep working with ROMA — and AMO — to help. We want to support your great ideas ... See growth and prosperity in rural and northern Ontario ... And help your residents and municipalities thrive. That's how we will Build Rural Ontario Together! Thank you!

Province Consulting with Municipalities on Strengthening the OMPF and Property Tax System

Ministry of Finance


TORONTO — Ontario continues to build strong, local partnerships by maintaining the funding available to municipalities through the Ontario Municipal Partnership Fund (OMPF) at $500 million for 2021.  
Today Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance, committed to maintaining the OMPF at the Rural Ontario Municipal Association annual conference while announcing consultations on next year's program to ensure the funding is better focused to deliver results for small, northern and rural municipalities.   ""Municipalities told us how vital the OMPF is to their communities and they need information sooner to plan their budgets,"" said Minister Phillips. ""That's why we announced allocations for 2020 earlier than ever before, and why we're committing today to maintain the funding envelope for next year.""  Moving forward, the province will continue to consult with municipalities on how to better focus the OMPF on communities that need it most, including small, northern and rural municipalities.  Ontario is also consulting with stakeholders on the province's property tax system to enhance the accuracy and stability of property assessments. Municipalities rely on the more than $22 billion annually raised through the property tax system to fund local services. Minister Phillips announced today that the government will work with municipal partners to ensure vital services are supported, while building a competitive business environment that will attract investment and create jobs.  ""Municipalities are critical partners in delivering services to the people of Ontario and we will continue to listen and work together to support people in every community across the province,"" said Minister Phillips. 

Quick Facts

As announced last year, the Province is investing $500 million in 389 municipalities across Ontario through the OMPF in 2020, to support local priorities in each community.
In October 2019, the government announced 2020 OMPF allocations, providing municipalities with detailed funding information earlier than ever before. 
The main objectives of the OMPF are to: 

recognize the challenges of small, northern and rural municipalities, while targeting funding to those with more challenging fiscal circumstances.
support areas with limited property assessment.
assist municipalities that are adjusting to year-over-year funding changes.

Property tax is the main revenue source for municipalities, raising more than $22 billion annually to fund local services.

Province moving forward with new intake for Rural Economic Development program and three broadband pilots

January 20, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Office of the Premier


As part of the government's Plan to Build Ontario Together, Ontario is helping rural communities across the province attract investment, create jobs and boost economic development through the Rural Economic Development (RED) program.
Earlier today while speaking at the Rural Ontario Municipal Association (ROMA) annual conference, Premier Doug Ford announced the province is now accepting applications for a new intake this year under the RED program. ""Many rural communities are feeling left behind,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""We need to make sure everyone, no matter where they live, can find a good job, grow a business, start a family, and build a better life for themselves. The RED program is one of the many ways that our government is helping to bring real benefits to more communities in rural Ontario."" Rural communities and regions, Indigenous communities and organizations, not-for-profit organizations, and local service boards can all apply for the RED program starting today through February 24, 2020. As part of the program's Economic Diversification and Competitiveness Stream, the province will cover up to 50% of the costs for eligible projects that help remove barriers to job creation and attract investment and skilled workers that will help regions grow. The Strategic Economic Infrastructure Stream of the program enables the province to cover up to 30% of eligible minor capital projects that help spur economic growth, such as restoring museums and heritage sites, setting up community hubs, and streetscaping. The Ontario government is also working with our federal partners and the Southwestern Integrated Fibre Technology (SWIFT) project to provide a combined investment of nearly $35 million for a broadband pilot in rural communities across Ontario. SWIFT is taking the next step today by awarding contracts to successful bidders to help bring better broadband service to three counties in Southwestern Ontario. ""This investment will help SWIFT move forward on projects that will provide broadband access to approximately 11,000 more homes and businesses across Norfolk, Wellington and Lambton counties,"" said Minister Ernie Hardeman, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. ""Having high-speed Internet access is no longer a luxury, it is a necessity that allows our businesses to connect to global markets, enables students and workers to learn and upgrade their skills, and allows people to bank or shop online."" The Ontario government is committed to helping build stronger rural communities that can attract investment and jobs to their region and promote new economic opportunities for their residents. The government is also supporting rural Ontario through additional measures that include:  Responding to farmer and rural municipality concerns by introducing Bill 156, the Security from Trespass and Protecting Food Safety Act, 2019 in the Ontario Legislature. If passed, the legislation will better protect farmers, their families, their employees, animals, livestock transporters, and the province's food supply.Providing $450,000 in new funding for the Rural Ontario Institute, an organization that provides leadership development programs for agriculture, rural businesses and organizations that help drive economic development and promote leadership in rural communities.Hosting a series of economic roundtables to listen to the views of people living in rural Ontario to understand how best to leverage the potential for economic growth in their communities. The first roundtable took place on January 19 at ROMA.Developing the new AgriSuite, a valuable suite of tools for farmers, land use planners and municipalities encompassing a phosphorus risk assessment to support environmental sustainability and Nutrient Management Planning tools that help to protect drinking water sources.

Quick Facts

The Rural Economic Development program is part of Ontario’s commitment to rural communities, which also includes expanding access to natural gas and improving rural infrastructure.
Southwestern Integrated Fibre Technology (SWIFT) is a not-for-profit corporation initiated by the Western Ontario Wardens’ Caucus, a group of 15 municipalities. SWIFT is focused on improving connectivity in Southwestern Ontario, Caledon and the Niagara Region. The project is delivered with support from Ontario and other levels of government.
Ontario is supporting the SWIFT project in southwestern Ontario, committing up to $63.7 million in funding toward SWIFT’s total project costs of more than $190 million.

Check against delivery
Good morning everyone!  I'm delighted to join you today,  I'd like to thank Chair Allan Thompson, and all of this year's organizers, for putting this great event together. I've had the privilege of chairing ROMA, and I can appreciate how much work goes into making this event happen. I want to say how pleased I am that Premier Ford is here joining us this morning.  I have some friends up from Oxford here today and even they want me to hurry up and finish so they can hear the Premier so I'll keep this speech to a brief... 40-50 minutes! In all seriousness, I'm so proud to have a premier that leads a government committed to rural Ontario. Premier, thanks very much for being here. This conference is a highlight of the year for me, as I'm sure it is for many of you. It is another opportunity to connect and collaborate over both the challenges and opportunities facing rural communities.  I'm proud to say that this is my 39th year attending. And each year I'm more and more impressed with the insights that our municipal partners bring to the table.  I know there have been times over the years when many have felt that rural Ontario was an afterthought at Queen's Park,  And that rural concerns didn't carry the same weight as others. This is not the case under our government. And that's because we understand that Rural Ontario's success is a big part of the province's success. We're making sure the dollars we're investing bring the maximum value for outcomes that benefit rural Ontario. I'm glad to have the opportunity today to talk with you about the ways we're working to support success in rural Ontario and for our agriculture sector. I've also brought some slides with me, to show you the range of economic development initiatives in play across the province. I think it's helpful to see the range of rural economic development projects on maps and to get a real sense of all the great work going on right across rural and northern Ontario. Now, I'd like to start by announcing a consultation on drainage red tape - something that has been an irritant for many of you. As most experienced rural municipal representatives in the room will know, you don't have to be on the job long before something involving the Drainage Act crosses your desk. The purpose of our proposed amendments is to try to reduce regulatory burden and to streamline approvals under the Act while still maintaining our provinces high environmental standards. We know that good drainage is essential to agricultural productivity. And while it may not be a particularly glamorous subject, Drainage truly is the workhorse of the agriculture sector. It improves crop productivity and reduces nutrient loss and soil erosion while helping with flood control. For those important reasons, it's a key foundation for our agriculture sector. And, of course, it is of significant interest for municipalities. Drainage works are vital rural infrastructure. And they are integral parts of our broader water management system that sustains rural communities and ecosystems. Our proposed amendments to the Drainage Act are now posted on the province's Environmental Registry. There, you'll find proposals that reduce the approval process from 9 months to as little as 4 months. As well, our proposed changes will look to save rural communities an estimated 10 per cent savings a year for minor improvement project costs. I strongly encourage you to share your input during this consultation period and submit your feedback on them. We'll use the input we receive to make sure our amendments to the Act do what they need to do to help reduce costs and paperwork for you as well as for rural and agricultural landowners and drainage contractors. These objectives are in line with our government's red tape reduction work. Cutting red tape lowers business costs and it improves business competitiveness. And when we streamline processes and remove barriers, we're helping to ensure Ontario is open for business. At the same time, we are committed to maintaining our province's stringent regulations that ensure that our rural communities and environment are safe and healthy. I also want to highlight a move we made late last year in direct response to meetings I held at AMO. Last year at AMO, I met with the Township of Warwick who highlighted growing concerns in Rural Ontario with on farm trespass.  ROMA's chair Mayor Allan Thompson connected with me multiple times to discuss the subject.  That's why, just last month, I introduced Bill 156, the Security from Trespass and Protecting Food Safety Act, 2019. More than 60 municipalities passed or supported the Warwick Resolution which called for stronger protections against unlawful and dangerous trespassing onto farms and into processing facilities.  As you can see from this map, the support for this resolution has come from across the province.  This proposed Bill balances the safety and security of farmers, their families and our food supply while protecting the right for people to participate in legal protests. Our government will always protect that right but that right cannot include trespassing on farms, in agricultural businesses or interfering with livestock in transport.  I look forward to carrying forward the proposed legislation through its next steps when the Legislature returns next month. Our government understands the importance of a strong and dynamic rural Ontario as a pillar of the province's economy. That includes greater access to broadband and cellular connectivity in the province. I know the Premier is going to be making an important announcement on that during his remarks that will be welcome news to rural communities in southwestern Ontario. And through a range of initiatives that support economic development, we're helping communities and businesses create and retain jobs for rural Ontarians.  This includes the revitalized Rural Economic Development program which is a particularly special program to me because I launched it when I was the Minister of Rural Affairs 17 years ago!  And much like my waist line, the program has grown since then. Today, the updated program supports the implementation of projects that diversify and grow local economies. I'd like to point out on this slide the RED program-funded initiatives in action across Ontario since June of 2018.  Each point shown on this map represents a RED-funded project that's spurring on rural economic development at the grassroots level.  As the map shows, the program is making critical investments in townships and municipalities across the province and I'm looking forward to seeing this map grow in the future.  We've got a very exciting announcement on RED that Premier Ford will be making at this podium right after me so make sure you stick around, you won't want to miss it! The Canadian Agricultural Partnership is another vehicle that is driving success in rural Ontario.  On this next map, you can see illustrated the CAP-funded projects that have been implemented in the past year and a half.  Since June 2018, both the federal and provincial governments have committed cost-share support to approximately 2,500 projects through the Partnership to help eligible Ontario farmers, processors, businesses and sector organizations innovate and grow. Our government has also invested in 18 agriculture projects in Northern Ontario through the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund that have seen impressive overall investments into northern communities.  And since June of 2018, over $100 million has been committed in Ontario through the Partnership to support a variety of new projects to help farmers, processors, businesses and sector organizations to innovate and grow. For example, we've leveraged a small investment of $530,000 in CAP money into the meat processing sector that stimulated a total investment of $1.7 million dollars. Here we see the locations of the more than 50 abattoirs that are being supported through the Partnership for projects to improve food safety. Not only are these investments supporting employment in this key sector, but they help to boost the competitiveness of the meat processing sector. The Ontario Community Infrastructure Fund is making sure funding is targeted to where it is needed most.  The program provides funding to more than 420 small, rural and northern communities.  The funding helps them develop and renew their core infrastructure assets and support asset management planning.  You may have heard Friday's announcement by the Premier of the province's investment of $200 million in OCIF funds to eligible municipalities and Local Services Boards for the 2020 calendar year. We know that by investing in local infrastructure projects we're investing in strong and prosperous communities. That's why our government is proud to participate in the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program.  The program is a wonderful example of the collaborative relationship between the province, the federal government and communities across Ontario. To date, Ontario has opened intakes for all four of these streams and nominated 351 infrastructure projects across the province to the federal government under ICIP, to get people moving and grow the economy.  So far, 84 of these projects have been approved by the federal government. This includes 62 projects under the Rural and Northern stream, which prioritizes investments in road, bridge, air and marine infrastructure. The province has also launched the Green Infrastructure stream in October last year. This stream allows eligible applicants to put forward projects that address critical health and safety issues related to local water, wastewater and stormwater infrastructure. The application intake for this stream closes later this week - Jan 22. These initiatives help to create jobs and open the doors to economic growth in rural Ontario while at the same time improves critical utility infrastructure across the province. But investing in infrastructure is just part of our plan to build up rural Ontario. Having great rural and agriculture infrastructure means nothing without the people to turn those investments into opportunities for their communities.  That's why, I'm very pleased today to announce our government will invest nearly half a million dollars in funding to the ""Building Leaders - Connecting Leaders"" project at the Rural Ontario Institute. The project aims to build and connect leaders in the Ontario agriculture and rural sectors.  This is the latest example of the kind of sector capacity-building work made possible by our partnership.  We believe this project will help to enhance competitiveness and innovation in the sector and in rural Ontario, and we are proud to back it.  Further along the vein of rural economic development...  I'm very pleased that yesterday, here at ROMA, my Parliamentary Assistant Randy Pettapiece held the first of 8 economic roundtables on rural economic development. With representatives from ROMA, the Eastern Ontario Warden's Caucus, the Western Ontario Warden's Caucus, AMO and others, it was a great kickoff to an important series of discussions.  In these roundtable meetings, we want to hear from representatives of Rural Ontario directly about how best to leverage its potential for economic growth. And we'll be providing updates on the roundtables as they progress.  As you can see from this map, we'll be holding roundtables in a number of communities across the province and as always, my door is open if you have ideas you want to share. Friends, once again, thanks very much for including me today. I appreciate the opportunity to speak with you, and to be part of the ROMA conference again this year. Let's just say that I'm already looking forward to returning next year to bring my attendance streak up to 40 years! And in the meantime, I look forward to continuing to work with you, and with every one of our partners who contribute in their own ways to rural Ontario's success.  All the best!

Ministry of Health


CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY 
Good morning, everyone. It is a pleasure to join you today.  I'm especially looking forward to the delegations scheduled with many of you over the next two days to hear about your experiences with health care and how we can work together to improve your communities' health and well being. Our government is proud to work alongside our partners in rural governments in finding solutions that work for all Ontarians, no matter where they may live. As Ontario's Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, it's my responsibility to help build a public health care system that works for all Ontarians. That includes the nearly three million people who live outside of our province's major metropolitan areas. This is not a responsibility I take lightly. In fact, I'm proud of the progress we've made over the past year in starting to correct long-standing inequities that have disadvantaged the health of Ontario's rural and remote communities. Take, for example, the $68 million our government announced last fall invested to support small- and medium-sized hospitals across Ontario with their unique situations and funding challenges.  This new investment is on top of the $384 million more that Ontario's hospitals received as part of the province's 2019 budget. It includes a province-wide increase in funding of one per cent for 66 small-sized hospitals...  ...1.5 per cent for 23 medium-sized hospitals... ...and targeted funding to assist with unique situations and historical funding challenges. The real and significant needs of the hospital that service Ontario's rural communities went ignored for too long. That's why last month our government was proud to announce that we are investing in the health and safety of patients by addressing urgent upgrades, repairs and maintenance to help modernize 131 hospitals across the province. Through the Health Infrastructure Renewal Fund, Ontario is investing $175 million this year to help hospitals across the province maintain their infrastructure and ensure a safe and comfortable environment for patients to receive care. In addition, we also announced that we are investing $7.2 million through the Community Infrastructure Renewal Fund to address ongoing urgent or emergent infrastructure renewal needs for community health service providers who met specific criteria on a priority basis. These investments will help ensure that patients across Ontario... ...wherever they may live...  ...can receive the care they need in a safe and comfortable setting. Seemingly small things like well-functioning roofs, windows or heating and air conditioning systems, fire alarms and back-up generators can make the world of difference to a patient's experience and ensure they have access to reliable, high-quality care. Now, as everyone here will know, our government made a commitment to the people of Ontario that we would end hallway health care. A problem long-neglected, the unfortunate reality is that there is no easy solution. I wish there was. But our government has a comprehensive plan to keep this promise. It's a plan with four pillars. First, we want to keep Ontarians healthy and out of hospitals. We call this pillar prevention and health promotion. Second, our plan will ensure that Ontarians receive the right care in the right place.  While in many ways the backbone of our health care system, especially in rural communities, the hospital isn't always the best place for a patient to receive care... ...especially at a time when far too many are operating at more than 100 per cent capacity. Third, we are better integrating care to improve patient flow.  Doing so will help ensure that those patients who are ready to leave the hospital can do so with the support and care they need while freeing up beds for patients waiting in a hallway or meeting room. Finally, by investing $27 billion over 10 years in hospital infrastructure projects, our plan is building much-needed capacity throughout the system, including in hospitals in rural communities across the province. Whether it's West Lincoln Memorial, Lake of the Woods, Markdale or Prince Edward County Memorial, we are investing in building new and expanded hospital capacity for all Ontarians closer to home. As the government continues our work to bring Ontario's health care system into the 21st century, this funding will help health service providers address urgent issues. Allow me to return to the first pillar in our plan to end hallway health care - prevention and health promotion. To build healthier communities, we must consider how best to deliver public health in a way that is resilient, efficient, nimble, and modern... ...and in a way that meets the evolving health needs and priorities of Ontario's families. For too long, public health has existed in isolation from the broader health care system...  ... a concern highlighted by the Auditor General. In 2017, the Auditor General reported that public health units are poorly coordinated and duplicating work.  The Auditor General also reported that public health services are delivered inconsistently across the province. This is neither fair nor equitable for the people of Ontario, especially those living in rural communities who may not benefit from the scope or scale enjoyed by larger municipalities. Something needs to be done. The status quo is not an option. We need to unlock the value of the good work being done in communities across the province to keep people healthy.  To that end, we are working with our municipal partners to design a public health system that meets the following principles:  Better consistency and equity of service delivery across the province;Improved clarity and alignment of roles and responsibilities between the province, Public Health Ontario and local public health;Unlocking and promoting leading innovative practices and key strengths from across the province; andBetter and deeper relationships with primary care and the broader health care system to support the goal of ending hallway health care through improved health promotion and prevention.    As we make these long-overdue changes, I want you to know our government is listening. Led by Jim Pine, our advisor on public health and emergency health services, the Ministry of Health has launched renewed stakeholder consultations across Ontario. To date, in-person sessions have been held in Thunder Bay, Peterborough, Peel Region, North Bay, and London. Approximately 200 participants from the public health, emergency health services, and municipal sectors have come out to share their thoughts and best advice. Planning is currently underway for nine or 10 additional in-person sessions, as well as additional meetings, such as with the AMO Health Task Force tomorrow afternoon. A discussion paper for each of the public health and emergency health services were also released to stakeholders asking for feedback by February 10, 2020. To date, over 400 submissions have been received from organizations and individuals providing their advice. And while we recognize we still have much more consulting to do, we're already hearing strong messages from our partners. We're hearing that there is an openness to doing things differently and addressing capacity challenges of public health units, based on evidence and determined alongside partners. Importantly, we've heard that careful consideration must be given to the unique issues and needs of your communities as we consider any changes. In instances where health units have well established partnerships, such as those with social services and health care services, we are hearing that there is a desire to maintain and build on existing partnerships. We recognize that there is also a desire to ensure that public health continues to be aligned with regional and municipal levels of government. We are hearing that there is a need to better define the role of our health units. And while we continue to hear questions about the implementation of the new cost-sharing arrangement and its impact on municipalities... ...we have also heard support for the need to ensure that public health units operate more effectively and efficiently. Together, we can tackle our shared challenges and take hold of these opportunities to build a more robust and effective public health system. Together, we can help facilitate better and deeper relationships between public health and primary care to keep our communities healthy and help end hallway health care. With respect to Ontario's emergency health services, we are hearing about the long-standing challenges of outdated technology and the inability to communicate in real time with other services in the area.   We are hearing about the potential for better dispatching systems to improve responses to patients and make the best use of paramedic resources within your communities. Like much of our health care system, we have heard our paramedics need greater, more seamless access to patient histories and health records. Municipalities have expressed their concerns about patient transportation between facilities, especially in rural areas where distances between services are vast.   We understand that in areas where paramedic services are called to transport these patients, it can significantly reduce the availability of paramedic capacity for emergencies within your communities. I know Jim will be speaking to many of you later today about the consultations and discuss these important issues. We believe there is an opportunity here for meaningful change that will benefit our communities and citizens. You have the first-hand knowledge to help us achieve that goal. Our government will be continuing with our consultations throughout the month of February. At that time, we can begin to consider the important changes we need to make to modernize and strengthen our public health and emergency health services in consultation with you, our municipal partners. Once again, thank you for the invitation to be here today. I look forward to hearing more from all of you on these important topics for our rural communities. Thank you.

Office of the Premier


CHECK AGAINST DELIVERY.
Thank you for the kind introduction. It's an honour to be here at ROMA with my team of all-star Ministers and MPPs at Queen's Park. I love talking to our municipal leaders. You folks get it. The challenges you face are very real and the solutions you bring forward are bold. But for years before I got here, Queen's Park acted as if nothing existed beyond the borders of Toronto. You didn't have a voice here. Rural Ontario was written off. And that's unacceptable. I'm proud to say that this is a government that works for each and every community in this province - and that includes the hard-working people of rural Ontario! You know, I just love people from rural Ontario. They're the most down-to-earth people I've ever met. Rural Ontario is an important engine of our economy. It contributes $109 billion a year to our GDP and supports 1.1 million jobs. Some of you may have seen the latest job numbers. They're incredible. Since our government took office, over 296,000 new jobs have been created in the province. In fact, Ontario accounted for 76 per cent of all job growth in Canada over the past year. Our economy is on fire. Every part of our province - north, south, east, and west - should have the opportunity to share in our prosperity. We need to ensure everyone, no matter where they live in Ontario, has access to a good job, the opportunity to start their own business, start a family, and the chance to build a better life for themselves and a better future for Ontario. So that's why I'm proud to announce today, right here on this stage that we're launching a new intake round for the Rural Economic Development program to support economic growth, attract more jobs, and create more opportunities in communities throughout rural Ontario. Starting today, rural municipalities, Indigenous communities, non-profits, and local services boards can apply. We're offering to cover up to half of the cost for eligible projects that help remove barriers to job creation and attract investment and skilled workers that will allow regions to grow. We'll also cover up to 30 per cent of the costs for eligible minor capital projects to spur economic growth, like restoring museums and heritage sites, setting up community hubs, and streetscaping. This year, our government is investing $5 million into this program, so you have the resources that you need to invest in yourselves, and in the great people that call rural Ontario home. Thank you Minister Hardeman for your leadership on this important program. We also know many rural communities still lack the necessary infrastructure to attract the investment you need to grow. That's why our government is investing $144 billion over the next decade in transit, roads, schools, hospitals, and broadband networks across the province. Part of that is through the federal Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program, or ICIP, which delivers $30 billion in new infrastructure across the province. This is money that will help build and improve projects like public transit, roads, highways, bridges, and broadband. In fact, the ICIP Rural and Northern Stream was the first stream we opened because we knew how important those projects were for many Ontario communities. I'm thrilled the federal government has recently approved 84 of the projects we submitted, including 62 projects in rural and northern communities. And currently, we're accepting applications until January 22 for the ICIP Green Stream. This includes a $200 million investment in eligible water, wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure projects for municipalities with 100,000 residents or less. I was just up in Parry Sound on Friday to announce the 2020 allocations for the Ontario Community Infrastructure Fund with our incredible Infrastructure Minister, Laurie Scott. We're providing $200 million for 424 Ontario communities to build and repair roads, bridges, water and wastewater facilities. My friend Minister Mulroney also released the draft regional transportation plan for Southwestern Ontario on Friday. We're looking for your input before March 17. In the meantime, we're going to increase the number of communities in the region with intercommunity bus service by 58 per cent over the next five years. With safer, more reliable, and more connected infrastructure, rural communities can support new businesses as they grow, allow new homes to be built, and help get people to where they need to go faster. We also recognize that a lack of fast, high-speed Internet and reliable cell service leaves many rural communities behind in the digital age. You can do almost anything online these days - from banking to shopping to business development. Access to better broadband means workers can upgrade their skills, businesses can modernize and compete, and residents can enjoy quality, reliable and high-speed service as others do in other parts of the province. That's why our government is investing $315 million to improve and expand broadband and cellular coverage in rural and northern Ontario as part of our government's Broadband and Cellular Action Plan. And today, we're taking another step forward towards that goal. I'm pleased to announce that three rural broadband contracts have been awarded through the Southwestern Integrated Fibre Technology, or SWIFT, project. These three projects represent a combined investment of $34.5 million from the province, the federal government, and private partners, which will benefit 11,000 homes and businesses in Norfolk, Wellington, and Lambton counties. SWIFT is working to bring better broadband and cellular service to 50,000 more homes and businesses in total across Southwestern Ontario. Our government also made a commitment to reduce energy costs for families and households, and that's exactly what we're doing with Phase 2 of our Natural Gas Expansion Program. Today, I'm happy to announce that the Ontario Energy Board is in the process of finalizing guidelines and they will be issuing a call for applications soon. We encourage all of the interested municipalities to partner with natural gas distributors on potential projects in their communities to best prepare for the application process. Switching to natural gas can save a household up to $2,500 a year in heating costs. It's one way our government is making life more affordable for the people of Ontario. Finally, we will continue to work with our municipal partners to give you the tools you need to build for the future. As you know, our government expanded the Municipal Modernization Fund to include small and rural municipalities. It's one way we're helping 405 small and rural governments across Ontario find savings, modernize, and work smarter, so you can continue to deliver the services that people in your communities rely on every day. My friend Minister Clark will have an important update on the fund later today, so stay tuned. We're going to keep working hard to make sure our Plan to Build Ontario Together is delivering for you and for people everywhere in this great province. And that includes building a stronger, more prosperous rural Ontario where everyone has the opportunity to build something better: a career, a business, a family, and a future - no matter where they call home in this province. But we can't do it alone. Working together, we can continue to build a strong, thriving Ontario. The best place in the world to live, play, and work. The best place to grow. Thank you for inviting me. Enjoy the rest of the conference.

ArcelorMittal Dofasco Fined $290,000 After Two Workplace Incidents in Hamilton


January 17, 2020  2:30 P.M.

Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development


Convicted: ArcelorMittal Dofasco MP Inc., 1330 Burlington Street East, Hamilton, Ontario, a manufacturer of steel products for the automotive and other industries. ArcelorMittal along with ArcelorMittal Canada Inc. are the partners which form ArcelorMittal Dofasco G.P.
Location of Workplace: 1330 Burlington Street East, Hamilton, Ontario. Description of Offence: In two separate incidents, two workers were exposed to carbon monoxide, and another was injured after a hand was drawn into the pinch point of a machine. Date of Offences: May 23, 2018 and December 6, 2018.  Date of Conviction: January 16, 2020.  Penalty Imposed: Following guilty pleas, ArcelorMittal Dofasco MP Inc. was fined $170,000 for the May incident and $120,000 for the December incident ($290,000 total) in provincial offences court in Hamilton by Justice of the Peace Glen G. Peace; Crown Counsel Alicia Gordon-Fagan.The court also imposed a 25-per-cent victim fine surcharge as required by the Provincial Offences Act. The surcharge is credited to a special provincial government fund to assist victims of crime.  Background: On May 23, 2018, two workers were cleaning a platform on the outside of a blast furnace located at the workplace. While sweeping this area, the blast furnace valves malfunctioned, causing the gases and dust contained in the furnace to erupt and to engulf the workers.The workers were wearing carbon monoxide detectors which began sounding alarms to a point beyond the detectors' ability of 1,000 ppm (parts of gas per million parts of air). They were not wearing their self-contained breathing apparatuses but put them on later.The workers attended the employer's medical facility, where they were placed on oxygen therapy for carbon monoxide exposure; they were subsequently treated at hospital.In Ontario, occupational exposure limits (OEL) are regulated under Ontario Regulation 833 (Control of Exposure to Biological or Chemical Agents). The regulation restricts the amount and duration of workers' exposure to hazardous workplace substances. To comply with the OEL, the employer must ensure that workers' exposure to hazardous substances is below these limits.The regulation specifies OEL for carbon monoxide (CO) at 25 ppm as an eight-hour and 40-hour time-weighted average (TWA) limit.Additionally, the exposure to CO must not exceed three times the TWA (75 ppm) for any period of 30 minutes and five times the TWA (125 ppm) at any time; these limits are called excursion limits, and are intended to minimize the potential of neurobehavioural changes upon exposure.A (then) Ministry of Labour hygienist calculated that the CO concentrations in the air inhaled by these two workers at the time of incident was at the range of 1,137 to 6,237 ppm - significantly higher than the limit of 125 ppm under the regulation.Accordingly, ArcelorMittal failed as an employer to comply with section 4 of Regulation 833/90 which states that ""every employer shall take the measures required by that section to limit the exposure of workers to a hazardous biological or chemical agent.""In the second incident, on December 6, 2018, a worker was working on the coil prep line. The worker was attempting to feed flat stock material into a pair of rollers.The worker used a control switch with one hand while trying to guide the steel between the two rollers with the other hand. The worker accidentally moved the switch in reverse instead of forward, which resulted in the worker coming into contact with the pinch point of the two rollers. The worker suffered critical injuries.The ministry investigation found that there were perimeter gates, access panels and guardrails on the north side of the roller that prevented access from that side. However, there were none on the south side, where the worker was standing, and therefore access was available to the pinch point. There was a shield present, but it was inadequate as the worker was able to gain access to the pinch point by reaching across it.This is contrary to section 25 of Ontario Regulation 851 (the Industrial Establishments Regulation), which states that ""an in-running nip hazard or any part of a machine, device or thing that may endanger the safety of any worker shall be equipped with and guarded by a guard or other device that prevents access to the pinch point."" Accordingly, on the dates of the two incidents, ArcelorMittal failed as an employer to ensure that the measures and procedures prescribed by the regulations were carried out in the workplace. This is contrary to section 25(1)(c) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act.

Company Fined $275,000 for Depositing Sediment into Waterways Near Cochrane


January 17, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry


The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry would like to remind companies that allowing sediment to enter waterways is illegal and can damage bodies of water.
A Toronto-based corporation has been fined $275,000 for releasing sediment into two creeks near Cochrane between April and December 2015. Justice Michel R. Labelle of the Ontario Court of Justice in Cochrane heard that Northland Power Inc. owns four solar farms in the area north of Cochrane. In 2015, during the construction of these solar farms, some rainfall events overwhelmed the erosion and sediment control systems. Breaches in these control systems allowed sediment-laden water to flow into two creeks. Justice Labelle found Northland Power Inc. guilty of two offences under the Lakes and Rivers Improvement Act (LRIA). He imposed a fine of $200,000 for impacts to Munroe Creek in Glackmeyer township and $75,000 for impacts to Smith Creek in Calder township. Justice Labelle noted that the company had spent close to $4 million to control the silt discharges and clearly took their environmental obligations seriously. He found that specific deterrence was not necessary for Northland in light of its conduct, but that these fines were necessary to demonstrate to others that any harm to the environment is unacceptable. A separate company, which was the contractor on the project, previously pled guilty to an offence under the LRIA for causing impacts to Munroe Creek. That company was fined $175,000.

Ensuring the Long-Term Sustainability of the Black Bear Population in Bruce Peninsula and Provincewide

Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry


Ontario has been refining how it manages black bears across the province for several decades. 
Using information from population surveys, hunting results, tag allocations, statistics from the Bear Wise reporting line, and science and research projects, the government has been working to ensure the long-term sustainability of black bear populations. Genetic sampling  Government staff set up survey sites baited with sardines in forested areas. As the bear enters the site, it brushes up against barbed wire strung around the area, leaving behind a hair sample. Staff visit the sites once a week during late spring and early summer to collect these hair samples. The samples are sent for DNA analysis to determine the sex and number of new or returning bears. Hair traps are a non-invasive means of collecting samples, and the information is used to estimate Ontario's bear population. Sites for the annual surveys are chosen to be representative of the larger landscape within each Wildlife Management Unit. Current provincial estimates Ontario is home to a healthy and sustainable black bear population at the provincial scale.There are an estimated 85,000-105,000 black bears in the province. Bruce Peninsula population Black bears on the Bruce Peninsula represent a genetically isolated population, due to the fragmented geography of the area. Government staff have been working in collaboration with Bruce Peninsula National Park and the Saugeen Ojibway Nation to assess the status of the local black bear population between 2009 and 2018. The research has indicated this population is at substantially higher risk than bear populations in other parts of the province due to its isolation and a high rate of human-caused mortality. There is concern current harvest rates may contribute to population decline. To reduce the pressure on black bears in the Bruce Peninsula, the government is proposing to reduce the bear hunting season in Wildlife Management Units 82A, 83 and 84 to one week in the spring and close the fall hunting season entirely. It would continue to monitor and collect data to see if the proposed changes have the desired effect on the bear population in this area. To comment on proposed changes to black bear management, see the notice on Ontario's Environmental Registry.

Ontario Protecting Black Bears and Promoting Sustainable Hunting
Province Consults on Annual Spring Bear Hunt

January 17, 2020 11:30 A.M.

Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry


PETERBOROUGH — The Ontario government is taking steps to ensure a healthy and sustainable black bear population while supporting small businesses and jobs in northern and central Ontario. Today, John Yakabuski, Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry, announced the start of government's consultation on a proposal to move to a regular annual spring black bear hunting season. 
In 2014, Ontario introduced a spring black bear hunting season pilot that supported sustainable hunting of black bears. The spring black bear hunting season pilot has continued each year since then. The province proposes to make the pilot a regular annual spring season subject to annual review.  ""Ontario is home to a healthy bear population,"" said Minister Yakabuski. ""The province will continue to monitor black bear populations, harvest results and sustainability indicators to inform an annual review and ensure bear populations are managed sustainably.""  As part of this proposal, all protections for Ontario's black bear population would remain in place.  For example, it would remain illegal to harvest black bear cubs and females with cubs in the spring, a crime that carries a potential fine of up to $25,000 and up to one-year imprisonment.   In addition to this proposal, Ontario is also proposing to take action to support the long-term sustainability of the declining black bear population on the Bruce Peninsula by reducing the bear hunting season in this area.    The spring black bear hunting pilot has been well received by northern communities and the tourism and hunting industries that support small businesses and jobs in northern and rural Ontario. The proposal to implement a regular season was recommended by the Big Game Management Advisory Committee (BGMAC). In Spring 2019, the government formed BGMAC to advise the province on how to improve big game management in Ontario.   ""We are listening to the concerns of northern Ontarians and the tourism industry that an ongoing pilot spring season creates economic uncertainty,"" said Minister Yakabuski. ""A regular, monitored spring bear hunting season would enable tourism outfitters and camp owners to better plan their operations for the entire year, while also allowing hunters to better plan their activities and support local businesses.""  The province is also proposing updates to black bear regulations:  Eliminating special black bear hunting opportunities for non-resident landowners and non-residents hunting with immediate relatives.Requiring people guiding resident bear hunters for commercial purposes to obtain a ""Licence to Provide Black Bear Hunting Services."" The proposed changes are now available on the Environmental Registry of Ontario for public feedback until February 18, 2020.

Quick Facts

Ontario is home to a healthy and sustainable black bear population.    
Each year, approximately 25,000 bear licences are sold, providing $2.4 million in revenue used to support fish and wildlife management.
In 2017, black bear hunters in Ontario spent approximately $50.6 million in hunting-related purchases

Funding will support Ontario meat processors to continue to deliver safe, high-quality products

January 16, 2020 11:00 A.M.

Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs


TORONTO - The governments of Canada and Ontario are helping meat processing businesses continue to produce safe, high-quality products that consumers enjoy with over $220,000 in cost-share funding to support 25 projects at provincially licenced abattoir businesses in Ontario.
This targeted effort through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership (the Partnership) will help strengthen food safety in this important part of the province's agri-food sector. This cost-share funding is in addition to funding to support 28 other projects completed at abattoirs in 2019, for a total investment of more than $530,000. These funding initiatives, when combined with contributions from the abattoir businesses, will collectively result in approximately $1.7 million in investments to further improve food safety in Ontario. Each project is eligible for up to 50 per cent cost-share, with eligible abattoirs receiving a maximum of $20,000.  ""The success of our meat processing businesses relies on the strength of our food safety systems,"" said the Honourable Marie-Claude Bibeau, federal Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. ""Supporting projects like these not only strengthens Ontario's capacity to produce safe, high-quality food products, it increases the overall competitiveness of the sector while creating good middle-class jobs.""  ""We're committed to working with our meat processing businesses to further strengthen the high quality of their products and expand market opportunities for them,"" said the Honourable Ernie Hardeman, Ontario Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. ""Investing in projects like these, which provide consumers with even more confidence about the safety of foods produced in Ontario, will support employment in this key sector and further boost its competitiveness."" These investments add to several initiatives Ontario has undertaken to support growth in the province's meat sector this year, including the recent launch of a meat industry engagement panel. Since June 2018, both the federal and provincial governments have committed cost-share support to approximately 2,500 projects through the Partnership to help eligible Ontario farmers, processors, businesses and sector organizations innovate and grow.

Quick Facts

There are 123 provincially inspected meat processing operations in Ontario.
The Partnership is a five-year, $3-billion commitment by Canada's federal, provincial and territorial governments that supports Canada's agri-food and agri-products sectors.
The Partnership is committing more than $220,000 to support 25 food safety enhancement projects at abattoirs approved in an application intake that took place from May 1, 2019 to August 30, 2019.
In a February 2019 intake, the Partnership invested approximately $313,000 in 28 projects at abattoirs.
The Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) delivers cost-share funding under the Partnership to food processors and other businesses (animal health, commercialization and primary agri-food businesses).
The Ontario agri-food sector supports more than 837,000 jobs in Ontario and contributes more than $47.5 billion each year to the province’s economy.

Severe Australian Fire Season Prompts International Support

January 16, 2020 10:30 A.M.

Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry


TORONTO - Today, Ontario is sending another seven fire management personnel to provide fire management support and expertise to Australia, which is currently facing a devastating fire season. An additional two staff will be deployed Friday, January 17, bringing the total number of Ontario personnel committed to Australia over several deployments to twenty-eight since the start of that country's fire season.
""Ontario is an internationally recognized leader in wildland fire management with staff who are highly trained and skilled in fighting wildfires,"" said John Yakabuski, Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry. ""The severe fire season in Australia has prompted the need for additional support. We are committed to helping Australians in their efforts by providing our resources and expertise."" Ontario participates in Mutual Aid Resource Sharing Agreements with its provincial, federal, and international partners. These agreements allow for the sharing of personnel, equipment, and aircraft between agencies during periods of escalated wildland fire activity. As further assistance is requested, the province will assess the ability to deploy additional resources to Australia.

Reducing delays and duplication through proposed changes to Class Environmental Assessments

January 16, 2020 10:15 A.M.

Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks


NIAGARA — Ontario is taking the next steps to modernize its almost 50-year-old environmental assessment program by working with holders of Class Environmental Assessments (Class EA) to propose changes that would exempt projects that have little or no negative environmental impact.
Jeff Yurek, Minister of the Environment, Conservation and Parks, was at the Niagara-on-the-Lake Ontario Power Generation plant today with Paul Norris, President, Ontario Waterpower Association, and Jessica Polak, Vice President of Operations, Ontario Power Generation, to announce a proposal to create a screening process that would exempt low-impact waterpower projects. ""We are looking to Class EA holders, like the Ontario Waterpower Association, to propose sensible, practical changes that would ensure strong environmental oversight while reducing delays on projects that matter most to Ontario communities,"" said Minister Yurek. ""This is an example of how our government is looking at smarter, more modern ways of doing business to remove unnecessary costs and delays for important public services and infrastructure projects."" For example, a company like Ontario Power Generation must complete an environmental assessment when they replace an old generator. This assessment can take over a year to complete and cost up to $100,000 before the project can begin. ""This proposal would help Ontario Power Generation save significantly in costs and offers a real opportunity to achieve effective and practical improvements to the current environmental assessment process for low-impact projects,"" said Jessica Polak. ""The proposed changes would allow us to continue doing what we do best - provide clean, safe, reliable, low-cost power to the people of Ontario."" ""I am very pleased the government is working with us on proposed actions to improve the province's environmental assessment process and eliminate delays for low-impact projects,"" said Paul Norris. ""I am confident the result will be real and positive benefits for communities and for the environment."" Projects that meet the screening eligibility criteria would be required to notify the public, Indigenous communities and government agencies when they start the screening process and complete an assessment of potential environmental concerns. The proposed amendments to the Ontario Waterpower Association's Class Environmental Assessment will be posted in February for public review and comment.

Quick Facts

In June 2019, the government amended the Environmental Assessment Act to exempt low-impact projects such as snow plowing and de-icing, constructing roadside parks, and adding bike lanes from requiring an environmental assessment. Projects like this are routine activities that have benefits to communities but little to no environmental impact.
A class environmental assessment is a document that sets out a standardized planning process for classes or groups of activities. It applies to projects that are carried out routinely and have predictable environmental effects that can be readily managed.
The Ontario Waterpower Association’s Class EA for Waterpower Projects sets out a standard planning process for the 224 waterpower facilities across the province.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Today, Premier Doug Ford, joined by MPP Michael Parsa and MPP Goldie Ghamari, announced the creation of a scholarship fund to honour the victims of the recent fatal plane crash in Iran. The tragedy claimed the lives of 57 Canadians, including several from Ontario. The fund will disburse the proposed scholarships of $10,000 to 57 students, one in memory of each victim.
""This was a terrible tragedy, and my heart goes out to the victims' families and loved ones,"" Premier Doug Ford said. ""Many of the victims were students and professors with bright futures, studying and teaching at Ontario universities and colleges, and contributing to the advancement of research in many lifechanging fields. We will honour their memories through these scholarships to recognize their incredible contributions to our communities."" ""I want to express my deepest condolences to the families and friends of the victims of this devastating event,"" said Ross Romano, Minister of Colleges and Universities. ""These new scholarships will pay tribute to those who lost their lives and ensure they will not be forgotten."" The Ontario postsecondary institutions who lost students or faculty in the fatal plane crash included Carleton University, Centennial College, Fleming College, George Brown College, Lambton College, McMaster University, Queen's University, Ontario Tech University (formerly UOIT), the University of Guelph, the University of Ottawa, the University of Toronto, the University of Waterloo, the University of Western Ontario, the University of Windsor, and York University. Criteria for the proposed scholarships will be open-ended, awarded based on academic merit and financial need, and determined in consultation with Ontario's colleges and universities, as well as with the families of the victims. Scholarships will be allocated in honour of each of the 34 victims to the institutions to which they belonged, with the remainder allocated to other eligible institutions based on a competitive process. The Ministry of Colleges and Universities is leading the development of the scholarship fund and will engage various partners, including the federal government, cultural community groups, and other institutions. The ministry will share more information in the coming weeks.

GUELPH—Strategic investments in public transit infrastructure play a key role in supporting affordable and sustainable transportation services that help Canadians get around their communities safely while better protecting the environment. 
Today, the Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities; Lloyd Longfield, Member of Parliament for Guelph; Stephen Crawford, Member of Provincial Parliament for Oakville and Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Infrastructure, Ontario; and His Worship Cam Guthrie, Mayor of the City of Guelph, announced funding for three projects that will expand Guelph's public transit fleet while supporting its transition to clean energy transportation. The first project involves the replacement of 35 diesel buses with long-range electric battery buses along with the installation of on-route charging stations. The second project will entail the purchase of 30 more electric buses that will add capacity to the public transit fleet while reducing emissions and protecting the environment. The third project consists of the construction of a new bus storage facility in Guelph that will store up to 200 vehicles and include electric charging stations for the new bus fleet.  Together, these investments will encourage more residents to choose public transit by providing them with more frequent and reliable bus service.   The Government of Canada is investing more than $40 million in this project through the Public Transit Infrastructure stream of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Ontario is providing over $33 million, while the municipal share will be $104 million. 

Quick Facts

Through the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities.
$28.7 billion of this funding is supporting public transit projects, including $5 billion available for investment through the Canada Infrastructure Bank.

Minister of Education Offers Financial Assistance to Parents Facing Increased Costs

January 15, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Ministry of Education


TORONTO — Today, the Honourable Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education, announced the government's plan to offer parents up to $60 per day if strike actions close schools or school-based child care centres.
""Our aim has always been to reach a negotiated settlement that keeps kids in class, which we have done successfully with multiple labour partners to date,"" said Minister Lecce. ""We recognize the impact of union escalation on families is real, and unions expect hard-working families to bear the costs of their cyclical labour action. While unions impose hardship on families and students, our government is taking proactive steps to ensure students remain cared for — and families supported — in the event that unions decide to further escalate job action in their fight for enhanced compensation and other demands. The contrast could not be clearer.""  A full withdrawal of services could require parents to make alternative arrangements. A strike could also impact the operation of full-day child care centres located in schools — forcing them to close as a direct result of escalating union job action. To address these potential realities, the Ministry of Education launched its Support for Parents initiative to make sure that child care and other safe spaces are as accessible as possible for any family impacted by strikes. It will also provide support to parents who are facing increased costs. Financial support will be provided to parents for each day of school that a child misses on account of a labour disruption, or each day of child care that is not available if offered from a closed school. Eligible parents of children up to age 12 (Grade 7), or up to age 21 for children and youth with special needs, in a publicly funded school, qualify for:  $60 per day for children aged 0-6 who are not yet enrolled in school but attend a school-based child care centre that is required to close on account of the strike.$40 per day for students in Junior Kindergarten (JK) and Senior Kindergarten (SK).$25 per day for students in Grades 1 up to and including Grade 7.$40 total per day for students in JK up to and including Grade 12 with a special need(s). Funding will also be retroactive for qualifying parents to cover costs already incurred due to labour disruptions that have occurred during the current 2019-20 labour negotiations. More details about this financial support can be found by visiting Ontario.ca/SupportForParents or by calling the Support for Parents Helpline at 888-444-3770. ""Our government will continue to support parents and provide predictability during this period of union-caused uncertainty,"" said Jill Dunlop, Associate Minister of Children and Women's Issues. ""We will always put families and children first.""

Quick Facts

During a strike, licensed child care programs, including before- and after-school programs, will be allowed to extend their hours, request temporary relocation to avoid labour disruptions and request an increase to the number of children they are licensed to support. 
The province also intends to allow day camps to open to school-aged students without it counting against their 13-week per-year operating limit. 
The ministry is also considering other ways to support students with special needs during any strike action by teacher federations and/or education worker unions.
Parents can use the licensed child care finder to contact local operators about available licensed programs in their area.
On November 4, 2019, a central agreement was ratified between the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) and the Council of Trustees' Associations (CTA), with the agreement of the Government of Ontario.
On December 10, Minister Lecce announced a tentative agreement with the Education Workers’ Alliance of Ontario.

Worker Fatality in Wood Drying Kiln Results in $225,000 Fine for Flooring Manufacturer

Convicted: Satin Finish Hardwood Flooring, Limited (now known as Prodtor Inc.), a manufacturer of pre-finished hardwood flooring, 15 Fenmar Drive, Toronto, Ontario.
Location: The company's leased industrial manufacturing facility at 15 Fenmar Drive, Toronto. Description of Offence: A worker died after becoming trapped in an operating wood drying kiln.  Date of Offence: December 13, 2017.   Date of Conviction: January 9, 2020.   Penalty Imposed:  Upon conviction, Satin Finish Hardwood Flooring, Limited was fined $225,000 in provincial offences court in Old City Hall, Toronto, by Justice of the Peace Lynette Stethem; Crown Counsel Daniel Kleiman.The court also imposed a 25-per-cent victim fine surcharge as required by the Provincial Offences Act. The surcharge is credited to a special provincial government fund to assist victims of crime.  Background:  On December 13, 2017, a worker employed by Satin Finish Hardwood Flooring, Limited (now known as Prodtor Inc.) suffered fatal thermal injuries after becoming trapped in an operating wood-drying kiln at the workplace.The company's factory included three large wood-drying kilns made of sheet metal and capable of holding large quantities of wood while it is dried with high heat from a gas-fired appliance.The kilns are equipped with large hanger-style doors that open to load and unload wood. There are two 'man doors' on each kiln, one at the front and one at the rear of each kiln, through which workers enter or exit. The inside of the kilns has no source of either natural or artificial lighting. On that day, two workers were asked to fix a malfunctioning damper on kiln #3. The workers determined that the damper was frozen open, and that the best course of action would be to let the heat from the kiln melt the ice on the damper.Later that day, the two workers met at kiln #3 to check the status of the damper. One of the workers turned off the kiln; it would remain hot for some time after that.  After attending the control room, the workers opened the rear man door that leads to the heated wood-drying area in the kiln to assess if they could see sunlight through the dampers on the roof and thus determine the functioning of the frozen damper. The workers were unable to see any sunlight due to the steam in the kiln and the overcast day.One of the workers ascended to the roof of the kiln to free up the previously frozen damper, and the other went into the kiln's control room.The co-worker descended to the ground level and could not locate the other worker.The co-worker and a supervisor proceeded to kiln #3 and opened the front man door. They found the worker lying on the floor unresponsive with vital signs absent. At the time, the kiln was operating at a temperature of 149 degrees Fahrenheit or 65 degrees Celsius, with very high humidity.Emergency services were called and attended but were unable to save the worker.The (then) Ministry of Labour investigated with the assistance of a ministry engineer who examined the front man door where the worker had been found.There was a door lock assembly designed to be used to open the door either from inside or outside the kiln. In the closed-door position, the lock assembly had a latch which locked the door closed. The lock assembly was functional from outside the kiln, allowing workers to enter the kiln. However, on the inside there was a push bar (also known as an ""anti-panic system"") used to release the door latch from inside the kiln.The door could not be opened from the inside.  Corrosion was observed under the push bar and cracks seen in the body of the man door on the kiln-facing side.After disassembling the door lock, the engineer noted that an internal component known as a ""push pin"" was corroded and seized, which prevented the door from being opened with the push bar from inside the kiln once the door was latched in the closed position. The engineer concluded that this was the direct cause of the fatal event, as the worker was unable to open the latched man door and leave the operating kiln.The manufacturer's instructions for the door lock assembly outlines routine maintenance on the door lock assembly, including checking for corrosion of metal parts. The defendant did not have a preventative maintenance schedule at the workplace for the door assembly, and the door lock assembly was not maintained as recommended by the manufacturer.In addition, the weatherstripping and metal around the push bar had deteriorated and corroded, creating openings that allowed moist air to enter and corrode the door lock assembly. Both the corrosion and malfunctioning of the push bar could be detected during the normal use of the door.The ministry's engineering consultant concluded that maintenance would have prevented malfunctioning of the door lock assembly. The defendant failed as an employer to ensure that a man door to kiln #3 could be opened by a worker from inside the kiln once the door latched closed, and failed to ensure that the man door to kiln #3 and its ""anti-panic system"" or door lock assembly were maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.These were an offence under section 25(2)(h) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, which states that the employer ""shall take every precaution reasonable in the circumstances for the protection of a worker.""

Convicted: Noront Steel (1981) Limited, Walden Industrial Park, Copper Cliff, Ontario, operator of a steel fabrication facility.
Location: The company's facility at 100 Noront Road in the City of Greater Sudbury. Description of Offence: A worker received critical injuries when a steel drum exploded into flames.  Date of Offence: August 24, 2018.  Date of Conviction: January 13, 2020.  Penalty Imposed: Following a guilty plea, Noront Steel was fined $70,000 in provincial offences court in Sudbury by Justice of the Peace Sharon K. Ashick; Crown Counsel Wes Wilson.The court also imposed a 25-per-cent victim fine surcharge as required by the Provincial Offences Act. The surcharge is credited to a special provincial government fund to assist victims of crime.  Background: When Noront produced small steel objects, it stored and shipped them in 45-gallon steel drums. The drums were obtained used from other facilities.Typically the top would be cut off at Noront using an oxy-acetylene torch, and holes would be cut in the bottom of the barrel for drainage purposes. The barrels would be worked on in the condition they were received; they were not cleaned out first.On August 24, 2018, a worker was cutting drainage holes into a drum with a torch when the barrel exploded into flames. The worker received critical injuries.Investigation by the Centre for Forensic Sciences determined that the barrel contained flammable substances, included acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and toluene.Section 78(1)(b) of the Industrial Establishments Regulation (Regulation 851) requires that ""...where alternations are to be made on a drum, tank... or other container... [it] shall be drained and cleaned or otherwise rendered free from any explosive, flammable or harmful substance.""The barrel that exploded had not been rendered free from explosive and flammable substances before being provided to the worker for cutting. The contents of the barrel were not communicated to the worker and the label on the barrel indicated its contents were a substance that was not combustible.

Ontario Launches Redesigned Training Program for Corrections Officers
New curriculum includes focus on mental health training 

January 13, 2020 11:30 A.M.

Ministry of the Solicitor General


Hamilton — Ontario is launching its Corrections Foundational Training program today, a redesigned curriculum to educate and prepare the province's incoming correctional officers. This new training will give staff the tools they need to plan and build a career in corrections, as well as meet the needs of a modern correctional system.
Corrections Foundational Training replaces the former Correctional Officer Training and Assessment program and offers an increased focus on key areas such as human rights, mental health, health and safety, and teamwork. The new training program has been redesigned to include more job-specific case studies and scenario-based learning, as well as an emphasis on communication and de-escalation skills. The first group of students will begin the program today and develop skills over the next eight weeks. ""Staff safety and training is very important to me and to our government,"" said Solicitor General Sylvia Jones. ""This course will teach the skills our frontline officers need to succeed in a modern corrections environment.""   Staff feedback was integral to the reshaping of the entire program, including its name. The new curriculum also addresses concerns raised about the previous training program by various stakeholders, reports, and coroners' inquests.    Corrections Foundational Training is one part of the government's strategy to ensure frontline officers stay safe on the job and can meet day-to-day demands in the province's institutions.

Governments supporting Ontario's beekeeping sector
Helping Ontario Beekeepers Address Bee Health Issues and Grow their Business

January 13, 2020  9:30 A.M.

Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs


The governments of Canada and Ontario are supporting projects that will strengthen the health of managed honey bees and Ontario's beekeeping sector.
Since September 2019, the federal and provincial governments have committed more than $221,000 to support 135 projects. These projects will help beekeepers make improvements to better manage pests, diseases and other stressors and grow their bee-related business. Factoring in project funding coming from the businesses themselves, this represents a joint investment of more than $602,000 in the sector. The funding has been provided through a targeted application intake under the Canadian Agricultural Partnership (the Partnership). Eligible applications are being received and assessed on a continuous basis, while funding is available. Some projects supported through this targeted intake include:  Equipment to help managed honey bees survive over the winter monthsProjects to detect and manage pests such as varroa mitesTechnology to enhance productionEquipment to prepare operations for managing Small Hive BeetleMarket and customer research to help increase sales. ""Many of our agricultural crops depend on the health and productivity of our pollinators, and this regional approach to strengthening Ontario's honey bee populations plays a vital role in allowing our high-value crops to succeed,"" said the Honourable Marie-Claude Bibeau, federal Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.  ""Honey bees play an essential role in Ontario's agricultural sector and in maintaining healthy ecosystems,"" said the Honourable Ernie Hardeman, Ontario Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. ""That's why it's so important to support and sustain the health of our honey bees. This investment has helped over 135 beekeepers so far to equip themselves with better tools to prevent diseases, improve winter survival, adopt best management practices and grow their businesses."" Since June 2018, both the federal and provincial governments have committed cost-share support to approximately 2,500 projects through the Partnership to help eligible Ontario farmers, processors, businesses and sector organizations innovate and grow.

Quick Facts

The targeted application intake to support managed bee health opened on September 3, 2019. Eligible applications are being received and assessed on a continuous basis, while funding is available.
This initiative is delivered by the Ontario Soil and Crop Improvement Association (OSCIA), and supports specific beekeeping activities in two project categories: 

Advancing Beekeeper Business Capacity; and
Honey Bee Health Management.

OSCIA also delivers cost-share funding under the Partnership for farmers and other businesses (plant health) – the next application intake for this group is from January 8 to January 29, 2020. Program details, including how to apply, program guides, and application forms, can be found on the OSCIA website.
The health of honey bees is complex and influenced by several factors, including diseases, pests, genetics, environmental stressors and extreme weather.
In addition to producing honey, Ontario-managed honey bees pollinate a wide range of crops, including apples, apricots, asparagus, blueberries, squash and canola, both within Ontario and in other provinces.
Managed honey bees pollinate 80 per cent of all agricultural crops requiring insect pollination. They account for $395 million in pollination services to Ontario farmers and contribute $30 million a year in honey sales.
Examples of projects supported through the Partnership since June 2018 include: implementation of technology to enhance food safety in processing plants; improving adoption of cover crop management to help reduce phosphorous entering the Lake Erie watershed; installation of equipment to to improve biosecurity; technology solutions to improve labour productivity and marketing plans to help businesses to expand their markets.
The Canadian Agricultural Partnership is a five-year, $3-billion commitment by Canada's federal, provincial and territorial governments that supports Canada's agri-food and agri-products sectors.

The alert was issued in error to the public during a routine training exercise being conducted by the Provincial Emergency Operations Centre (PEOC).  There was no incident at the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station that should have triggered public notification. Nor was there ever any danger to the public or environment. Emergency exercises are a critical component of ensuring preparedness for emergency management and response agencies. The PEOC conducts training exercises regularly and there was no intention to notify the public in this instance.   The Government of Ontario sincerely apologizes for raising public concern and has begun a full investigation to determine how this error happened and will take the appropriate steps to ensure this doesn't happen again.""

Ontario making NOHFC programs open to broader range of businesses and workers

January 10, 2020  2:00 P.M.

Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines


FORT FRANCES - Ontario's government is helping increase access to post-secondary training and education for Indigenous and other residents in rural Northwestern Ontario.
Today, Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines, announced the Seven Generations Education Institute is receiving $2.25 million through the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation (NOHFC) for its Connected Classroom project. The project allows students to study close to home in a culturally sensitive environment where they are most likely to succeed. It also reduces barriers to obtaining future employment by providing easier access to post-secondary education and addresses the demand for more Indigenous professionals working in the health-care field. The institute is using provincial funding to digitally connect students from its four campuses - Dryden, Fort Frances, Kenora and Sioux Lookout - with Lakehead University's main campus in Thunder Bay. This will be done by purchasing and installing telepresence immersive technology videoconferencing equipment to administer programs such as the nine-month All Nations Nursing Entry Program and a four-year Bachelor of Science in Nursing program. Telepresence immersive technology is a video experience designed to deliver the feeling that participants in two or more locations are in the same room. When using a telepresence system, all participants are visible in life-size high-definition and no view is blocked by other participants. Presentations or other visual material can also be easily viewed. ""Our government's support for post-secondary education in rural Northern Ontario is creating good jobs and building prosperity and a better quality of life for northerners,"" said Minister Rickford. ""We recognize the importance and benefits of helping people access higher learning in their local communities."" ""The support from NOHFC will enable our students to access diverse programming not typically offered in our area,"" says Brent Tookenay, CEO of Seven Generations Education Institute. ""The connected classroom technology we are investing in will provide an immersive and collaborative classroom experience and remove travel as a significant barrier for our students."" The NOHFC promotes and supports economic development across Northern Ontario by providing financial assistance to projects - big and small, rural and urban - that stimulate growth, job creation and develop a skilled workforce. Ontario is working to develop new NOHFC programs that:  make it easier for more people and businesses to applysupport more projects in rural northern communitiestarget both existing and emerging market opportunitiesprovide more work opportunities for Indigenous peopleaddress the skilled labour shortage in the north. ""We have heard from northerners who want NOHFC programs to be open to a broader range of businesses and workers so that the unique needs of Northern Ontario communities are met,"" said Minister Rickford. ""Through these proposed changes, Ontario's government will continue to build strong and resilient communities while supporting an environment where businesses can thrive, grow and create good jobs."" Promoting and stimulating economic development initiatives in Northern Ontario is part of the government's plan to build Ontario together. Ontario's balanced and prudent plan is creating more jobs and opportunities in the north and keeping more money in people's pockets.

Quick Facts

Seven Generations Education Institute is an Indigenous-owned not-for-profit institution that provides educational programming to both Indigenous and non-Indigenous students at the secondary, post-secondary and vocational levels.
In addition to nursing programs, the Connected Classroom project offers other training and course opportunities, such as culinary classes and a mobile driver training simulator.
Since June 2018, the NOHFC has invested more than $147 million in 1,003 projects in Northern Ontario. This has leveraged more than $699 million in investment and created or retained over 3,000 jobs.

Full-time employment growth in Canada driven by gains in Ontario

January 10, 2020 10:45 A.M.

Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade


TORONTO —  The government's plan to build Ontario together is working — creating more jobs, putting more money in people's pockets and building towards the future.
Statistics Canada announced this morning that employment in Ontario increased by 25,100 in December. Since June 2018, employment in Ontario has risen by 296,700.   ""We are working to create an environment that attracts investment and encourages entrepreneurs to grow their businesses and create high-paying, good quality jobs in Ontario, and we are seeing the results of that,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. Last month, the Ontario Legislature officially passed the Better for People, Smarter for Business Act, 2019. The Act is part of the government's signature package to address red tape and modernize regulations to make life easier for people and business. The legislation will lower the cost of doing business by making it simpler and more cost-effective to comply with regulations — leading to more jobs, higher wages and more opportunities for hard-working families. Throughout 2020, the government is committed to continuing to find ways to reduce regulatory burden with legislative packages and several new initiatives. ""Ontario is heading in the right direction,"" said Fedeli. ""By reducing small business taxes and cutting red tape, we are creating a more competitive business landscape and giving job-creators the tools they need to create more jobs and build a more prosperous Ontario.""

Quick Facts

Full-time employment growth in Canada driven by gains in Ontario. Employment in Ontario grew by 243,000 in 2019.

Overall, Ontario’s small businesses will save $2.3 billion in 2020 through actions the government is taking such as cancelling the cap-and-trade carbon tax, keeping the minimum wage at $14 per hour, supporting Workplace Safety & Insurance Board premium reductions and delivering Ontario Corporate Income Tax relief through the Capital Cost Allowance.
A number of significant government actions are lowering costs for businesses in Ontario, allowing them to grow and create jobs, and creating a competitive environment to attract new investment. It is estimated that Ontario businesses could save $5.4 billion in 2020 through these actions.


Ontario has cut the small business Corporate Income Tax (CIT) rate by 8.7 per cent and reduced the rate to 3.2 per cent. Supporting small businesses is part of the government's plan to attract investment and enable entrepreneurs and risk takers to grow their businesses and create high-paying, good quality jobs.
Small businesses have benefited from accelerated write-offs of capital investments as well as the government’s decision to not parallel a federal measure that would have increased taxes on some small businesses earning passive investment income.
Ontario has launched the Job Site Challenge to identify shovel-ready mega sites where automakers or other advanced manufacturer could build a large plant that would create thousands of direct and supply-chain jobs. 
The government has launched a new Regional Development Program for eastern and southwestern Ontario. Businesses can get financial support through the Eastern Ontario Development Fund (EODF) and Southwestern Ontario Development Fund (SWODF) and guided access to a range of complementary services and supports.
Ontario will create the Premier’s Advisory Council on Competitiveness to work with business leaders and workers across the province to find ways to improve competitiveness and report back with actionable recommendations.

New Ads Showcase Skilled Trades as a Viable First Option 

January 10, 2020 10:30 A.M.

Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development


TORONTO — The Government of Ontario is taking action to attract more people to the skilled trades and employers to hire more apprentices. The province is facing a serious labour shortage which has the potential to get progressively worse. On any given day tens of thousands of jobs go unfilled and many of those are in the skilled trades.  
As part of the government's Open for Business, Open for Jobs strategy Monte McNaughton, the Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development, today launched a marketing campaign to highlight good-quality, well-paying and flexible careers in the trades, under the slogan 'Find a Career You Wouldn't Trade.' ""We need to do a better job at enticing young people and their parents to the skilled trades,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""For too long, we haven't viewed these challenging positions as a viable first option. That needs to change and our Open for Business, Open for Jobs strategy, including our new advertising campaign, will go a long way towards making the skilled trades more attractive."" The advertising campaign reflects the passion of real skilled tradespeople in their work environments. It features up-close footage of three skilled trades people with in-demand careers and high income potential: a tower crane operator, a steamfitter and an arborist.  The ads are just one part of the government's strategy to open up the skilled trades for young people and businesses. The government is also investing approximately $75 million in three programs to expose high school students to the trades: $12.7 million in the Ontario Youth Apprenticeship Program, $42 million in the Specialist High Skills major program and $20.8 million in a pre-apprenticeship program.  ""The reality is that the skilled trades offer exciting and challenging careers that often require solid math and problem solving skills, and expose people to the latest technologies such as 3D printing and robotics"", said Minister McNaughton. ""When it comes to opportunity, to earning potential, to having a chance to start your own business, the skilled trades come out on top.""  Over the first nine months of 2019, Ontario employers had, on average, 204,000 job openings across all occupations and industries. Of these, 13,000 were in the construction sector.  People can view the ads for students and parents on ONgov Youtube. The ads will run digitally, in movie theatres and on Tim Hortons TV across the province.

Government of Ontario Protecting the Health Care System from Fraud 
Switching to Secure Photo Health Card is Easy and Free

January  9, 2020  9:00 A.M.

Ministry of Health


Ontario is protecting the health care system against fraud by ensuring the final transition to a more secure photo health card. As of July 1, 2020, red and white health cards will no longer be accepted for Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) services. 
""The advanced security features of the photo health card help protect our public health system and is another measure to improve value for taxpayers' dollars,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""While there is no cost to convert or renew an Ontario photo health card, there could be significant costs by allowing red and white health cards, which could be used fraudulently, to remain in circulation. Each month, individuals using these outdated cards access up to $108 million in health services."" Starting this month, individuals with red and white health cards will begin to receive letters letting them know that they will need to get a photo health card at a ServiceOntario centre before the July 1, 2020, deadline.  Photo health cards can easily be obtained for free at ServiceOntario by:   Bringing the right original documents (proof of Canadian citizenship or OHIP-eligible immigration status; proof of residency in Ontario and proof of identity); Completing a Health Card Re-Registration form ahead of time or by getting one at ServiceOntario; andVisiting a ServiceOntario centre. Regardless of an individual's health card status, Ontario's public hospitals cannot refuse to provide services to a patient who is faced with a life-threatening medical emergency. Red and white card holders who do not convert by July 1, 2020, may be asked to pay up-front for insured health services as their red and white health card will not be valid. Once a photo health card is obtained, eligibility for Ontario health insurance is restored and any payments made for OHIP-insured health services will be promptly reimbursed once a valid health card is provided.   

Quick Facts

Approximately 300,000 red and white health cards remain in circulation. This represents two per cent of all Ontario health cards. 
In addition to sending multiple notification letters, the province will also advertise the final transition at all ServiceOntario locations and promote these changes on the ministry’s social media channels.

Lumber Mill Fatality in Chapleau Results in $250,000 Fine For Mill Owners

Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development


Convicted: Rayonier A.M. Canada Industries Inc., 4 Place Ville-Marie, Ste. 100, Montreal, Quebec, owner and operator of a softwood lumber mill in Chapleau, Ontario. Rayonier acquired the mill from Tembec Industries Inc., which operated the mill under the name Ryam Lumber, on May 31, 2018.
Location: The company's lumber mill at 175 Planer Road, Chapleau. Description of Offence: A worker was killed while operating a loader with fork attachments.  Date of Offence: May 25, 2018.  Date of Conviction: January 8, 2020. Penalty Imposed: Following a guilty plea, Rayonier A.M. Canada Industries Inc. was fined $250,000 in provincial offences court in Chapleau by Justice of the Peace Nathalie Breton; Crown Counsel Wes Wilson.The court also imposed a 25-per-cent victim fine surcharge as required by the Provincial Offences Act. The surcharge is credited to a special provincial government fund to assist victims of crime.  Background: A worker was tasked with removing bundles of wood from the lumber mill's kiln and placing them in the yard. There was no eye witness to the incident.It is believed that a load of wood had been placed in the yard and that the worker had reversed the loader, then gotten out of the machine to place three ""crossers"" (small pieces of wood) on the pile, so as to create a space between the original bundle and the next bundle to be placed on top of it.Two crossers were placed, and given their positioning and the length of the wood bundle involved, it is believed that the worker was in the process of placing a third crosser. The loader rolled forward and pinned the worker between the loader and the wood bundle.The worker died as a result of the subsequent injuries. Inspection of the loader revealed no mechanical defects to the braking system. However, it was determined that the brake actuator had been modified by the addition of a spring which made the parking brake easier to release.It was determined in the (then) Ministry of Labour's investigation that the forks of the loader had not been lowered securely to the ground, but rather had been resting on an 8"" x 8"" beam used to indicate where lumber bundles were to be placed.The loader had been parked on ground that sloped toward the wood bundle that had previously been deposited. The slope was found to be 6.3 per cent on the left side of the loader and 5.6 per cent on the right side.The ground was uneven, with deep ruts in the soil. No wheel chocks had been applied to the loader's wheels.Rayonier A.M. Canada Industries Inc. pleaded guilty to failing as an employer to ensure that the measures and procedures prescribed in section 57 of Ontario's Regulation 851 (the Industrial Establishments Regulation) were carried out in the workplace, contrary to section 25(1)(c) of the Occupational Health and Safety Act -that is, that a vehicle left unattended shall be immobilized and secured against accidental movement.

TORONTO — Today, Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education, issued the following statement regarding the upcoming province-wide EQAO Grade 9 math assessment:
""The EQAO Grade 9 math test provides valuable information to students, families, and the province about how students are performing in critical math skills and concepts. It also supports improved teaching and learning. It should not be in jeopardy for our students.  Regrettably, due to escalation by union leaders and the withdrawal of services by OSSTF, some secondary students will not be prepared for assessment this Monday.  OSSTF said their job action would not impact students, but this is a clear example of union disruption affecting Ontario students. It is unfair that union actions are undermining student success. They are jeopardizing the learning experience of Ontario's future leaders. The Government believes in setting students up for success and providing students, parents, and the province with data and insights needed to make critical policy decisions.  School boards will make local decisions about whether the province-wide EQAO Grade 9 math assessment, originally scheduled to start next week, should proceed. For those high schools which are not administering the test in January, students will need to take the test during the June 2020 administration period, as it provides a valuable opportunity for individual feedback for students and families. I recognize that this important assessment may not take place in the majority of English-public high schools. We continue to be concerned by the adverse impacts on students due to union escalation.  Our Government remains focused on investing in students - not enhanced compensation. We are focused on developing the skills our students need to succeed in the classroom and in the jobs of the future.""

TORONTO — Ontario has fulfilled its promise to cut the small business Corporate Income Tax (CIT) rate by 8.7 per cent by reducing the rate to 3.2 per cent effective January 1, 2020. Supporting small businesses is part of the government's plan to attract investment and enable entrepreneurs and risk takers to grow their businesses and create high-paying, good quality jobs.
""Ontario has tremendous opportunity and potential, and we are working to create the conditions for job creators to grow and succeed. An important part of our plan is to reduce the tax rate for small businesses, as they play a vital role in the economy,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. This tax cut will deliver up to $1,500 in annual savings to more than 275,000 businesses - from family-owned shops to innovative start-ups. Overall, Ontario's small businesses are saving $2.3 billion in 2020 through government actions such as cancelling the cap-and-trade carbon tax, supporting Workplace Safety & Insurance Board premium reductions, providing Ontario income tax relief and other measures. To date, the government has also taken over 100 actions to cut red tape for businesses. These and other expected measures would save businesses $400 million in compliance costs. ""A lower small business tax rate is a welcome way to kick off the new decade,"" said Julie Kwiecinski, Director of Provincial Affairs for Ontario at the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. ""The move will help make doing business in Ontario more affordable, providing extra money for job creators to use where it's most needed."" To continue to build on these steps, the government is consulting with industry and business leaders to inform its Small Business Success Strategy."

By cutting the small business Corporate Income Tax (CIT) rate to 3.2 per cent from 3.5 per cent starting January 1, 2020, the government has fulfilled its promise to cut the rate by 8.7 per cent—the government is helping to create a more competitive environment for small businesses. This tax cut will deliver up to $1,500 in annual savings to more than 275,000 businesses.
This tax relief and other actions the government has taken to lower business costs will save small businesses $2.3 billion in 2020. Here are two potential scenarios on how these measures benefit small businesses. Savings for a Local Business To illustrate these savings to a small business, consider Sue's Bakery, a local business that employs 11 staff including four that earn minimum wage. In total, Sue's Bakery would see savings of $10,955 in 2020 from Ontario measures, including:  $935 in Ontario CIT relief from the small business CIT rate cut and from accelerated write-off measures for capital investments,$780 in savings from the cancellation of the cap-and-trade carbon tax, $2,295 from reduced WSIB premiums, and $6,945 from keeping the minimum wage at $14 per hour.  Savings for a Small Manufacturer To illustrate these savings for a small manufacturer, consider Omar's Auto Parts Manufacturing, which employs 20 staff including four that earn minimum wage. In total, Omar's Auto Parts would see savings of $22,565 in 2020 from Ontario measures, including:   $5,045 in Ontario CIT relief from the small business CIT rate cut and from accelerated write-off measures for capital investments, $675 in savings from the cancellation of the cap-and-trade carbon tax,$7,200 from reduced WSIB premiums, and$9,645 from keeping the minimum wage at $14 per hour.  These are savings that can be reinvested to grow their businesses, buy more supplies and hire more people.

TORONTO — Today, Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education, issued the following statement in response to the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation (OSSTF) announcement of another one-day strike:
""Parents have been clear: strikes by unions hurt kids and investments should go to support student success, not towards enhanced compensation. We agree with Ontario parents. This is why we will continue to vigorously champion the interests of students and seek stability for parents in 2020, who are frustrated and tired of the union-led escalation that began in 2019. This continued strike action is unfair to students and their families.""

""People care about the welfare of animals and so does our government,"" said Solicitor General Sylvia Jones. ""We committed to creating a strong, new system to protect animals, and we have delivered on that promise.""  Effective January 1, 2020, Ontario will:  Implement the new model with more inspectors to provide province-wide coverage, including those with specialized expertise in livestock, zoos, aquariums and equines. Enable courts to impose the highest financial penalties for offenders in Canada.Update prohibitions and obligations, such as barring the return of dog fighting equipment to a person convicted of an offence and harming or attempting to harm a service animal or one that works with peace officers.Establish new oversight of inspectors that offers increased transparency and accountability, as well as a one-window complaints mechanism for the public.Establish a multi-disciplinary advisory table made up of a wide range of experts, including veterinarians, agriculture representatives, academics, animal advocates and others to provide ongoing advice to the ministry.  Transitional regulations have been put in place to ensure animals are protected while long-term regulations are developed through consultation, including through the multi-disciplinary table. The province has established a toll-free number, 1-833-9-ANIMAL (264625) for people to report concerns about animal distress or abuse. This call centre is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
