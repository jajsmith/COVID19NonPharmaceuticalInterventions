Ontario Ready to Respond to Spring Flooding Season 
Province and Partners Develop Further Preparedness Measures for Communities at Risk

May  2, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government has been actively working with federal and municipal governments, First Nations partners, and non-governmental organizations to prepare and respond to any flooding situation across the province during the COVID-19 outbreak.
As part of Ontario's flood preparedness planning, the province has been working with the federal government, municipalities and First Nations partners to develop evacuation plans. Recognizing the impact of COVID-19 on municipalities this year, Ontario is taking the lead on identifying suitable locations to host evacuees and to minimize the reliance on municipal resources for various supports, including health care and social services. As a result, the province has taken steps to ensure that provincial, federal and non-governmental resources, such as the Canadian Red Cross, can be deployed to minimize the burden on local communities as much as possible. The flooding update was provided today by Premier Doug Ford, John Yakabuski, Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry, Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General, and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""During these unprecedented times, our government is prepared for any scenario, and that includes the spring flooding season,"" said Premier Ford. ""By working together with our federal, municipal, and First Nations partners and putting our provincial flooding strategy into action, we have taken the critical steps needed to help keep people and communities safe."" Ontario has also been engaging with the federal government to support First Nations communities staying on their lands as long as it is safe to do so, including where First Nations community members would be temporarily relocated to higher and safer grounds within their own communities. Relocating community members from reserve to traditional hunt camps or other remote sites also addresses concerns around the potential spread of COVID-19 to these vulnerable communities. ""Our staff are closely monitoring ongoing flooding risks across the province and working with partners and communities on any areas of concern,"" said Minister Yakabuski. ""We are ready to respond to any requests for sandbags during this very challenging time. We also continue to work with our partners to advance the important long-term initiatives outlined in Ontario's Flooding Strategy, which will help us become more resilient to flooding events in the years to come."" Current provincial projections show a moderate-to-high risk of flooding for northern Ontario and the James and Hudson Bay coasts, where staff are closely monitoring all major tributaries in anticipation of ice breakup, expected to begin in early May. As of April 30, 2020, surveillance flights have begun across the Far North to monitor these ice breakups, with operations based out of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry's Moosonee Field Office. There is also a risk of shoreline flooding from snow melt in southern Ontario along the Great Lakes. The province's Surface Water Monitoring Centre in Peterborough continues to monitor water levels in other areas at risk throughout the province, including communities in the Ottawa Valley and along the Great Lakes. ""Thanks to the extraordinary efforts of our emergency management personnel and partners, we will be able to safely evacuate Northern communities and provide for their needs until they can safely return home,"" said Solicitor General Jones. ""We continue to monitor flood risks and we are assessing all necessary actions to maintain the safety and wellbeing of communities. We will be ready to proceed with evacuations should the need arise."" ""Our government will continue to work with First Nations leadership and the federal government to ensure the safety of remote Indigenous community members during the flood season,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Indigenous Affairs. ""If or when an evacuation occurs, it will be conducted in the safest way possible, providing additional support to evacuees and northern host communities. Indigenous leaders across the province have taken critical steps to protect their communities from the spread of COVID-19 and we will continue to support those efforts through out the flooding season."" In March, the government released Protecting People and Property: Ontario's Flooding Strategy, which outlines the steps the province is taking to reduce flood risks and help Ontarians better prepare for flooding events. Actions outlined in the strategy include increasing access to current and timely information, using improved future rainfall prediction data and establishing a flood mapping technical team.

Quick Facts

Ontario works to keep people safe and secure by coordinating with other organizations to prepare for and respond to emergencies. In parallel to the work done to prepare for potential flood-related evacuations, the province is also engaged in a contingency planning process to prepare for the forest fire season.
To determine the potential for flooding, Ontario monitors flood risks on a continuous basis. This includes using weather forecasts, recorded snow depths, and stream gauge and camera data to analyze water levels and flows.
For remote far northern areas of Ontario, the province uses radar and satellite imagery, surveillance flights and Indigenous community knowledge and expertise.
Ontario’s Surface Water Monitoring Centre carries out storm surge modelling and provides twice daily notifications to local conservation authorities and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry’s district offices along the Great Lakes.
Great Lakes water levels remain very high — particularly Lakes Erie, Huron, St. Clair and Superior — and this is expected to continue for the next few months. The municipalities of Chatham-Kent and Pelee both declared emergencies this year due to high levels and storm surge impacts on Lake Erie. 
In 2019-20, as part of a $1-million “Build Back Better” pilot project, the province provided municipalities that qualified for Municipal Disaster Recovery Assistance funding with up to 15 per cent above the estimated cost of rebuilding damaged public infrastructure to make it more resilient to extreme weather. Eligible projects include raising roads to provide better overland flow of water, improving bridges, and increasing the size of ditches and catch basins to increase their capacity to hold water.
The province’s updated Provincial Policy Statement (PPS), which came into effect May 1, responds to the recommendations of the report of the Special Advisor on Flooding and is part of Ontario’s Flooding Strategy. The PPS, 2020 acknowledges the role of the province, planning authorities and conservation authorities in working together to mitigate the risks associated with natural hazards, including the impacts of a changing climate.
As part of Ontario’s Action Plan: Responding to COVID 19, the government committed $4.3 million to support emergency planning and management in remote First Nations in the event that these First Nations are forced to evacuate during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Ontario Providing Support for Industrial and Commercial Electricity Consumers During COVID-19
Businesses to See Temporary Relief starting from April 2020

May  1, 2020  3:30 P.M.

Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines


TORONTO - Through an emergency order passed today, the Ontario government is taking steps to defer a portion of Global Adjustment (GA) charges for industrial and commercial electricity consumers that do not participate in the Regulated Price Plan for the period starting from April 2020. This initiative is intended to provide companies with temporary immediate relief on their monthly electricity bills in April, May and June 2020. The government intends to keep this emergency order in place until May 31, 2020, and subsequent regulatory amendments would, if approved, provide for the deferral of these charges for June 2020 as well.
This relief will prevent a marked increase in Global Adjustment charges due to the low electricity demand caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. Without this emergency order, a small industrial or commercial consumer (i.e., Class B) could have seen bills increase by 15 per cent or more. This emergency order will hold GA rates in line with pre-COVID-19 levels. ""Ontario's industrial and commercial electricity consumers are being impacted by COVID-19. They employ thousands of hardworking Ontarians, and we know this is a challenging time for them,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines. ""This would provide immediate financial support for more than 50,000 companies when they need it most: as they do their part to stop the spread of COVID-19 and as they prepare to help get our economy moving again.""

Quick Facts

The GA rate for smaller industrial and commercial consumers (i.e., Class B) has been set at $115 per megawatt-hour, which is roughly in line with the March 2020 value. Large industrial and commercial consumers (i.e., Class A) will receive the same percentage reduction in GA charges as Class B consumers.
Subject to the approval of subsequent amendments, deferred costs would be recovered over a 12-month period beginning in January 2021.

Ontario Takes Additional Steps to Improve Health Care Flexibility During COVID-19 Outbreak
Emergency orders issued to help better manage health care resources 

May  1, 2020  3:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Today, the Ontario government issued new temporary emergency orders under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act to support the immediate needs of the province's hospitals and health care workers so they can better manage critical health care human resources during COVID-19.
""By taking these steps today, we are improving flexibility for our hospitals and health care workers so they can focus more of their time and resources on providing patient care and stopping the spread,"" said Premier Ford. ""We will do whatever it takes to ensure our frontline health care heroes are safe and have everything they need to do their jobs more efficiently.""   The new temporary emergency orders issued today will: Give hospitals the authority and flexibility to more quickly appoint, re-appoint and grant privileges to medical and other professional staff, in order to address potential surge volumes due to COVID-19. This emergency order will allow for the reduction of administrative processes and better enable hospitals to focus operational resources on providing frontline services.Authorize coroners, registered nurses appointed as coroner investigators, and public health units to access the provincial electronic health record to help reduce demands on clinicians' time related to death investigations, reduce exposure to COVID-19 related death investigations, and improve the ability to monitor the spread of the virus.Allow registered nurses appointed as coroner investigators to complete medical certificates of death instead of a physician or nurse practitioner, giving these medical professionals more time to focus on patient care.""Extending the authority to a limited number of registered nurses, who are trained and authorized to investigate deaths, is imperative as we work to stop the spread of COVID-19,"" noted Solicitor General Sylvia Jones. ""This temporary order will help ensure clinicians remain available for patient care as well as provide respectful care of the deceased and the timely completion of medical certificates of death.""

Quick Facts

Registered nurses, currently appointed under s. 16.1 of the Coroners Act, are trained in all aspects of death investigation, including determination of cause and manner of death. Training specific to completion of the medical certificate of death will be provided with ongoing review and mentoring.
The completion of a medical certificate of death is necessary to understand the extent of infection and illness in the community.

Certain Businesses Allowed to Reopen Under Strict Safety Guidelines
Steady Decrease in COVID-19 Cases Required Before Beginning Next Stage of Reopening

May  1, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO ― The Ontario government is allowing certain businesses and workplaces to reopen as long as they comply with strict public health measures and operate safely during the COVID-19 outbreak. Those permitted to start up include seasonal businesses and some essential construction projects.
Today's announcement was made by Premier Doug Ford, Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance, Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. The Chief Medical Officer of Health has provided general recommendations on how the openings of businesses and workplaces could be implemented to support safe operations, including strict adherence to health and safety requirements. ""We are allowing certain businesses to reopen under strict guidelines because we are confident they can operate safely and adapt to the current environment,"" said Premier Ford. ""While further reductions in the spread are needed before we can begin reopening the province, we have the right framework and the right workplace guidelines in place to do so gradually and safely.""  The government, in partnership with Ontario's health and safety associations, has developed more than 60 guidelines in response to COVID-19. These sector-specific measures will help employers prepare their workplaces so they can be reopened safely and ensure workers, customers and the general public are protected. By following the proper health and safety guidelines these businesses will be permitted to begin operations on Monday, May 4 at 12:01 a.m.: Garden centres and nurseries with curbside pick-up and delivery only;Lawn care and landscaping;Additional essential construction projects that include:shipping and logistics;broadband, telecommunications, and digital infrastructure;any other project that supports the improved delivery of goods and services;municipal projects;colleges and universities;child care centres;schools; andsite preparation, excavation, and servicing for institutional, commercial, industrial and residential development;Automatic and self-serve car washes;Auto dealerships, open by appointment only;Golf courses may prepare their courses for the upcoming season, but not open to the public; andMarinas may also begin preparations for the recreational boating season by servicing boats and other watercraft and placing boats in the water, but not open to the public. Boats and watercraft must be secured to a dock in the marina until public access is allowed.""Ontario workers and businesses have shown exemplary cooperation and resilience throughout the course of this crisis,"" said Minister Fedeli. ""We're beginning to ease restrictions on select businesses as we carefully and methodically re-open Ontario's economy and continue together on our path to renewed prosperity."" Although certain businesses are being permitted to reopen, it is critical that people continue to stay home, practise physical distancing and only go out for essential reasons, to pick up groceries, prescriptions or to keep a medical appointment. It is through these simple actions that Ontario is making progress to stop the spread of COVID-19.   ""As we begin planning for the next phase of our fight against COVID-19, Ontarians should continue to stay home as much as possible to ensure we stop as quickly as possible the spread of this virus,"" said Minister Elliott. ""While we have made tremendous progress in our shared battle against this new virus, we are not done yet. We need to keep up the fight by continuing to practise physical distancing and good hygiene habits."" On April 27, the government released A Framework for Reopening our Province, which outlines the criteria Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health and health experts are using to advise the government on the loosening of emergency measures, as well as guiding principles for the safe, gradual reopening of businesses, services and public spaces. While the government remains in Phase One of Ontario's Action Plan in response to COVID-19, Protect and Support, allowing certain businesses and workplaces to open under strict guidelines demonstrates the government's commitment to balance the needs of the economy with the health and safety of the people of Ontario. ""People's efforts are paying off and we can see a light at the end of the tunnel,"" said Minister Phillips. ""Our response has always been based on the current status of the outbreak in our province, and on what makes sense for Ontario. To be clear ― we haven't moved into the reopening phase of our response to COVID-19. Not yet. But based on the best public health advice available to us, we are a step closer.""

Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry


The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry wants to remind migratory bird hunters that proper permits are required and that the rules regarding baiting and shot size are in place to protect the resource for future generations.
Five men have been fined a total of $11,600 for migratory bird hunting-related offences. Conservation officers launched an investigation, which included the use of a remotely piloted aircraft system, after receiving a tip from the public. Brett McLean and Guy Cooper of Mississauga, and Thomas Caravasilis of Toronto pleaded guilty to unlawfully depositing bait less than 14 days prior to the opening day for migratory birds. McLean, Cooper, Caravasilis, Thomas Davies of Gravenhurst and Lukas Timm of Orangeville pleaded guilty to hunting migratory birds within 400 metres of bait. Court heard that on September 20, 2019, a conservation officer witnessed Cooper and McLean placing bait in a pond near the Town of Gravenhurst. The following day, conservation officers witnessed the hunters engaged in migratory bird hunting on the same pond. Further investigation found that Davies was hunting without a permit and using toxic shot. He also failed to carry the required accreditation while hunting with a firearm. Justice of the Peace Doug Conley heard the case in the Ontario Court of Justice, Bracebridge, on March 4, 2020. MNRF conservation officers continue to patrol and protect our natural resources during the COVID-19 outbreak and would like to remind everyone that by respecting seasons, sanctuaries, bag and possession limits we all help ensure our natural resources stay healthy. Visit Ontario's website to learn more about how the province continues to protect Ontarians from COVID-19.

Province Takes Critical Steps to Help Businesses Adapt to New Environment

April 30, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO ― The Ontario government is ensuring employers have the safety guidelines they need to protect workers, customers, and the general public from COVID-19 as it prepares for a gradual reopening of the provincial economy.
The government safety guidelines released today will provide direction to those working in manufacturing, food manufacturing and processing, restaurant and food service, and the agricultural sector. These measures build on more than 60 guidelines developed by Ontario's health and safety associations in response to COVID-19 for various sectors such as retail, health care, construction, transportation, police services, firefighters, and transit employees.  ""We all want to reopen our businesses, services and favourite places across the province, but we must do it in a safe and responsible way,"" said Premier Ford. ""That's why we are providing clear guidelines to employers, with practical measures to help them keep staff and customers safe while preventing the spread of COVID-19. By taking these steps, we will be prepared to get people back to work when the time is right."" These new sector-specific guidelines feature recommended actions employers can begin to plan for as they prepare to adapt to the new reality during COVID-19, including: Ways to ensure appropriate physical distancing, like eliminating pay-at-the-door options, holding team meetings outdoors, staggering shift times and using ground markings and barriers to manage traffic flow.Changes to the workplace, like installing plexiglass barriers, increasing the air intake on building heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems to increase air flow, and using boot sanitizing trays.Promoting proper workplace sanitation, providing personal protective equipment, substituting dry dusting with vacuuming, ensuring customer-facing staff are given hand sanitizer, providing a place to dispose of sanitizing wipes, and enforcing handwashing before and after breaks.The government is also issuing posters to promote a variety of useful safety tips. The posters offer helpful advice on physical distancing and sanitation. They are downloadable from the Ontario.ca website so employers can print and post them in their workplaces. ""We are truly in extraordinary times and employers and employees are facing situations they have never had to deal with before,"" said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""It is incumbent on our government, with the advice of health officials, to provide the guidance and tips outlining the safest ways to reopen workplaces and help prevent the spread."" The government will work with Ontario's health and safety associations to bring forward additional workplace safety guidelines for more sectors in the coming days and weeks. Starting this week, 58 new inspectors will join the hundreds of existing provincial labour inspectors on the ground. The inspectors, which include workers from the Technical Standards and Safety Authority (TSSA) and the Ontario College of Trades (OCOT), will be tasked with communicating COVID-19 safety guidelines to essential workplaces or enforcing emergency measures, including physical distancing and the closure of non-essential businesses. ""Protecting the health and well-being of Ontarians during the COVID-19 outbreak has been and will always be our government's number one priority,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""These guidelines will help employers begin to plan for their safe reopening based on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health and in alignment with our framework to ease public health measures and restart our economy. In doing so, we can ensure we continue to stop the spread of COVID-19 and keep workers safe."" ""Our province's businesses have made great efforts to protect the health and safety of their workers throughout the course of this pandemic,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""These new guidelines will help employers continue to protect their staff and customers as we begin to carefully and methodically re-open our economy, so that we can return Ontario to prosperity in the safest way possible."" The government is committed to a careful, stage-by-stage approach to loosening emergency measures and reopening Ontario's economy. Public health and workplace safety will remain the top priority, while balancing the needs of people and businesses.

Last fall the government launched a review of PDSB to ensure an effective board governance that promotes equity, increases accountability, transparency and safeguards the success and well-being of all students. 
The Minister is directing this investigation pursuant to the authority under section 230 of the Education Act, as a result of concerns that the PDSB has contravened his binding Direction that all members of the Board, the Director of Education, and Associate Directors of Education undertake mandatory mediation (Direction 1).
Direction 1 further requires the PDSB to satisfy the Minister of Education that the Board can work together with the Director and Associate Directors of Education to provide good governance in the interests of all students of the PDSB. 
The Ministry has concerns about the PDSB’s ability to provide good governance and that the lack of co-operation among the members of the board, and with and among the senior leadership team, might result in a contravention of other Ministerial directions, specifically:  
 Direction 6 (mandatory trustee learning plan)
Direction 7 (composition of Board committees)
 Direction 8 (Director’s performance appraisal)
Direction 12 (Human Rights Commissioner’s independence of office)
 Direction 16 (Board anti-racism policy)

The PDSB is responsible for 257 schools in Brampton, Mississauga and Caledon, and over 155,000 students representing a rich array of racial, ethnic, linguistic and religious backgrounds.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government is launching the COVID-19: Tackling the Barriers website to help businesses overcome the unique challenges created by the global pandemic. Businesses working to retool their operations to produce health-related products, or those that want to continue their operations in this new environment of physical distancing, can submit any potential roadblocks to the website. The province is prepared to allow temporary changes to provincial rules and regulations in order to remove any barriers that are hindering business and negatively impacting Ontario's supply chain.
Today's announcement was made by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Prabmeet Sarkaria, Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction. ""With COVID-19, we are facing unchartered territory. As government, we must be prepared to work with businesses and show some flexibility in helping them to overcome challenges they may have never faced before,"" said Premier Ford. ""This website will allow us to listen to and support businesses as they adapt to this new environment. At the same time, it should also make it easier for businesses to retool to produce the health-related supplies and equipment that our frontline workers need."" ""During this extraordinary period, we need to do everything we can to support businesses as they struggle to operate as an essential business, or wait for the outbreak to subside,"" said Minister Sarkaria. ""Clearly, it is not business as usual for anyone, and that's why our government is prepared to temporarily adjust our processes, rules, and regulations to accommodate unforeseen circumstances. I encourage everyone to visit our new website if there are any questions or concerns."" The website builds on steps the government has already taken to help businesses respond to COVID-19, including: providing $10 billion in provincial tax deferrals, Workplace Safety and Insurance Board premium deferrals, and other business supports;providing more than $900 million in urgent relief to small businesses and their landlords through a new program, the Ontario-Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance Program (OCECRA);providing $50 million to help businesses such as manufacturers and distilleries retool so they can produce health-related products and supplies, such as ventilators, gowns, face masks and hand sanitizer;permitting 24-hour construction for critical infrastructure;permitting 24-hour deliveries in every municipality across the province to help grocery stores and pharmacies keep their shelves stocked; andallowing restaurants and bars to sell alcohol with food takeout or delivery orders.In order to help Ontario businesses focus on overcoming today's challenges, the province is also pausing or extending any existing public consultations, delaying non-urgent related consultations while the emergency situation remains in place, and considering extending deadlines for reports and audits.

TORONTO — The Honourable Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development, issued the following statement regarding the National Day of Mourning:
""Today, we observe the National Day of Mourning to honour those who have died, been injured or become ill in the course of their work. As Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development, I'm asking everyone in Ontario to take a few moments to remember those who are no longer with us, and think about those who are still living with the consequences of a workplace tragedy. The National Day of Mourning was established in 1984 to commemorate workers and their families affected by workplace accidents. It provides all of us with an opportunity to reflect on these unsung heroes who carried out their duties in circumstances they never could have imagined. This is an extraordinary year, as it brings with it the never-before seen risk of COVID-19. Clearly, this deadly virus puts us all in harm's way, especially our essential workers who have been on the front lines protecting us, caring for us and serving us since the outbreak began several weeks ago.   I am deeply saddened when I think of all of those who have lost their life due to COVID-19, including our workers and our seniors. Their lives will be celebrated, their contributions will be honoured, and their absence will be mourned. Our government is doing everything it can to make sure that workplaces are safe and workers can return home to your loved ones at the end of the day. I am committed to preventing and eliminating workplace accidents, by ensuring training and safety information is widely available, hiring more workplace inspectors and ensuring employees know they have the right to refuse to work in an unsafe environment. If a worker ever has any concerns about their safety at work, they can file a complaint with the Ministry's Health and Safety Contact Centre by calling 1-877-202-0008.   Today we're remembering those who have been killed, injured or become ill while on the job. Our ministry is continuing to develop Ontario's Occupational Health and Safety Strategy to prevent further workplace deaths, injuries and illness, and working with partners across our government to keep Ontario workers safe today, tomorrow and into the future.""

Premier and Ministers Commit to New Phased Approach for a Safe Restart and Recovery 

April 27, 2020  1:30 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Today, the Ontario government released A Framework for Reopening our Province, which outlines the criteria Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health and health experts will use to advise the government on the loosening of emergency measures, as well as guiding principles for the safe, gradual reopening of businesses, services and public spaces. The framework also provides details of an outreach strategy, led by the Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee, to help inform the restart of the provincial economy.
Details were provided by Premier Doug Ford, Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance, Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""Our top priority remains protecting the health and safety of the people of Ontario and supporting our frontline heroes as we do everything in our power to contain and defeat this deadly virus,"" said Premier Ford. ""At the same time, we are preparing for the responsible restart of our economy. This next phase of our response to COVID-19 is designed to help us map out what needs to be done, and when, to get us back on the road to recovery."" The government is planning a stage-by-stage approach to reopening the economy to ensure there are appropriate measures in place so workplaces can open safely. Public health officials will carefully monitor each stage for two to four weeks, as they assess the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak to determine if it is necessary to change course to maintain public health. Stage 1: For businesses that were ordered to close or restrict operations, opening select workplaces that can immediately modify operations to meet public health guidance. Opening some outdoor spaces like parks and allowing for a greater number of individuals to attend some events. Hospitals would also begin to offer some non-urgent and scheduled surgeries, and other health care services.Stage 2: Opening more workplaces, based on risk assessments, which may include some service industries and additional office and retail workplaces. Some larger public gatherings would be allowed, and more outdoor spaces would open.Stage 3: Opening of all workplaces responsibly and further relaxing of restrictions on public gatherings.Throughout each stage, continued protections for vulnerable populations must be in place, along with the continued practice of physical distancing, hand washing and respiratory hygiene, and significant mitigation plans to limit health risks. ""Recent public health indicators show us that we're beginning to turn a corner in the COVID-19 outbreak, while economic data, feedback from businesses and insights from our communities are outlining how we need to plan for economic recovery,"" said Minister Phillips. ""Turning on an economy after an unprecedented shut-down is not as simple as flipping a switch. We need to plan this out carefully to ensure we do not spark a sudden outbreak, undo the progress we have made and put the safety of the public at risk.""   To reopen the economy, the government will consider factors such as the risk of the spread of COVID-19 and the ability to implement protective measures to keep workplaces safe. The Chief Medical Officer of Health and health experts will provide advice to the government about easing public health measures using a range of set criteria, including: A consistent two-to-four week decrease in the number of new daily COVID-19 cases;Sufficient acute and critical care capacity, including access to ventilators and ongoing availability of personal protective equipment;Approximately 90 per cent of new COVID-19 contacts are being reached by local public health officials within one day, with guidance and direction to contain community spread; andOngoing testing of suspected COVID-19 cases, especially of vulnerable populations, to detect new outbreaks quickly.""It is because of the collective efforts of all Ontarians to stay at home and stop the spread of COVID-19 that we are able to consider plans to move into the next phase of our battle against this virus,"" said Minister Elliott. ""The Chief Medical Officer of Health has outlined some criteria he will use to advise government on when we may begin to slowly and safely ease public health measures and restart our economy. To be able to do so, we need everyone to continue their extraordinary efforts so that we can meet these thresholds and begin to move forward."" Supporting the next phases of Ontario's Action Plan, the new Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee, chaired by Minister Phillips, will be consulting with key sectors in all regions to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the provincial economy and develop a plan to move forward. The government and Members of Provincial Parliament will lead discussions with business associations, chambers of commerce, municipal leaders, the postsecondary sector, corporate leaders, small business owners, community and social service providers, Indigenous partners, Franco-Ontarians, entrepreneurs and others. The work of the committee will build on Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19, the first phase of the government's $17 billion response, that is delivering targeted relief for businesses and families across Ontario. ""The COVID-19 outbreak has had far-reaching economic impacts for businesses and communities across Ontario,"" said Minister Fedeli. ""In the face of these challenges, businesses and individuals have stepped up to support our frontline workers, produce essential equipment and keep our supply chains moving. Our plan to carefully and methodically reopen Ontario's economy will ensure that businesses are supported on our path to renewed economic prosperity.""

School Closures Extended to Keep Students, Staff and Families Safe
Students Will Still Be Able to Complete School Year 

April 26, 2020 12:30 P.M.

Ministry of Education


TORONTO — Today, Education Minister Stephen Lecce announced that all publicly-funded schools will remain closed until at least May 31, 2020, as part of an effort to keep students, staff and families safe from COVID-19.
The extension was based on expert advice from the Chief Medical Officer of Health and health officials on the COVID-19 Command Table and is part of the government's ongoing effort to stop the spread of the virus. The advice was to extend school closures for an additional period of time to permit updated modelling and data to inform next steps, given the government's absolute commitment to safety. ""We will do whatever it takes to keep our students safe,"" said Minister Lecce. ""The government is taking a careful approach which provides our medical experts the time to review the modelling and make the best decision for the safety of our students and the future of learning.""  The government took immediate action to close schools in Ontario, the first in Canada to do so. The ministry continues to monitor the evolving situation and if necessary, the closure may be extended further to protect the health and safety of Ontario's school communities. At the same time the Ontario government is taking steps to ensure learning can continue. In March the province unveiled its Learn at Home portal. It offers all students high-quality resources, featuring made-in-Ontario math and literacy resources, created by Ontario-certified educators, in both English and French. Elementary resources are designed to help young students learn at home with interactive activities that encourage participation through entertaining and stimulating digital content. High school content was designed with a focus on STEM courses and ensures core competencies and skills are reinforced. At the end of March the Ministry of Education unveiled the second phase of Learn at Home to ensure the continuity of learning for students. This included providing clarity for parents, enhancing education supports and creating opportunities for educators to connect with students. The government has also partnered with Rogers Communications and Apple to help meet the educational needs of students and families during the COVID-19 outbreak. iPads are being purchased and distributed by Ontario school boards, pre-equipped with free Rogers LTE wireless data. Apple is providing on-going support in French and English to teachers, parents and students, with a collection of resources to support learning and working from home. To date, over 20,000 iPads have been sent to targeted families in need. The free Rogers wireless data will be available until the end of June. ""Regardless of what transpires over the coming weeks, Ontario's students will be able to complete their school year with confidence,"" added Minister Lecce. ""In particular, for students in their final year, we are removing all impediments to ensure students graduate and pursue post-secondary education."" 

Quick Facts

Should schools be permitted to reopen, school employees will have access as of May 29, 2020.
The Ministry of Education will move forward to replace the remainder of Professional Activity (PA) days and examination days with instructional time, as well as the introduction of an expanded summer learning program that will focus on credit recovery, supports for vulnerable students, and course upgrading. Boards are to find solutions at the local level in keeping with this direction while upholding collective agreement obligations.
Private schools, First Nation schools, licensed child care centres and EarlyON programs will remain closed until May 6, 2020, with certain exceptions for licenced care, under an emergency order made under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, which only allows closures to be extended for 14 days at a time.
Through the Ontario Together web site, the province received more than 300 proposals from businesses, organizations and everyday Ontarians to provide solutions to remote learning while schools are closed during the COVID-19 global pandemic. Next steps will be shared soon.

This increase will provide four dollars per hour worked on top of existing hourly wages, regardless of the qualified employee's hourly wage. In addition, employees working over 100 hours per month would receive lump sum payments of $250 per month for each of the next four months. This means that eligible employees working an average of 40 hours per week would receive $3,560 in additional compensation. Those eligible to receive the payment will be staff working in long-term care homes, retirement homes, emergency shelters, supportive housing, social services congregate care settings, corrections institutions and youth justice facilities, as well as those providing home and community care and some staff in hospitals. The announcement was made today by Premier Doug Ford, Peter Bethlenfalvy, President of the Treasury Board, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""During these dark days, the Ontario spirit continues to shine through with everyday acts of heroism, courage, and compassion by our frontline workers,"" said Premier Ford. ""These people put themselves in harm's way to care for our sick and vulnerable citizens. I am truly grateful, as are the people of Ontario, for their service, and it's time we give something back to those who sacrifice so much day in and day out."" Staff providing frontline clinical services, along with those providing support services, such as cleaning and meal preparation, will be eligible to receive the pandemic payment. The additional compensation is temporary and would begin flowing immediately and continue for 16 weeks. ""The pandemic payment recognizes the valiant efforts of our frontline workers in the fight against COVID-19,"" said Minister Bethlenfalvy. ""These heroic workers are delivering critical services that support all Ontarians, including the most vulnerable members of our communities, often putting themselves or their loved ones at risk. They are saving lives and we owe them an incredible debt of gratitude."" ""It is vital that we retain our frontline health care workers as we continue our fight to stop the spread of COVID-19,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""We are taking further actions to continue to ensure that our healthcare workers are supported, and the health care sector maintains a safe staffing level, especially in places where it is needed the most."" These measures build on steps the government has already taken to support frontline workers, including providing free emergency child care and securing necessary medical equipment and supplies.  The Ontario government remains committed to using every resource it has to support frontline workers as we work to stop the spread of COVID-19.

TORONTO — On the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health, the Ontario government is introducing new and amending some emergency orders under subsection 7.0.2 (4) of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act to better support Ontario's long-term care homes and deafblind community. The orders would allow for the redeployment of staff to ensure they can work where they are needed most during the COVID-19 outbreak.

""That's why we are doing everything we can to support them through these tough economic times, so they can hit the ground running when we are in a position to open up the provincial economy. I want to thank the federal government for partnering with us to help our small businesses and commercial landlords. I look forward to working together to also provide much-needed support to residential renters ahead of May 1."" The OCECRA will provide forgivable loans to eligible commercial property owners experiencing potential rent shortfalls because their small business tenants have been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. To receive the loan, property owners will be required to reduce the rental costs of small business tenants for April to June 2020 by at least 75 per cent and commit to a moratorium on evictions for three months. Partnering with the federal government on the OCECRA builds on the provincial government's approach to supporting business during COVID-19. As part of Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19, the government has implemented a series of cash flow supports amounting to $10 billion to help support jobs and the economy, including: Doubling the Employer Health Tax exemption for 2020, cutting taxes by $355 million, benefiting roughly 57,000 employers;Eliminating penalties and interest to businesses who miss filing or remittance deadlines for various provincially administered taxes for five months starting April 1, 2020, providing up to $6 billion in cashflow for about 100,000 Ontario businesses;Postponing the planned property tax reassessment for 2021, providing stability for Ontario's property taxpayers;Deferring the upcoming quarterly (June 30) remittance of education property tax to school boards by 90 days, providing municipalities with the flexibility to, in turn, provide property tax deferrals of over $1.8 billion to local residents and businesses;Implementing the new Regional Opportunities Investment Tax Credit for businesses that make eligible capital investments in designated regions of the province where employment growth has significantly lagged behind below the provincial average.Ontario has also suspended time-of-use electricity rates for eligible small businesses, as well as residential and farm time-of-use customers, holding electricity prices to the off-peak rate of 10.1 cents-per-kilowatt-hour, for 24 hours per day, seven days a week for 45 days, for all time-of-use customers, who make up the majority of electricity consumers in the province. By switching to a fixed off-peak rate, time-of-use customers will see rate reductions of over 50 per cent compared to on-peak rates. ""To help stop the spread of COVID-19, businesses have closed their doors and employees have stayed home and that has been working, but it has also created significant financial hardship,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. ""By subsidizing rent payments, reducing taxes, extending deadlines, and eliminating penalties and interest, we're helping to ensure businesses can start up quickly when the time is right."" The Ontario government has also worked with the federal government to develop the Small and Medium-sized Enterprise Loan that will enable up to $40 billion in lending, supported through Export Development Canada and the Business Development Bank. This program will help businesses meet cash flow requirements through guaranteed loans. ""Ontario's small and medium-sized businesses are vital to our economy and include some of the hardest-working people in the world who have rolled up their sleeves to support our frontline healthcare workers, and beat this virus,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""This package of supports will help them get through these difficult days and resume normal operations as soon as possible."" ""In the months ahead, small businesses will be critical to Ontario's economic recovery. Together with our federal partners, we are ensuring we support our small businesses today, so that they can continue to create opportunities for hardworking Ontario families tomorrow,"" said Prabmeet Sarkaria, Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction. ""With rents coming due, it's extremely important that the federal government move quickly to implement this program and get small businesses and property owners the support they urgently need.""

""Beginning today at sundown, Muslims in Ontario and all over the world will observe the month of Ramadan. For the Muslim community, Ramadan is the most important and holiest month of the year. It is a time for self-reflection, charitable giving, and prayer. This year, Ramadan will be unlike any other, as we continue to practise social distancing to fight the COVID-19 outbreak. This will mean Muslims will have to pray at home rather than in services at mosques, but the spirit and meaning of Ramadan will continue to inspire those observing this sacred time. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the Muslim community for their generosity and support towards those in need during this unprecedented time. On behalf of the people of Ontario, I wish the Muslim community a happy Ramadan and I look forward to celebrating with you next year.""

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Ontario is delivering a new COVID-19 Action Plan for Vulnerable People to better protect vulnerable populations during the outbreak of COVID-19. This plan builds on the government's previous actions to protect people living in high-risk settings, including homes serving those with developmental disabilities, shelters for survivors of gender-based violence and human trafficking, children's residential settings, and those residential settings supporting vulnerable Indigenous individuals and families both on and off reserve.
Details of the plan were unveiled today by Premier Doug Ford, Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""The plan we are announcing today will build on and support the critical work that is currently being carried out each and every day by our frontline heroes to care for our most vulnerable citizens,"" said Premier Ford. ""These people are most at risk during this pandemic and that's why we are helping these organizations immediately ramp up screening and testing, deploy more protective masks and gloves, and put more boots on the ground in the fight against COVID-19."" ""We have been working in close partnership with the federal government, municipalities, First Nations, Indigenous organizations and bargaining agents as part of the rapid response to COVID-19 in congregate care settings,"" said Minister Smith. ""The action plan we are delivering today lays out a set of interventions, tailored by sector, to enable prevention and infection control, while maintaining service continuity for the benefit of our vulnerable clients and staff."" The COVID-19 Action Plan for Vulnerable People focuses on three specific areas: Enhanced Screening and Reduced Exposure to Prevent SpreadEnhancing screening of visitors, staff, and residents on sites, as well as restricting non-essential visitors.Providing masks to staff working in congregate care settings and providing training on the use of personal protective equipment in the event of an outbreak.  Infection Control: Managing Outbreaks and Limiting SpreadEnhancing testing of symptomatic staff and clients to identify the need for isolation and additional infection control measures on-site.Planning to limit staff from working at more than one congregate care setting during an outbreak, specifically in developmental services, intervenor services, violence against women and anti-human trafficking settings.Providing additional training and support for high-risk settings dealing with an outbreak, including guidance on how to isolate clients.Sustaining Staffing and Managing Staff ShortagesWorking with organizations to promote workforce stability and capacity in high-risk settings.""Women and children who are in a vulnerable place in their lives must have access to the supports they need and a setting that is safe,"" said Jill Dunlop, Associate Minister of Children and Women's Issues. ""We are taking steps to stop the spread of COVID-19, including physical distancing, flexible staffing, and cleaning and disinfecting protocols, to keep people safe where they work and where they live."" ""We know that those who live and work in homeless shelters face unique challenges because of the COVID-19 outbreak,"" said Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. ""That's why we're working closely with service managers and our local partners to collect data and identify specific actions we can take to help."" The government will work with Indigenous-led congregate care settings both on and off reserve to ensure that these tools and supports are available and adapted to meet their local needs in keeping their clients and staff safe. ""Indigenous leaders across the province have taken swift action to protect their communities from the spread of COVID-19 and today's enhanced safety measures will provide additional protection for those community members living and working in congregate care settings,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines and Minister of Indigenous Affairs. The plan also supports mobilizing action to assessed high-risk locations in managing the COVID-19 outbreak in the days and weeks to come by providing assistance with staffing and additional training and support. The government is also moving immediately to solicit ideas on additional actions and measures that can be taken now to further support vulnerable Ontarians and staff in high-risk settings.

Quick Facts

Tens of thousands of Ontarians live and work in congregate care settings across more than 4,000 locations.
The Action Plan builds on current measures implemented by the government to protect vulnerable populations, including visitor restrictions, flexibility for staff hours, expanded access to emergency daycare for frontline workers, and providing alternate settings for care. 
The province has also suspended evictions, provided funds through the province’s $200 million Social Services Relief Fund to Service Managers and invested over $37 million to support outbreak planning, prevention and mitigation efforts to ensure the health and well-being of Indigenous people and communities. Constant monitoring is also underway with local public health organizations.
The government is expanding the list of eligible expenses under Special Services at Home and for Passport funding. We will also continue to assist families and provide greater clarity about what expenses are eligible under the Ontario Autism program, including Childhood Budgets and Interim one-time funding, for the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak.

TORONTO — The Ontario government is making progress on the implementation of the COVID-19 Action Plan for Protecting Long-Term Care Homes to help stop and contain the spread of COVID-19 in the province's long-term care homes. The government has introduced more aggressive testing, screening, and surveillance, deployed specialized teams from hospitals, public health and the home care sector, recruited additional frontline staff, and increased personal protective equipment.    
Today's update was provided by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""Within 48 hours of launching our Action Plan, we sent in reinforcements to further protect our most vulnerable seniors and those who care for them in our long-term care homes,"" said Premier Ford. ""Today, we are making progress against this ruthless disease, but I want to emphasize that every option is on the table to get our long-term care homes what they need to stop the spread. That is why we intend to make a formal request for assistance from the federal government."" Since the Action Plan was announced, the government has worked swiftly and decisively to provide targeted, on-the-ground support to long-term care homes through the following measures: Assisting 20 long-term care homes, which were previously experiencing outbreaks, to become now outbreak-free. Increasing testing on both symptomatic and asymptomatic staff and residents. To date, approximately 11,600 tests have been completed amongst residents in long-term care.Conducting additional testing of asymptomatic residents and staff outside of the testing guidance at 21 long-term care homes, to help understand the spread of the virus.Setting up a 24/7 Long-Term Care COVID-19 Response Team, which has already helped more than 30 homes by putting in place infection control protocols, resolving staffing issues, and fulfilling personal protective equipment needs.Launching 31 Infection Prevention and Control interventions, which are currently in progress, with six assessments already completed. Continuing to identify critical 24-, 48-, and 72-hour help that homes need by matching qualified people and volunteers who can help with duties, including nursing support and cleaning. Responding to every escalated request for personal protective equipment from long-term care homes within 24 hours through the following measures:A four-step process is in place to ensure an optimized regional distribution and redistribution when supplies are urgently needed.Critical supply needs are escalated for provincial action.Daily distribution of supply from provincial warehouses to regional sites.Daily monitoring of and reporting against performance target of 100 per cent of critical need requests being shipped within 24 hours.Working with hospitals across the province to deploy additional staffing and infection prevention controls in long-term care homes:In Toronto alone, five hospitals (Michael Garron Hospital, Women's College, North York General, Unity Health Toronto and Mount Sinai Hospital) have been engaged to support approximately 40 long-term care homes in the city.Other hospital partners and health partners have stepped up to help their local homes, including Trillium Health Partners, Halton Healthcare, Grand River, Cambridge Memorial Hospital, and the Ottawa Hospital.More than 70 volunteers, including registered nurses, social workers, administration and medical doctors, have been recruited from the University Health Network to assist long-term care homes in the Greater Toronto Area.Providing over 400 job matches for long-term care homes through the province's Health Workforce Matching Portal, with over half of Ontario's long-term care homes now using the portal.To further support ongoing efforts to fight COVID-19 in Ontario's long-term care homes, the federal government has offered resources that could include personnel and other supports from Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada and Canadian Armed Forces. This support would be deployed to five priority long-term care homes as one element of the government's robust Action Plan. The Ontario government will be making a formal request to access those extra reinforcements today. The government continues to explore additional measures to help stop the spread of COVID-19 and keep vulnerable people safe, including building isolation capacity at long-term care homes. ""We must continue to act swiftly and decisively to keep our loved ones in long-term care safe, as well as their caregivers,"" said Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""Our long-term care homes continue to be the front-lines of this pandemic and we must continue to work around the clock to assist all our dedicated staff during this crisis.""

TORONTO — Today, Jeff Yurek, Minister of Environment, Conservation and Parks released the following statement on the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.
""Today is the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, the day that we as global citizens come together to increase awareness and appreciation of Earth's natural environment. It's a chance to reflect on the importance of the environment to our own health and wellbeing, and what we must do to protect it for future generations. As we continue to fight the spread of COVID-19, we are seeing, first hand, how our personal contributions make a difference. Now, more than ever, true meaningful action begins at home.  I've been so inspired by what I've seen online these past few weeks. I've seen gardeners re-growing their own produce from vegetable stalks and making seed pods using old toilet paper rolls, people sewing masks from used textiles and children creating homemade ""thank you"" signs to show appreciation to frontline waste collection workers.  I've also been encouraged by all the organizations like the Toronto Zoo and Earth Rangers stepping it up to offer free daily educational activities virtually that help growing minds stay connected with nature and wildlife, while practicing physical distancing.  Our government continues to take action to support a healthy and clean environment through actions committed to in our Made-in-Ontario Environment Plan. Through our plan, we will continue to protect our land, air, and water, address litter and reduce waste, and fight climate change.   So today, on Earth Day, I want to thank you all for your incredible contributions and I look forward to engaging with you as we work together to make our communities and our province a cleaner, healthier place to live, work and grow.""

Funding and services will help seniors and people with disabilities during the COVID-19 outbreak

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government is delivering much-needed support to Ontario's most vulnerable citizens, including seniors and persons with disabilities, during the outbreak of COVID-19. The province is investing $11 million to help deliver meals, medicines and other essentials to those in need and doubling the Guaranteed Annual Income System (GAINS) payments.
Today's announcement was made by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care, and Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services.   ""As we face some of the darkest times in our province's history, we have a duty to protect and care for the most vulnerable in our society,"" said Premier Ford. ""Our seniors and people with disabilities are the most at risk during this crisis, and we must go above and beyond to ensure they get financial relief, food, medicine and other essentials without delay."" The province is working with the Ontario Community Support Association (OCSA) to launch a new Ontario Community Support Program to expand existing Meals on Wheels services to reach low-income seniors and people with disabilities and chronic medical conditions across Ontario. The program will also develop the capacity of community organizations and others to help deliver medication and other essentials. ""We know that the best way we can all take care of ourselves during this outbreak is to stay home,"" said Raymond Cho, Minister for Seniors and Accessibility. ""For older Ontarians and people with disabilities, this may be especially challenging. That is why I am so proud to see the Ontario Spirit being demonstrated by the volunteers, local not-for-profit organizations, charities and businesses that are helping our most vulnerable through the Ontario Community Support Program."" This week the province will also be issuing the first doubled Guaranteed Annual Income System (GAINS) payments. Individuals will receive up to $166 per month and couples will receive up to $332 per month. These doubled payments will continue for six months and provide an additional $75 million to 194,000 vulnerable seniors who may need more help to cover essential expenses during the COVID-19 outbreak. ""As part of Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19, we are investing $3.7 billion to provide immediate and direct support to Ontario's people and employers. It starts with those most in need,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. ""For our vulnerable seniors, we will double the Guaranteed Annual Income System payment for six months. That will ensure 194,000 of our lowest income seniors will have some extra support during these unprecedented times. The first payment will start to arrive this week and assist low income seniors with their essential expenses when they need it most."" The province is investing $40 million in the Residential Relief Fund. The funding will assist developmental services, child welfare, victims shelters, and organizations delivering social services to vulnerable First Nations individuals and families with COVID-related costs, such as the purchase of personal protective equipment (PPE) and enhanced staffing. In addition, the government is providing $148 million to municipal partners that administer social services with funding to support the province's most vulnerable as part of the province's $200 million in social services relief funding in response to COVID-19. ""Our government is taking decisive action to protect the health and safety of our most vulnerable populations,"" said Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services. ""If you have a friend or neighbour who is a senior or a person with a disability, please reach out to them to ensure they have what they need and are doing okay during this very difficult period.""

""At sundown, the people of Ontario and the Jewish community across the province and around the world will remember one of the darkest periods in human history. Yom HaShoah commemorates the lives and heroism of Jewish people who were brutally murdered by the Nazi regime during the Second World War. We must never forget the millions of women, children and men who lost their lives in the Holocaust. What took place during the Holocaust must never be repeated. We remember not only the atrocities, but also the many heroes and survivors, so that we can learn from the past and educate future generations. As survivors age, we must renew our commitment to remember the past and to vigilantly keep the promise - never again. We recognize the many contributions of the Jewish community to our province, while renewing our commitment to fight anti-Semitism and hate in all its forms. I want to thank MPPs Will Bouma and Robin Martin for leading a private members' bill to officially adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism. We are stronger when we stand together. Ontario will always promote a society that respects diversity and freedom.""

Health Experts Say the COVID-19 Outbreak Has Likely Peaked in Ontario 
Modelling shows physical distancing still needed to prevent further spread

April 20, 2020 12:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government today released updated COVID-19 modelling, which shows that the enhanced public health measures, including staying home and physically distancing from each other, are working to contain the spread of the virus and flatten the curve. However, the Chief Medical Officer of Health says emergency measures must remain in place to continue reducing the number of cases and deaths.
""The modelling clearly demonstrates that we are making progress in our fight against this deadly virus. That's due to the actions of all Ontarians, those who are staying home and practising physical distancing, and to the heroic efforts of our frontline health care workers,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""But COVID-19 continues to be a clear and present danger, especially to our seniors and most vulnerable citizens. That is why we must continue to follow the advice of our Chief Medical Officer of Health and stay the course in order to keep people safe and healthy."" Key highlights from the modelling update include: The wave of new community spread cases of COVID-19 in Ontario appears to have peaked.Outbreaks in long-term care and congregate settings continue to be a major concern. Concerted actions are underway to protect vulnerable people in these settings.Ontario is now trending toward a best case scenario rather than a worst case scenario and has significantly improved its standing as compared to March modelling.The province has avoided a significant surge in cases. Total cumulative cases are forecast to be substantially lower than worst case or even moderate case scenarios projected by previous models.While several hundred new cases are identified daily in Ontario, hospitals across the province have not been overwhelmed by the COVID-19 outbreak as a result of capacity planning and the public health measures currently in place. The rate of growth day-over-day is declining.To further reduce the number of cases and deaths, it remains critical that Ontarians continue to adhere to public health measures, including staying home and practicing physical distancing if they must go out for essential reasons only.""The information released today shows early but unmistakable signs that our efforts are working,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""These numbers are not an accident. They are the result of months of planning and collective action to stop the spread of COVID-19 and flatten the curve. However, in order for these projections to become reality, each of us must continue to stay home as much possible and practise physical distancing."" To enhance protections for residents and staff in long-term care homes, last week Ontario launched the COVID-19 Action Plan: Long-Term Care Homes. This action plan will ensure the implementation of critical new measures to prevent further outbreaks and deaths from COVID-19 in long-term care homes. These measures include enhancing and expanding testing for symptomatic and asymptomatic contacts of confirmed cases; providing public health and infection control expertise; and redeploying staff from hospitals and home and community care to support the long-term care home workforce. ""The new province-wide modelling data are encouraging, but we know that long-term care homes and other congregate settings will track on a different path,"" said Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""We will continue to take aggressive action to support our most vulnerable residents and their caregivers.""

Quick Facts

All Ontarians need to stay home unless absolutely necessary for essential trips, such as accessing health care services, groceries, picking up prescriptions or supporting vulnerable community members with meeting essential needs. If you must leave your home, go alone and stay at least two metres apart from others.
Ontario has made improvements to its COVID-19 Self-Assessment Tool by expanding its symptom list, addressing the most high risk individuals, and making it more accessible and responsive. 
Take these everyday steps to reduce exposure to COVID-19 and protect your health: wash your hands often with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer; sneeze and cough into your sleeve; avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth; avoid contact with people who are sick; stay home if you are sick.

On March 3, 2020, both men pleaded guilty to charges under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Actin Bancroft Provincial Offences Court, before Justice of the Peace Ernest Parsons. Brandon Bellis of Foxboro was fined $3,000 for discharging a firearm without reasonable consideration for people or property and $500 for possessing illegally killed wildlife. He also received a one-year hunting suspension and must successfully retake the Ontario Hunter Education Course before he can hunt again. Eric Mclennan of Campbellford was fined $3,000 for discharging a firearm without reasonable consideration for people or property and $500 for possessing illegally killed wildlife. He also received a one-year hunting suspension and must successfully retake the Ontario Hunter Education Course before he can hunt again. The seized deer was donated to a local charity. Conservation officers continue to patrol and protect our natural resources during the COVID-19 outbreak and would like to remind everyone that by respecting seasons, sanctuaries, bag and possession limits we all help ensure our natural resources stay healthy.

Ontario Enables Auto Insurance Companies to Provide Driver Rebates During COVID-19 
Regulatory Changes Open the Door for Auto Insurance Rebates

April 16, 2020  3:00 P.M.

Ministry of Finance


TORONTO — The Ontario government is enabling auto insurance companies to provide temporary insurance premium rebates to drivers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The province has amended a regulation under the Insurance Act to help ease the financial pressure on working people and families during this public health crisis.
By amending this regulation insurance companies would be able to provide auto insurance premium rebates to consumers for up to 12 months after the declared emergency has ended.  ""We are in an unprecedented time and people are experiencing extraordinary financial pressures,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. ""My message to insurance companies has been clear: they should provide relief that reflects the financial hardships their dedicated customers are facing due to the COVID-19 outbreak."" ""All of us will remember how companies treat us during these unprecedented times. I often remind business leaders that their customers from the past five years are likely to be their customers for the next five years,"" said Phillips. ""Insurance companies indicated that the regulation preventing rebates was a barrier to providing relief to their customers. That barrier has now been removed so auto insurance companies can step up and do the right thing for the people and families of Ontario."" The Government and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario (FSRA) will continue to work together to monitor how the auto insurance sector is responding. 

Quick Facts

Ontario is the first jurisdiction in Canada to remove existing restrictions on rebating so auto insurers can provide additional consumer relief. 
The rebating prohibition is designed to protect consumers from being misled in purchasing decisions based on a rebate and to provide consumer protection from insurers who may discriminate between consumers.
Auto insurance policy terms generally last for 12 months. The 12-month time period of this regulation would allow insurers to provide rebates to all policyholders, regardless of their annual policy renewal date.
The Financial Services Regulatory Authority of Ontario (FSRA) is an independent regulatory agency designed to improve consumer and pension plan beneficiary protections in Ontario. FSRA is responsible for monitoring compliance with and enforcing the Insurance Act and its regulations.

Province adds more than 2,000 acute care and critical care beds and enacts pandemic staffing plans

April 16, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Acting on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health and other health care professionals, the Ontario government has significantly expanded hospital capacity in preparation for any COVID-19 outbreak scenario. The province has added 1,035 acute care beds and 1,492 critical care beds and taken steps to ensure hospitals have the staff available to care for a sudden surge in patients.
""Thanks to the hard work and relentless preparation of our hospital staff to build capacity in our hospitals, we are in a position to better allocate resources to sectors that are in critical need and respond to any potential surge in cases,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""When you combine these life-saving beds with the very best care delivered by our highly skilled hospital staff, our patients will definitely have a fighting chance against this deadly virus."" Hospitals across the province have taken steps to make more beds available for COVID-19 patients in every region of the province. As a result, Ontario has a total of 20,354 acute care beds with a potential for an additional 4,205 more acute care beds by April 30, 2020. Of Ontario's 3,504 critical care beds, 2,811 are now equipped with ventilators, up from 1,319 when the outbreak first started. ""As we've said from the outset of the COVID-19 outbreak, Ontario will be prepared to respond to any outbreak scenario, including having plans in place for the worst-case scenario,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Heath. ""Thanks to the innovative work by our health care leaders, we have been able to significantly expand acute and critical care capacity in Ontario's hospitals. While these are positive steps forward, it remains as important as ever that everyone continues to help stop the spread by staying home unless you are an essential service worker."" This bed capacity expansion has been organized in coordination with pandemic staffing plans to ensure each hospital has the physicians and staff needed, including in case of a major surge of cases. Measures include: Redeploying surgical nursing staff who can now work with medicine units;Sharing highly trained emergency department and intensive care unit nursing staffs across units;Sharing physician resources across hospitals in a given region;Recruiting family doctors to complete shifts within the hospital; andRecruiting retirees, including nursing and support services.The province continues to focus on what resources will be needed to further enhance capacity quickly, if the need arises. Hospitals have identified additional opportunities to add new beds, including through the use of field hospitals, conference centres, school locations and more. Sites are ready to open based on the needs of the community.

Quick Facts

Ontario’s hospitals activated their pandemic plans to guide their decisions on how they created the enhanced capacity, including postponing some elective surgeries and reorganizing the discharging of alternate level of care patient to appropriate locations.

Several other measures, including the launch of Ontario’s online self-assessment tool, opening assessment centres, increasing Telehealth capacity and the ability to consult with emergency department doctors virtually have also helped to reduce emergency room visits and hospital admissions.
As of April 13, 2020, the average hospital occupancy rate was 69.1%% (64.1% for acute care only), a significant decrease from 96.2% (97.3% for acute beds) before COVID-19 measures. There are over 7,300 acute care beds unoccupied and over 2,000 critical care beds currently available across Ontario.
Ontario recently placed an order with O-Two Medical Technologies to produce 10,000 ventilator units, along with the support of Ontario's world-class manufacturing sector.

The COVID-19 Action Plan: Long-Term Care Homes was announced today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""We will do everything we can to protect our seniors and most vulnerable citizens because we all know they are most at risk during this pandemic,"" said Premier Ford. ""Our three-point action plan builds on the measures we have already taken to fortify that iron ring of protection we have placed around our long-term care residents and those who care for them.""  The COVID-19 Action Plan: Long-Term Care Homes adds critical new measures to prevent further outbreaks and deaths from COVID-19 in long-term care homes, including:    Aggressive Testing, Screening, and Surveillance: enhancing testing for symptomatic residents and staff and those who have been in contact with persons confirmed to have COVID-19; expanding screening to include more asymptomatic contacts of confirmed cases; and leveraging surveillance tools to enable care providers to move proactively against the disease.Managing Outbreaks and Spread of the Disease: supporting long-term care homes with public health and infection control expertise to contain and prevent outbreaks; providing additional training and support for current staff working in outbreak conditions.Growing our Heroic Long-Term Care Workforce: redeploying staff from hospitals and home and community care to support the long-term care home workforce and respond to outbreaks, alongside intensive on-going recruitment initiatives.Additional measures under development will help to ensure preparedness and respond to the situation as it evolves, including improving isolation capacity at long-term care homes. Within less than 48 hours, the government will immediately act to deliver: enhanced testing and surveillance for symptomatic residents and staff and those in contact with persons confirmed to have COVID-19;testing of asymptomatic residents and staff in select homes across the province to better understand how COVID-19 is spreading;risk and capacity assessments for all homes;working with Ontario Health, the Ontario Hospital Association, and public health units to assemble infection control and preventions teams and additional supports;enhanced guidance on personal protective equipment and continued priority distribution to homes;enhanced training and education to support staff working in outbreak situations; andredeploying hospital and home care resources into homes.""We must continue to act to stop the spread of this virus in our long-term care homes,"" said Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""Nothing is more important than protecting the health and well-being of our loved ones in long-term care, or the front-line heroes who care for them."" ""This new action plan significantly enhances existing efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19 and protect our most vulnerable, including long-term care home residents and the staff who care for them,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""Having significantly expanded the scope and scale of testing and made considerable progress in securing personal protective equipment, Ontario has never been better positioned to deliver on our commitment to support long-term care homes in our shared battle against this virus."" The government has also issued an emergency order directing long-term care employers to ensure their employees, including registered nurses, registered practical nurses, personal support workers, kitchen and cleaning staff only work in one long-term care home. This means that employees cannot work in multiple locations such as a retirement home or other health care setting. As a result of this order, long-term care workers who must temporarily give up a job in another care setting are protected from losing their job as they are entitled to an unpaid leave of absence. To help long-term care workers make up these lost wages, the government encourages long-term care employers to offer full-time hours to their part-time employees during the COVID-19 outbreak. To help employers cover this expense, the government is taking action to ensure long-term care homes have the flexibility and funds to rapidly hire nurses and other front-line staff they need, when they need them. These emergency funds are available to help long-term care homes cover the incremental costs of increasing hours for part-time staff to help those staff limit their work locations. All long-term care staff continue to be subject to rigorous screening procedures and must follow personal protective equipment guidelines, including wearing surgical masks, gowns, gloves and eye protection while in homes.

Quick Facts

The COVID-19 Action Plan: Long-Term Care Homes will continue to evolve in response to COVID-19. The government is actively seeking and acting on proposals to fight this virus through the Ontario Together portal. 
The temporary emergency order will come into effect on April 22, 2020 in order to give long-term care homes enough time to be compliant with the order. It builds on previous emergency orders issued March 24 and March 28, 2020.
An investment of $243 million in COVID-19 emergency funding is available to homes to cover the costs associated with securing the staffing, supplies, and capacity they need at this unprecedented time.
To help understaffed long-term care homes find qualified staff, the government launched an online tool to help match skilled front-line workers with employers: the Health Workforce Matching Portal.

Ontario Extends Declaration of Emergency to Continue the Fight Against COVID-19
Sustained Measures Necessary to Stop the Spread and Protect Public Health

April 14, 2020  3:30 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO ― On the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health and with the approval of the Ontario legislature, the Ontario government is extending the Declaration of Emergency under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act for a further 28 days. This will allow the government to continue to use every tool at its disposal to protect the health and safety of the people of Ontario during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Passed during a special sitting of the Ontario legislature and with the full cooperation of all parties, the Declaration of Emergency has been extended until May 12. The extension of the provincial declaration of emergency allows Ontario to continue to enforce current emergency orders, such as the closure of all non-essential workplaces, outdoor amenities such as parks and recreational areas, public places and bars and restaurants, as well as restrictions on social gatherings of more than five people, and prohibitions against price-gouging. A full list of emergency orders can be found on the e-Laws website under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act. ""During these unprecedented times, we cannot let our guard down. The actions being taken by everyone to stay home and practice physical distancing are making a difference, but we are not out of the woods yet,"" said Premier Ford. ""With the support of every Ontario MPP, we continue to take any and all actions necessary to support our frontline health care workers and respond rapidly and decisively to slow the spread of this deadly virus."" The legislature also passed the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Support and Protection Act to amend the Education Act, Planning Act, Development Charges Act, Police Services Act and the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities Act. This new legislation demonstrates that the government is actively listening to the concerns of education and municipal stakeholders during this COVID-19 emergency. ""This legislation is about protecting the health and economic interests of Ontarians,"" said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education. ""We will do whatever it takes to get through this challenge ― most especially for the next generation ― so that students continue learning and graduating."" The amendments to the Education Act will allow school boards to continue charging fees on new construction in order to retain a vital source of revenue for new school projects. The bill also includes an amendment to provide a fair and consistent provincewide approach to addressing school suspensions and expulsions as part of the government's commitment to the safety of students and staff upon the reopening of schools. The changes to the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities Act will temporarily suspend student loan payments for OSAP borrowers and initiate a six-month interest-free moratorium on OSAP loans. ""We are taking action to ease the financial burden for students and current borrowers during the COVID-19 outbreak,"" said Ross Romano, Minister of Colleges and Universities. ""By temporarily suspending loan repayments and interest accrual, our government is providing immediate support for OSAP borrowers during these challenging times.""   The government is making it possible to suspend certain municipal planning decision timelines during the state of emergency, and change the Development Charges Act to ensure municipalities can continue to count on a vital source of revenue that helps pay for local growth-related infrastructure, such as roads, water and sewers as well as fire and police services. The amendments to the Police Services Act also allow the Solicitor General to give municipalities an extension beyond January 1, 2021 to prepare and adopt a community safety and well-being plan. ""Nothing is more important than protecting the health and well-being of all individuals and families,"" said Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. ""We have listened to our municipal partners and made these changes to help them better manage staff time and resources so they can focus on the COVID-19 outbreak."" ""In these unprecedented times, our government is doing everything in its power to support our municipal, policing and community partners,"" said Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General. ""While Community Safety and Well-Being Plans are an important tool for municipalities to keep our communities safe, we need them to focus on allocating resources where they are needed most right now, and that is to stop the spread of COVID-19.""

Ontario Secures Critical Medical Equipment and Supplies
Same-Day Deliveries Made to Protect Patients and Frontline Workers from COVID-19

April 13, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government continues to ensure that patients, frontline health care workers and first responders have the critical equipment and supplies they need to protect themselves during the COVID-19 outbreak. Over the last five days, more than 13 million surgical and procedural masks, 200,000 N95 respirator masks, and 38 ventilators have been delivered to Ontario's pandemic stockpile warehouses.  
""The global competition to secure critical personal protective equipment and medical supplies is fierce, yet our team of procurement specialists continues to locate the masks, gloves and ventilators we need to keep our frontline workers and patients safe,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""I also want to take this opportunity to thank Premier Jason Kenney and the people of Alberta for making a generous donation of critical medical supplies and equipment in the fight against COVID-19. By standing united in adversity, Team Canada will stop this virus in its tracks."" Ontario is providing same-day deliveries to hospitals, long-term care and retirement homes, and other facilities to support essential workers in all settings and ensuring supplies and equipment are expedited to those most in need. This includes shipments this past weekend of 6.5 million surgical and procedural masks to over 650 providers across the province to protect our frontline workers, patients and residents. ""I am pleased to report that we continue making significant progress in securing the necessary personal protective equipment needed to effectively respond to COVID-19,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""Nothing is more important than protecting the health and safety of patients and the workers caring for them, as well as our first responders. We will continue working around the clock to add to the provincial stockpile to ensure that we are equipped to support those fighting this outbreak on the frontlines."" Ontario has been procuring vital supplies and personal protective equipment through its traditional suppliers and donations, as well as working in collaboration with the federal government, other provinces, and Ontario's manufacturers. On Saturday, Alberta committed to send Ontario 250,000 N95 masks, 2.5 million surgical masks, 15 million surgical gloves, 87,000 safety goggles, and 50 ventilators.  While Ontario is making progress in procuring critical supplies and equipment, the global supply chain remains constrained. Conservation of supplies and equipment, particularly personal protective equipment is of utmost importance. The government is working to ensure those in priority areas and in urgent need are receiving the supplies they need.

Quick Facts

Ontario obtains its own supplies and receives others procured centrally by the federal government. 
As of April 13, through the Ontario Together web portal, the province has received over 14,500 submissions from businesses and private citizens, offering to provide or donate various supplies and equipment, such as masks, face shields, testing equipment, ventilators, hand sanitizer, gowns and coveralls. More than 9,000 emergency supply submissions have generated nearly $90 million in purchases of critical equipment and supplies. 
Ontario has launched a new $50 million Ontario Together Fund to help businesses provide innovative solutions or retool their operations to manufacture essential medical supplies and equipment, including gowns, coveralls, masks, face shields, testing equipment and ventilators
Ontario is making it easier for businesses to work with government by developing a smarter procurement system that will save taxpayer money, drive office efficiencies and help small- and medium-sized businesses tap into new opportunities in government procurement.

Province Developing New Health Data Platform to Help Defeat COVID-19
New platform will allow researchers to better detect, plan and respond to the outbreak

April 12, 2020  4:02 P.M.

Ministry of Health


TORONTO —The Ontario government is taking steps to better detect, plan and respond to the COVID-19 outbreak. In consultation with the Ontario Privacy Commissioner, the province is developing a new health data platform called the Pandemic Threat Response (PANTHR). This new platform will hold secure health data that will allow researchers to better support health system planning and responsiveness, including the immediate need to analyze the current COVID-19 outbreak.
""Better access to integrated data will improve modelling and research to determine how COVID-19 is evolving, ensuring frontline staff are as prepared as possible in these unprecedented times,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""While access to data is important, we are taking all measures to ensure patient privacy is always respected and Ontarians are aware of how anonymized information may be shared."" Ontario will appoint a PANTHR special advisor and form a roundtable to provide recommendations about the data and policies to support and help overcome barriers while developing this platform. The information gathered in the secure platform will help break down long-standing barriers and allow researchers to help with: Increasing detection of COVID-19;Discovering risk factors for vulnerable populations;Predicting when and where outbreaks may happen;Evaluating how preventative and treatment measures are working; andIdentifying where to allocate equipment and other resources. ""Integrating data from across the province will allow us to effectively leverage tools, like artificial intelligence, to better understand this virus, how it spreads and the most effective means of combatting it,"" said Peter Bethlenfalvy, President of the Treasury Board. ""These key insights will mean our world-class health system partners have secure access to better and more consistent population data, improving decision-making in health care and aiding our efforts to beat COVID-19. The health and safety of Ontarians remains our singular focus - this is another measure that will allow us to continue to deliver on that commitment.""  When launched, PANTHR will provide access to de-identified, integrated data on publicly funded administrative health services records, including: Physician claims submitted to the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP);Medical drug claims submitted to the Ontario Drug Benefit Program;Discharge summaries of hospital stays and emergency department visits; andClaims for home care and long-term care. PANTHR will also contain clinical data from special registry collections, such as the Critical Care Information System (CCIS), which reports on critical care capacity in the province, and clinical data extracted from public health, hospital, laboratory and diagnostic imaging information systems. Other supporting data may also be added based on needs of researchers in achieving COVID-19 objectives.

Today, Premier Doug Ford issued the following statement to mark Easter Sunday:
""Today, people across Ontario will celebrate the joyous occasion of Easter. For Christians, Easter Sunday is the holiest day in the Christian calendar and marks the triumphant resurrection of Jesus Christ. For others, the Easter long weekend is a time to celebrate the arrival of spring, spend quality time with family, and exchange gifts such as chocolates and sweets with loved ones. This year, Easter celebrations will be different due to the pandemic. All but essential workers will need to stay home and practise physical distancing in order to help keep everyone safe and healthy. However, we can still enjoy a meal with those in our household and connect with loved ones by phone, email or videochat. Please think of our seniors and those facing hard times, and consider reaching out or dropping off necessities for them. For the kids worried about whether the Easter Bunny will come this year, don't worry. Earlier this week, I declared the Easter Bunny's delivery of chocolates and candy an essential service. The Easter Bunny will still be hopping about, while following the rules of physical distancing and avoiding public areas to keep us all protected and ensuring everyone can enjoy this special time. From my family to yours, I want to wish everyone a safe and healthy holiday at home. Happy Easter!""

Ontario Takes Further Action to Stop the Spread of COVID-19 
Province Extends Emergency Orders until April 23

April 11, 2020  8:00 A.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — To help stop the spread of COVID-19 and protect the health and safety of people across the province, the Ontario government has extended all emergency orders that have been put in place to-date under s.7.0.2 (4) of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act until April 23, 2020, including the closure of outdoor amenities in parks and recreational areas, non-essential workplaces, public places and bars and restaurants, along with restrictions on social gatherings and the prohibition of price gouging.
In addition, new measures have been introduced to address surge capacity in retirement homes, restrict recreational camping on Crown land, and allow the repurposing of existing buildings and temporary structures. All of these actions are based on the advice of Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health.

With the proper precautions and additional measures we're taking today, I am confident we will get through this together and stronger."" Ontario introduced the following new steps to help stop the spread of COVID-19. The government is: Making it easier to repurpose existing buildings and put up temporary structures, like tents, so communities can meet their local needs quickly. This will reduce pressure on health care facilities, where needed, and help shelters provide more space for sleeping to maintain the physical distancing requirements to reduce the spread of the virus.Temporarily enabling hospitals to increase their capacity by using the beds and services of retirement homes without certain labour relations implications during the declared provincial emergency.Prohibiting recreational camping on Crown land as of April 9, 2020. Under the emergency order, no individual can camp on Crown land, including the placement of tents or other camping structures, while the order is in effect. The government will continue to monitor the situation and re-evaluate if further actions are required.Supporting construction workers and businesses with emergency action to help improve cash flow in the construction industry during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Ontario Protects Parents during COVID-19
Province Prevents Operators from Charging Fees while Child Cares are Closed

April 10, 2020  2:30 P.M.

Ministry of Education


TORONTO — During the COVID-19 outbreak, the Ontario government is temporarily preventing child care centres from collecting payments from parents, while also ensuring that their child care spaces are protected. Child care centres, with the exception of those accommodating health care and other frontline workers, were ordered closed to help prevent the spread of the virus and keep the children and child care staff safe.  
An emergency order has been issued, and immediately prevents any child care operator from charging parent fees where care is not being provided. The order also means that parents cannot lose their child care space because they are not paying fees during this period. This will help provide much needed relief for parents during the outbreak. ""COVID-19 has imposed significant financial pressure on working parents,"" said Stephen Lecce, Education Minister. ""We need to support our parents who may be facing reduced income or layoffs during the COVID-19 outbreak."" The child care sector, like many others, is facing significant financial pressures. Child care providers can seek supports for businesses and individuals under the federal government's Economic Response Plan. ""We are defending the interests of consumers and protecting parents' hard-earned money by ordering child care centres to stop charging fees for services not rendered,"" said Minister Lecce. ""From protecting health and safety, to jobs and incomes, we will do whatever it takes to get our province and our incredibly resilient people through this.""  The Ontario government will continue to work with the child care sector and federal, municipal and First Nations partners on a plan to ensure the sustainability of the sector during the outbreak.

Quick Facts

Child care centres have been ordered to close through a provincial Emergency Order. 
Some child care centres that are providing child care for health care and other frontline workers, and home-based child care providers (licensed and unlicensed), are permitted to continue to operate
Over 1 million applications have been received through Ontario’s Support for Families. The simple online application gives parents a one-time payment of $200 for each child aged 0 to 12, or $250 for children 21 years old or younger with special needs.
