SAULT STE. MARIE - The Ontario government is investing $50,000 in the Lake Superior Watershed Conservancy's Canoes for Conservation project to help promote ecotourism and create several seasonal jobs. Funding through the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation (NOHFC) will be used to develop guided tours in a 14-person, 11-metre canoe, connecting visitors to cultural and historical sites along the banks of the St. Marys River in Sault Ste. Marie.
""Sault Ste. Marie's downtown core and many of the city's tourist attractions are situated along the St. Marys River,"" said Ross Romano, MPP for Sault Ste. Marie. ""In addition to boosting tourism development along this historic waterway, the Lake Superior Watershed Conservancy's Canoes for Conservation project will also promote environmental stewardship of Lake Superior and create greater opportunities for cross-cultural learning with Indigenous people."" The Lake Superior Watershed Conservancy is a land trust organization that works to sustain a healthy Lake Superior watershed for future generations. It is the lead stewardship organization of the Lake Superior Water Trail and works closely with educational institutions to advance environmental stewardship. ""NOHFC funding assists local enterprises like the Lake Superior Watershed Conservancy, ensuring our northern communities can grow and thrive,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines. ""As the province reopens and the economy recovers, our government is proud to support tourism and attractions across the north."" The NOHFC promotes economic development across Northern Ontario by providing financial assistance to projects - big and small, rural and urban - that stimulate growth, job creation and develop a skilled workforce. Since June 2018, the NOHFC has invested more than $193 million in 1,386 projects in Northern Ontario, leveraging more than $748 million in investment and creating or retaining 3,912 jobs. The Ontario government is getting more people back to work and more recreational activities open by moving forward with a regional approach to Stage 3 of reopening the province.

Ontario Extends Emergency Orders 
Extensions Protect Health and Safety as Economy Gradually Reopens

July 16, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government, in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health, has extended most emergency orders currently in force under s.7.0.2 (4) of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act (EMCPA) until July 29, 2020. Keeping the emergency orders in place provides the government with the necessary flexibility to ensure the protection of vulnerable populations, such as seniors, while continuing to implement its Framework for Reopening the Province with many regions entering Stage 3 on Friday.
""Although the trends in public health indicators continue to improve, we must remain on our guard and only relax emergency orders if and when safe to do so,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""By following our gradual plan to reopen the province, we are seeing people get back to work and resume many activities safely. We do not want to undo the tremendous progress we have made together, so I urge everyone to stay the course and follow public health advice."" On July 7, 2020, the Government of Ontario introduced the Reopening Ontario (A Flexible Response to COVID-19) Act, 2020 that would, if passed, ensure important measures remain in place to address the threat of COVID-19 once the provincial Declaration of Emergency has ended. The extension of these emergency orders under the EMCPA would allow orders that remain essential to be continued under the proposed legislation, if passed. The government continues to review emergency orders currently in place to determine when and if they can be safely eased or lifted. The following orders under s.7.0.2 (4) of the EMCPA are extended until July 29, 2020:  Work Redeployment for Certain Health Service  Providers Drinking Water Systems and Sewage Works  Electronic Service Work Deployment Measures in Long-Term Care  Homes Electricity Price for RPP Consumers Rules for Areas in Stage 1 Traffic Management Streamlining Requirements for Long-Term Care  Homes Prohibition on Certain Persons Charging  Unconscionable Prices for Sales of Necessary Goods Enforcement of Orders Work Deployment Measures for Boards of  Health Work Deployment Measures in Retirement  Homes Service Agencies Providing Services and  Supports to Adults with Developmental Disabilities and Service Providers Providing Intervenor Services  Pickup and Delivery of Cannabis Signatures in Wills and Powers of Attorney  Use of Force and Firearms in Policing  Services Agreements Between Health Service Providers  and Retirement Homes Temporary Health or Residential Facilities  Work Deployment Measures for Service Agencies  Providing Violence Against Women Residential Services and Crisis Line Services Limiting Work to a Single Long-Term Care  Home Work Deployment Measures for District Social  Services Administration Boards Deployment of Employees of Service Provider  Organizations Work Deployment Measures for  Municipalities Limiting Work to a Single Retirement Home  Work Deployment Measures for Mental Health and  Addictions Agencies Congregate Care Settings Access to Personal Health Information by Means  of the Electronic Health Record Certain Persons Enabled to Issue Medical  Certificates of Death Hospital Credentialing Processes Education Sector Management of Long-Term Care Homes in  Outbreak Management of Retirement Homes in Outbreak  Special Rules Re: Temporary Pandemic Pay  Rules for Areas in Stage 2 Patios "

Ontario Takes Steps to Strengthen Consumer Protection 
New Act will promote confidence for those purchasing a home and other products

July 15, 2020  3:00 P.M.

Ministry of Government and Consumer Services


TORONTO — Earlier this week, the Ontario legislature approved Bill 159, the Rebuilding Consumer Confidence Act. Once in force, it will promote higher quality new home construction and reduce defects and warranty claims, while better protecting consumers from bad actors in the marketplace.
The Act will overhaul Tarion Warranty Corporation and the way it protects new-home buyers with better warranties and more protections than they have had in the past. The Act will include an improved dispute resolution process and help Tarion better protect consumers by helping them get more useful information about home builders and their histories. ""When you get the keys to your new home, you should feel confident that it has been built safely and properly, and that any defects will be taken care of in a timely manner,"" said Lisa Thompson, Minister of Government and Consumer Services. ""That is why we are rebuilding the Ontario new home warranty and protection program from the ground up, focusing on consumer protections, transparency, access to information, and governance."" Bill 159 also includes improvements to administrative authorities, independent organizations like the Real Estate Council of Ontario and the Technical Standards and Safety Authority, that help protect consumers. The Act includes new powers for the government that will ensure administrative authorities can continue acting in the public interest during emergencies. In addition, Bill 159 will allow for financial penalties under the Consumer Protection Act (CPA). The people of Ontario count on the CPA everyday in a wide range of situations, including contract cancelations, door-to-door sales and the value of their reward points.  The Act will also ensure that prices of tickets for Ontario events are listed and charged in Canadian currency. ""The passage of this bill marks our government's continued commitment to strengthening consumer protection,"" said Minister Thompson. ""We will continue to work with Tarion Warranty Corporation to better respond to the needs of consumers in Ontario and establish a new builder regulator. We will continue to consult with stakeholders to develop regulations that are necessary and needed for the future.""

Quick Facts

Tarion Warranty Corporation administers the Ontario New Home Warranties Plan Act which deals with new home warranties, protections, and new home builder and vendor regulation.
The Auditor General released a Special Audit of Tarion Warranty Corporation in October 2019, that included recommendations to strengthen how Tarion is run. 
The government also improved consumer protection for homebuyers in Bill 145, the Trust in Real Estate Service Act, to modernize the rules for real estate brokerages, brokers and salespersons. It was approved by the legislature in February.

Changes Proposed to Keep Fatal Wildlife Disease Out of Ontario 

July 15, 2020  2:00 P.M.

Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry


The Ontario government is seeking public input on a proposal to increase protections for the province's wildlife populations from Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD).
CWD is a progressive, fatal disease that affects members of the cervid family - deer, elk, moose and caribou. While it has not been detected in Ontario, it is important for hunters, wildlife management and the general public to remain vigilant. CWD was discovered in 2018 on a deer farm in Quebec, close to the Ontario border. It has also been found in all five U.S. states bordering Ontario. ""We're committed to doing everything we can to keep Chronic Wasting Disease out of Ontario and preserve Ontario's deer, elk and moose populations for generations to come,"" said John Yakabuski, Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry. ""I would like to hear from members of the public on our proposed measures to ensure they will work effectively in every part of the province."" The government is proposing amendments to regulations under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act that would:  Prohibit people from importing into Ontario live, captive cervids from outside of the province, with some exceptions. Prohibit people from moving live cervids from one part of Ontario to another, with some exceptions. Expand the existing prohibition on the use or possession of lures, scents and attractants made from cervid parts to include any purpose beyond hunting. Expand the existing prohibition on import of high-risk parts of cervids hunted in other jurisdictions.  In December 2019, Ontario announced a CWD Prevention and Response Plan that will ensure the province has the right approaches in place to minimize the risk of the disease entering or spreading within the province. The new proposed measures are the next step to protect Ontario's wildlife and support sustainable hunting, which creates jobs and makes an important economic contribution to our province. The proposed changes are now available on the Environmental Registry of Ontario for public feedback until August 31, 2020. 

Quick Facts

The province conducts an annual CWD surveillance program, which would help detect the disease and minimize the risk of it entering the province.
Since 2002, the government has tested more than 13,000 wild deer and elk for CWD; all test results have been negative. 
Deer hunters spend more than $275 million annually in Ontario, which helps support jobs in many rural and northern communities.

Ontario Accelerating the Development of Long-Term Care Homes
New Approach Will Lead to More Modern and Upgraded Facilities with Air Conditioning

July 15, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government announced a redesigned funding model that will lead to the building of additional, modern long-term care homes providing seniors with the quality care they deserve. This new approach will help break down historic barriers and accelerate the construction of urgently needed long-term care projects, and new and redeveloped beds. Over the next five years, the government is investing $1.75 billion in long-term care homes. It is also updating design standards to include air conditioning for any new and renovated homes, beginning immediately.
Details were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""After inheriting 15 years of underinvestment in long-term care and a massive waitlist of seniors, our government is putting forward bold new solutions to turbo charge the development of long-term care beds across the province and ensure our most vulnerable citizens can live in modern surroundings,"" said Premier Ford. ""That's why our new funding model will not only encourage new beds to be built faster, but also upgrade existing older homes to meet high quality design standards, with features like air conditioning and private or semi-private rooms. Our seniors deserve nothing less."" The new funding model will help speed up construction by: Creating four new regional categories based on geographic location, each with a targeted home size: large urban, urban, mid-size, and rural. An increase to the province's construction funding subsidy (CFS) will be tailored to each of these four categories, enabling the government to address the barriers and needs of different communities;Providing development grants, between 10 per cent and 17 per cent depending on regional category, to cover upfront costs like development charges, land and other construction expenses;Helping small operators in rural communities navigate the high cost of development, while ensuring larger urban centres can secure the loans and real estate they need; andIncreasing funding to incentivize the construction of basic accommodation and continuing top-ups for small and medium sized homes.By taking these steps the government is making it more attractive for operators to build long-term care homes and bring aging homes with 3-4-person ward rooms up to modern design standards. Currently, more than 38,000 people are on the waitlist to access a long-term care space, and new long-term care home construction has not kept pace. The previous ""one-size-fits-all"" funding model has not spurred development nor accounted for how regional differences impact land, construction and other development costs. Working with the long-term care sector, the government will dedicate funding to ensure long-term care homes in need have working air conditioning ― a measure that should have been put in place many years ago. With thousands of new and redeveloped beds on the way, the government is also going to be changing long-term care regulations and design standards to ensure that all new long-term care builds and redevelopments are mandated to have air conditioning. ""This newly designed model is a signature element of our government's plan to address capacity in long-term care,"" said Minister Fullerton. ""This bold new plan will allow us to modernize a system that had been neglected for years, reduce the waiting list and ensure seniors live in a setting that is modern, clean and comfortable. In addition, this new investment will create jobs and contribute to our economic recovery.""

Quick Facts

Between 2011 and 2018, there were 611 long-term care beds built across the province ― less than one bed per home.

Ontario is now investing $1.75 billion to create more urgently needed long-term care beds and redevelop older beds to modern standards.
Long-term care projects dating back to 2018 will be eligible for the new funding model.
The modernized funding model will address concerns about the structure and sufficiency of funding raised during formal stakeholder consultations held in January 2020. 
The CFS is a per bed per day (per diem) funding amount provided to eligible long-term care homes once they complete a long-term care infrastructure project.
Nearly 78,000 Ontario residents currently live in 626 long-term care homes across the province.

TIMMINS —The health and well-being of Canadians are the top priorities of the governments of Canada and Ontario. But the COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than Canadians' personal health. It is having a profound effect on the economy.
That is why governments have been taking decisive action to support families, businesses and communities, and continue to look ahead to see what more can be done. Strategic investments in modern public transit infrastructure support a healthy environment and play a key role in ensuring Ontarians can get to work and essential services on time, then safely back home at the end of the day. Today, Terry Sheehan, Member of Parliament for Sault Ste. Marie, on behalf of the Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities; the Honourable Dave Smith, Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines and Indigenous Affairs and Member of Provincial Parliament for Peterborough-Kawartha on behalf of the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure; and his Worship George Pirie, Mayor of Timmins, announced funding for three public transit projects in Timmins. The purchase of a new conventional bus and the replacement of standard buses with two paratransit vehicles will improve the transit system's accessibility, upgrade the system's capacity, and enhance the overall quality for public transit riders. In addition, renovations to Timmins' terminal transit station will modernize the facility and will include fully accessible washrooms. These upgrades will ensure a reliable, barrier-free space for all public transit users. By upgrading and expanding public transit systems in the city and connecting residents to the essential services they require, residents can get around their communities safely while also protecting the environment. The Government of Canada is investing over $960,000 in these projects through the Public Transit Infrastructure Stream (PTIS) of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Ontario is providing more than $806,000 to the projects, while the municipality is contributing more than $645,000.

Investments will strengthen local economy and create jobs as province reopens

July 15, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines


BURK'S FALLS - The Ontario government is investing more than $1.4 million through the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation (NOHFC) in three companies in the Almaguin Highlands Region, helping create fifteen new jobs.
""As the province reopens and the economy recovers, companies in the north need our support,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines. ""NOHFC funding assists local businesses and creates good jobs, making sure our northern communities can grow and thrive."" Norm Miller, MPP for Parry Sound-Muskoka, announced the NOHFC funding for three local companies:  Lofthouse Manufacturing in Burk's Falls is receiving $1 million to increase productivity on the company's valve assembly line by expanding its facility and purchasing new equipment. The project will create eight full-time jobs. In addition, Lofthouse Manufacturing is also receiving $20,800 to accommodate a junior draftsperson intern position. Fleetmetrica Inc. in Emsdale is receiving $200,000 to develop a version of its proprietary fleet management software app that can be licensed to other companies. The monitoring app helps supervisors and drivers ensure vehicles are being safely operated. The project will create four full-time jobs. Jonathan Miller & Sons Farms in Burk's Falls is receiving $200,000 to establish a cattle farm that raises grass-fed, stress-free cows and calves. The farm will also sell hay and firewood. The project will create one full-time job and one seasonal job.  ""These investments are helping drive economic growth, innovation and job creation right here in the Almaguin Highlands Region,"" said Norm Miller, MPP for Parry Sound-Muskoka. ""Now more than ever, our government is committed to building strong, vibrant communities across Northern Ontario and creating real opportunities for the people who live here."" The NOHFC promotes economic development across Northern Ontario by providing financial assistance to projects - big and small, rural and urban - that stimulate growth, job creation and develop a skilled workforce. Since June 2018, the NOHFC has invested more than $193 million in 1,386 projects in Northern Ontario, leveraging more than $748 million in investment and creating or retaining 3,912 jobs.

MARKSTAY-WARREN —The governments of Canada and Ontario recognize the different ways that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted smaller and rural communities across the province. Both governments are making strategic investments in infrastructure to meet the specific needs of rural and northern Ontario municipalities and help them strengthen their local economies.
Today, Marc G. Serré, Member of Parliament for Nickel Belt, on behalf of the Honourable Maryam Monsef, Canada's Minister of Women and Gender Equality and Rural Economic Development; and the Honourable John Yakabuski, Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry, and Member of Provincial Parliament for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, on behalf of the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure, announced funding for eight road and bridge projects in Northern Ontario. They were joined by his Worship, Stephen Salonin, Mayor of the Municipality of Markstay-Warren. These projects will improve various streets, roads, and a bridge. In Markstay-Warren, $4.4 million in federal and provincial funding is being invested in resurfacing, improvements to shoulders and drainage, and the replacement of driveway culverts for approximately 5.5 kilometers of streets. The project will improve road safety and reliability.  In Wasauksing First Nation - Parry Island, the reconstruction of about 16 kilometres of Wawbawzee Road will improve access to the First Nation territory for residents, visitors and emergency vehicles, year-round. In addition, the reconstruction of the Krugerdorf Bridge will replace the current 3-span, 60 metre bridge with a shorter span, improving drainage and the roadway. The new bridge will be safer and more reliable for residents of the Township of Chamberlain. The Government of Canada is investing over $16.7 million in these projects through the Rural and Northern Communities Infrastructure Stream of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Ontario is contributing more than $8.3 million for these important infrastructure projects in these communities, while municipalities are contributing over $2.7 million towards the projects and the Wasauksing First Nation is contributing $330,215 towards its project. The governments of Canada and Ontario are working in collaboration with their partners to support jobs, improve communities and build confidence as we safely and sustainably restore economic growth. 

Quick Facts

 Province Supports Development of Made-in-Ontario N95 Respirators
Building Homegrown Manufacturing Capacity Vital in Fight against COVID-19

July 14, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


CAMBRIDGE ― The Ontario government is providing Cambridge-based Eclipse Innovations Inc. with $1,408,475 from the Ontario Together Fund to scale up its operations to manufacture made-in-Ontario N95 masks. These masks are an essential piece of personal protective equipment (PPE) used to protect workers in healthcare and industrial settings. This investment is part of the government's plan to increase the capacity of Ontario-made PPE, while supporting local businesses during the safe and gradual reopening of the province.
The announcement was made today at the company's facility by Premier Doug Ford and Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""As part of our government's made-in-Ontario plan for renewal, growth, and recovery, we are actively working with local companies to manufacture the critical PPE we need to protect our frontline workers today and well into the future,"" said Premier Ford. ""We have the most talented and innovative people anywhere to make the highest quality products in the world. Ontario is the manufacturing powerhouse of Canada and we encourage everyone to buy local to help our businesses and factories get back on their feet."" Today also marked the beginning of the Premier's tour to acknowledge and thank strong local businesses and exceptional individuals across the province who have stepped up to help out during the outbreak of COVID-19. Over the coming months, Premier Ford will visit a number of communities to recognize those who have gone above and beyond, hear ideas from the people on how the government can help them succeed in the new environment, and support made-in-Ontario products as a key part of the province's path to recovery. ""As our government continues to move forward with the gradual and safe reopening of our economy, we have been working closely with our business community to mobilize Ontario's manufacturing and innovation might,"" said Minister Fedeli. ""Businesses like Eclipse Innovations have stepped up with solutions to help at a critical time. Together with our entrepreneurs and innovators, we will ensure Ontario has the factories, plants, and assembly lines to respond to any future crisis, should the need ever arise."" With Ontario's support, Eclipse Innovations will create the capacity to manufacture made-in-Ontario N95 respirators, enabling it to bring a qualified, domestically produced N95 respirator to market. N95 respirators filter 95 per cent of airborne particles, making it highly effective in protecting the wearer from airborne pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria that could damage the respiratory tract. By adding this new capacity, Eclipse Innovations will be able to make one million N95 respirators per week, which will help serve domestic market demand to ensure a safe reopening of the economy and combat COVID-19 safely and effectively. Eclipse Innovations Inc. is a Cambridge-based company established in April 2020 as an affiliate of Eclipse Automation Inc., a leading manufacturer of custom automated equipment for the life sciences, energy, transportation, consumer, industrial and electronics industries. Eclipse Automation has 450 Ontario-based employees and this project will include the creation of 17 new permanent full-time jobs at its affiliate company, Eclipse Innovations. ""Eclipse is a company that does not stand still, especially at a critical time like now. We are nimble and ready to take action, and that's exactly what we did when we established Eclipse Innovations,"" said Steve Mai, CEO of Eclipse Innovations Inc. ""We are pleased to work with the Ontario government to begin manufacturing respirators as soon as possible. By working in partnership, we can rapidly create automation systems to support the design, assemble these important medical supplies and pave the way for a domestically produced N95 respirator."" When the outbreak of COVID-19 hit, Eclipse quickly pivoted its business and collaborated with global players IREMA and Harmontronics to create a solution to design, produce and distribute N95 respirators for the domestic market. This investment will also allow Eclipse to develop a range of different mask sizes and styles, such as horizontal and vertical fold, providing multiple options for an optimal fit. This is important because, for a N95 respirator to work effectively, it must properly fit the face of the wearer. Eclipse also has a partnership with Conestoga College for the development of a N95 predictive fit testing software using facial scanning technology.

Quick Facts

The government launched the $50 million Ontario Together Fund to support the development of proposals submitted by businesses and individuals through the Ontario Together web portal and help businesses retool their operations. Since its launch in April, six other companies, in addition to Eclipse, have received support from the Ontario Together Fund: Virox Technologies, Southmedic, SRB Technologies, Sterling Industries, CSA Group Testing & Certification, and Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters.
Since its launch, the Ontario Together web portal has received more than 28,000 submissions. More than 18,000 emergency supplies leads have been converted into $662 million in purchases of critical supplies and equipment to support staff on the front lines, including: 26 million gowns, 177 million gloves, 123 million masks, and over 4 million face shields. Over 6,900 ideas have been submitted through the portal on how to address the COVID-19 outbreak, including offers from businesses to retool their operations to make critical supplies or to deliver needed goods or services.

The Ontario Together web portal is also accepting technology-driven solutions and services to help businesses reopen safely and to strengthen interprovincial trade and supply chains.
The Workplace PPE Supplier Directory provides businesses with information on PPE suppliers.

Province partners with North York General Hospital to give vulnerable patients direct access from hospital to long-term care

July 14, 2020 11:30 A.M.

Ministry of Long-Term Care


TORONTO — Today, the Ontario government announced it is launching a pilot project with North York General Hospital that would give alternate level of care (ALC) hospital patients direct priority access to a long-term care bed to help reduce waitlists and end hallway health care. 
""One of the challenges facing our health care system is the length of time hospital patients wait to be discharged to long-term care homes,"" said Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""The pilot project is an example of how our government, together with our long-term care partners, is using innovative ideas and modern solutions to help end hallway health care and reduce the long-term care waitlist."" ALC patients at North York General Hospital who have been waiting for at least 60 days for a long-term care home placement will be eligible for direct access to one of 18 long-term care beds at the hospital's long-term care facility, Seniors' Health Centre. This 18-month pilot project addresses the wait times for a growing number of ALC patients — people who no longer require hospital services, but who are still in hospital because their health status prevents them from going home and there is no space in long-term care for them. ""Innovative models like North York General Hospital's pilot project with Seniors' Health Centre will directly help reduce wait times by getting more patients in the right care setting faster,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""Supporting collaborative, solution-based projects is part of our government's comprehensive plan to end hallway health care and build a connected and sustainable health care system centred around the needs of the patient."" For the pilot, North York General Hospital patients will be eligible for up to 10 per cent of long-stay beds at Seniors' Health Centre, provided they meet specific criteria: they are occupying a bed at the hospital, they have been designated as an alternate level of care patient, they require immediate admission into a long-term care home, and they have been waiting for placement for at least 60 days as an alternate level of care patient. ""The future of health care rests on developing innovative solutions while working together to provide an integrated system of care,"" said Dr. Joshua Tepper, President and CEO, North York General Hospital. ""Through our long-term care home, Seniors' Health Centre, North York General is uniquely poised to help patients return to the community as quickly as possible while also improving the efficiency of the health care system. We are very pleased to be leading this pilot and see direct benefits for our patients and their families, as well as the entire community."" If the pilot success is seen early, the government will consider expanding this approach to other hospitals and long-term care homes in the province.

Quick Facts

In June 2020, 51 per cent of alternate level of care patients in Ontario hospitals were waiting to be discharged to long-term care.
Often, patients no longer need hospital services, but remain in hospital because their health status prevents them from going home, and there is no space in long-term care for them. These patients are known as alternate level of care, or ALC, patients.

An important step in creating a child welfare system focused on prevention and early intervention

July 14, 2020 10:30 A.M.

Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services


TORONTO — Today, Jill Dunlop, Associate Minister of Children and Women's Issues, announced the province is eliminating the practice of birth alerts. Birth alerts are notifications sent by children's aid societies to hospitals when they believe a newborn may be in need of protection. This new approach will improve pre- and post-natal services by promoting collaboration between children's aid societies, hospitals, service providers, Indigenous partners and community-based service providers.
""Ending the use of birth alerts is an important step as we shift our focus to prevention, early intervention and improve outcomes for families and their children,"" said Minister Dunlop. ""This change is part of our government's effort to build a child welfare system that is better coordinated and focused on community-based prevention services that are high quality, culturally appropriate and truly responsive to the needs of children, youth and families."" It has been reported the practice of birth alerts disproportionately affects racialized and marginalized mothers and families. Expectant mothers can be deterred from seeking prenatal care or parenting supports while pregnant due to fears of having a birth alert issued. Birth alerts have never been required under provincial legislation and have been used inconsistently by children's aid societies across the province. Going forward, the government is directing children's aid societies to end the practice of using birth alerts by October 15, 2020. This means working with families, community partners and service providers to create a pre- and post-natal plan that supports the parents of newborns, to ensure more families stay together. ""By ending the use of birth alerts and encouraging collaborative alternatives for children's aid societies and other health care providers, expectant parents will be better supported in accessing community resources before the birth of their child,"" said Jamil Jivani, Ontario's Advocate for Community Opportunities. ""This is a step in the right direction in helping racialized and marginalized communities across Ontario.""

Quick Facts

Ending the use of birth alerts was a recommendation from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. 
Alternative approaches to birth alerts include providing counselling services such as birth planning services, pre-natal services and referrals to community resources and agencies that can provide support to expectant parents.
Birth alerts are also referred to as hospital alerts.
The government is undertaking an extensive review of the child welfare system, including the overrepresentation of Black, Indigenous and racialized children and youth.

Government moves to modernize Ontario Energy Board

July 14, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines


TORONTO - The Ontario government is modernizing the Ontario Energy Board (OEB) in order to strengthen trust and transparency of Ontario's energy sector and improve regulatory processes for the benefit of provincial ratepayers. As part of this process, the province is recommending the appointment of a new leadership team which includes Susanna Zagar as the OEB's new Chief Executive Officer and Lynne Anderson as the OEB's new Chief Commissioner. This new governance structure would come into effect upon proclamation of the amendments under Schedule 2 of the Fixing the Hydro Mess Act, 2019 in Fall 2020.
""I look forward to working together with these experienced leaders as we renew and modernize the OEB,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines. ""Strong leadership will help the OEB better serve individuals and families, allow the provincial regulator to operate more effectively and efficiently, and help ensure that Ontario's energy system remains sustainable and reliable, as was envisioned in the OEB Review Panel."" The restructuring of the OEB is a part of the government's ongoing commitment to improve energy sector regulation for the benefit of Ontario ratepayers. This includes pursuing greater efficiencies, reducing regulatory burden, and enhancing transparency and accountability.  Ms. Zagar spent 10 years as the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board's Chief Strategy, Analytics & People Officer. An experienced public servant, Ms. Zagar has also held executive-level roles at the Ontario Ministry of Infrastructure and the Ontario Ministry of Labour. If her appointment as Chief Executive Officer is approved, Ms. Zagar would provide leadership over the OEB's operations and policy work.  Ms. Anderson has extensive experience at the OEB and was most recently a full-time OEB Board Member. She also served as the OEB's Vice President of Applications for nearly seven years. Ms. Anderson previously served as Hydro Ottawa's Chief Regulatory Affairs and Government Relations Officer. If her appointment as Chief Commissioner is approved, Ms. Anderson would be responsible for the OEB's adjudicative function and will establish panels of Commissioners to preside over rate, facility, utility consolidation and other applications and enforcement matters. The government also intends to make the following initial appointments to the OEB under the new governance structure:  John Knubley (Board of Directors) - Current president of InnovAction Advisory Services Inc. and a former Deputy Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada. Gerald Moncrief (Board of Directors) - Previous owner and president/vice president of Moncrief Construction Limited. Glenn O'Farrell (Board of Directors) - Currently the CEO at the Ombudservice for Life & Health Insurance. Previously, he served as CEO at Groupe Média TFO, Canadian Association of Broadcasters and Global Television Network Québec. Marie Oswald (Board of Directors) - Previously served as Director and Chair of the Board at Oakville Enterprises Corporation and Oakville Hydro Electricity Distribution Inc., following a career in legal and compliance leadership in the financial services industry. Allison Duff (Commissioner) - A former OEB Member with previous experience as a business consultant.  Finally, the government has reappointed a number of current OEB Members who will become Commissioners once the new governance structure comes into effect.

Quick Facts

The OEB is the province’s independent energy regulator. Its responsibilities include setting just and reasonable rates for some electricity bill components and setting rules for energy companies operating in Ontario.
Modernizing the OEB was a key commitment under Bill 87, Fixing the Hydro Mess Act, 2019.
Amendments under Schedule 2 of the Fixing the Hydro Mess Act, 2019, once in force, will reform the OEB's governance structure to strengthen the independence of the adjudicative function of the OEB and provide clear accountability within the organization.
On January 31, 2020, the Ontario Government appointed Richard Dicerni to take on the Chair of the OEB under the new governance structure. Mr. Dicerni's appointment was approved by the Lieutenant Governor in Council on February 20, 2020.
Once the new governance structure is in place, the Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines will provide the OEB with a mandate letter outlining the government's vision for a modernized OEB.

Nearly All Businesses and Public Spaces to Reopen in Stage 3 
Public Gatherings Will Increase in Size as the Province Continues its Path to Economic Recovery

July 13, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government announced nearly all businesses and public spaces will reopen in Stage 3 of the province's reopening framework with public health and workplace safety measures and restrictions in place. As Ontario continues down the path to economic recovery, decisions on which regions will enter Stage 3 and when will be made in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health and other health experts and based on trends of key public health indicators.
Details on the Stage 3 reopening framework were provided by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance, and Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education. ""Our success in reducing the spread of COVID-19 and getting Ontario to a place where we are ready to reopen most of the province is a testament to the hard work of business owners, individuals and families right across the province,"" said Premier Ford. ""So many have stepped up and played by the rules, demonstrating that we can restart our economy safely and responsibly. Small actions can make a big difference. Now more than ever, we must continue to follow the public health advice to preserve the progress we have made together."" As part of the Stage 3 reopening, Ontario will be increasing gathering limits for those regions entering the next stage to the following: Indoor gathering limits will increase to a maximum of 50 people;Outdoor gathering limits will increase to a maximum of 100 people;Gathering limits are subject to physical distancing requirements.Public gathering limits apply to indoor and outdoor events, such as community events or gatherings, concerts, live shows, festivals, conferences, sports and recreational fitness activities, fundraisers, fairs, festivals or open houses. A two metre distance must still be maintained at such events. Regions remaining in Stage 2 will maintain the existing gathering limit of 10. Social circles in all stages at this point will also be kept to a maximum of 10 people province-wide, regardless of stage. The Chief Medical Officer of Health, public health experts and other officials have advised the following, high-risk places and activities are not yet safe to open, even if a region has entered Stage 3, due to the likelihood of large crowds congregating, difficulties with physical distancing, or challenges maintaining the proper cleaning and sanitation required to prevent the spread of COVID‑19: Amusement parks and water parks;Buffet-style food services;Dancing at restaurants and bars, other than by performers hired by the establishment following specific requirements;Overnight stays at camps for children;Private karaoke rooms;Prolonged or deliberate contact while playing sports;Saunas, steam rooms, bath houses and oxygen bars;Table games at casinos and gaming establishments.For more information on the restrictions that will remain in place during Stage 3, as well as the public health guidance necessary to keep the people of Ontario safe, visit Ontario.ca/reopen. The province is committed to working closely and collaboratively with businesses and sectors not yet able to reopen or who are experiencing significant challenges for reopening due to Stage 3 restrictions. These businesses can visit Ontario.ca/reopen to work with the government on a reopening proposal that will enable them to safely resume or increase operations. Government and public health officials will review proposals and contact businesses for feedback or clarifications. ""With almost all businesses and services able to resume operations, Stage 3 is a major step forward in our plan to reopen the province,"" said Minister Phillips. ""We have to keep treating each other with respect and acting responsibly to keep up the progress in our fight against COVID-19. Our government will continue working with our partners across Ontario to rebuild our economy so that our province is a place of economic strength and prosperity for every person and family."" The following public health unit regions will be allowed to move into Stage 3 first, on Friday, July 17, 2020: Algoma Public HealthBrant County Health UnitChatham-Kent Public HealthEastern Ontario Health UnitGrey Bruce Health UnitHaliburton, Kawartha, Pine Ridge District Health UnitHastings Prince Edward Public HealthHuron Perth Public HealthKingston, Frontenac and Lennox & Addington Public HealthLeeds Grenville & Lanark District Health UnitMiddlesex-London Health UnitNorth Bay Parry Sound District Health UnitNorthwestern Health UnitOttawa Public HealthPeterborough Public HealthPorcupine Health UnitPublic Health Sudbury & DistrictsRegion of Waterloo Public Health and Emergency ServicesRenfrew County and District Health UnitSimcoe-Muskoka District Health UnitSouthwestern Public HealthThunder Bay District Health UnitTimiskaming Health UnitWellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public HealthBusinesses and municipalities will be permitted to enter Stage 3 based on their region and, as in the previous stages, may choose to take more time before reopening. For a list of regions that will remain in Stage 2, visit Ontario.ca/reopen. At the beginning of each week, the province will continue to reassess local trends in public health indicators, including rates of transmission, hospital capacity, progress on testing and contact tracing, to determine if additional public health unit regions can progress to Stage 3. The Chief Medical Officer of Health and other public health experts will continue to closely monitor the evolving situation to advise when public health restrictions can be further loosened or if they need to be tightened or reapplied. ""Having seen a decline in the number of new COVID-19 cases as the province safely re-started over 90 per cent of economic activity with Stage 2, we now have the confidence to move certain regions into Stage 3, including expanding the size of gatherings indoors and outdoors,"" said Minister Elliott. ""As we do, it's never been more important for all Ontarians to continue to practise physical distancing and wear a face covering when doing so is a challenge, such as safely visiting a favourite local store. Together, we'll continue to move Ontario forward."" As the province safely and gradually enters Stage 3, child care centres and home child care providers across Ontario will be able to continue to operate with strict safety and operational requirements in place. Beginning on July 27, 2020, child care centres will be permitted to operate with cohorts of 15 children, which is an increase from the current cohort cap of 10. This change will allow parents to return to work, and bring the child care sector to approximately 90 per cent of its operating capacity before the COVID-19 outbreak. ""Providing child care for parents is critical so that, as more Ontarians return to work, they can do so with confidence in knowing that their children are being safely cared for,"" said Minister Lecce. ""Child care is an integral enabler to the continued restart of Ontario's economy, and we remain committed to working to ensure child care remains accessible, affordable and, most importantly, safe as we gradually increase capacity of Ontario's child care sector."" The government, in partnership with health and safety associations, has released over 170 guidance resources at Ontario.ca/COVIDsafety to help employers in multiple sectors ― including fitness, restaurant and food services, and the performing arts ― keep spaces safe for workers and customers. Guidance will be available for all spaces permitted to open in Stage 3. As they prepare to reopen, employers are strongly advised to review and implement appropriate measures to help protect their communities. ""As we enter Stage 3 and continue on the path to economic recovery, it is more important than ever that we support business owners and workers,"" said Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade. ""That is why we launched the Workplace PPE Supplier Directory to provide businesses with information on personal protective equipment suppliers so they can keep their employees, customers and clients safe as they resume their operations. By continuing to work together, we will ensure Ontario is prepared and well-supplied for any future challenges."" Based on community needs, some municipalities and local medical officers of health have implemented more restrictions or requirements, such as mandatory face coverings in commercial establishments and all indoor public places. Check your local public health unit's or local municipality's website.

BARRIE — The safety and well-being of Canadians are top priorities of the governments of Canada and Ontario. But the COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than Canadians' personal health, it is also having a profound impact on the economy.
That is why governments have been taking decisive action to support families, businesses and communities, and continue to look ahead to see what more can be done. Strategic investments in public transportation infrastructure play a key role in supporting Ontarians getting to work, school and essential services on time, and safely back home at the end of the day. Today, the Honourable Mary Ng, Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade, and Member of Parliament for Markham, on behalf of the Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities; the Honourable Doug Downey, Member of Provincial Parliament for Barrie-Springwater-Oro-Medonte and Ontario's Attorney General, on behalf of the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure; and Jeff Lehman, Mayor of the City of Barrie, announced funding for five projects that will modernize and improve Barrie Transit. Residents who use public transit will benefit from the replacement of the City of Barrie's retiring bus fleet with 30 new, low-floor, accessible buses. In addition, transit users with accessibility needs will benefit from the purchase of 21 new fully accessible, paratransit city buses which will replace the existing fleet over the next seven years. A new transit hub at the Allandale GO Station and a new connection hub downtown will offer transit users a better connected and more integrated public transit system. More bus stops and platforms, as well as additional bicycle parking, will make it easier for residents to access the public transit system.  The Government of Canada is investing more than $16.4 million in these projects through the Public Transit Infrastructure Stream (PTIS) of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Ontario is providing more than $13.6 million, while the City of Barrie's contribution is more than $10.9 million.

Quick Facts

Through the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities.
$28.7 billion of this funding is supporting public transit projects, including $5 billion available for investment through the Canada Infrastructure Bank.
Across Ontario, the Government of Canada has invested more than $2.5 billion in infrastructure under the Investing in Canada Plan.
Across the province, Ontario is investing more than $7.3 billion in public transit infrastructure over 10 years through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program.

THUNDER BAY — The Ontario government announced today the final settlement of a 115 year old land claim that addresses the shortfall of land received by Flying Post First Nation, as part of the James Bay Treaty (Treaty #9) that was originally signed in 1905. The $14.1 million settlement will contribute to the future economic prosperity of the First Nation.
""I'm pleased that Ontario is fulfilling its outstanding obligation to Flying Post First Nation, dating back more than a century,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Indigenous Affairs. ""Settling land claims through co-operative negotiations and respectful dialogue is a key step towards reconciliation with Indigenous people."" The Flying Post First Nation reserve lands are located near Timmins along the Ground Hog River, however, today the majority of its members live near Nipigon. ""This is an important moment,"" said Chief Murray Ray of Flying Post First Nation. ""Flying Post First Nation and the province of Ontario have taken the proper steps to right an historic wrong for a loss that is almost 115 years old. We had a successful ratification on December 2, 2019 and are confident it will contribute to our economic and social development. We are proud of all our members of voting age who cast their ballot in favour of this settlement."" The settlement was approved by the First Nation members in a vote in December 2019, with 100% of those who voted in favour of the agreement.

VAUGHAN — As the province safely and gradually reopens, Ontario is starting down the road to growth, renewal and economic recovery. That's why the Ontario government is proud to support the launch of the Ontario Made program from Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters (CME). This new program will promote the many world-class goods that are made across the province by helping consumers easily identify, access and purchase local products.
Details were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, and Dennis Darby, President and CEO of Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters, at Artistic Skylight in Vaughan, Ontario. ""Ontario has always been Canada's workshop, and our products are recognized as the gold standard across the country and around the world,"" said Premier Ford. ""Our government is proud to support Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters' Ontario Made program. Promoting locally made products will be essential to building a strong, self-sufficient province and key to our economic recovery."" Funding for Ontario Made is made possible through the $50 million Ontario Together Fund launched on April 1, 2020. This funding will be used to help retailers and consumers identify local products by: Creating a new Ontario Made logo that manufacturers can use to help consumers identify their made-in-Ontario products. CME will also meet with major retailers to promote Ontario Made products in-store and increase visibility for customers;Launching a new SupportOntarioMade.ca website that will connect consumers and supply chain partners to manufacturers of made-in-Ontario products through one directory;Promoting Ontario Made through a digital newsletter to raise awareness of Ontario goods and products online and through social media.""Over the past few months, plants and factories across the province retooled their operations to provide the front lines with the essential equipment needed in the fight against COVID-19, including PPE,"" said Minister Fedeli. ""As the province reopens and the economy recovers, it is now more important than ever to support and promote Ontario's world-class manufacturing sector and get people back to work. By supporting Ontario manufacturing, consumers are buying quality, locally made products."" In March, the government launched the Ontario Together web portal to encourage companies to submit innovative ideas and ways to provide medical supplies, PPE and other essential equipment. To date, more than 27,000 submissions have been received since the launch of the web portal and 18,000 leads have been converted into more than $658 million in purchases of emergency supplies. In April, the government launched the $50 million Ontario Together Fund to support the development of proposals submitted by businesses and individuals through the Ontario Together web portal and help businesses retool their operations or deliver innovative solutions in response to COVID-19. ""Ontario manufacturers have a long and proud history of making some of the most innovative products in the world. As consumers increasingly want to buy local, it's important that we help them make informed decisions and find local manufacturers,"" said Mr. Darby. ""We want to encourage Ontario manufacturers to proudly wave the flag by labeling their products and buying local where possible. Ontario Made will help raise awareness of what is manufactured right here by our neighbours, friends, and families and support local manufacturing.""

Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade


TORONTO - Today, Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, issued the following statement on Statistics Canada's monthly employment release:
""Today's employment numbers are an indication that Ontario's economy is beginning to stabilize as we continue to safely and gradually reopen the province. According to Statistics Canada, employment in Ontario increased by 377,900 in June, including an increase of 66,200 manufacturing jobs. But the job numbers are much more than a statistic, they represent, families, business owners and workers back at work and contributing to Ontario's economic recovery. Earlier this week, we introduced the COVID-19 Economic Recovery Act. This legislation is the first step in our made-in-Ontario plan for growth, renewal and economic recovery. If passed, this bill will help get shovels in the ground faster on key infrastructure projects, lead to the creation of more jobs and investment, and cut red tape to help businesses adapt to the new environment. As we look towards Stage 3 of reopening, we know we have a solid foundation upon which to continue building our future and emerge stronger than ever. Our government is committed to working in partnership with people, businesses and municipalities across Ontario to respond to the challenges they face so we can create jobs and continue to support the economic health and prosperity of every region of the province."" Our government intends to stand shoulder to shoulder with those who are struggling as a result of this global pandemic. That also means supporting and promoting everything local. Made in Ontario means built in Ontario, it means hope for businesses and workers. It means asking consumers to support Ontario manufacturers and businesses by purchasing local products, because you will not only be buying quality, but supporting your friends, neighbours and local communities during one of the darkest periods in our province's history.""

Governments increase support for eligible farmers experiencing labour challenges during COVID-19

July  9, 2020  3:30 P.M.

Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs


WOODSTOCK — The governments of Canada and Ontario are providing the best support possible to help farmers manage challenges beyond their control by enhancing AgriInsurance coverage for the 2020 growing season to include labour shortages due to COVID-19.
Ontario's agriculture industry, specifically farms growing fruits and vegetables like tomatoes, melons and peaches, are labour intensive and highly dependent on seasonal agricultural workers. COVID-19 has interrupted regular flows of worker travel and has resulted in some gaps in labour availability. This could result in some crops being unharvested and financial loss for the agri-food industry. The federal government made a commitment on May 5th to work with the provinces and territories to explore possibilities for expanding the AgriInsurance program to include labour shortages as an eligible risk for the horticulture sector. This work with provincial and territorial partners would insure against lost production due to an insufficient workforce, should producers be unable to find enough labour to harvest. ""During these exceptional times, we fully appreciate just how essential our agri-food workers are to our entire food supply chain,"" said the Honourable Marie-Claude Bibeau, federal Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. ""Our Government has been working hard with the provinces and agri-food businesses to ensure those workers have a safe workplace so they can continue putting food on our tables. I congratulate Ontario for being the first province to take this important step that recognizes the hardships Ontario farmers and food producers have faced because of worker shortages, and gives them the added support they need.""  ""We recognize that this terrible virus has created new business pressures and increased uncertainty for farmers, which is why we are taking action to ensure farmers have the resources they need to address today's challenges,"" said Ernie Hardeman, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. ""By enhancing AgriInsurance coverage to include labour shortages due to COVID-19 for eligible farmers, we are directly responding to their requests for support and protecting Ontario's agri-food sector so it can continue producing the food our province needs."" Ontario farmers already enrolled in an eligible production insurance plan who suffer from crop losses due to labour disruptions during the 2020 growing season will have access to further insurance coverage through Agricorp. The added insurance coverage will include:  Inability to attract sufficient on-farm labour due to COVID-19; andIllness or quarantine of on-farm labour and the producer due to COVID-19. Farmers will be expected to notify Agricorp as soon as possible if they experience COVID-19 related labour disruptions that are having an impact on their crops.  ""This announcement is an important first step towards giving growers assurances that their government will have their backs during the pandemic,"" said Bill George, Chair of the Ontario Fruit and Vegetable Growers' Association. ""We thank Minister Bibeau for making this enhanced coverage possible, and we thank Minister Hardeman and the Ford government for its leadership, and for being the first province in Canada to take this step."" Business Risk Management programs, including AgriInsurance, protect producers against significant risks that threaten the viability of their farm and are beyond their capacity to manage, such as weather, disease and pests. It is a business risk management program under the Canadian Agricultural Partnership, a five-year, $3-billion commitment by Canada's federal, provincial and territorial governments to support Canada's agri-food and agri-products sectors.

Quick Facts

Ontario is home to 49,600 farms, growing 200 different commodities. Ontario’s agriculture industry supports 69,000 jobs and contributes $7.6 billion to the GDP.
Agricorp administers production insurance programming in Ontario on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs.
The province is significantly expanding the Agri-food Workplace Protection Program and committing up to $15 million to enhance health and safety measures on farms and in food processing facilities. 
The Enhanced Agri-food Workplace Protection Program provides cost-share funding for farmers to purchase Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and implement workplace modifications and other measures.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs has provided funding to Workplace Safety and Prevention Services (WSPS) to deliver resources and consulting services to help farmers and other agri-food businesses provide safe workplaces. For more information, visit the WSPS website.

Ontario Seeking Input on Modernizing Capital Markets
Taskforce Aims to Help Strengthen Competition and Innovation

July  9, 2020  2:00 P.M.

Ministry of Finance


TORONTO — The Ontario government is continuing to seek advice and input from people and organizations on modernizing Ontario's Capital Markets and supporting economic growth and job creation with the posting of the Capital Markets Modernization Taskforce initial consultation report.
""As we plan for Ontario's economic recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic, competitive capital markets can play an important role attracting global investment and creating good jobs here in our province,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. ""Despite rapid changes in the global economy, the Ontario Securities Act has not been updated in over 15 years. More than ever, Ontario needs a modern capital markets system that attracts businesses and competes for investment and talent worldwide. I created the Taskforce with this goal in mind. I appreciate that they put forward an ambitious and creative set of initial recommendations for consultation."" Over the last few months, the Taskforce listened to over 110 stakeholders about the challenges they face, including financial institutions, small and large publicly-listed companies, independent investment dealers, industry associations, law firms and investor advocacy groups. The Capital Markets Modernization Taskforce consultation report outlines their findings and more than 47 policy proposals to modernize the province's capital markets. ""Industry members have been asking for a regulatory approach that supplements the policing function with a public policy imperative of capital markets growth to enable Ontario to compete globally. Responding to this feedback, we are now asking for input to help make sure our final recommendations to government support our mandate to make Ontario one of the most attractive capital markets in the world,"" said Walied Soliman, Chair of the Capital Markets Modernization Taskforce. ""On behalf of the Taskforce, I'd like to thank the diverse group of over 100 business leaders, investors, associations, and investor advocacy groups for their thoughtful contributions and participation in this consequential work. I would also like to thank my Taskforce colleagues for their tireless efforts over the past six months."" The Capital Markets Modernization Taskforce will provide recommendations to the Minister of Finance on how to transform the regulatory landscape for capital markets. Following this consultation, a final report will be submitted to the Minister before the end of the year. The consultation will end on September 7, 2020.

Ontario Taking Bold Action to Address Racism and Inequity in Schools


July  9, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


The Ontario government is taking bold action to break down systemic barriers in schools and establish discrimination-free classrooms to ensure every student is set up for life-long success. 
Suspensions Through Bill 197, COVID-19 Economic Recovery Act, 2020, the government is proposing to eliminate discretionary suspensions for students from kindergarten up to Grade 3, beginning September 2020. Serious offences will still be subject to mandatory suspensions. The latest suspension data in 2018-19 shows that over 65,000 elementary and secondary students were suspended. Students with special education needs made up almost half of all those suspended that year. About 10 per cent (6,395) of suspended students were among the youngest learners, in kindergarten to Grade 3. In addition, 40 per cent of suspensions in those early years were issued for undefined reasons, meaning it is not known why the youngest learners in schools are suspended. Furthermore, there is over-representation of students from historically underserved and racialized communities in suspension data, including: In Ontario's two largest school boards (Toronto District School Board and Peel District School Board), Black students make up 11 per cent and 10 per cent of the student population but represent over 34 per cent and 22 per cent of students receiving suspensions, respectively.Streaming As of September 2021, the government will begin the process of ending Grade 9 streaming into applied and academic courses. Currently, students enrolled in applied-level courses have multiple negative outcomes and limited opportunities for post-secondary advancement. This includes: Students enrolled in applied courses are over four times more likely to not graduate;33 per cent of students who took the Grade 9 applied  courses transitioned directly into college or university, compared to 73 per cent of students who took the academic courses;Over 13 per cent of students in applied courses live in low-income households, compared to just over seven per cent in academic courses; and,50 per cent of students enrolled in applied courses feel they do not belong at schoolDiscrimination-Free Classroom There is clear research-informed evidence that when schools have staff that reflect the social identities of their students, there are immediate and long-term positive impacts on student achievement. The Ministry of Education is exploring increased opportunities for boards to hire educators that reflect their classrooms and ensure that there is a consistently high standard of merit and diversity in those who are teaching Ontario's students. The government will take immediate action, including working with the Ontario College of Teachers to publish a Professional Advisory for members. This will be accompanied by a Policy/Program Memorandum (PPM) to school boards to reinforce the Professional Advisory, and to provide guidance in dealing with behaviour or remarks of a racist nature. It is expected that, as the government consults with key partners in addressing anti-Black racism and discrimination, this PPM will serve as an interim method of ensuring school boards have clear direction on how to immediately respond to incidences and allegations of racism and discrimination. To further strengthen the expectations of educators, staff, and school boards, the government may  explore amendments to the Ontario College of Teacher's Act to ensure there are clear, transparent, and effective accountability and recourse measures in rapidly responding to instances and allegations of anti-Black racism and discrimination. The ministry has also proposed additional anti-racism and anti-discrimination training before the end of the calendar year. The government is currently consulting with teachers' federations, education workers' unions, and trustees' associations on the implementation of this critical initiative. The ministry will also continue to work with the Anti-Racism Directorate (ARD) to establish additional anti-racism initiatives in the education system that are grounded in evidence and research. Demographic Data While there is existing data that boards and the Ministry rely on for understanding the demographics and achievement of students and staff, boards currently have limited and varying capacity to apply a demographic lens to their data. The collection of this student and staff identity data will be implemented immediately. Boards will have until the beginning of the 2023 calendar year to ensure that they are aligned with province-wide data collection efforts.

New Changes to Advance Equal Opportunity for Black, Indigenous and Racialized Students

July  9, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government announced bold new changes to the education system that will help break down barriers for Black, Indigenous and racialized students and provide all students with an equal opportunity to succeed. As part of this action, the province will move forward with ending Grade 9 streaming into applied and academic courses, proposing to eliminate discretionary suspensions for students, strengthening sanctions for teachers who engage in behaviour of a racist nature, and providing teachers with additional anti-racism and anti-discrimination training.
Details were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education, and Jamil Jivani, Ontario's Advocate for Community Opportunities. ""To help our young people reach their full potential, we have to start earlier to create equal opportunity for them, whether that's reforming suspensions for primary grades or ending the practice of streaming for Grade 9 students,"" said Premier Ford. ""Above all, our government will not tolerate racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia, Islamophobia or hate in any form in our schools. Through these initiatives to promote equality in education, we will ensure students from all walks of life are set up for lifelong success."" Through Bill 197, COVID-19 Economic Recovery Act, 2020, the government is proposing to eliminate discretionary suspensions for students from kindergarten up to Grade 3, beginning September 2020. Serious offences will still be subject to mandatory suspensions. The latest suspension data from 2018-19 shows that over 65,000 elementary and secondary students in Ontario were suspended during that school year. Starting in September 2021, the government will begin the process of ending Grade 9 streaming into applied and academic courses. Currently, students enrolled in applied-level courses have multiple negative outcomes and limited opportunities for post-secondary advancement. ""Every student ― irrespective of the colour of their skin, faith, heritage, and orientation ― deserves every opportunity to succeed in the classroom,"" said Minister Lecce. ""The transformational change we are driving forward will embolden a generation of students and unleash their full potential, absent the systemic barriers that hold them back. To racialized students in Ontario: we see you, and we value you. We will stand with all students on this journey to advance respect, dignity, and opportunity."" As part of its plan to end early streaming, the government will introduce a new foundational Grade 9 math course for September 2021 and will work with school boards as they transition students into a de-streamed Grade 9 math program. The de-streaming of the Grade 9 math curriculum is the first step towards further de-streaming in other curriculum areas, which will better support all students in having every opportunity to pursue the pathway of their choice after their K-12 education. ""We must recognize that today's changes are the result of our government and community members working together,"" said Jamil Jivani, Ontario's Advocate for Community Opportunities. ""In particular, parents in Ontario's Black communities have been a powerful voice for change, providing their unique insights in how suspensions and streaming have disadvantaged black students. Thank you to every parent and community leader who engaged with us in this process."" To ensure students feel accepted in a discrimination-free classroom, the government will be strengthening sanctions for teachers who engage in behaviour of a racist nature. Over the last 23 years, the Ontario College of Teachers reports that there have been 32 instances of teacher discipline for racist or homophobic behavior or remarks. The Ministry of Education has also proposed additional anti-racism and anti-discrimination training before the end of the calendar year. The government is currently consulting with teachers' federations, education workers' unions, and trustees' associations on the implementation of this critical initiative.

Quick Facts

Through the Grants for Student Needs program (GSN), the Ministry of Education is providing a projected $40.9 million to help school boards implement suspension policies, including the hiring of professional staff and implementing prevention and intervention activities and programs. School boards will use this record-high allocation to support the implementation of the new suspension policies. 
School boards can use portions of their $10 million in new mental health funding to provide students, educators, and staff with the resources and training needed to implement the new suspension policies.
The government has committed to providing $3.5 million to support the Black and Indigenous grad coach programs, which provide wrap-around supports for students who are at risk of not graduating.
On June 4, 2020, the government launched the Premier’s Council on Equality of Opportunity, a new advisory group that will provide advice on how young people can overcome social and economic barriers and achieve success.

In accordance with the Anti-Racism Act and Anti-Racism Data Standards, all school boards in Ontario will be required to collect race-based data by January 1, 2023.

Application intake for broadband and cellular program opens today

July  9, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Ministry of Infrastructure


The Ontario government is expanding access to reliable broadband and cellular service in underserved and unserved parts of the province. The application intake for the $150 million Improving Connectivity for Ontario program (ICON) opens today. This funding will help drive economic investment and job creation across the province, while allowing more people to work from home more efficiently, engage in online learning, and connect with family and friends.
""The outbreak of COVID-19 reinforced the need to improve access to reliable broadband and cellular service as more people work and learn from home in order to practice physical distancing,"" said Laurie Scott, Minister of Infrastructure. ""By making these investments we will help to ensure every region in the province can participate in the modern digital economy, and contribute to Ontario's economic recovery.""     Any areas across Ontario that do not meet the national standards for broadband speeds would be eligible for provincial funding. Up to 12 per cent of households in the province - mostly in rural, remote or northern areas - don't have adequate broadband service, according to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. Telecommunication service providers, municipalities, Indigenous communities and non-profits are invited to submit innovative proposals and lend their investment, expertise and experience to improve connectivity in communities across Ontario. The preliminary application deadline for the first intake of the ICON program is August 21, 2020. The province's investment of $150 million announced today is part of the $315 million Up to Speed: Ontario's Broadband and Cellular Action Plan. This action plan has the potential to leverage up to $1 billion in partner funding for broadband infrastructure investments. 

Quick Facts

On June 3, 2020, Ontario announced the ICON program, a multi-year plan which aims to support approved projects as early as 2021. 
National standards for adequate broadband service are defined by speeds known as 50/10 (50 megabits per second download, and 10 megabits for upload).
Over the past several months, Ontario has partnered with the Eastern Ontario Regional Network (EORN) to leverage $213 million to improve cellular access in eastern Ontario.
The Province is investing in the $190 million Southwestern Integrated Fibre Technology (SWIFT) project to bring high-speed broadband to 50,000 more homes and businesses across Southwestern Ontario.
Ontario has invested in initiatives to improve connectivity in Northern Ontario, such as a project that will connect five remote Matawa First Nations communities, seven broadband projects that will support rural and Indigenous communities, and the Next Generation Network Program.

The extension was made to ensure the province maintains the necessary flexibility to protect public health and safety as more businesses reopen and people go back to work.
The extension of the emergency orders will help protect vulnerable people, such as seniors, by allowing the redeployment of frontline staff in long-term care facilities, retirement homes and other congregate care settings, like women's shelters and residential services. In addition, the extension would allow public health units to redeploy or hire staff to support case management and contact tracing. ""Our government is getting Ontario back on track and more people back to work, but at the same time taking steps to ensure we don't undo the tremendous progress we have made together,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""By keeping these emergency measures in place, we will continue to support our frontline care providers, protect our most vulnerable, and ensure we can rapidly respond to potential outbreaks or surges."" The government intends to extend emergency orders to align with the Reopening Ontario (A Flexible Response to COVID-19) Act, 2020, if passed. This proposed legislation is part of the government's plan to cautiously reopen Ontario in a way that recognizes the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 even after the provincial declaration of emergency has ended. The bill, if passed, would allow Ontario to continue its path to recovery by easing restrictions where appropriate, while maintaining important select tools to address the ongoing threat of this deadly virus and protect Ontarians. A full list of emergency orders can be found on the e-Laws website under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act and at Ontario.ca/alert.

Quick Facts

Ontario Starting Down the Path to Growth, Renewal and Economic Recovery


July  8, 2020  2:15 P.M.

Office of the Premier


The COVID-19 outbreak has touched all Ontarians. It has created significant hardship for individuals, families and businesses and they need help to bounce back from the serious health and economic impacts. 
In response, Ontario has introduced the COVID-19 Economic Recovery Act, 2020, part of a made-in-Ontario plan to help boost the province's economic recovery, create thousands of jobs, put more opportunities within reach of businesses, get infrastructure projects built faster, and improve the quality of life in every community across the province. Restarting Jobs and Development Building Code Act The Ontario government is making it easier and faster to update the Building Code. The proposed changes will allow the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing to make regulations that will streamline the Building Code development process, align it with National Construction Codes and enable Ontario to respond faster to construction sector needs. This will reduce inter-provincial trade barriers, make Ontario more competitive and support economic growth. Drainage Act The Ontario government is working with the farm and food sector to reduce regulatory burden, while preserving the environmental rules that help to keep Ontarians safe and healthy. Streamlining administrative processes under the Drainage Act would encourage innovation in drainage practices, help to prevent flooding, and reduce costs for farmers, rural landowners and municipalities. Reducing Delays for Environmental Infrastructure Projects The Ontario government is making environmental approvals for wastewater and stormwater infrastructure work better for communities. It is proposing improvements to its Environmental Compliance Approval process providing a single, consolidated approval process for low-impact municipal sewage collection and stormwater management projects. This proposed approach would mean that simple, routine changes by municipalities — including alterations, extensions, enlargements or replacement projects — could be pre-authorized to begin construction without needing separate approvals for each project. The new process would ensure municipalities would be able to build this critical infrastructure faster, eliminating costly construction delays while maintaining strong environmental protections. Environmental Assessment Act The Ontario government is updating the almost 50-year old environmental assessment program to build a modern, practical process that supports strong environmental oversight and a strong economy. Building on our enhancements over the past year, the government is proposing changes to the Environmental Assessment Act that will improve the environmental assessment program. The changes would allow us to focus resources on projects that have the highest impact on the environment, reduce timelines by half from 6 to 3 years for the largest projects, and match the level of assessment requirements with the level of environmental impact so critical infrastructure projects can get off the ground without undue delay. Farm Registration and Farm Organizations Funding Act By introducing an appeal process under the Farm Business Registration Program, The Ontario government can deliver a less expensive, faster and less cumbersome appeal process for Ontario farmers. If passed, applicants could appeal a decision through the Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs Appeal Tribunal, rather than through the courts. We are also clarifying the renewal process for eligibility for funding to provide greater consistency and fairness in the treatment of farm organizations. Planning Act Proposed updates will reduce red tape and speed up transitconstruction, the development of affordable housing and construction projects that are not in the Greenbelt. When making a zoning order, the proposed changes will give the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing additional authority to apply inclusionary zoning (so that new developments may include affordable housing) and address site plan matters, such as the exterior design of buildings, landscaping and pedestrian and vehicle access. Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing Act The Ontario government is proposing changes to permanently establish the Office of the Provincial Land and Development Facilitator and give the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing the authority to appoint the Facilitator. The Facilitator will continue to provide advice and make recommendations to the Minister on growth and land-use planning matters - helping to ensure that complicated and long-standing land-use planning disputes are resolved quickly across the province. Occupational Health and Safety Act As part of the government's commitment to keeping workers safe, an amendment to the Occupational Health and Safety Act will allow nationally and internationally recognized standards to be updated more regularly. These standards set workplace safety expectations for everything from protective clothing to equipment, and they are established by organizations such as Canadian Standards Association Group (CSA). Updating standards without requiring regulatory amendments will allow employers and workers access to more current information on workplace standards. Invest Ontario As the province continues to reopen and the economy recovers, it's more critical than ever to position Ontario as a top tier destination for investment, domestic growth, and job creation. A key measure to support this objective is the creation of a new investment attraction agency, Invest Ontario. Invest Ontario will promote the province as a key investment destination, making Ontario more competitive while sending a strong signal to investors that the province is open for business. It will be a ""one stop shop"" for businesses and investors. It will move at the speed of business and drive greater economic growth, support strategic domestic firms and attract business from around the world to create good jobs in Ontario. It will initially focus on three important sectors for COVID-19 recovery where Ontario has a globally competitive advantage: advanced manufacturing, life sciences, and technology. Invest Ontario will include greater business development and deal structuring expertise and build on the many benefits of investing in Ontario, including: a good quality of life, a highly skilled talent pool, a strong and growing innovation sector, and a pro-job creation jurisdiction that can help businesses thrive. Reducing Regulatory Costs to Business Act, Burden Reduction Reporting Act and Modernizing Ontario for People and Businesses Act The Ontario government is committed to business recovery and job creation, which is why it is taking urgent action to modernize how it operates. The province is proposing to merge the Reducing Regulatory Costs for Business Act, 2017 with the Burden Reduction Reporting Act so that all burden reduction requirements would now be in a single law - the Modernizing Ontario for People and Businesses Act. This new act would enshrine the government's seven burden reduction principles into legislation, so that businesses can count on clear, focused and effective rules that maintain or enhance protections for people's health, safety, and the environment. These proposed changes will broaden the reach of burden reduction requirements to encompass legislation, regulation, policies and forms - and to include additional stakeholder groups like for-profit and not-for-profit businesses. This will ensure the government is doing everything it can to communicate clearly, ensure digital rather than paper pathways where possible, and deliver on the province's commitment to be a modern regulator. Transit-Oriented Communities Act and Ministry of Infrastructure Act The Ontario government is advancing the Transit-Oriented Communities (TOC) Program, which will help connect people to places by building communities that are centred around transit stations along the four priority subway projects. The TOC approach provides real opportunities to build complete, mixed-use communities that are connected to transit, building not only subway stations but vibrant communities. By partnering with third-parties, TOCs will make it easier and faster for commuters to get to the places that matter most - bringing housing, including affordable housing, and jobs closer to transit. Transit-Oriented Communities are part of the government's plan to build new, sustainable transit faster so people can get where they want to go, when they want to get there. Public Transportation and Highway Improvement Act Investment in infrastructure is a key component of economic recovery. Construction puts local people to work, and provides the province with assets that allow people and goods to move more efficiently. The Ontario government is looking at ways to accelerate key provincial highway construction projects by identifying and proposing changes that would remove potential ""bottlenecks"", allowing construction to start earlier and finish sooner. Strengthening Communities Environmental Assessment Act The Ontario government is committed to giving local municipalities more say in landfill approvals, as committed to in our Made-in-Ontario Environment Plan. We are proposing a change that will require new, large landfill applicants to ensure there is local support from host municipalities, and certain neighbouring adjacent municipalities within 3.5km that meet certain criteria as part of the approvals process. This is a balanced approach that puts communities at the center of decision-making and provides more certainty for landfill applicants, while ensuring enough landfill capacity in the province. Municipal Act and City of Toronto Act The Ontario government is proposing changes that will enable municipalities and local boards to hold virtual meetings, at their discretion, and to allow municipal councils the option to permit their members to vote by proxy when absent. Planning Act and Development Charges Act The Ontario government has a housing shortage, which is driving up costs and making it unaffordable to rent or buy a home. Now, more than ever, builders need certainty about costs in order to build more housing and support economic recovery. Based on consultations, Ontario is proposing changes that will give municipalities flexibility to fund community services for new developments through modified development charges and a new community benefits charge. The modified development charges will allow municipalities to recover 100 per cent of the cost to build critical community services like long-term care, child care, public health facilities, playgrounds, libraries and affordable housing. A separate community benefits charge will enable municipalities to fund growth-related capital costs of services due to higher density developments that aren't funded by other tools. Municipalities will continue to fund parkland with the existing mechanisms and added accountability. Development charges and the community benefits charge will work together to ensure municipalities can pay for the infrastructure and services growing communities need. The proposed changes will increase the supply of housing, ensure growth pays for growth, support municipalities in building complete communities, and make municipal revenues and costs for builders clearer from the start. Focusing on the Environment and Health The Ontario government is committed to holding polluters accountable, while reducing the burden on responsible businesses. The province is reviewing the province's compliance policy to ensure it can quickly and effectively address noise and odour incidents with known or potential environmental and/or health impacts. This review will allow the government to focus more of its resources on incidents and complaints that pose a higher risk to the environment and/or human health. Creating Opportunity for People Education Act The Ontario government is proposing multiple amendments to the Education Act: Ontario is listening to parents, caregivers and students impacted by the closures of the province's demonstration schools due to the COVID-19 outbreak and proposing amendments that would provide the capacity for a second-year option for all first-year demonstration school students during the 2020-21 school year.The government is also proposing to broaden the qualification requirements for Director of Education positions that would allow school boards to select the best candidate for their respective communities. The requirement that only qualified teachers can be Directors of Education has not been updated since 1997, and this overdue amendment would allow school communities to choose from a wider pool of candidates with a wider skill set, and who are representative of Ontario's diverse population.The Ontario government is committed to supporting school boards in building and sustaining a positive school climate that is safe, equitable, inclusive, and accepting for all students to support their education and well-being. A proposed amendment would allow regulations to remove the discretionary powers of principals to suspend kindergarten to grade 3 students for minor infractions.The Reciprocal Education Approach (REA) is a successful initiative created in collaboration with First Nation partners, school board associations and the Ministry of Education. The government is proposing an amendment that reflects feedback collected through those collaborative partnerships and is responsive to the emerging considerations identified during REA's inaugural year.Justices of the Peace Act As part of the government's plan to press forward boldly towards a more accessible, responsive and resilient justice system, the province is proposing changes to fill justice of the peace vacancies faster. The current process to appoint justices of the peace is outdated and slow. This has created obstacles to filling vacancies, resulting in delays for people waiting for their day in court. The proposed changes would ensure greater transparency and encourage more diversity throughout the recruitment and appointment process. They would require the committee to publish diversity statistics at every step of the process in their annual reports (the disclosure of this information would be voluntary). Proposed changes will also change the composition of the committee to increase efficiency while ensuring the participation and representation of local representatives and non-lawyers. Marriage Act The Ontario government is taking decisive action to stop the spread of COVID-19 and some of the necessary measures have delayed some marriage and wedding plans. To ensure couples can use marriage licences purchased between December 1, 2019 and the last day of the province-wide emergency, the government is proposing legislative amendments to the Marriage Act that extend the validity period of most marriage licences that were not used due to the provincial emergency. If the proposed amendments to the Marriage Act receive Royal Assent, Ontario will waive the provincial fee for licences if a couple requires a new licence because critical information on the licence purchased during that timeframe is no longer accurate, or the original unused licence has been lost or destroyed. Ontario Educational Communications Authority Act and Ontario French-language Communications Authority Act To give secondary students more choice in high-quality online learning courses - no matter where they live or go to school - The Ontario government is proposing amendments that would broaden the mandates of both TVO and TFO to position them to provide centralized administration, coordination and support for teacher-led online learning in the English-language and French-language publicly-funded education systems. Payday Loans Act The Ontario government is taking necessary action to protect the province's most vulnerable consumers by proposing amendments that would limit the interest rate that may be charged on payday loans in default to 2.5 per cent per month (non-compounded). The government is also proposing to set $25 as the maximum fee that payday lenders could charge for dishonoured payments. These proposed changes would provide relief for payday loan borrowers who may be unable to repay their loans on time. Provincial Offences Act Provincial offences courts are the busiest courts in Ontario's justice system. Fifty-nine municipal partners administer court operations for Provincial Offences Act matters heard by the Ontario Court of Justice. Due to COVID-19, provincial offences matters scheduled between March 16, 2020 and September 11, 2020 have been adjourned and rescheduled to a later date. As part of our commitment to keeping people safe and maintaining access to justice throughout the public health emergency, the Ontario government is amending the Provincial Offences Act so that municipally-run courts can make greater use of technology to deliver justice services remotely and reduce in-person court appearances.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government is taking the first step in a made-in-Ontario plan for growth, renewal and economic recovery. Today, the province introduced the COVID-19 Economic Recovery Act, proposed legislation that lays the foundation to restart jobs and development, strengthen communities, and create opportunity for people in every region of the province. 
Details of the legislation were provided by Premier Doug Ford, Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, Prabmeet Sarkaria, Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. ""The COVID-19 pandemic has touched all Ontarians and created significant hardship for individuals, families and businesses,"" said Premier Ford. ""People are relying on our government to help rebuild the province and get people back to work ― and that's exactly what we're doing, starting with this new legislation."" If passed, the COVID-19 Economic Recovery Act will: Restart jobs and development to get Ontario's economic engine roaring again by getting key infrastructure projects built faster, attracting more jobs and investment, and cutting red tape to help businesses adapt to the new environment.Strengthen communities by ensuring municipalities are equipped with the tools they need to continue to provide the critical services people rely on every day, including allowing municipalities and their local boards to continue to choose to hold meetings electronically at any time and putting in place a new community benefits charge to help municipalities pay for the infrastructure and services needed for growing communities.Create opportunity for people as they recover their lives and livelihoods by protecting consumers, modernizing services, improving the education system and removing the social and economic barriers that stand in the way of success for young people.""We are working hand in hand with our municipal partners so they can emerge stronger and better able to meet the needs of local residents,"" said Minister Clark. ""Ontario will continue to be a champion for communities and work closely with the federal government to help every community chart a path to a strong economic recovery."" ""Making Ontario a modern regulator — one that communicates clearly and operates effectively — will free up our people and businesses to focus on what's important: recovering and re-emerging stronger than before,"" said Minister Sarkaria. ""By improving digital access to government and incorporating best practices, we're empowering businesses to rebuild, rehire, and return to a period where their success fuels our economic growth. A modern Ontario is better for people and smarter for business."" The government is committed to working in partnership with people, businesses and municipalities to respond to the challenges they face and support the long-term health and prosperity of Ontario's economy.

Quick Facts

Ontario’s COVID-19: Tackling the Barriers website was created to help businesses overcome the unique challenges created by this pandemic.
Through almost 1,300 submissions the government is actively investigating nearly 400 as identified roadblocks.

To assist municipalities, the province announced several supports in Ontario’s Action Plan: Responding to COVID 19 (March 2020 Economic and Fiscal Update). This lays the groundwork for nearly $450 million of direct support to assist municipalities in their efforts to support vulnerable people, deferring the June municipal remittance of education property tax to school boards by 90 days, and postponing the property tax reassessment for 2021 to ensure that municipal governments can focus their attention on critical public health initiatives.
The $450 million in support includes: $350 million through the Social Services Relief Fund, most of which allows local service managers and Indigenous program administrators to expand supports for our vulnerable people across the province; an additional $100 million to support public health units and Public Health Ontario for the extraordinary costs incurred in meeting this public health threat and in protecting Ontarians.

The government is investing $2.6 billion this year to rehabilitate Ontario’s highways and bridges in every corner of Ontario. To get shovels in the ground faster and get more people back to work, the government is making it easier to build this critical transportation infrastructure, which will reduce delays and save taxpayers money.

Ministry of Infrastructure


WILMOT—The governments of Canada and Ontario recognize the different ways that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected smaller communities across the province. While moving towards recovery, investments in infrastructure in rural and northern Ontario are vital to successful, sustainable communities and their economies.
Today, Tim Louis, Member of Parliament for Kitchener-Conestoga, on behalf of the Honourable Maryam Monsef, Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Rural Economic Development; the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure; and His Worship Les Armstrong, Mayor of the Township of Wilmot, announced funding for the improvement of road and bridge infrastructure in Western Ontario. Several communities in Western Ontario will benefit from 11 road and bridge projects which will increase road safety and reliability, improve the flow of traffic, and help prevent future flooding in rural communities. Investing in these projects will not only increase safety for drivers, but also for cyclists and pedestrians. In Wilmot, for example, a one-lane bridge will be replaced with a two-lane concrete bridge which will remove height and weight restrictions, reduce risk of flooding, and increase traffic circulation. The project will include building a new foundation, abutments, and superstructure with a reinforced concrete deck and barrier walls; reconstructing roadway approaches; and applying erosion and sediment control measures. Of the 11 projects, one project in Chippewas of Nawash Unceded First Nation, will replace several culverts, preventing road washouts and increasing the service life of the connected roadway. This project will include cleaning and regrading ditches, relocating utilities, and applying measures to prevent erosion. The Government of Canada is investing more than $13.2 million in these 11 projects through the Rural and Northern Communities Infrastructure Stream (RNIS) of the Investing in Canada plan. The Government of Ontario is contributing over $7.5 million; while municipalities and a First Nation community are contributing over $4.3 million.

Quick Facts

Through the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities.
$2 billion of this funding is supporting infrastructure projects that meet the unique needs of rural and northern communities like facilities to support food security, local access roads and enhanced broadband connectivity.
Ontario is investing $10.2 billion under the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program to improve public transit; community, culture and recreation; green, and rural and northern community infrastructure.
The Rural Economic Development Strategy leverages ongoing federal investments and provides a vision for the future, identifying practical steps to take in the short term, and serving as a foundation to guide further work.
Central to Canada’s Connectivity Strategy are historic new investments that are mobilizing up to $6 billion toward universal connectivity. They include a top-up to the Connect to Innovate Program, a new Universal Broadband Fund, and investments from the Canada Infrastructure Bank.
Across Ontario, the Government of Canada has invested more than $2.5 billion in infrastructure under the Investing in Canada Plan.
On June 3, 2020, Ontario announced it was investing $150 million to launch the Improving Connectivity in Ontario program to fund broadband infrastructure projects in rural, remote and underserved regions of Ontario. This is part of the province's $315 million initiative Up to Speed: Ontario's Broadband and Cellular Action Plan.

BRANTFORD — The health and well-being of Canadians are the top priorities of the governments of Canada and Ontario. But the COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than Canadians' personal health. It is having a profound effect on the economy.
That is why governments have been taking decisive action to support families, businesses and communities, and continue to look ahead to see what more can be done. Strategic investments in modern public transit infrastructure support a healthy environment and play a key role in ensuring Ontarians can get to work and essential services on time, then safely back home at the end of the day. Today, the Honourable Filomena Tassi, Minister of Labour and Member of Parliament for Hamilton West-Ancaster-Dundas, on behalf of the Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities; Will Bouma, Member of Provincial Parliament for Brantford-Brant on behalf of the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure; and his Worship Kevin Davis, Mayor of Brantford, announced funding for four public transit projects in Brantford. The purchase of 21 new buses, 13 conventional and eight para-transit buses, will replace the retiring fleet and offer passengers better service and reduce maintenance costs. In addition, the installation of 31 new fareboxes with smart card technology on buses will allow the city to better monitor ridership of existing routes. New bus pads and shelters will provide riders with safer, fully accessible waiting areas and important upgrades will be made to the transit maintenance facility to ensure the new fleet remains well-maintained and reliable. By upgrading and expanding public transit systems in the city and connecting residents to the essential services they require, residents can get around their communities safely while protecting the environment. The Government of Canada is investing over $5.5 million in these projects through the Public Transit Infrastructure Stream (PTIS) of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Ontario is providing more than $4.6 million to the projects, while the municipality is contributing more than $3.7 million.

Quick Facts

Through the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities.
$28.7 billion of this funding is supporting public transit projects, including $5 billion available for investment through the Canada Infrastructure Bank. 
Across Ontario, the Government of Canada has invested more than $2.5 billion in infrastructure under the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan.
Across the province, Ontario is investing more than $7.3 billion in public transit infrastructure over 10 years through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program.

Ontario Makes it Easier for Truck Drivers to get Tested for COVID-19
Pilot program designed to help stop the spread and protect public health

July  8, 2020  9:00 A.M.

Ministry of Transportation


TORONTO - The Ontario government is piloting a new system that will make it easier for truck drivers to access COVID-19 testing through a partnership with DriverCheck. This is part of the government's efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19 and protect public health across the province.
""Expanding access to testing will help keep our truck drivers safe as they move essential goods throughout Ontario and across the border,"" said Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation. ""We thank Ontario's truck drivers for everything they do to keep goods moving so that families have access to the goods they rely on every day.""  The pilot program will allow truck drivers to access voluntary testing on a first-come, first-served basis at locations where there is high volume truck traffic, including Kitchener and Ayr, as well as a mobile option. DriverCheck will roll out the project in phases beginning July 8 until September 8, 2020. DriverCheck is private sector company that currently administers drug and alcohol testing for the trucking industry.  ""With this pilot project for truck drivers, we will be able to find cases faster, intervene earlier, reduce the spread and save lives,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""As the province carefully reopens, it is critical that we all continue to follow public health advice such as practicing physical distancing, wearing a face covering when physical distancing is a challenge, and washing your hands thoroughly and frequently.""

Quick Facts

Testing will be available at a DriverCheck clinic in Kitchener beginning July 8, 2020, at a truck stop in Ayr beginning July 14, 2020, and at a mobile option at select locations throughout the pilot period.
Ontario has also released a 511 app that provides up-to-date information for truck drivers during COVID-19. The app is available for free on the App Store and Google Play.
Every year, $1.26 trillion worth of goods are moved by trucks on Ontario’s roads.

Proposed Bill Would Provide Flexibility to Address the Ongoing Threat of COVID-19

July  7, 2020  2:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Today, the Ontario government introduced proposed legislation that, if passed, would give the province the necessary flexibility to address the ongoing risks and effects of the COVID-19 outbreak. The proposed legislation is part of the government's plan for the continued safe and gradual reopening of the province once the declaration of emergency ends.
Details about the proposed legislation were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Solicitor General Sylvia Jones. ""If passed, the proposed legislation would allow us to chart a responsible path to economic reopening and recovery without putting all the progress we've made in fighting this virus at risk,"" said Premier Ford. ""Even as we continue certain emergency orders under the proposed legislation to protect public health, we will always be a government accountable to the people of Ontario. That's why I will ensure ongoing updates are provided and that a report is tabled within four months of the anniversary of this proposed Act coming into force."" ""While the declaration of emergency may come to an end shortly, the risk posed by COVID-19 is likely to be with us for some time to come,"" said Solicitor General Sylvia Jones. ""This new legislation would provide the government with the necessary flexibility to ensure select tools remain in place to protect vulnerable populations, such as seniors, and respond to this deadly virus."" The Reopening Ontario (A Flexible Response to COVID-19) Act, 2020 would, if passed, ensure important measures remain in place to address the threat of COVID-19 once the provincial declaration of emergency has ended. Specifically, the legislation would: Continue emergency orders in effect under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act (EMCPA) under the new legislation for an initial 30 days.Allow the Lieutenant Governor in Council to further extend these orders for up to 30 days at a time, as required to keep Ontarians safe.Allow the Lieutenant Governor in Council to amend certain emergency orders continued under the EMCPA if the amendment relates to:labour redeployment or workplace and management rules;closure of places and spaces or regulation of how businesses and establishments can be open to provide goods or services in a safe manner;compliance with public health advice; orrules related to gatherings and organized public events.Not allow new emergency orders to be created.Allow emergency orders to be rescinded when it is safe to do so.The ability to extend and amend orders under the new legislation would be limited to one year, unless extended by the Ontario legislature. Appropriate oversight and transparency would be ensured through regular, mandated reporting that provides the rationale for the extension of any emergency order. The legislation would include the same types of provisions on offences and penalties as set out under the EMCPA to address non-compliance with orders.

Quick Facts

The termination of the provincial emergency declaration under the EMCPA, or the passage of the proposed Act, would not preclude a head of council of a municipality from declaring under the EMCPA that an emergency exists in any part of the municipality or from continuing such a declaration.
The termination of the provincial emergency declaration under the EMCPA, or the passage of the proposed Act, would not preclude the exercise of the powers under the Health Protection and Promotion Act by Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health or local medical officers of health.

The Government of Ontario declared a provincial declaration of emergency under s.7.0.1 of the EMCPA on March 17, 2020. The declaration has been extended under s.7.0.7 of the EMCPA and is in place until July 15, 2020, allowing the province to continue to make new emergency orders or amend existing orders under the EMCPA until that date.
On June 26, 2020, emergency orders then in effect that were made under section 7.0.2 of the EMCPA were extended to July 10.
A full list of current emergency orders in effect under the EMCPA can be found on the e-Laws website under the EMCPA and at Ontario.ca/alert.

In Windsor, the purchase of 19 buses will allow the city to replace 16 buses that have exceeded their useful life, while expanding the fleet's capacity by 3 buses to meet system needs. Additionally, the construction and rehabilitation of sidewalks, pathways and bike lanes throughout the city will make it safer and easier for pedestrians and cyclists to commute to their destinations or to directly access public transit. In Tecumseh, the construction of a new 3 kilometre multi-purpose pathway will link the Tecumseh Hamlet to the Tecumseh Transit Service, providing residents with easier access to public transit. Together, these investments will make it easier for residents to get around their community safely while facilitating active transportation. The Government of Canada is investing more than $12.6 million through the Public Transit Infrastructure stream of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Ontario is providing over $10.5 million, while the City of Windsor is contributing more than $25.1 million and the City of Tecumseh is contributing $580,314.

 Ontario Passes Legislation to Deliver Subways Faster
Building Transit Faster Act Will Accelerate Delivery of Priority Transit Projects, Support Economic Recovery

July  7, 2020 12:30 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO ― Ontario is building a modern, reliable and sustainable transit system for the 21st century that will get people moving, reduce congestion, and drive economic growth and job creation. Today, Bill 171, the Building Transit Faster Act, 2020, was passed by the Ontario legislature.
The legislation, once in force, enables the province to expedite the process of building Ontario's four priority transit projects, which will get people to where they want to go, reduce congestion, and drive economic growth and job creation. The projects include the all-new Ontario Line, the Yonge North Subway Extension to Markham and Richmond Hill, the improved three-stop Scarborough Subway Extension, and the Eglinton Crosstown West Extension to Pearson airport. ""Getting more transit built faster will help reduce gridlock, deliver a modern rapid transit system for the province and become a major contributor to our economic recovery,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""These four priority transit projects will create thousands of jobs, provide more housing options for people, and open up countless opportunities for businesses throughout the Greater Toronto Area and beyond."" ""During consultations and throughout debate, we heard a common theme from a wide range of people who reinforced how important it is to not only build transit quickly, but to also get it right,"" said Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation. ""That is why we've focused solely on eliminating the roadblocks that cause unnecessary delays, so we can deliver these major transit projects as quickly and cost effectively as possible."" This legislation supports Premier Ford's ""New Subway Transit Plan for the GTA"" ― representing the largest subway expansion in Canadian history. The legislation, once in force, will expedite the planning, design and construction process for the four priority subway projects by: Enabling relocation of utilities more efficiently, while treating businesses fairly, and ensuring costs are not passed on to consumers;Better enabling the assembly of land required to construct stations, conduct tunneling and prepare sites, while treating property owners fairly;Ensuring timely access to municipal services and rights-of-way;Allowing the province to conduct due diligence work and remove physical barriers with appropriate notification to property owners; and,Ensuring nearby developments or construction projects are coordinated so they do not cause delays.""Now that legislation has passed, we continue to call on the federal government to come to the table and fund at least 40 per cent of these nationally-significant subway projects that will provide a modern, efficient rapid transit system, benefiting all transit riders and taxpayers,"" said Kinga Surma, Associate Minister of Transportation (GTA). ""With the passage of this bill, we can get shovels in the ground sooner and get skilled people back to work as we restart the economy and recover from COVID-19."" ""The passage of this legislation gets us closer to building much-needed transit infrastructure to reduce congestion and contribute to the economic recovery and renewal of our province,"" said Laurie Scott, Minister of Infrastructure. ""We are committed to fulfilling our promise to get people where they want to go when they want to get there."" Working together with its municipal and federal partners on priority transit projects, the government is building a world-class rapid transit system and developing transit-oriented communities with a greater variety of affordable housing options.

Quick Facts

Ontario signed preliminary agreements with the City of Toronto and the Region of York, laying the foundation for continued collaboration towards the shared goal of the accelerated delivery of the four priority transit projects.
The Business Cases for the four priority transit projects, published by Metrolinx, demonstrate how, once complete, the subway plan will provide improved connections with other transit systems across the network, congestion relief on roadways, and better connections to jobs.
For example, the 15.5 km Ontario Line will provide 154,000 more people with walking distance access to rapid transit and see 389,000 daily boardings, with 53,000 more jobs accessible within a 45-minute transit commute for Toronto residents.

The Scarborough Subway Extension, an approximately 8 km long extension of the Toronto Transit Commission’s Bloor Danforth Line 2 from the existing terminus Kennedy Station, will provide 38,000 more people with walking distance access to rapid transit and see 105,000 daily boardings.
The Eglinton Crosstown West Extension will extend the Eglinton Crosstown Light Rail Transit (LRT) project by 9.2 km from Mount Dennis Station to Renforth Drive, and will see a 23 per cent increase in weekday boardings on the Mississauga Transitway and eastward section of the Crosstown LRT, with 31,000 more jobs within a 10-minute walk to a station and a total of 37,000 daily boardings expected.
Ontario is using a P3 model to deliver these projects, to achieve greater efficiency and cost effectiveness.

 Building Transit Faster Act: Removing Unnecessary Delays


July  7, 2020 12:30 P.M.

Office of the Premier


Bill 171, the Building Transit Faster Act, 2020 targets steps in the planning, design and construction process that have unnecessarily delayed major projects in the past. The legislation, once in force, will remove roadblocks and give the province the tools needed for Metrolinx and Infrastructure Ontario to deliver the following four priority transit projects faster:
Ontario Line Subway with 15 stations. The 15.5 km Ontario Line will run between Exhibition/Ontario Place through downtown Toronto to the Ontario Science Centre, bringing rapid transit to neighbourhoods such as Liberty Village and Flemingdon Park. It will help address overcrowding and provide needed relief on the TTC's Line 1 and Bloor-Yonge station.Scarborough Subway Extension with three stations. The nearly 8 km extension of TTC's Line 2 (Bloor-Danforth), from the existing Kennedy Station northeast to McCowan Road/Sheppard Avenue, will improve transit access to the residents of Scarborough.Yonge North Subway Extension with five stations. The 7.4 km extension of TTC's Line 1 (Yonge-University) will connect north from Finch Station to Highway 7. The line will pass through the City of Toronto into York Region, passing along the boundary of Markham and Vaughan into Richmond Hill.Eglinton Crosstown West Extension with multiple stops along the Eglinton West corridor. The western extension of the Eglinton Crosstown LRT (future Line 5) will increase connectivity along Eglinton Avenue from the future Mount Dennis station to Renforth Drive. Ultimately, through future phases of this project, the province is committed to establishing connectivity with Pearson International Airport.The legislation, once in force, will help get transit built faster by Enabling relocation of utilities more efficiently while treating businesses fairly, and ensuring costs are not passed on to consumers.Allow for Metrolinx to require a utility company to relocate its infrastructure within a prescribed timeframe. Introduce a clear process for managing disputes and allow Metrolinx to seek compensation from a utility company if timelines are not met.This is similar to the process used for highway projects.Amendments to the Ontario Energy Board Act, 1998 will prohibit the Ontario Energy Board from allowing provincially regulated utilities (electricity and natural gas) to pass compensation costs incurred from delays on to ratepayers.Better enabling the assembly of land required to construct transit projects, while still treating property owners fairly.Currently, redundant steps require the province to repeatedly demonstrate the need for land related to infrastructure projects one at a time.This will remove Hearings of Necessity for any property required to deliver the four priority transit projects and avoid unnecessary delays.The province will continue to treat people fairly and compensate people whose properties are required.The legislation would include provisions to allow the Minister of Transportation to establish an alternate streamlined process for receiving and considering comments from landowners about the proposed land assembly.For municipal properties needed, municipalities will be given reasonable time limits for internal review to help keep the process on schedule.Ensuring timely access to municipal services and rights-of-way.The government will continue to work closely with municipalities, including the City of Toronto, to negotiate and secure permits.In cases where an agreement cannot be reached, the Minister of Transportation can use a new legislative provision to issue an order that outlines the terms and conditions under which Metrolinx could use or modify a municipal road or service, if needed.The government will remain committed to working in partnership with municipalities and reducing the disruption to local communities as much as possible throughout the construction process.As outlined in Provincial Statements of Intent with the City of Toronto and York Region, the government intends to work in collaboration with municipalities to develop and facilitate streamlined processes to get the necessary permits and approvals to build transit faster.  Further details of how all parties commit to engage and collaborate will be outlined in future downstream agreements under the transit partnerships. Agreements with the City of Toronto, York Region and the province, will ensure the partners continue to collaborate and work effectively together to delivery Ontario's historic 'New Subway Transit Plan for the GTA.' Allowing the province to conduct due diligence work and remove physical barriers, such as trees, with appropriate notification to property owners.Anyone entering private property will be required to provide notice, abide by time of day restrictions and show identification.Similar provisions exist for highway projects.Ensuring nearby developments or construction projects do not interfere with or delay the four priority subway projects.A permit will be required to construct or change any building, structure, road or underground utility infrastructure. A permit will also be required to perform any dewatering or excavation near a subway corridor, in addition to existing requirements.This will apply to new and some existing developments. For existing approved developments that are identified as potential conflicts, there will be at least six months of negotiation before a permit will be required.This will give the province the ability to coordinate activities in and around the subway corridors and stations and manage the timing of construction activities to prioritize the subway projects.The province will continue to work with partners to implement these measures.

Government Proposes Made-in-Ontario Plan for Growth, Renewal and Economic Recovery
Measures Would Help Deliver Critical Infrastructure Projects Faster

July  6, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Government of Ontario has developed a made-in-Ontario plan for growth, renewal and economic recovery. This plan includes measures that would make it easier and faster to build provincial highways, major transit infrastructure projects and quality, affordable housing, while ensuring there are meaningful opportunities for community consultation and input.
Details were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation, and Kinga Surma, Associate Minister of Transportation (GTA). ""The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant hardship for individuals, families, and businesses throughout the province. We're going to need everyone's help to rebuild the province and get people back to work,"" said Premier Ford. ""Through these proposed initiatives, we will start Ontario down the road to recovery by getting critical infrastructure projects built faster, creating jobs in communities across the province."" As part of the government's plan, the province is proposing to accelerate key provincial highway construction and priority transit projects by establishing an exemption from the Hearing of Necessity process. Provincial Hearings of Necessity occur approximately 5-10 times per year on average for provincial highway projects. Each hearing adds months of red tape and construction delays for critical provincial infrastructure, costing up to five months for transit projects and up to 12 months for provincial highway projects. ""Communities need reliable transit, transportation and housing as a strong foundation for future economic growth,"" said Minister Mulroney. ""These initiatives would create tens of thousands of new well-paying jobs, make our roads safer, reduce gridlock, and put home ownership within reach of many people across the province."" As part of this plan, the government would also enter into new commercial agreements with partners to build transit-oriented communities. This would allow for the development of more housing around transit in an integrated manner and put more job opportunities within the reach of more people. The measures would also save taxpayers money by having the development industry make direct, significant contributions to the cost of building transit for the benefit of communities, all transit riders, and Ontario taxpayers. ""Instead of building stations in isolation, we will build fully integrated communities,"" said Associate Minister Surma. ""Transit-oriented communities will benefit the Greater Toronto Area by increasing ridership, reducing congestion, providing a mix of housing ― including affordable housing ― and providing critical local services and amenities like daycares and recreational spaces."" These measures would allow the province to more quickly undertake important technical investigations and prepare construction sites, while ensuring meaningful consultation with landowners.

Quick Facts

The province is investing $2.6 billion to expand and repair Ontario’s highways and bridges.

Ontario will continue to collaborate with the City of Toronto and York Region under the historic joint transit partnership agreements and Transit-Oriented Communities Memorandums of Understanding.

Real-Time Courses Make It Easier for People to Get Essential Qualifications

July  3, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO ― As the province safely and gradually reopens, the Ontario government is investing $3 million to provide free online health and safety training for the first time. These virtual courses will make it easier for job seekers and workers to get essential qualifications, while practising physical distancing and preventing the spread of COVID-19.
The announcement was made today by Premier Doug Ford and Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""In this new environment, we need to look for new and innovative ways to deliver services, while keeping people safe and healthy,"" said Premier Ford. ""This virtual approach to safety training will ensure employers and employees have access to the latest information without the need to physically interact with others. In this way, we also reduce the risk of spreading this deadly virus."" Up to 100,000 job seekers can now take free online workplace health and safety training through Employment Ontario. There are 10 courses on offer, which include topics such as infection control, conducting health and safety incident investigations, ladder safety, slips, trips and falls prevention, and preventing workplace violence and harassment. Job seekers should contact an Employment Ontario service provider in their area to enroll. ""This is the first time this type of online safety training has been made available at no cost to people who have lost their jobs and I am confident it will be an effective way to prepare people to rejoin the workforce safely,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""The training is free and accessible from anywhere, so people can learn from their own homes."" In addition, worker and employer members of Joint Health and Safety Committees can now use video conferencing to take training in real-time with qualified instructors from training providers approved by Ontario's Chief Prevention Officer. The training includes sessions on how to establish a Health and Safety Committee, resolving health and safety issues, workplace inspections, and accident investigations. Ontario's Chief Prevention Officer is extending the time for completion of refresher training for more than 8,000 certified committee members whose certification would have expired between February 28 and August 31, 2020. They have until November 30, 2020 to renew their training, which will be easier thanks to new online options.

Quick Facts

Employment Ontario serves more than one million clients per year and has more than 700 service locations across Ontario.
A Joint Health and Safety Committee’s primary role is to identify workplace health and safety issues and bring them to the attention of the employers.

Over the last three years, an average of 37,000 people per year took Joint Health and Safety Committee certification training.

Ontario Salutes the Military for its Critical Work in the Fight Against COVID-19

July  3, 2020 10:30 A.M.

Ministry of Long-Term Care


TORONTO — The Ontario government expressed its gratitude to members of the Canadian Armed Forces who went above and beyond the call of duty to temporarily support high-priority long-term care homes during the height of the COVID-19 outbreak. The final team concludes its work today.  
Under Operation LASER, the Canadian Armed Forces deployed teams consisting of nurses, medical technicians and additional personnel. They have been working in Ontario long-term care homes since April providing staffing support and helping with infection prevention and control, and other duties such as cleaning and food preparation. ""We owe our brave men and women in the Canadian Armed Forces, and the military families who support them, a debt of gratitude for their service to our province during this crisis,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""From providing relief to our frontline workers, to taking care of our loved ones in long-term care homes, they have been there for their fellow Canadians when we needed them most. We hope to find ways in the near future to properly show our thanks for their contributions and for the contributions of all Ontarians who have gone above and beyond these past few months."" Over the course of their mission, the Canadian Armed Forces teams supported the following homes: Orchard Villa, Holland Christian Homes Grace Manor, Altamont Care Community, Eatonville Care Centre, Hawthorne Place Care Centre, Downsview Long Term Care, and Woodbridge Vista Care Community. ""In this time of exceptional need, we are grateful for the support we received from the Canadian Armed Forces teams in our long-term care homes,"" said Dr. Merrilee Fullerton, Minister of Long-Term Care. ""Their experience and expertise in emergency situations have been crucial in fighting this virus and helping to protect our residents and staff in long-term care homes."" ""The Canadian Armed Forces have been tremendous partners in helping support some of the most vulnerable Ontarians during this unprecedented time,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""We are grateful for the support and protection they provided to our long-term care home residents in the midst of our fight against COVID-19."" In May, the Ontario government responded immediately to the findings of the Canadian Armed Forces report. The Ministry of Long-Term Care has been addressing issues around infection control, standards of practice/quality of care, supplies, local practices, communication, staffing and inappropriate behaviour. To-date, the following action has been taken:   Each home identified at that time as high-risk has been inspected or has an inspection underway. Inspections at all the Canadian Armed Forces-supported homes have been completed and have since been expanded with inspectors remaining onsite. Temporary management has been appointed at Altamont Care Community, Camilla Care Community, Orchard Villa, Extendicare Guildwood, River Glen Haven, Downsview Long Term Care, Woodbridge Vista Care Community, Forest Heights and Hawthorne Place Care Centre. Each home identified as high-risk has been required to submit a plan to the ministry that details how they are improving care standards.  Additional measures taken to support staff and residents in long-term care homes include emergency funding, regulatory flexibility, staffing support, expanded testing, direction and guidance on outbreak management, infection prevention, and assistance provided by public hospitals to homes in outbreak. The government recently announced the launch of an independent, non-partisan commission into Ontario's long-term care system beginning in July 2020. Details of the commission are now being finalized, including the terms of reference, membership, leadership of the commission and reporting timelines.

Quick Facts

The number of long-term care homes experiencing a COVID-19 outbreak has decreased from 150 homes (May 25) to 44 (as of July 2), out of a total of 626 homes. This means that more than 90 per cent of homes (582) have no resident cases.

Investment will create six new jobs as province gradually restarts the economy

July  3, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines


SAULT STE. MARIE - The Ontario government is investing $185,425 to help a natural products manufacturer expand operations, meet growing demand for products that will help in the fight against COVID-19, and create six new jobs as the province gradually restarts the economy.
OC Hair Bath & Body Co. will use the funding to purchase new equipment and renovate and expand its facility where it manufactures natural products such as hand sanitizer, soap, shampoo, insect repellent and makeup. The company also provides custom products, labelling and packaging for hospitals, not-for-profits, and businesses, including salons, spas, resorts and health clubs. The funding is delivered through the Northern Ontario Heritage Fund Corporation (NOHFC). ""As the province reopens and the economy recovers, small businesses in the north like OC Hair Bath & Body Co. need our assistance,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines. ""Supporting small businesses is an important part of our government's plan to create more jobs and attract new and expanded investment so northern communities can grow and thrive."" The NOHFC promotes economic development across Northern Ontario by providing financial assistance to projects - big and small, rural and urban - that stimulate growth, job creation and develop a skilled workforce. Since June 2018, the NOHFC has invested more than $176 million in 1,224 projects in Northern Ontario. This has leveraged more than $650 million in investment and created or retained 3,559 jobs. ""OC Hair Bath & Body Co. has grown steadily since its inception,"" said Ross Romano, MPP for Sault Ste. Marie. ""And now, with our investment, we are helping the company further expand operations and increase revenues, creating employment and prosperity for the people of Sault Ste. Marie."" The Ontario government is getting more people back to work and more recreational activities open by moving forward with a regional approach to Stage 2 of reopening the province. For a full list of spaces and services allowed to open in regions that have entered Stage 2, please visit ontario.ca/reopen.

Innovative training project will prepare up to 100 job seekers for construction careers

July  3, 2020  9:30 A.M.

Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development


GEORGINA - The Ontario government is helping more people find a career in the trades and getting shovels in the ground faster on affordable housing projects by investing more than $4 million to support a local construction training program.
The program will be run through Skills Advance Ontario, which connects job seekers with the sector-specific employment and training, and employers with the services they need to recruit the right workers. Led by Georgina Trades Training Inc. (GTTI), the project will prepare up to 100 job seekers for construction-related professions and use the skills learned to help build new modular housing units. The training facility will be located in the Town of Georgina. ""This project shows how our government is partnering with local communities to address economic challenges and help more people find work in the trades,"" said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""Many communities have been hit hard by the pandemic, and as we continue to reopen Ontario's economy, effective training initiatives will be an essential part of our efforts to get everyone back on the job. ""By providing funding for this project in Georgina, we're giving young people a chance to learn new skills and start careers in the skilled trades,"" said Caroline Mulroney, York-Simcoe MPP and Minister of Transportation and Francophone Affairs. ""This project will provide good jobs, spur economic development and provide affordable housing in our region."" ""As a founding partner of GTTI, The Town looks forward to continuing this partnership with the development of the Skilled Trades Institute,"" said Margaret Quirk, Mayor of Georgina. ""This is a great opportunity with far-reaching economic and social benefits in providing post-secondary opportunities closer to home for residents, addressing skilled trades shortages while creating affordable housing for those who need it."" ""Acute shortages in the skilled trades have become a serious problem for Ontario's economy that requires bold, creative thinking to come up with solutions,"" said John De Faveri, Chair of GTTI. ""Not only are we attracting and training post-secondary school graduates as well as multi-barrier candidates to consider a career in skilled trades, we are at the same time creating a unique model for municipalities that clearly speaks to affordable housing."" Over the coming weeks and months, Georgina Trades Training Inc. will begin hiring staff for the project and finalize the training curriculum. The start of training is projected for January 2021.

Quick Facts

The Town of Georgina is supporting the project with $2.6 million in funding and is leasing the land that the housing units will be built on as part of the training project.
The new project is one of 50 current SkillsAdvance Ontario projects across the province. Five of these projects are dedicated to skills training in the construction sector.
The Employment Ontario network offers a range of services and supports that help businesses find talent and connect job seekers to training and job opportunities.

Ontario Supporting Restaurants as Province Safely Reopens
New and Amended Emergency Orders Will Help Establishments Expand Patios Faster

July  3, 2020  7:00 A.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government is helping restaurant and bar owners reopen and safely serve more customers by issuing a new emergency order and amending another under s.7.0.2 (4) of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, which will allow municipalities to quickly pass temporary bylaws for the creation and extension of patios and allow covered outdoor dining areas to serve customers.
This decision was made in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health to keep the people of Ontario safe as the province continues to recover and resume activities as part of Ontario's Framework for Reopening the Province. ""Businesses across the province are demonstrating that we can still enjoy our beautiful Ontario summer while protecting the health and safety of their patrons,"" said Premier Ford. ""Restaurants and bars are an important part of our economy, and a great driver of employment. I am proud to say that we will continue to support them as our province reopens and recovers."" Under the Planning Act, the process to pass temporary use bylaws to create or extend a patio could take several weeks or more. As restaurants are currently only permitted to host dine-in guests on outdoor patios under Stage 2, this exemption under the emergency order will cut red tape and reduce the process time for passing these bylaws to a matter of days. Municipalities would still be responsible for compliance activities and ensuring proper health and safety practices, like proper physical distancing. The government also amended an emergency order to clarify that outdoor dining areas can open if they have a roof, canopy, tent, awning or other covering. At least two full sides of the outdoor dining area must be open to the outdoors and must not be substantially blocked in any way. If the outdoor dining area has a retractable roof, the roof must be fully open and at least one full side must be open to the outdoors and must not be substantially blocked in any way. Most of Ontario has moved into Stage 2 recovery, except for the Municipality of Leamington and the Town of Kingsville, which remain in Stage 1. On June 24, Ontario announced the extension of the Declaration of Emergency to July 15, allowing the province to continue to make or amend emergency orders under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act. The government continues to review all these emergency orders to determine when and if it is safe to amend or lift them as restrictions are eased and more places in the province reopen in a safe and measured way. A full list of emergency orders can be found on the e-Laws website under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act and at Ontario.ca/alert.

New Investment Will Be Used to Develop Long-Term, Innovative Housing Solutions

July  2, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government is providing municipalities and urban Indigenous community partners with an additional $150 million to continue to protect vulnerable people from COVID-19 by improving homeless shelters and creating opportunities for longer-term housing. This investment more than doubles the funding currently flowing to local municipal service managers and urban Indigenous program administrators through the Social Services Relief Fund.
Details were provided today by Premier Doug Ford and Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. ""We are standing shoulder to shoulder with our municipal and Indigenous community partners to ensure our most vulnerable citizens are protected during these difficult times,"" said Premier Ford. ""Today's investment builds on our collective efforts to help people get back on their feet quickly and recover from this global crisis. We will continue to be a champion for our municipal partners with the federal government to ensure a strong recovery for communities across the province."" Municipalities and urban Indigenous community partners will be able to use this funding for long-term, innovative housing solutions resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak. They can renovate shelters or purchase new facilities that will help with physical distancing in the short term and support longer-term, more sustainable solutions to homelessness. In addition, this funding could also be used to provide vulnerable people with food, shelter and supplies. The funding is another way that Ontario is coming to the table to support municipalities as it continues to work with provincial partners and the federal government on municipal supports through the federal government's proposed Safe Restart Framework. ""We know that municipal and Indigenous partners are facing extraordinary challenges due to this global pandemic,"" said Minister Clark. ""That's why we continue to step up to provide financial support and other measures to help our local partners. This investment is another step our government is taking to protect our most vulnerable, but we know more needs to be done. We continue to work closely with our federal and municipal partners to ensure communities across Ontario have the support they need."" With this additional funding, the government is providing municipal service managers and urban Indigenous program administrators with $350 million through the Social Services Relief Fund. This builds on the support being delivered as part of the COVID-19 Action Plan to Protect Vulnerable Ontarians. The action plan provides enhanced screening and testing in high-risk settings such as shelters and homes, including for those with developmental disabilities, and provides personal protective equipment and training so staff will know what to do in the event of an outbreak. ""The Government's Social Services Relief Fund was an immediate response to COVID-19 related municipal costs when it was announced in March. The initial $148 million literally saved lives in communities across Ontario,"" said Jamie McGarvey, President of the Association of Municipalities of Ontario. ""The additional $150 million announced today will help offset the added costs of addressing homelessness and protecting the most vulnerable from COVID-19.""

Quick Facts

In March, Ontario announced an initial investment of $148 million to support municipalities, food banks, homeless shelters and individuals. This funding is already helping individuals and families in financial crisis. 
Another $52 million expanded the Emergency Assistance program administered through Ontario Works for people in emergency situations and made more support available to vulnerable social assistance recipients to meet a broad range of needs.

Ministry of Infrastructure


THE NATION — The governments of Canada and Ontario recognize the different ways that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted smaller and rural communities across the province. Both governments are making strategic investments in infrastructure to meet the specific needs of rural and northern Ontario municipalities and help them strengthen their local economies.
Today, the Honourable Francis Drouin, Member of Parliament for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, on behalf of the Honourable Maryam Monsef, Canada's Minister of Women and Gender Equality and Rural Economic Development; and the Honourable Steve Clark, Ontario's Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing and Member of Provincial Parliament for Leeds-Grenville-Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes on behalf of Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure, announced funding for five road and bridge projects in Eastern Ontario. They were joined by Mayor François St-Amour, The Nation Municipality; Mayor Nancy Peckford, Municipality of North Grenville; and Frank Prevost, Warden, United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry. In The Nation, the Touchette Bridge will be rehabilitated, replacing the majority of its parts, including the floor beams, the deck, and the steel stringers. These upgrades will extend the lifespan of the bridge while increasing the flow of traffic, allowing motorists to get where they need to go faster. In addition, Mississippi Mills will see its Levi Bridge replaced, upgrading from a one-lane to a new two-lane bridge with new railings and guardrails, making it safer for drivers and pedestrians. The remaining projects will see upgrades to major roads in each community. North Grenville will expand approximately 1.15 kilometers of County Road 43 from two to four lanes, adding new bike lanes and crosswalks in support of active transportation. Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry will rehabilitate nearly 1.25 kilometers of County Road 2 leading to Morrison, improving the sidewalk entrances to local businesses to support economic growth. Finally, Cornwall's reconstruction of a portion of Lemay Street, which includes new bike lanes, sidewalks and a roundabout, will increase the safety of pedestrians and will improve the city's active transportation routes.  The Government of Canada is investing over $9 million in these projects through the Rural and Northern Communities Infrastructure Stream of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Ontario is contributing more than $6.5 million for these important infrastructure projects in these communities while municipalities are contributing over $3 million in total towards the projects. The governments of Canada and Ontario are working in collaboration with their partners to support jobs, improve communities and build confidence as we safely and sustainably restore economic growth.

Quick Facts

Through the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities.
$2 billion of this funding is supporting infrastructure projects that meet the unique needs of rural and northern communities like facilities to support food security, local access roads and enhanced broadband connectivity.
Ontario is investing $10.2 billion under the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program to improve public transit; community, culture and recreation; green, and rural and northern community infrastructure.
The Rural Economic Development Strategy leverages ongoing federal investments and provides a vision for the future, identifying practical steps to take in the short term, and serving as a foundation to guide further work.
Central to Canada’s Connectivity Strategy are historic new investments that are mobilizing up to $6 billion toward universal connectivity. They include a top-up to the Connect to Innovate Program, a new Universal Broadband Fund, and investments from the Canada Infrastructure Bank.
On June 3, 2020, Ontario announced it was investing $150 million to launch the Improving Connectivity in Ontario program to fund broadband infrastructure projects in rural, remote and underserved regions of Ontario. This is part of the province's $315 million initiative Up to Speed: Ontario’s Broadband and Cellular Action Plan.

Government Seeks Input to Help Improve Elevator Safety and Availability

July  2, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Ministry of Government and Consumer Services


TORONTO - The Ontario government is launching consultations in an effort to improve elevator safety, performance, and availability in multi-storey buildings. The province is seeking input on proposed regulatory changes under the Technical Standards and Safety Act, 2000. These new rules would help to ensure that elevators are well-maintained and meet updated safety requirements.
""Ontarians living and working in high-rises want elevators to be better maintained with fewer breakdowns and less downtime, and they want more information about elevator disruptions,"" said Lisa Thompson, Minister of Government and Consumer Services. ""Long wait times and elevator outages have been a long-standing and frustrating issue for people, particularly those with accessibility needs. We are responding to the concerns of the Auditor General of Ontario and, at the same time, we want to assure all Ontarians that they have a voice in helping us create stronger rules to protect them."" The government is working with the TSSA to enhance elevator safety and availability, and help consumers, including those with accessibility needs to make more informed choices as homebuyers and renters. As part of these enhancements, the TSSA would be required to publish elevator outage data for residential buildings online, providing valuable information that will help consumers make better-informed decisions about their future homes. Ontarians can share their input online until August 4, 2020.

Quick Facts

Elevators are among the safest modes of transportation. The TSSA’s annual safety data shows the number of elevator incidents in Ontario is consistently low each year, with an average of 9.41 injuries/million people/year (2008-2019).
There are approximately 58,700 elevators in Ontario, of which almost 20,000 are located in residential buildings. 
The Auditor General of Ontario’s 2018 Value for Money Audit and the TSSA Elevator Availability Study in Ontario authored by former Superior Court Justice Douglas Cunningham, both stated that better enforcement of elevator maintenance requirements may lead to improved safety outcomes.
The TSSA is an independent administrative authority that administers and enforces the Technical Standards and Safety Act, including its regulations related to elevating devices and the certification and training of elevating device mechanics. The TSSA licenses and inspects Ontario’s elevating devices (e.g., elevators, escalators, and lifts).

Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade


TORONTO — Today, Vic Fedeli, Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade issued the following statement on the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA):
""The Ontario government welcomes the implementation of this important trade agreement and looks forward to the greater certainty it provides to help businesses grow and protect jobs across the continent. Nearly one in five Ontario jobs depend on trade, and approximately $400 billion CAD in two-way trade in goods travels across the U.S. and Canadian border in Ontario every year. We know that ensuring strong trade ties is vital to businesses and the communities they support on both sides of the border. Our government's top priority during the negotiations was to protect jobs for the hard-working people of Ontario. I want to thank the leaders and negotiators from all three countries who worked long hours and reached across party lines to secure this critical deal. The economic impact of COVID-19 has demonstrated the need to continue forging mutually beneficial partnerships and ensure Ontario businesses have access to the world's markets. The joint relationship between Ontario and the U.S. has always been strong, and as we proceed on our path to economic recovery it has never been more important to strengthen this relationship for the benefit of businesses, workers, and consumers in both jurisdictions. Our government will continue to support Ontario businesses and Ontario workers, including our aluminum and steel industry, farmers and our vital agri-food sector. The strength of our trading relationship will be integral for these industries over the coming months, and we will continue to take decisive action to put us in a position to reduce risks and provide the fiscal certainty that will see our economies recover faster. Strengthening our unique trading partnership will only ensure that everyday consumers, workers, and businesses can emerge from this period of economic uncertainty in a position of strength. Ontario's commitment to building bridges and not barriers remains unchanged. Today marks an important step that will ensure a prosperous way forward together.""

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Today, Premier Doug Ford issued the following statement to mark Canada Day:
""As we celebrate Canada's 153rd birthday, I want to reflect on a year that has been unlike any other, one of the darkest periods in Ontario's history. The COVID-19 pandemic touched everyone in the province, creating personal and financial hardship and resulting in losses far greater than anyone could have imagined. As a country, as a province and as a people, Canadians have always come together in the face of adversity and worked together to defeat the threats we faced. The past few months have been no exception. We have had each other's backs and stepped up in thousands of ways to combat this threat, support our frontline health care workers, protect our most vulnerable, and do our part to stay home and stop the spread. Hundreds of Ontario businesses retooled their operations, turning Ontario's manufacturing might to make the critical personal protective equipment and medical supplies we need to fight this deadly virus. Ontario's best and brightest minds are leading the country in clinical trials and research for vaccines, treatments, and rapid testing methods to help save lives. Today, we celebrate not only our great country, but all those people who have worked tirelessly to protect us and our families, keep food on our tables, and get us through tough times. Their compassion, generosity, grit, and determination in the face of a global pandemic should make us all proud to be Canadian. In the months ahead, the Ontario spirit will continue to inspire us as we rebuild and ensure our province comes back stronger and more prosperous than ever before. Whether you're celebrating at the cottage, in a park, on a patio or at home this Canada Day, please remember to stay safe and act responsibly by following public health advice. Avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people, stay two metres apart from anyone not in your social circle, wear a mask when physical distancing is a challenge, and wash your hands frequently.

Ontario Updates and Modernizes Regulations and Statutes 
Changes Come into Force on Canada Day

June 30, 2020  9:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


The following legislation and regulation changes will come into effect on July 1, 2020. They are listed by responsible ministry:
Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs To ensure the continued protection of animal health, a regulatory amendment to the Livestock Medicines Act will extend outlet licences for an additional year so they can continue to supply medicines to the farm community. This will ensure uninterrupted licencing of Outlets until a new regulatory regime is put in place. There will be no cost associated with the extension of permanent Class 1 licences to July 31, 2021 for all currently licensed Livestock Medicines Outlets. The licence extension amendment does not apply to Class 2 licences or new Class 1 applicants. In these cases, existing licencing requirements and fees would still apply. Ministry of the Attorney General and Treasury Board Secretariat An amendment to a regulation under the Adjudicative Tribunals Accountability, Governance and Appointments Act will create ""Ontario Land Tribunals."" This new organization will combine the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal, Board of Negotiation, Conservation Review Board, Environmental Review Tribunal and Mining and Lands Tribunal. It will help ensure Ontario's land tribunals have the dedicated support and resources to resolve disputes fairly and faster. Ministry of Colleges and Universities An amendment to the Ontario College of Art & Design University Act would provide the university with full degree-granting authority, including honorary degrees. It would allow the university to award degrees, certificates and diplomas in any and all branches of learning provided they are consistent with the objective of providing advanced education in art and design and supporting teaching, research and professional practice in these fields. Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines As part of its commitment to reducing regulatory burden and red tape for Ontario's electricity sector, the government will repeal the Ontario Clean Energy Benefit Act (OCEBA), revoke two regulations made under the OCEBA and amend the Definitions and Exemptions regulation under the Ontario Energy Board Act to remove reference to the OCEBA. The OCEBA and the associated Ontario Clean Energy Benefit program were established in 2010 to help lower electricity costs for Ontarians through a 10 per cent rebate on the total cost of electricity charges related to electricity consumption on eligible bills. The Ontario Clean Energy Benefit program ended on December 31, 2015 and was replaced by the Ontario Electricity Support Program, which helps reduce electricity costs for low-income households. An amendment to the Energy and Water Efficiency — Appliances and Products regulation (Ontario Regulation 509/18) under the Electricity Act will set or increase minimum energy-performance standards for 10 energy products by: Updating eight products to higher efficiency levels in order to harmonize with current Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) standards. These products include commercial gas storage water heaters; residential gas instantaneous water heaters; commercial gas instantaneous water heaters; residential gas furnaces; commercial gas boilers; commercial oil boilers; residential gas boilers; and gas fireplacesAdding commercial oil-fired storage water heaters, which are currently regulated by NRCan and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to Ontario's regulation, and harmonizing with NRCan and DOE standardsHarmonizing Ontario's efficiency standards for residential windows with Ontario Building Code minimum requirements.Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks In order to provide added flexibility in transit planning — reducing the risk of delays while still providing environmental oversight and consultation with the public and Indigenous communities — the current environmental assessment process will be modified so that construction on the Ontario Line subway project can proceed as quickly as possible and so any significant design changes to the Scarborough and Yonge North subway extensions and the Eglinton Crosstown West extension proceed as efficiently as possible. As part of the government's efforts to encourage brownfield redevelopment and put vacant lands back to good use, regulatory amendments under the Environmental Protection Act will clarify rules for developing sites where groundwater is not to be used for drinking water. The government is bringing forward smart, sensible solutions to keep our communities healthier and safer, while creating an open-for-business environment, by supporting the waste management sector through a regulatory amendment to the Environmental Protection Act. This amendment clarifies that waste transportation systems, which are already exempt under Ontario Regulation 101/94, are not required to use the Environment Activity and Sector Registry. The government is modernizing programs and services and lowering costs for the people of Ontario by allowing producers to find new and innovative ways to reduce costs, manage their products and packaging more efficiently and reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills. The Batteries regulation (Ontario Regulation 30/20) under the Resource Recovery and Circular Economy Act makes battery producers fully responsible for managing their products. This new regulation will give them more control over how they manage their waste and dispose of batteries safely. As part of our commitment to support a healthy environment and a healthy economy, these changes will ensure we are maintaining strong enforcement and environmental compliance while making Ontario open for business.  The government is updating the almost 50-year-old environmental assessment program to support building safer and stronger communities. As part of these efforts, the ministry will remove the duplicative requirements for forestry activities in the Declaration Order under the Environmental Assessment Act. Forestry activities will continue under the Crown Forest Sustainability Act, which will help ensure the government is able to protect the environment while allowing the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry to be the primary source of direction for forest management in Ontario. The temporary approach for forestry operations on Crown land under the Endangered Species Act has been extended for an additional year. This will maintain the current requirements for the forestry sector by helping to avoid additional regulatory burden and economic strain while a long-term approach is being considered. Ministry of Finance Regulation amendments under the Investment Management Corporation of Ontario Act will enable the Investment Management Corporation of Ontario (IMCO) to continue to manage the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board's (WSIB) pension assets when the WSIB plan becomes a jointly sponsored pension plan (JSPP). It will also enable certain other broader public sector JSPPs to use IMCO to manage their pension assets in the future. Further amendments to the Pensions Benefits Act, Regulation 909 (General) will help facilitate an efficient and effective pension regulatory system in Canada. Ontario has recently signed the 2020 Agreement Respecting Multi-Jurisdictional Pension Plans (MJPPA) along with the federal government and other provinces. As of July 1, 2020, this new agreement will replace a prior agreement from 2016 and will simplify and clarify the supervision of pension plans with members in more than one jurisdiction. Ministry of Health The government is expanding Ontario's newborn screening program to include screening tests for Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Hurler Disease and its variants — becoming the first province in Canada to offer screening for these serious diseases. A regulatory amendment to the Laboratory and Specimen Collection Centre Licensing Act will add mucopolysaccharidosis type 1 and spinal muscular atrophy to the list of Newborn Screening Tests and permit midwives to order them. A complementary amendment to the Health Insurance Act will add the Newborn Screening Tests for mucopolysaccharidosis type 1 and spinal muscular atrophy as an insured service to the Schedule of Benefits for Laboratory Services. Babies across the province will be able to receive earlier diagnosis and interventions for these diseases so they can be as healthy as possible. The government continues its comprehensive approach to protecting youth from vaping. As part of the Smoke-Free Ontario Act, certain provisions coming into force on July 1 will: Restrict the retail sale of flavoured vapour products to Specialty Vape Stores and Cannabis Retail Stores, except for menthol, mint and tobacco flavoursRequire Specialty Vape Stores to ensure that indoor vapour product displays and promotions are not visible from outside their storesRestrict the retail sale of vapour products with high nicotine concentrations (>20 mg/ml) to Specialty Vape Stores.Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development As part of the government's commitment to keeping workers safe, an amendment to the Occupational Health and Safety Act will add or revise occupational exposure limits or listings for 36 substances, including warfarin, furfural and ethylene glycol. As of July 1, regulations under the Ontario Immigration Act have been amended. More eligible occupations in the manufacturing sector will be added to the In-Demand Stream of the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program's Employer Job Offer Category. Also, applicants to this stream will no longer have to demonstrate they have settlement funds. Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing Ontario's Community Housing Renewal Strategy outlines the government's plan to transform a fragmented and inefficient system into one that is more streamlined, sustainable and ready to help those who need it most. One of the early steps in the strategy was to make rent more predictable by simplifying rent calculations. A new regulation and regulation amendment under the Housing Services Act will make calculating rent-geared-to-income (RGI) faster for housing providers and easier for social housing tenants to predict and understand. This includes: Moving to an annual calculation based on 30 per cent of adjusted family net incomeSimplified deductions on employment incomeExempting income earned by full-time studentsMinimum rent amountsSetting effective dates of rent increases and decreases.Under the new rules, a household will remain eligible for RGI assistance for a longer period of time while paying market rent and household members will generally be required to file an income tax return. Changes were also made to align the province's Portable Housing Benefit Framework with changes to the calculation of RGI assistance. In spring 2019, the government launched the More Homes, More Choice plan with changes to make it faster and easier to build housing, including rental housing, and to build the right types of homes in the right places. A regulatory amendment under the Residential Tenancies Act will modernize outdated practices, such as the need to submit CD-ROMs with certain Landlord and Tenant Board applications, making it easier to be a landlord. Five Planning Act regulations are being revoked to remove the need for provincial approvals of highly technical local planning matters in unincorporated areas of northeastern and northwestern Ontario. Amendments to regulations under the Planning Act will enable 16 northern communities to move forward with local planning decisions faster. The following towns, townships and municipalities will be exempt from the requirement to obtain the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing's approval of official plan amendments: TownsGore BayHearstSpanishTownshipsThe ArchipelagoArmourAssiginackBillingsBurpee and MillsCockburn IslandMattice-Val CotéNipissingO'ConnorTehkummahMunicipalitiesCentral ManitoulinGordon/Barrie IslandOliver Paipoonge The Town of Spanish has been delegated 'approval authority' for plans of subdivision/condominium in the municipality. Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry Changes to the Independent Forest Audit regulation will improve transparency and provide time and cost savings for industry and government. These changes include: Allowing final audit reports and action plans to be posted online instead of requiring them to be reported to the Legislative AssemblyEstablishing a 10-year audit period with the possibility of a two-year extension and providing greater flexibility to schedule audits.The Nurseries regulation under the Forestry Act has been identified as outdated and no longer in use. Tree seedlings for forest renewal on Crown land have been produced exclusively by private growers for many years, so this unnecessary regulation will be revoked.  A number of changes to the four Forest Manuals regulated under the Crown Forest Sustainability Act will allow for more effective consultation and reduce workload, time and costs in the preparation and implementation of forest management plans, while maintaining rigorous oversight and sustainable management of Ontario's Crown forests. A regulation under the Aggregate Resources Act will be amended to continue to outline requirements for forestry aggregate pits in the proposed revised Forest Manuals. This will simplify how the requirements are identified for forestry aggregate pits to support people engaged in forest operations. Ministry of Transportation Ontario is committed to making life more affordable for people and families in response to COVID-19. That is why there will be no increase to driver and commercial vehicle fees that would have taken effect July 1, 2020. The government is making historic investments in our provincial highways in order to reduce congestion and make our roads safer. Following a successful eight-year pilot, single-occupant use of provincial High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes by licenced taxicabs and airport limousines will be made permanent by removing the sunset provision through an amendment to the Highway Traffic Act, Ontario Regulation 620/05 — High Occupancy Vehicle Lanes. Making the exemption permanent will encourage more efficient use of the HOV transportation network by allowing taxis and limousines to reach their next passenger more quickly and support accessibility for people who cannot or choose not to drive. Various changes to regulations under the Highway Traffic Act will: Expand the type of off-road vehicles permitted on roads to include off-road motorcycles, dirt bikes and extreme-terrain vehicles, commonly known as ARGOs. This will allow users to access more trail networks across the province by lifting some of the existing restrictions. These new off-road vehicles will be required to follow most of the same operating rules as existing off-road vehicles permitted on roads, including:G2/M2 licencing minimumRegistration and insuranceSpeed under 50km/h for roadsAlways riding on the shoulder in the same direction as traffic or, when unavailable, right-most portion of the roadwayThese changes will provide for increased regulatory flexibility, allow greater municipal choice over operation on municipal roads and transfer regulation-making authority from the Lieutenant Governor in Council to the MinisterMoving forward with annual inspections for mobile cranes and concrete pumps. An inspection must be completed at a licenced Motor Vehicle Inspection Station by January 1, 2021 and July 1, 2021 dependent on vehicle category. The Ministry of Transportation will continue to work with industry and ministerial partners on long-term solutions to address concerns related to qualified technicians and appropriate inspection frequencyImplement an additional licensing option for full Class G licence holders or higher (Class A, B, C, D, E, F) wishing to operate a three-wheeled motorcycle. This option would allow full Class G licence holders or higher to attend a ministry-approved school in the Driver Certification Program, pay the associated fee and complete an approved one-day safety course, including in-class and on-road testing, and receive a restricted three-wheeled motorcycle licence."

June 30, 2020  2:30 P.M.

Ministry of Transportation

Province Promotes Shop Local, Shop Safe and Shop with Confidence Campaign

June 30, 2020 10:30 A.M.

Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade


TORONTO — The Ontario Government is celebrating International Small Business Week with the launch of the ""Shop Local! Shop Safe! Shop with Confidence!"" campaign, encouraging Ontarians to support their local small businesses and to shop safely while doing so.
""The countless stories of success from our diverse small business community is living proof that Ontario is a place to grow and achieve big dreams,"" said Prabmeet Sarkaria, Associate Minister of Small Business. ""All of our small businesses supported the fight against COVID-19, many by closing their doors for several months—now it's our turn to help support their recovery. When Ontarians Shop Local, Shop Safe and Shop with Confidence, we're doing our  part to ensure the future vitality of our main streets, our communities and our province."" The province's campaign asks for mayors, local leaders and groups to support our small businesses by committing on social media to ""Shop Local, Shop Safe, Shop with Confidence,"" while highlighting the best practices put in place by businesses to help keep shoppers safe while ensuring that the reopening of Ontario continues to be a success. For example, the principles of the People Outside Safely Together (POST) Promise encourage small businesses to strictly follow health guidelines and reopen with appropriate measures in place, so consumers can shop safely and with confidence, including:  Washing and sanitizing handsMaintaining physical distancingStaying home if unwellPracticing respiratory etiquetteCleaning and disinfecting regularly   ""The Retail Council of Canada is strengthened by the contributions of our diverse membership, and we're delighted join the Government of Ontario in supporting our main street retail businesses and indeed all retailers across the province,"" said Diane J. Brisebois, President of the Retail Council of Canada. ""'Shop Local, Shop Safe, Shop with Confidence' helps retailers, the province's largest private-sector employers, promote safety for consumers and workplaces, while continuing to help to build strong and vibrant communities all across Ontario.""  The province, in partnership with various health and safety organizations, has also released sector-specific guidelines in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. These documents help workplaces better understand their responsibilities and includes best practices they can use to help them comply with their legal obligation to protect the health and safety of workers.

The Ontario Government reduced the small business Corporate Income Tax rate by 8.7 percent starting January 1, 2020. This will deliver up to $1,500 in annual savings to more than 275,000 businesses.
Ontario’s Small Business Success Strategy, launched prior to COVID-19, identified the need for small businesses across the province to build or enhance their online presence to remain competitive and expand their markets. COVID-19 has further reinforced the need for Ontario small businesses to embrace digital tools, including having online storefronts and expanding them. The Strategy also seeks to promote entrepreneurship in all of Ontario’s diverse communities.
To further support small businesses with physical storefronts impacted by COVID-19 restrictions, Ontario has implemented a Temporary Ban on Commercial Evictions

Provincial Task Force to Look at Improving Safety, Consumer Protections and Industry Standards

June 29, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO ― The Ontario government is establishing a task force to improve provincial oversight of the towing industry. The task force will help develop a regulatory model that will increase safety and enforcement, clarify protections for consumers, improve industry standards and consider tougher penalties for violators. The government is taking this action in response to concerns raised about incidents of criminal activity and violence in the towing industry.
Details were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation, and Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General. ""The party's over for the bad actors who are engaged in violence and criminal activity in the towing industry. We're going to keep working with our police partners to bring these criminals to justice,"" said Premier Ford. ""Setting up this task force will help us bring together experts to develop ways to better protect drivers, operators and inspectors."" The task force will review a number of topics related to the towing industry, which could include provincial oversight of safety, consumer protection, improved industry standards, training and background checks. As part of the review, the task force may consider opportunities for increased protections for consumers against the first-to-scene unethical business practices, insurance savings through a crackdown on insurance fraud rings or improved consumer choice for payments and repairs. The province is also reviewing ways to improve our transportation system by clearing accidents more quickly which would minimize lane reductions and reduce congestion on our highways. ""Most tow truck operators in Ontario are responsible and play a critical role in keeping our roadways safe. However, like all people of Ontario, our government is concerned about the recent reported incidents of violence in the towing industry,"" said Minister Mulroney. ""We are committed to ensuring a higher standard for the tow truck industry and are looking at ways to provide greater oversight of the industry to keep our roads and highways among the safest in North America."" ""When Ontarians are stranded on the side of the road, they need to know their calls will be answered by towing service providers who act safely, ethically and within the law,"" said Solicitor General Jones. ""The task force will help us determine tougher standards for the industry as part of our government's commitment to build safer communities."" Membership of the task force will include representatives from the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of the Solicitor General, the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, the Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development, the Ministry of Finance and the Ontario Provincial Police. Once the task force has developed proposals for discussion and comment, it will be consulting with industry, municipalities, and public safety experts. ""Since I first tabled a Private Members' Bill over five years ago calling for better oversight on our roads, the violence and extortion within the towing industry has rapidly escalated,"" said Gila Martow, MPP for Thornhill. ""I look forward to the seeing strengthened provincial oversight of the tow truck industry so we can keep everyone safe.""

Quick Facts

There are approximately 1,600 tow truck companies registered in the Ministry of Transportation’s Commercial Vehicle Operator’s Registration (CVOR) program. A valid CVOR certificate is required to operate a tow truck.

The Consumer Protection Act contains specific tow and storage services rules to help protect consumers who need a tow or roadside assistance in Ontario. The Ontario government is currently reviewing the Act and consumers can provide input through a survey until July 17, 2020, on a number of issues, including towing.

Canada and Ontario invest in a more sustainable Belleville with improved active transportation and public transit infrastructure


June 29, 2020 11:00 A.M.

Ministry of Infrastructure


BELLEVILLE — The health and well-being of Canadians are the top priorities of the Governments of Canada and Ontario. But the COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than Canadians' personal health. It is having a profound effect on the economy.
That is why governments have been taking decisive action to support families, businesses and communities, and continue to look ahead to see what more can be done. Strategic investments in public transit and active transportation infrastructure are important to building sustainable communities. These investments support a healthy environment and help Ontarians get to work, school, and essential services. Today, Neil Ellis, Member of Parliament for Bay of Quinte, on behalf of the Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities; the Honourable Todd Smith, Minister of Children, Community and Social Services and Member of Provincial Parliament for Bay of Quinte, on behalf of the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure; and His Worship Mitch Panciuk, Mayor of the City of Belleville announced funding for two projects that will increase the size of Belleville's public transit fleet while making it easier for residents and visitors to use. The first project involves the expansion of public transit and active transportation infrastructure in Belleville's North East Industrial Park. The construction of three kilometers of new sidewalk and a one kilometre accessible multi-use path will provide commuters with direct access to the city's public transit system. The addition of new bus stops and transit shelters, all fully accessible, will help meet the growing needs of transit users in this busy commercial area. The second project consists of the purchase of four new buses which will be added to the existing bus fleet. The new buses will lead to increased service levels on the busiest bus routes and also expand transit service to underserved areas of the city. Together, these investments will make it easier for pedestrians and cyclists to safely access the public transit system. The Government of Canada is investing more than $1.3 million in the North East Industrial Park active transportation and transit shelters project, and contributing over $1.3 million to the purchase of four buses through the Public Transit Infrastructure stream of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Ontario is also contributing over $2.2 million to improve public transit in the community, with nearly $1.1 million towards the North East Industrial Park and more than $1.1 million towards new bus purchases and overall transit expansion. The City of Belleville's contribution is nearly $2 million.

Quick Facts

Through the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities.
$28.7 billion of this funding is supporting public transit projects, including $5 billion available for investment through the Canada Infrastructure Bank.
Across the province, Ontario is investing more than $7.3 billion in public transit infrastructure over 10 years through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program.

Ministry of the Solicitor General


TORONTO — Today, the Ontario government issued the following statement in recognition of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Awareness Day in Ontario:
 ""While post-traumatic stress can affect anyone, police officers, paramedics, firefighters and corrections staff are particularly at risk. And during this unprecedented time, we are grateful for these brave individuals who confront the unique challenges of their jobs with the added stress of exposure to COVID-19. Today, on PTSD Awareness Day, we recognize the effects post-traumatic stress can have on the lives of those affected by it and reaffirm our commitment to protecting the health and well-being of our frontline heroes.""  — Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General  ""PTSD can have a significant impact on all of us, especially those who have dedicated their lives to serving others. This year, our health care heroes have demonstrated incredible strength and dedication in our fight against COVID-19. That's why our government has expanded online mental health resources like internet-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy to ensure our health care frontline heroes have fast and easy access to services they need during this unprecedented time."" - Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health ""Every day, PTSD touches the lives of people and their families across Ontario, including our frontline heroes. Earlier this year, our government unveiled Roadmap to Wellness: A Plan to Build Ontario's Mental Health and Addictions System. Through our plan, we will address the unique needs of those impacted by work-related stress or trauma. We look forward to engaging with all first responders, so we can ensure they have access to the highest quality services and supports, where and when they need them."" - Michael Tibollo, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions  ""PTSD is a significant risk to the health and well-being of our frontline workers, especially now during the COVID-19 outbreak. These brave individuals are there for us when we need them, and it is our duty to return that support. That is why, last year, I was proud to table the PTSD Awareness Act and demonstrate our government's commitment to making mental health a priority. Now more than ever, we must acknowledge the threat of PTSD and its impacts on Ontarians."" — Will Bouma, MPP for Brantford-Brant   Where to Find Help  For Ontarians currently receiving mental health and addictions services and supports, please contact your current service provider to learn about potential virtual care options. Ontarians interested in public addictions services and mental health services for those over 18, can contact ConnexOntario, Ontario's mental health, addictions and problem gambling help line at 1-866-531-2600. Children and youth under 18 can locate mental health services through the Ontario.ca and Kids Help Phone websites, or contact Kids Help Phone (1-800-668-6868) for 24/7 telephone support if they need someone to talk to. Good2Talk is a free, confidential mental health support service providing professional counselling and information and referrals for mental health, addictions and well-being to postsecondary students in Ontario, 24/7/365.

Ontario Extends Emergency Orders to July 10 
As more communities enter Stage 2, maintaining health and safety protocols remains a top priority 

June 27, 2020  7:00 A.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government has extended all emergency orders currently in force that were made under s.7.0.2 (4) of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act until July 10, 2020, while removing restrictions that were limiting access to certain sport training facilities. This decision was made in consultation with Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health to ensure the safe and gradual reopening of the province on a regional basis can continue as part of Ontario's Framework for Reopening the Province.
The extension of the emergency orders will allow key measures needed in the fight against COVID-19 to continue, including allowing frontline health care providers and public health units to redeploy staff where they are needed most, while providing the government with the tools it needs to successfully steer the province through the next stage of reopening and beyond. ""While we have made truly incredible progress in our fight against COVID-19, thanks to the collective efforts of our frontline heroes and the people of Ontario, we know that we must remain vigilant,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""These emergency orders will allow us to take action, if necessary, to ensure our continued success as we reopen our province and get more people back to work."" In addition, the government has removed certain restrictions for Stage 2 indoor sports and recreational fitness activities facilities. This will enable the facilities to be used by more businesses and organizations to train amateur or professional athletes, or to run certain non-contact amateur or professional athletic competitions. In all cases, facility owners would only be able to permit activities to occur in a way that meets public health requirements. These changes will also enable many sports and recreational organizations around the province to again offer  sport training programming, helping more people return to sport in Ontario. On June 24, Ontario announced the extension of the Declaration of Emergency to July 15, allowing the province to continue to make or amend emergency orders under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act. The government continues to review all these emergency orders to determine when and if it is safe to amend or lift them as restrictions are eased and more places in the province reopen in a safe and measured way. A full list of emergency orders can be found on the e-Laws website under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act and at Ontario.ca/alert.

Ontario Provides Stable Electricity Pricing for Industrial and Commercial Companies 
Province provides predictable electricity rates for two years

June 26, 2020  3:30 P.M.

Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines


TORONTO - The Ontario government is helping large industrial and commercial companies return to full levels of operation without the fear of electricity costs spiking by providing more stable electricity pricing for two years. Effective immediately, companies that participate in the Industrial Conservation Initiative (ICI) will not be required to reduce their electricity usage during peak hours, as their proportion of Global Adjustment (GA) charges for these companies will be frozen.
""Ontario's industrial and commercial electricity consumers continue to experience unprecedented economic challenges during COVID-19,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines. ""Today's announcement will allow large industrial employers to focus on getting their operations up and running and employees back to work, instead of adjusting operations in response to peak electricity demand hours."" Due to COVID-19, electricity consumption in Ontario has been below average and the province is forecast to have a reliable supply of electricity to accommodate increased usage. Peak hours generally occur during the summer when the weather is hot and electricity demand from cooling systems is high. ""Today's action will reduce the burden of anticipating and responding to peak hours for more than 1,300 ICI participants with 2,000 primarily industrial facilities in Ontario,"" said Bill Walker, Associate Minister of Energy. ""Now these large employers can focus on getting their operations back up and running at full tilt."" The government previously announced it was providing temporary relief for industrial and commercial electricity consumers that do not participate in the Regulated Price Plan (RPP) by deferring a portion of GA charges for April, May and June 2020.

Quick Facts

ICI provides an incentive for eligible electricity consumers to reduce their consumption during peak hours to reduce their costs.
New ICI participants for the 2021-22 program year will not be affected; they will be assessed on their electricity consumption during peak hours in 2020-21.

Ontario Providing Additional Support for Seniors 
Provincewide Grant Program Will Promote Safety, Community Engagement and Financial Security

June 26, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government is providing up to $4 million for the Seniors Community Grant Program, a significant increase over last year. This funding will help non-profit organizations, local services boards, or Indigenous groups develop programs for seniors that focus on combatting social isolation, promoting seniors' safety and well-being, improving financial security and making communities age-friendly.
The announcement was made today by Premier Doug Ford and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""It's incredibly important to ensure our seniors have the supports they need to live full, rich and socially active lives, especially during this pandemic,"" said Premier Ford. ""Many have been staying home to help stop the spread of COVID-19. As the province gradually reopens, this funding will go towards establishing virtual seniors' tours, offering programs to combat elder abuse and developing age-friendly communities through initiatives like making outdoor spaces more accessible for seniors."" This year's grants will range from $1,000 to $100,000 and will fund projects that will: Help older individuals and couples receive the support they need in their community;Ensure seniors are less at risk for neglect, abuse and fraud, and that their rights and dignity are protected​;Ensure more older adults are connected and engaged, reducing social isolation;​​ and,Provide more opportunities for older adults in employment and volunteering, achieving greater financial security and engagement within the community.""The past several months have been difficult for seniors, as many have stayed home in self isolation to help prevent the virus from spreading,"" said Minister Elliott. ""Through the Seniors Community Grant Program, our older adults will be getting out more to take part in various activities. When going out, seniors must continue to follow public health advice and practise physical distancing, wear a face covering when physical distancing is a challenge, wash hands frequently, and stay home when ill. This is the best way to keep everyone safe."" In the past, the Seniors Community Grant Program has supported community-based activities like seniors' fitness classes, lawn bowling, brain fitness activities, multicultural dance, along with a public education and awareness campaign that challenges the myths and stereotypes that portray older adults as frail, out-of-touch, technologically illiterate, and no longer employable. ""Although many seniors have been socially isolated to stay safe from COVID-19, our government is committed to ensure they stay connected and physically active, especially now when the province is gradually starting to reopen,"" said Raymond Cho, Minister for Seniors and Accessibility. ""We want to help them maintain their autonomy and independence, while supporting their physical, mental and social well-being."" The application period for the Seniors Community Grant Program is now open and will close on August 7, 2020. Unincorporated and incorporated not-for-profit organizations, local services boards, or Indigenous groups must submit applications to Transfer Payment Ontario (formerly Grants Ontario) online at Ontario.ca/GetFunding. ""Each year, the Seniors Community Grant program makes a difference in the lives of many older Ontarians by creating meaningful opportunities for them to connect with their communities,"" said Sue Hesjedahl, Executive Director of the Older Adult Centres' Association of Ontario. ""This year, supporting that connection is even more important and the SCG program will ensure seniors across the province can still engage with what matters most to them while staying safe and healthy.""

Quick Facts

Since the Seniors Community Grant Program was established in 2014, nearly 1,900 grants have been provided, which have positively impacted the lives of more than half a million seniors.

By 2023, there will be three million Ontarians over the age of 65. Older adults are the province’s fastest growing demographic.

Annual Rabies Bait Drop To Begin
Province Committed to Eliminating the Threat of Rabies in Ontario’s Wildlife

June 26, 2020  9:00 A.M.

Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry


The Ontario government is continuing to protect people and animals against rabies with an annual bait drop.
The Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry will distribute rabies vaccine baits for wildlife throughout southern Ontario, by aircraft in rural areas and by hand in urban centres. Baits help to immunize most raccoons, skunks and foxes that eat them. Hand baiting in urban areas will begin June 29 in Toronto, Peel, Wellington, Halton, Waterloo, Dufferin, Perth, Middlesex, Oxford, Elgin, Haldimand-Norfolk, Niagara, Hamilton, Six Nations (Ohsweken) in Brant, Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry counties. It will also occur in the city of Cornwall in mid-August. Hand baiting targets urban skunk and raccoon habitat where the use of aircraft would not be feasible. Staff distribute the baits by hand in urban areas, focusing on raccoon and skunk habitat, such as bushes, green spaces and ravines where animals may forage, or along fence lines, hedges and large culverts. Baits are not distributed near schools, playgrounds, or in yards with toys where children are likely to be present. Baiting by aircraft will happen on August 6 in Frontenac and Leeds and Grenville counties. Baiting by aircraft will start August 17 in Brant, Bruce, Dufferin, Elgin, Grey, Haldimand, Halton, Hamilton, Huron, Middlesex, Metro Toronto, Niagara, Norfolk, Oxford, Peel, Perth, Simcoe, Waterloo, and Wellington. All baiting dates are subject to change depending on weather conditions. The khaki-green coloured bait is made of wax-fat and smells like marshmallow to attract animals. A label with a toll-free telephone number (1-888-574-6656) and the message ""Do not eat"" are printed on the exterior of the bait and a plastic package containing the liquid rabies vaccine is embedded in the centre. If found, the bait should not be touched, but left for raccoons, skunks and foxes to consume. For further information about rabies in Ontario, please visit Ontario.ca/rabies or contact the ministry's rabies information line at 1-888-574-6656.

Quick Facts

Wildlife Technicians will be following all public health guidelines during the bait drop, including physical distancing, wearing appropriate protective equipment (masks and gloves), and hand washing/sanitizing. 
It is not harmful to a pet or person if a bait is consumed by mistake. However, contacting a doctor or veterinarian as a precaution is recommended. 
Ontario’s bait drop program is one of the most successful rabies control programs in North America. 
Since the start of a rabies outbreak in 2015 – the first of its kind in over a decade – the ministry has taken action to protect communities by distributing over five million vaccine baits, focusing on a 50-km area around where all the rabies cases were discovered.
Since 2016, rabies cases have declined in Ontario by approximately 50 per cent each year.
If a person contracts rabies and does not receive treatment, the disease is fatal.

CORNWALL — The health and well-being of Canadians are the top priorities of the governments of Canada and Ontario. But the COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than Canadians' personal health. It is having a profound effect on the economy.
That is why governments have been taking decisive action to support families, businesses and communities, and continue to look ahead to see what more can be done. Strategic investments in public transit infrastructure play a key role in ensuring Ontarians can get to work, school and essential services on time, and safely back home at the end of the day. Mark Gerretsen, Member of Parliament for Kingston and the Islands, on behalf of the Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities; the Honourable Steve Clark, Ontario's Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing and Member of Provincial Parliament for Leeds─Grenville─Thousand Islands and Rideau Lakes, on behalf of the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure; Jim McDonell, Member of Provincial Parliament for Stormont-Dundas─South Glengarry; her Worship Bernadette Clement, Mayor of Cornwall; and his Worship Jason Baker, Mayor of Brockville, today announced funding for six public transit and accessible transportation projects in Cornwall and Brockville, Ontario. The five Cornwall projects involve the installation of 10 new bus shelters and 60 fully accessible bus stops, and the replacement of 12 conventional buses and eight para transit buses. The installation of 90 surveillance cameras, 15 new passenger counters and 26 electronic fare-boxes will enhance the passenger experience and provide better security to the public. These investments will encourage more residents to choose public transit by providing them with greater accessibility and safer public transit in Cornwall. Brockville will see the replacement of five buses for Brockville Transit to the existing fleet, from 2021 to 2027. The buses are commercial minibuses equipped with an accessible lift. All buses in the replacement fleet will have automated stop announcement systems, fare counting aids and improved rider metric collection devices, allowing for better safety, accessibility and route planning. The Government of Canada is investing over $5.1 million in these projects through the Public Transit Infrastructure Stream (PTIS) of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Ontario is contributing more than $4.1 million while the City of Cornwall is contributing over $3.0 million and the City of Brockville is contributing $210,076 in their respective projects

The 2020 Youth Opportunities Fund will provide financial support to 43 community organizations that will benefit youth aged 12 to 25, and their families. Projects receiving funding this year include: Black Moms Connection ― focusing on economic empowerment for Black mothers across the Greater Toronto Area (GTA).Immigrants francophones d'Afrique pour l'intégration et le développement (IFAPID)― to support newcomers from Francophone African nations to navigate financial systems in Canada.Earthling Art Collective ― to provide development and mentorship opportunities for youth leaving care and the justice system in Thunder Bay.Miziwe Biik Aboriginal Employment & Training ― to help Indigenous youth in the GTA access employment and training opportunities in the skilled trades.     ""The Youth Opportunities Fund is a way for our government to form partnerships with grassroots projects and community leaders who are creating change.

That is why governments have been taking decisive action to support families, businesses and communities, and continue to look ahead to see what more can be done. Strategic investments in public transit and active transportation infrastructure play a key role in ensuring Ontarians can get to work and essential services on time then safely back home at the end of the day. Today, Vance Badawey, Member of Parliament for Niagara Centre, on behalf of the Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities; Chris Bittle, Member of Parliament for St. Catharines; Sam Oosterhoff, Member of Provincial Parliament for Niagara West and Stephen Crawford, Parliamentary Assistant to Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure and Member of Provincial Parliament for Oakville on behalf of the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure; Jim Bradley, Chair of Niagara Region; His Worship Jim Diodati, Mayor of the City of Niagara Falls; and His Worship Walter Sendzik, Mayor of the City of St. Catharinesannounced funding for 31 public transit projects in the Niagara Region. Several of the projects across the region involve improvements to transit routes and infrastructure, including new buses, renovations to bus shelters as well as new surveillance systems to ensure passenger safety. New fare payment technology will enable customers to use one method of contactless payment to access all of the transit systems across Niagara Region. In Niagara Falls, the construction of a multi-modal hub on Bridge Street will increase access to local transit and transportation alternatives for residents using the GO regional transit system and help keep pedestrians safe in a traffic-centric location. In St. Catharines, 21 new buses and four new paratransit vehicles will add capacity to the existing bus fleet, encouraging more residents to choose public transit by providing them with more frequent and accessible bus service.  The projects announced today support a regional approach to public transit throughout Niagara, St. Catharines, Fort Erie, Port Colborne, and Welland to help build inclusive and resilient communities. By modernizing and expanding public transit systems in the region and connecting residents to active transportation alternatives, Ontarians can get around their communities safely while protecting the environment. The Government of Canada is investing over $31 million in these projects through the Public Transit Infrastructure Stream (PTIS) of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Ontario is providing more than $26 million to the projects, while the municipalities are contributing more than $21 million.

Ontario Holds Back Leamington and Kingsville due to Higher Rates of COVID-19

June 24, 2020  7:30 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO —The Ontario government is allowing Windsor-Essex to move into Stage 2 of reopening on Thursday, June 25, 2020 at 12:01 a.m., with the exception of the Municipality of Leamington and the Town of Kingsville. These areas are being held back due to the higher transmission rates in the local agriculture and agri-food sector. This decision was made in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health and the local Medical Officer of Health of Windsor-Essex County Health Unit.
The announcement was made today by Premier Doug Ford, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health Christine Elliott and Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development Monte McNaughton. ""Our government is doing everything in our power to reopen every region of Ontario safely and gradually, and with today's announcement, the province is nearly all in Stage 2,"" said Premier Ford. ""Right now, we need to redouble our efforts to support the people in the Leamington and Kingsville areas, so that we can stop the spread of COVID-19 and get those remaining businesses and services open."" The majority of Windsor-Essex can reopen and move into Stage 2 as local data and information indicates there is lower transmission of COVID-19 in these areas. There is also sufficient hospital capacity, public health capacity to do rapid case and contact management, and a significant increase in testing. Outbreaks in agriculture and agri-food sectors pose unique challenges that require a targeted and collaborative response. Working with federal and local authorities, Ontario is implementing a three-point plan to support Leamington and Kingsville to move into Stage 2 as soon as it is safe to do so. Work is already underway to expand and provide ongoing on-site testing on work sites. The Chief Medical Officer of Health is also issuing public health guidance allowing positive asymptomatic workers to continue working as long as they follow the public health measures in their workplace to minimize the risk of transmission to others. This guidance will provide clarity and assurance that local public health officials will assist with interpreting test results and developing a plan that, first and foremost, ensures essential workers in the sector are able to return to work safely. ""We are able to open most of Windsor-Essex because of our collective efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19 in these communities,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""We will continue to provide the necessary support to Kingsville and Leamington so that they can safely move into Stage 2 as well when they are ready. Now more than ever, it remains critical to continue to follow public health advice, including physical distancing with those outside our social circle or household.""

Quick Facts

The three-point plan to support Windsor-Essex to move into Stage 2 includes ongoing and expanded on-site testing, access for workers to employment benefits and supports, and new public health guidance for positive asymptomatic workers for all workplaces.

There are two general assessment centres at Windsor Regional Hospital (Ouellette Campus) and Erie Shores Healthcare in Leamington. One additional assessment centre at the Nature Fresh Centre is ready to reopen should demand increase or to schedule specific times to accommodate testing for smaller farms.

Province Unveils Plan to Reduce Transmission on Farms and in the Community

June 24, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — In consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health and local public health officials, the Ontario government is implementing a three-point plan to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 on farms and throughout the community. Recent outbreaks, especially those in the agriculture and agri-food sectors, pose unique challenges that require a targeted response. By taking immediate action, health officials hope to stop the spread of the virus and move the region into Stage 2 as soon as it is safe to do so.
Details of the plan were provided today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development. ""We are doing everything we can to help Windsor-Essex contain this virus and get back on track, so we can allow local businesses to reopen and get more people back to work,"" said Premier Ford. ""Clearly, our agricultural sector in this part of the province is being hit particularly hard. Our three-point plan will give farmers the support they need to protect essential workers and ensure they can keep putting food safely on our tables."" The three-point plan builds on the work already underway by the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit and enhances the coordinated efforts of the province, federal and local authorities. The plan's three points are as follows: Ongoing and expanded on-site testingOntario is continuing to facilitate on-site testing at agri-food businesses and community assessment centres to make proactive testing more timely and accessible. About 350 asymptomatic workers have been tested at their work site since on-site testing launched this past weekend. Ontario is currently engaging employers to schedule more mobile testing on farms. Early identification of workers who are not showing symptoms, but who may be infected with COVID-19, will help reduce the potential spread of the virus in the workplace and the community. Access to Employment Benefits and SupportsTemporary foreign workers are entitled to the same benefits and protections as any other worker in Ontario. That includes workers' compensation benefits, which are administered by the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB). It also includes protections afforded by the Employment Standards Act. Under Ontario's new infectious disease emergency leave provisions, a worker's job is protected while they take unpaid leave due to COVID-19. In certain cases, temporary foreign workers may also be eligible to apply for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB). To access the federal benefit, workers must have earned $5,000 in the last 12 months or in the previous year. New Public Health GuidanceThe Chief Medical Officer of Health will issue new public health guidance allowing positive asymptomatic workers to continue working as long as they follow the public health measures in their workplace to minimize the risk of transmission to others. This guidance will provide clarity and assurance that local public health officials will assist with interpreting test results and developing a plan that, first and foremost, ensures essential workers in the sector are able to return to work safely and meet the business-critical operational needs on a case-by-case basis. ""By providing both farmers and employees with economic certainty, this three-point plan will allow the rapid scaling up of testing in agri-food sector workplaces across the region,"" said Minister Elliott. ""These targeted actions build on the collaborative and comprehensive response already in progress and will allow us to better identify and isolate cases so we can move this region into Stage 2 and safely reopen."" ""The safety of workers on farms and in greenhouses across the province is critically important as we work to overcome COVID-19,"" said Ernie Hardeman, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. ""They work incredibly hard to support our farmers as they plant, harvest and process the good things that grow here in Ontario. It is critical that we step up our efforts at this challenging time to protect these essential workers and ensure our local produce gets to market."" ""A worker's passport does not determine how they are treated in our system,"" said Minister McNaughton. ""That's not the Ontario way. If you're working in this province, I want you to know that your health and safety is a priority for our government."" The Chief Medical Officer of Health and health experts will continue to closely monitor the evolving situation in all regions of the province to advise when public health restrictions can be gradually loosened or adjusted if necessary. Although restrictions are being gradually relaxed in Stage 2, the government is strongly recommending that everyone in Ontario continue to follow public health advice, including physical distancing, wearing a face covering if physical distancing is a challenge, washing hands frequently and thoroughly, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth. If you think you have COVID-19 or have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19, get tested.

Quick Facts

More than 170 workplace health and safety resources, including guidelines, tip sheets are available at Ontario.ca/covidsafety. They include resources translated into French and Spanish specifically for the agricultural sector.

If an individual contracted COVID-19 while at work, they should tell their employer about their illness and any medical treatment received right away and file a claim to determine eligibility for WSIB benefits and services. Employers should report the case immediately to local public health officials and the Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development.
Local mobile teams comprised of staff from local hospitals, Ontario Health West Region, Erie St. Clair Local Health Integration Network home and community care services, emergency medical services, and interpreters are being deployed each day and are completing regular health check assessments on-site at farms for all referred who are positive and symptomatic.
There are two general assessment centres at Windsor Regional Hospital (Ouellette Campus) and Erie Shores Healthcare in Leamington. One additional assessment centre at the Nature Fresh Centre is ready to reopen should demand increase or to schedule specific times to accommodate testing for smaller farms.
Ontario has taken action to safeguard farm workers and protect the food supply, including providing up to $15 million in the Enhanced Agri-Food Workforce Protection program.
Stage 3 will focus on reopening more workplaces and community spaces, while carefully and gradually relaxing restrictions, and sustaining and expanding workplace health and safety guidance.
The province has developed a practical step-by-step guide to help Ontarians as they safely develop and join a social circle.

Canada and Ontario invest in public transit infrastructure for Peterborough residents 


June 24, 2020 11:30 A.M.

Ministry of Infrastructure


Peterborough — The health and well-being of Canadians are the top priorities of the governments of Canada and Ontario. But, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than Canadians' personal health. It is having a profound effect on the economy.
That is why governments have been taking decisive action to support families, businesses and communities and continue to look ahead to see what more can be done. Strategic investments in public transit infrastructure play a key role in ensuring Ontarians can get to work, school, and essential services on time and safely back home at the end of the day. The Honourable Maryam Monsef, Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Rural Economic Development and Member of Parliament for Peterborough-Kawartha; along with the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure; Dave Smith, Member of Provincial Parliament for Peterborough-Kawartha: and Her Worship Diane Therrien, Mayor of Peterborough, today announced funding for five public transit projects in the City of Peterborough and one project in the County of Peterborough. Public transit users will benefit from new buses and vans, as well as refurbished buses. These upgrades will increase the capacity and reliability of the fleet. They will also improve the quality of service for passengers. Four of the six projects include new or upgraded accessible vehicles, such as buses and special access vans. This will open up opportunities and improve the quality of life for people living with limited mobility in Peterborough, including Canadians who require specialized care. The Government of Canada is investing over $5.8 million in these projects through the Public Transit Infrastructure Stream (PTIS) of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Ontario is providing more than $4.76 million to the projects, while the City of Peterborough is contributing more than $3.67 million and the County of Peterborough is contributing over $18,000. This is one in a series of important project announcements that will be made across the province over the coming weeks. The governments of Canada and Ontario are working cooperatively to support jobs, improve communities, and build confidence, while safely and sustainably restoring economic growth.

Quick Facts

Through the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities.
$28.7 billion of this funding is supporting public transit projects, including $5 billion available for investment through the Canada Infrastructure Bank. 
Across the province, Ontario is investing more than $7.3 billion in public transit infrastructure over 10 years through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program.

Ontario Extends Declaration of Emergency to July 15
Province Focuses on Safe, Gradual Reopening of Regions 

June 24, 2020 11:15 A.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO ― In consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health, the Ontario government has extended the provincial Declaration of Emergency under s.7.0.7 of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act to July 15, 2020. This extension, approved by the Ontario Legislature earlier today, provides Ontario with the additional time, flexibility, and the necessary tools to safely and gradually allow more places to reopen, while continuing to support frontline health care providers in the fight against COVID-19.
""As we gradually and safely reopen our economy, our frontline care providers can continue to rely on these emergency orders to better protect our seniors and most vulnerable citizens and provide the flexibility to put resources where they're needed most,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""We are hopeful that another extension of the Declaration of Emergency will not be needed as we see improvements in the public health trends and as people and businesses continue to act responsibly and adapt to the new environment."" The provincial Declaration of Emergency enables the government to make, and as needed amend, emergency orders that protect the health and safety of all Ontarians. Emergency orders in force under the Declaration of Emergency include those allowing frontline care providers to redeploy staff to areas most in need, limiting long-term care and retirement home employees to working at one home, and enabling public health units to redeploy or hire staff to support the province's enhanced case management and contact tracing strategy. These measures continue to be needed to protect seniors and other vulnerable populations from the threat of COVID-19. The extension of the Declaration of Emergency will allow the province to make or amend emergency orders as needed as it continues to ease restrictions in support of its phased reopening.   In consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health, the government will continue to monitor public health trends related to COVID-19 and assess on an ongoing basis whether the provincial Declaration of Emergency needs to be extended further. The government will also continue to review emergency orders currently in place to determine when and if it is safe to amend or lift them as more places in the province are allowed to reopen in a safe and measured way. As of June 24, 33 public health unit regions have entered Stage 2 of the Framework for Reopening our Province, allowing more businesses and services to open and getting more people back to work. The Windsor-Essex County public health unit region remains in Stage 1 and the situation in the region will continue to be assessed on an ongoing basis. A full list of emergency orders can be found on the e-Laws website under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act and at Ontario.ca/alert.

Ministry of Francophone Affairs


TORONTO — As the province begins its economic recovery, the government is launching the 2020-21 edition of the Francophone Community Grants Program to support Ontario's francophone businesses and community organizations, as well as those that serve French-speaking Ontarians.
""Our government is committed to supporting Ontario's Francophone community through the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond,"" said Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Francophone Affairs. ""This year's investment in the Francophone Community Grants Program will help Francophone organizations and businesses implement new projects and initiatives and contribute to our recovery."" The Francophone Community Grants Program is a two-stream, application-based funding program. Funding provided under the Economic Development stream helps francophone entrepreneurs and businesses improve front-line services and better serve their French-speaking clients and partners. Under the Cultural and Community stream, the Program invests in local cultural and community initiatives, demonstrating the government's ongoing commitment to protecting and promoting the French language and culture. The Program supports projects which strengthen the capacity of organizations to provide products and services in French, promote the recruitment and training of bilingual staff, or provide opportunities to celebrate and foster understanding of Ontario's Francophonie. This year, the Economic Development stream has been extended to include not-for-profit organizations, in addition to for-profit organizations. ""This is an important step in building the capacity of Francophone organizations across Ontario to support our communities and bring Ontario on the path to recovery,"" added Minister Mulroney. ""By investing in new projects, our government will leverage the economic strengths of Ontario's Francophonie and help francophone organizations and businesses across the province face these unprecedented times.""

Quick Facts

As was done last year, applications must be submitted through the Transfer Payment Ontario portal. Applications are open from June 24 to August 5, 2020 and projects must be implemented between October 15, 2020 and March 31, 2021.
Ontario is investing $1 million through the Francophone Community Grants Program in 2020-2021.
Improvements have been made to the Program this year to make it easier for organizations to apply and receive funding: under the Community and Culture Stream, the minimum operating budget required has been reduced to $10,000 from $50,000; under the Economic Development Stream, the minimum annual revenue required has been lowered to $50,000 from $100,000 and the minimum number of full-time employees (FTEs) has been reduced to one, instead of three; not-for-profit organizations are now also eligible under Economic Development stream; applicants under both streams can request funding of up to $50,000.

Ministry of Infrastructure


BELLEVILLE — The governments of Canada and Ontario recognize the different ways that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected smaller communities across the province. While moving towards recovery, investments in infrastructure in rural and northern Ontario are vital to successful, thriving communities and their economies.
Today, Neil Ellis, Member of Parliament for Bay of Quinte, on behalf of the Honourable Maryam Monsef, Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Rural Economic Development; the Honourable Todd Smith, Ontario's Minister of Children, Community and Social Services and Member of Provincial Parliament for Bay of Quinte, on behalf of the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure; His Worship Mitch Panciuk, Mayor of the City of Belleville; and his Worship Jim Harrison, Mayor of the City of Quinte West, announced funding for the improvement of road and active transportation infrastructure in the two neighbouring cities. Belleville residents will benefit from the reconstruction and widening of approximately 1.5 km of Bell Boulevard. The boulevard will be widened from two to four lanes west of Sidney Street, new signalized intersections will be installed, and auxiliary and turning lanes, street lighting, and paved shoulders will be added to support active transportation, such as cycling and walking. Traffic congestion will be eased by accommodating higher traffic volumes, supporting commercial and industrial development along the boulevard, and improving the safety and reliability of the road. In Quinte West, King Street, Division Street, Catherine Street and Dufferin Avenue will be reconstructed and upgraded to include wheelchair-accessible sidewalks, bike lanes and asphalt resurfacing. These enhancements will support safer and more reliable infrastructure for drivers, cyclists and pedestrians. The Government of Canada is investing more than $4.9 million in these projects through the Rural and Northern Communities Infrastructure Stream (RNIS) of the Investing in Canada plan. The Government of Ontario is contributing over $3.3 million; the City of Belleville is contributing more than $5.9 million; and Quinte West is contributing $7.8 million.

Quick Facts

Through the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities.
$2 billion of this funding is supporting infrastructure projects that meet the unique needs of rural and northern communities like facilities to support food security, local access roads and enhanced broadband connectivity.
Ontario is investing $10.2 billion under the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program to improve public transit; community, culture and recreation; green, and rural and northern community infrastructure.
The Rural Economic Development Strategy leverages ongoing federal investments and provides a vision for the future, identifying practical steps to take in the short term, and serving as a foundation to guide further work.

A modern elementary math curriculum
To better support students in Ontario, the government has released a new math curriculum for Grades 1 to 8. The new curriculum is part of the government's four-year math strategy designed to improve student math grades, help students solve everyday math problems and better prepare students' for the jobs of tomorrow. The Ontario Curriculum: Mathematics, Grades 1 to 8 was last updated in 2005. Today, there have been advances in education on: how students learn and engage in math;the role financial literacy and coding plays in a student's life today and in the future;how technology can enhance learning; andhow to access and interact with information.How the new math curriculum was informed In the Fall of 2018, parents, educators, organizations and the general public provided feedback during the Ministry of Education's provincewide consultations. More than 70 per cent of respondents identified the following areas that were needed to improve academic achievement in math: focus on fundamental math concepts and skills;include practical examples of math;enhance teacher training and resources; andgive elementary students more opportunities to learn about science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines.The new curriculum was also informed by expert knowledge and research, best practices from other jurisdictions across Canada and around the world, and input from stakeholders, academics and math education and industry experts. For the first time, the curriculum was placed under a market sounding lens, to ensure private and non-profit sector leaders could inform the development of the curriculum. The feedback played an invaluable role in ensuring the curriculum aligns with the job market and the skill set required to succeed in today's competitive marketplace. Further teaching resources and supports will be available, including providing classroom-ready resources for each grade, as well as in-depth virtual training for teachers, principals and board staff. Changes and key learning Changes to the curriculum include: focusing on fundamental math concepts and skills, such as learning and recalling number facts - including multiplication fact tables from 0 to 12 (0×0 to 12×12); andusing current examples that help students see math in their everyday lives.Key learning to ensure students are future-ready includes: teaching coding skills starting in Grade 1 to improve students' ability to become problem solvers and develop fluency with technology;developing an understanding of the value and use of money over time and consumer awareness through learning about financial literacy; andcreating and reading infographics and collecting and analyzing data to make arguments, and inform decisions and predictionsSocial-Emotional Learning Skills The development of social-emotional learning (SEL) skills supports students' overall health and well-being. SEL skills help students develop confidence, cope with challenges, learn from mistakes, build perseverance, and think critically. Throughout the curriculum, students learn to apply these skills to help them deepen their understanding of math concepts and apply them in their everyday lives. During their education, students will acquire social-emotional learning skills as well as transferable skills such as critical thinking and problem solving, self-directed learning, collaboration, communication, and digital literacy. Students apply these everyday skills as part of their learning across the other five parts of the curriculum, and in their experiences at school, at home and in the community. These interconnected skills help foster overall health and well-being, and the ability to learn, build resilience and thrive.

Focus on the Fundamentals will Better Prepare Students for Jobs of the Future 

June 23, 2020  1:10 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government released the province's new elementary math curriculum to better prepare students for work in a rapidly changing world, strengthen math competence and improve grades. The curriculum was developed over two years in consultation with parents, math educators, academics and math education experts, and is designed to reverse a decade of declining math scores. It will be available to students across the province beginning in September 2020.
Details were released today by Premier Doug Ford, Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education. ""I made a promise to parents that we would fix the broken education system we inherited, get back to basics, and teach our children the math fundamentals they need for lifelong success,"" said Premier Ford. ""Today, our government is delivering on that promise with the first-ever math curriculum in Canada for Grades 1-8 that includes the teaching of coding and financial literacy, both critical skills that will help our students prepare for and succeed in the modern world and in the modern workforce."" The new math curriculum for Grades 1-8 will: Build understanding of the value and use of money through mandatory financial literacy concepts;For the first time, teach coding or computer programming skills starting in Grade 1 to improve problem solving and fluency with technology, to prepare students for jobs of the future;Use relevant, current, and practical examples so students can connect math to everyday life;Put a focus on fundamental math concepts and skills, such as learning and recalling number facts.""For over a decade, too many students were lacking everyday math, financial literacy, and numeracy skills,"" said Minister Lecce. ""The new curriculum will help students solve everyday math problems, enshrine financial literacy in the early grades, and better prepare students for the jobs of tomorrow by ensuring every student learns how to code."" The Ministry of Education is also changing how it makes curriculum available to better reflect how Ontarians consume information. The new math curriculum will be the first uploaded to the new Curriculum and Resources website, a digital space where anyone can access curriculum and learning resources. This platform will help parents, students, and teachers see connections between learning in different grades and subjects. ""Our research team provided an extensive background research report giving the Ministry of Education the most up-to-date research and analysis of other curricula,"" said Dr. Christine Suurtamm, Vice Dean Research, and Professor of Mathematics Education, Faculty of Education, University of Ottawa. ""Ontario's new mathematics curriculum builds on what we know about student learning and how students develop an understanding of mathematics. It supports all students to be math learners with opportunities to learn foundational mathematics and engage in current topics. The goal is to support how students use math in the world today, and how they will use math to make informed decisions in the world ahead of them.""

Quick Facts

The last update to Ontario’s elementary math curriculum was in 2005.
The new elementary math curriculum is part of the government’s four-year math strategy to ensure that students can build the confidence and skills they need to excel in math.
The elementary report card will be updated to align with the new curriculum and provide an overall mark in math, along with comments on the different strands of the curriculum to give parents a better overall assessment of how their child is doing.
Grade 3 and 6 students will not participate in Education Quality and Accountability Office (EQAO) assessments during the 2020-21 school year, as the ministry works to align the assessments with the new curriculum. Students in Grade 9 and Grade 10 will continue to take the mathematics assessment and Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test (OSSLT), respectively.
The Ontario Government is committed to supporting educators in effectively implementing the new elementary math curriculum. This includes providing classroom-ready resources for each grade, as well as in-depth virtual training for teachers, principals and board staff.
Educators will also continue to benefit from investments in professional development and math supports, including $10 million for board-based math learning leads, $15 million for school-based math learning facilitators, and $15 million to support release time for educators to become expertly familiar with the curriculum.

Ministry of Infrastructure


GUELPH —The health and well-being of Canadians are the top priorities of the Governments of Canada and Ontario. But the COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than Canadians' personal health. It is having a profound effect on the economy.
That is why governments have been taking decisive action to support families, businesses and communities, and continue to look ahead to see what more can be done. Strategic investments in public transportation infrastructure play a key role in supporting affordable and sustainable transportation services that allow Ontarians to get to work, school and essential services on time, and safely back home at the end of the day. Today, Lloyd Longfield, Member of Parliament for Guelph, on behalf of the Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities; Stephen Crawford, Member of Provincial Parliament for Oakville and Parliamentary Assistant to the Ontario Minister of Infrastructure and on behalf of the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure; and His Worship Cam Guthrie, Mayor of the City of Guelph announced funding for two projects that will expand Guelph's public transit fleet while supporting its transition to clean energy transportation. The first project involves the expansion and enhancement of the cycling network in Guelph. Construction of new accessible bike paths and improvements to bike path intersections will improve safety for cyclists and provide direct access to the city's public transit system. The second project consists of the construction of a new Guelph Transit terminal building at Guelph Central Station that meets accessibility and energy efficiency standards. The new building will include passenger waiting areas and public washrooms, as well as amenities for transit employees. Together, these investments will make it easier for cyclists and public transit users to get around their community safely while protecting the environment. The Government of Canada is investing more than $1.8 million to the cycling network expansion and $2.7 million to the Guelph Central Station project through the Public Transit Infrastructure stream of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Ontario is providing over $3 million, while the City of Guelph's contribution is more than $11 million to both projects.

Quick Facts

Through the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities.
$28.7 billion of this funding is supporting public transit projects, including $5 billion available for investment through the Canada Infrastructure Bank.

										Member of Parliament for Guelph on behalf of the Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities
									




“Today, Ontario is investing an additional $3 million to support local transit infrastructure in Guelph, adding to the more than $33-million investment announced in January. With the approval of these projects and this joint investment of more than $18 million from Ontario, the federal government and the City of Guelph will help jump start the local recovery and create much needed jobs. I am very pleased that Guelph is now able to move forward with these local priority projects and to deliver improved transit to the community.”

The funding announced today represents an important step forward as we work to make this vision a reality. On behalf of Council and the City of Guelph, I want to thank the Government of Canada and Province of Ontario for their contributions to these important projects, and for their continued partnership in helping Guelph achieve its climate goal to be a net-zero carbon community by 2050.”

Keep Pets Safe this Summer, Do Not Leave Them in Hot Vehicles
Ontario has toughest penalties in Canada for violations

June 22, 2020  2:30 P.M.

Ministry of the Solicitor General


The Ontario government is strongly urging everyone to ensure their pet is not left unattended in a vehicle during the hot summer weather. Temperatures inside a vehicle can quickly become much hotter than the temperature outside even if the windows are opened slightly. This can put pets at risk of serious illness and possibly death. If your pet can't be with you at your destination, leave them at home where they will be safe, cool and comfortable.
""It is critically important to ensure all pets are protected from the potential fatal effects of the hot summer sun,"" said Sylvia Jones, Solicitor General. ""Leaving pets to suffer in a sweltering vehicle will not be tolerated and we have adopted tough new laws to deter this type of reckless behaviour in the province."" Ontario is the first jurisdiction in Canada to implement a full provincial government-based animal welfare enforcement system. The Provincial Animal Welfare Services (PAWS) Act came into effect January 1, 2020 and allows police, First Nations constables and provincial animal welfare inspectors to enter motor vehicles to help pets in distress. The legislation also has the strongest penalties in the country for people who violate animal welfare laws, including causing distress to animals. If you see an animal in a hot car and are concerned the animal's life is in immediate danger, dial 911. Members of the public should not attempt to enter a vehicle in these situations.  

Quick Facts

Unlike humans, dogs have a very limited ability to sweat. Even a short period in a hot environment can cause suffering and distress, which could result in brain damage or death.
Excessive panting, drooling, listlessness, collapsing or seizures are all examples of visible signs of heat stress in animals. If you witness these signs in your pet, move the animal to a cool area and seek veterinary attention immediately. 
Cruelty to any animal is not tolerated in Ontario. If you think an animal is in distress or being abused, call 1-833-9-ANIMAL (264625).

More People Can Return to Work as Key Public Health Trends Improve

June 22, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government is allowing more businesses and services to open and getting more people back to work by moving the City of Toronto and Peel Region into Stage 2 on Wednesday. This decision was made in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health and the local medical officers of health. It is based on positive local trends of key public health indicators, including lower transmission of COVID-19, ongoing hospital capacity, public health capacity to do rapid case and contact management, and a significant increase in testing.
""Today's announcement is another sign that we continue to make steady progress,"" said Premier Ford. ""We have been working hand-in-hand with our municipal partners and local public health units to safely and gradually reopen the province. We will do everything we can to get our final region, Windsor-Essex, into Stage 2 as soon as possible. That's why we are ramping up testing and inspections on Ontario's farms to protect workers and keep our food supply chains strong and healthy."" Toronto Public Health and Peel Public Health will enter Stage 2 on Wednesday, June 24, 2020 at 12:01 a.m. They will join the 31 other public health regions that entered Stage 2 on June 12 and 19, 2020. ""Because of our collective efforts, we continue to make real and significant progress in stopping the spread of COVID-19,"" said Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health. ""As a result, more regions have met the public health criteria to move into Stage 2 and reopen more services for the communities to enjoy. Just as importantly, these efforts to stop the spread have ensured that we aren't seeing spikes in cases in those regions that have been open for well over a week now."" Windsor-Essex will remain in Stage 1 and the situation in the region will continue to be assessed on an ongoing basis. To ensure the region is able to move forward as soon as it is safe to do so, the province is building on the work completed by Windsor-Essex County Health Unit to date and collaborating with federal and local authorities to support the implementation of a targeted and collaborative response that includes:  Continuing with proactive targeted testing for agri-food workers, including enhanced on-farm testing; Conducting more than 200 Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development on-farm inspections and investigations; Starting new joint inspections of farms with federal authorities to review current working and living conditions of temporary foreign workers with the Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development and local public health officials; Providing $15 million through the Enhanced Agri-food Workplace Protection program, which provides cost-share funding to improve employee and workplace health and safety on farms and in processing facilities. The funding can be used to purchase personal protective equipment (PPE), put up physical barriers, make housing modifications, or provide alternate housing or other measures; Translating COVID-19 health and safety guidance documents into Spanish and posting them on Ontario.ca/covidsafety. Additional resources, including webinars and helpful posters, are also available, and will help farmers and other agri-food employers provide safe and healthy workplaces; Providing specific funding to Workplace Safety and Prevention Services to deliver resources and consulting services to help farmers and other agri-food businesses provide safe workplaces; and Continuing to press the federal government to provide new funding to support priority sectors impacted by COVID-19, including the agricultural sector, as the province reopens and charts a path to economic recovery.  ""Our government is committed to protecting our agri-food workers who continue to produce the safe and healthy foods Ontarians rely on,"" said Ernie Hardeman, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. ""Expanded on-farm proactive testing, more workplace inspections and additional resources like our $15-million Enhanced Agri-food Workplace Protection Program are part of our coordinated effort to safeguard our farm workers."" The Chief Medical Officer of Health has also strongly recommended that local medical officers of health use their authority under section 22 of the Health Protection and Promotion Act to issue class orders to ensure that employers of temporary workers take actions to decrease the risk of transmission of COVID-19 on farms. These actions will ensure:  All foreign workers self-isolate for 14 days from the date of their arrival, with the resources and supports they need to avoid any contacts with others and notification to public health unit if they have any COVID-19 symptoms; All workers coming from any area where there is community transmission have tested negative for COVID-19 within 48 hours prior to beginning work; Daily active screening; Accurate and updated contact information of permanent, temporary and contract employees available to the public health unit within 24 hours and ensuring employees are assigned to the same group to support effective case management and contact tracing; Physical distancing maintained between workers as best as possible and personal protective equipment to be provided based on risk assessment; and All legislative requirements to protect worker health and safety are followed. ""COVID-19 has changed the way people work and interact with each other ― both on and off the farm,"" said Monte McNaughton, Minister of Labour, Training, and Skills Development. ""Our ministry, together with its health and safety partners, has worked hard to get important information to employers and workers in the agricultural sector. I encourage you to access these documents at Ontario.ca/covidsafety."" With this enhanced response, and continued support from the entire Windsor-Essex community, the government is confident Windsor-Essex County Health Unit region will proceed to Stage 2 soon. The Chief Medical Officer of Health and health experts will continue to closely monitor the evolving situation in all regions of the province to advise when public health restrictions can be gradually loosened or if they need to be tightened. Although restrictions are being gradually relaxed in Stage 2, the government is strongly recommending that everyone in Ontario follow public health advice, including physical distancing, wearing a face covering if physical distancing is a challenge, washing hands frequently and thoroughly, and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.

Quick Facts

Every Monday, the government is providing an update on the ongoing assessment of the different regions, and whether they are ready to move into Stage 2.
To get tested, people should visit Ontario's website to find their local assessment centre and whether they need to call ahead to make an appointment.
Stage 3 will focus on reopening more workplaces and community spaces, while carefully and gradually relaxing restrictions, and sustaining and expanding workplace health and safety guidance.
The province has developed a practical step-by-step guide to help Ontarians as they safely develop and join a social circle.

Minister Takes Immediate Action to Confront Racism and Ensure Schools are Safe and Inclusive

June 22, 2020 11:20 A.M.

Ministry of Education


TORONTO — Today, Minister of Education, Stephen Lecce issued the following statement on the appointment of Bruce Rodrigues to supervise the Peel District School Board (PDSB):
""We expect all schools and classrooms in the province to be safe and inclusive. For far too long, this has not been the case at the Peel District School Board. From day one, I said that if the PDSB does not act swiftly and completely to counter racism and positively change the culture within our schools, then the government will act. For a generation, students have felt ignored, powerless, and disrespected. This ends starting today. The appointment of a Supervisor will allow the PDSB to get back on track and undertake the necessary actions to eliminate the practices and policies underpinning discrimination and inequities.  Mr. Rodrigues brings a wealth of experience to this appointment, including leading systemic change as Director of Education of the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB) and as Chief Executive Officer of the Education Quality and Accountability Office (EQAO). Mr. Rodrigues has an outstanding track record in Ontario's publicly funded education system with commitment and passion to drive change, confront discrimination, and advance equity, inclusion and opportunity for all students. He has put students of all abilities at the heart of his work and public service. With the assistance of Mr. Rodrigues' supervision, I know that the Peel District School Board will have the leadership and necessary management structure in place to ensure the learning and working environments are welcoming, inclusive, and respectful for students and staff. We know there is more to do - provincewide - which is why we will continue to work to confront racism, including anti-Black racism, in all Ontario schools across our province. Ontario's children deserve nothing less."" "

Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services


Toronto — Today, the Ontario government announced members of the new Indigenous Women's Advisory Council. The Council includes First Nations, Métis, Inuit, and LGBTQ2S leaders on violence prevention who will provide input on issues impacting their communities such as human trafficking and child, youth and family well-being. Today's announcement is being made on National Indigenous Peoples Day.
“For culturally relevant and effective changes to occur in Ontario, Indigenous women must lead the development of our policies so we can truly support their communities,” said Jill Dunlop, Associate Minister of Children and Women's Issues. “The Council will be key to ensuring Indigenous women's voices guide Ontario's priorities on a range of critical issues.” The Council will be co-chaired by Cora-lee McGuire-Cyrette, Executive Director of the Ontario Native Women's Association. The other co-chair will be selected at the Council's first meeting in early July 2020. Other members of the Indigenous Women's Advisory Council include:   Sylvia Maracle, Ontario Federation of Indigenous Friendship Centres Sandra Montour, Six Nations of the Grand River Lyndia Jones, Independent First Nations Jennifer St. Germain, Métis Nation of Ontario Teresa Sutherland, Nishnawbe Aski Nation Amanda Kilabuk, Tungasuvvingat Inuit Marina Plain, Union of Ontario Indians/Anishinabek Nation Tracy Antone, Chiefs of Ontario  “I'm honoured to accept this position and work with our Indigenous partners and the Ontario government. It will take everyone working together to address issues of gender-based violence and systemic racism,” said Cora-lee McGuire-Cyrette, Council Co- Chair and Executive Director of the Ontario Native Women's Association. “I want to thank Associate Minister Jill Dunlop for this opportunity and her leadership in making this space possible. The Indigenous Women's Advisory Council is building on the foundational work the province has been leading and the work of the Council is critical to ensuring the issues Indigenous Women face daily will be a priority.” “I'm pleased Cora-lee McGuire-Cyrette has agreed to provide her leadership and expertise and I look forward to hearing the voices of these incredible individuals on how we can work together to prevent violence in all its forms,” said Minister Dunlop. “Indigenous women, communities and organizations have been working tirelessly to address violence against Indigenous women, and the knowledge and expertise of the Council will be instrumental in ensuring our province's continued response is effective and collaborative,” said Greg Rickford, Minister of Indigenous Affairs.

Quick Facts

Indigenous women in Canada between the ages of 15-24 are more than three times likely to experience violence than non-Indigenous women.
Indigenous women in Canada are two-and-a-half times more likely to experience spousal violence.
Currently, there is no dedicated provincial forum for Indigenous women and LGBTQ2S leaders and experts to engage on violence prevention issues.

Ministry of Indigenous Affairs


TORONTO —The government of Ontario is providing up to $10 million to Indigenous-owned small and medium sized businesses to help them with much needed capital as the province begins to safely and gradually reopen the economy. 
Loans of up to $50,000 will be available to businesses that are either ineligible for, or unable to access, existing federal and provincial COVID-19 response initiatives for small businesses. The funding is being delivered through the Support for People and Jobs Fund. ""Indigenous businesses are experiencing revenue shortfalls at this time, as many are located in rural or remote areas and operate in hard-hit service sectors such as tourism, hospitality and retail,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Indigenous Affairs. ""This funding responds to their unique challenges and will help them get back up and running so they can contribute to the rebuilding of the provincial economy.""  Loans will be available through Aboriginal Financial Institutions. Up to 50% of each loan will be in the form of a non-repayable grant, with no interest due on the loan portion until December 31, 2022. Businesses may use these funds to cover general expenses such as payroll, rent, utilities and taxes. They may also be used towards increasing production capacity, developing new products, moving to online marketing, or to make improvements to accommodate social distancing requirements, such as the installation of plexiglass barriers.  ""Ontario's small businesses are the backbone of our economy and their recovery is critical to Ontario's recovery,"" said Prabmeet Sarkaria, Associate Minister of Small Business and Red Tape Reduction. ""As many Indigenous small businesses across the province closed their doors and halted business during the COVID-19 outbreak, many struggled to keep the lights on. Today, we are providing these businesses with the support they need to recover and adapt to the challenges of this unprecedented time.""

Quick Facts

Aboriginal Financial Institutions (AFIs) are autonomous, Indigenous-controlled, community based financial organizations providing developmental lending, business financing and support services to First Nations, Métis and Inuit businesses in Ontario.

Convicted - Port Weller Marine Terminal Inc.
Court Location - St. Catharines Court Description of Offence - The conviction relates to the discharge of cement dust that migrated off-site affecting local residential properties.  Date of Offence - On or about July 28, 2016 and ending on or about August 3, 2016 Date of Conviction - June 4, 2020  Penalty Imposed - Port Weller Marine Terminal Inc. was convicted of one violation under the Environmental Protection Act and was fined $50,000 plus a victim surcharge of $12,500 and was given six months to pay the fine.  Background:  Port Weller Marine Terminal Inc. is in Port Colborne and operates a terminal on the Welland Canal which is part of the St. Lawrence Seaway. At the time of the violation, the company was under contract to unload vessels carrying cement clinker, which had been imported by a Port Weller Marine client.  Clinker is a component of cement and is used in cement manufacturing and can become caustic when wet, potentially causing burns to eyes and skin.  The St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation (SLSMC) is the agent of the federal Crown charged with administering the St. Lawrence Seaway. The terminal is also located on lands owned by the federal Crown.  On July 28, 2016, the ministry was notified that clinker dust had migrated off the terminal site and an investigation indicated that despite Port Weller Marine's efforts to contain the dust, a quantity was carried off-site and fell onto residential properties in the area. The company was unaware of the discharge at the time.   An investigation resulted in charges being laid, which resulted in one conviction.   "

PETERBOROUGH COUNTY — The governments of Canada and Ontario recognize the different ways that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted smaller communities across the province. While moving towards recovery, investments in infrastructure in rural and northern Ontario are vital to successful, sustainable communities and their economies. . 
Today, the Honourable Maryam Monsef, Minister of Women and Gender Equality and Rural Economic Development; the Honourable Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure; and J. Murray Jones, Warden of Peterborough County, announced funding for 10 road and bridge projects in Central and Eastern Ontario. In Peterborough County, improvements are being made to approximately 1.4 kilometres of the J.A. Gifford Causeway, including repairs to the Chemong Bridge. An additional 5.3 kilometres on Yankee Line (County Road 14) are also being rehabilitated. This is a joint project by Peterborough County and the Township of Selwyn. These improvements will increase safety for motorists and pedestrians, and extend the life of the bridge and roadway for many years.   Other projects include road improvements in Asphodel-Norwood, Beausoleil First Nation, Collingwood, and Hiawatha First Nation. In addition, bridge repairs and replacements will create safer and more efficient conditions for users of the roadway in Adjala-Tosorontio, Faraday, Highlands East, Minden Hills, and the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte.  The Government of Canada is investing over $22 million in these projects through the Rural and Northern Infrastructure Stream (RNIS) of the Investing in Canada infrastructure plan.

Province Supports Scientific Research to Protect Environment from Invasive Species

June 19, 2020  2:00 P.M.

Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry


SAULT STE. MARIE — The Ontario government is protecting the province from the harmful ecological, social and economic effects of invasive species by investing in management and prevention.   
Today, Ross Romano, MPP for Sault Ste. Marie, announced the province is investing $850,000 in the Invasive Species Centre to support important ongoing research into prevention, early detection, control and eradication of invasive species across the province.   ""Investing in the Invasive Species Centre is an investment in prevention, which is the most effective approach for managing invasive species and vital to the preservation of Ontario's natural resources in the long-term,"" said MPP Romano. ""The Centre does vital work, and we are pleased to be working together with them."" Invasive species can cause significant harm to biodiversity and can affect recreational activities and tourism. Once invasive species become established, it is extremely difficult to remove them, potentially causing long-lasting damage to the environment. Since 2011, the Invasive Species Centre, based in Sault Ste. Marie has collaborated with government, academic, industry and Indigenous communities and organizations to play a significant role in research, response planning, management and habitat restoration. ""Our province is home to an abundance of natural beauty and resources, and our government is committed to protecting the environment for future generations,"" said John Yakabuski, Minister of Natural Resources and Forestry. ""This means that we have to act now to prevent the spread of invasive species that can harm the great outdoors we love and enjoy."" ""Thanks to this provincial investment, the Invasive Species Centre will work with partners to develop new measures to prevent and manage invasive species,"" said Bob Lambe, Chair of the Board of Directors of the Invasive Species Centre. ""Invasive species are among the largest challenges to conservation, and we are committed to working together in the fight against this serious threat."" The ministry will continue to work with conservation partners to coordinate prevention, management, and research activities while promoting public education on the negative impacts of invasive species.

Quick Facts

In 2020-2021, Ontario is investing over $2 million to support ongoing research, monitoring, and management of invasive species across the province.
Ontario is the only jurisdiction in Canada that has standalone invasive species legislation. The Invasive Species Act provides legislative tools to prohibit and restrict certain invasive species and carriers that facilitate the movement of invasive species.
Protecting our environment from invasive species by working with partners and other governments and using tools to prevent, detect and respond to invasions is a commitment under the Made-in-Ontario Environment Plan.

Province Releases School Safety Plan for the 2020-21 School Year

June 19, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Today, the Ontario government released its safety plan for the resumption of class for the 2020-21 school year, outlining scenarios for how students, teachers and staff can safely return to classrooms in September. The plan also provides choice to parents, enhanced online learning, and additional funding. While the decision to return to the normal school day routine will continue to be based on medical advice, boards and schools are being asked to plan for alternative scenarios that may need to be implemented in September depending on the province's COVID-19 situation.
""Nothing is more important than protecting our kids in this province. Parents expect us to take every precaution to keep their children safe when they go back to school in September - and that's exactly what we're delivering today,"" said Premier Ford. ""This plan takes the best medical advice available from our public heath experts to ensure every school board and every school is ready to ensure students continue learning in the safest way possible."" Ontario's plan to safely reopen schools will provide options for parents - to send their children in-class or to enter online learning - with health, safety and well-being at its core. Boards will be asked to plan for the following three scenarios to be implemented in September, depending on the public health situation at the time: Normal school day routine with enhanced public health protocols - Students going to school every day, in classes that reflect standard class size regulations.Modified school day routine - Based on public health advice, an adapted delivery model has been designed to allow for physical distancing and cohorts of students. Under this model, school boards are asked to maintain a limit of 15 students in a typical classroom at one time and adopt timetabling that would allow for students to remain in contact only with their classmates and a single teacher for as much of the school day as possible. This model would require alternate day or alternate week delivery to a segment of the class at one time.At home learning - Should the school closure be extended, or some parents choose not to send their child back to school, school boards need to be prepared to offer remote education. Remote education should be delivered online to the greatest extent possible, including the establishment of minimum expectations for students to have direct contact with their teacher at the same time on a regular basis, also known as synchronous learning. Synchronous learning can be used as part of whole class instruction, in smaller groups of students, and/or in a one-on-one context.The government is instructing school boards to be prepared with a plan, should it be required, that includes an adapted delivery model, which could include alternate day or alternate week attendance, staggered bell times and recess, and different transportation arrangements, among a variety of other considerations to ensure the safety of students and staff. The government's safety plan for schools was created following extensive consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health, health experts on the COVID-19 Command Table, medical experts at The Hospital for Sick Children, education sector partners, frontline workers, parents and students. While this plan reflects the best medical and scientific advice and recommendations available, parents who do not feel comfortable having their children physically return to school will have a choice to pursue online remote learning. ""We are taking every precaution, investing more, and listening to the best medical advice in the country to keep students, staff, and families safe,"" said Minister Lecce. ""I want to assure parents safety is our guiding principle and the right supports are being put in place to ensure our students are set up for success. I am grateful to Ontario students, education staff, and communities for stepping up during this difficult period."" ""Having careful plans in place to reopen schools in September is of the utmost importance for the mental and developmental health of children and youth, as well as their academic success,"" says Dr. Ronald Cohn, President and CEO of SickKids. ""The risk posed by COVID-19 cannot be completely eliminated, however, there are significant steps that can be taken to mitigate risk and protect the health and well-being of students, staff and their families."" Key elements of the safety plan include: guidance for developing health and safety protocols, including the use of personal protective equipment;expectations of an in-class school environment;professional development training for teachers on the new protocols and directions;supports for students with special education needs;enhanced mental health and well-being supports;proposals on how educators and students can move fluidly between in-class and remote learning;guidelines to help schools and boards in their communications with students and parents;guidelines for student transportation systems;expectations for the delivery of curriculum and assessment across subjects and grades;guidance for working with First Nations students, parents and communities;regional options for reopening based on the advice of local public health authorities; anda checklist to help boards in their reopening planning.Moreover, the government announced $4 million in net new funding for cleaning, cleaning protocols, and financial support to hire additional custodial staff in September to ensure schools are safe. School boards have been asked to prepare their own safety plans for the upcoming school year and submit them to the ministry by August 4, 2020. The ministry will be providing all boards with an opportunity to share their draft plans and seek feedback from a formalized table of medical experts that the ministry will be convening. School boards will also be required to communicate with parents and students prior to the start of the 2020-21 school year, outlining the safety plan, guidance on health and safety measures and protocols, and any other changes that will be implemented when schools open in September.

Quick Facts

Ontario is investing an additional $736 million in public education for the 2020-21 school year, for a total of $25.5 billion. This funding, provided through the Grants for Student Needs (GSN) program, represents the largest investment in public education in Ontario’s history.


The Ministry of Education is working in partnership with school boards to deliver high-speed internet to all schools in Ontario, with all high schools having access to broadband by September 2020, and all elementary schools having access by September 2021. As of March 31, 2020, broadband modernization has been completed at 1,983 schools, including 403 northern schools. Installation is currently in progress at 2,954 schools, including 99 northern schools.
School boards, in collaboration with their local public health units, are encouraged to refer to Transport Canada’s recently issued Federal Guidance for School Bus Operations as part of their student transportation planning.
On March 20, 2020, the Ministry of Education unveiled the Learn at Home / Apprendre à la maison portal, which provides online resources for families and students while schools remain closed. 
Through the Ontario Together web site, the province identified over 30 proposals from businesses, organizations and everyday Ontarians to provide solutions to remote learning while schools are closed during the COVID-19 global pandemic.

NIAGARA FALLS - The Ontario government is supporting the Niagara Region's vital tourism sector by providing a $25-million loan to the Niagara Parks Commission to redevelop the historic Canadian Niagara Power Generating Station into a one-of-a-kind, made-in-Ontario attraction.
Today, Lisa MacLeod, Minister of Heritage, Sport, Tourism and Culture Industries, was in Niagara Falls to announce the province's support for the project, which will transform the 1905 heritage building into a thriving tourist attraction, offering visitors an educational experience about Ontario's power generating history, and a unique new perspective on the Falls through a new viewing platform. The minister was joined by Jim Diodati, Mayor of Niagara Falls, Sandie Bellows, Chair of Niagara Parks Commission, Joel Noden, Chair of Niagara Falls Tourism and Rebecca Mackenzie, President and CEO of Culinary Tourism Alliance, for a ribbon-cutting ceremony to officially welcome people back to the Niagara Region as part of Stage 2 of the province's reopening plan. ""This has been a very challenging time for the tourism sector, but today the Niagara Region will begin to reopen its world-class attractions and start down the road to recovery,"" said Minister MacLeod. ""I am proud that our government is supporting the new Canadian Niagara Power Generating Station project. It will be another terrific reason for people to come and visit one of the most attractive destinations in Ontario."" The first phase of the redevelopment of the Canadian Niagara Power Generating Station is scheduled for completion in July 2021, just in time for Niagara Region to welcome athletes, coaches and families from across Canada for the 2021 Canada Summer Games next August. The Ontario government loan will be repaid over 10 years, with the first payment expected in January 2024 after the attraction is fully operational and generating revenue. The government recently announced $1 million in tourism support for Niagara Region through a new $13-million funding partnership between Destination Ontario and Destination Canada. This funding will help to deliver locally driven marketing programs to bolster the local tourism economy. As part of this partnership, the Culinary Tourism Alliance - a not-for-profit food tourism development organization - will receive $100,000. ""As our government moves forward with the safe and gradual reopening of the province, we are encouraging people to travel safely and rediscover the spectacular tourist attractions that Ontario has to offer,"" said Minister MacLeod. In April 2020, Ontario released sector-specific safety guidelines for the tourism and hospitality sectors to help businesses operate and reopen safely in this current environment. The guidelines include enhanced hygiene procedures, physical distancing measures and screening of both workers and guests for health issues. These guidelines can be viewed at www.ontario.ca/covidsafety.

Ontario Protecting Farmers and Food Supply Chain
Legislation to curb on-farm trespass, while preserving the right for lawful protests

June 18, 2020  4:30 P.M.

Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs


WOODSTOCK - The Ontario government is taking action to balance the safety and security of farmers, their families and the provincial food supply with protecting the right for people to participate in lawful protests on public property. Today, Bill 156, the Security from Trespass and Protecting Food Safety Act, 2020, received Royal Assent. Once proclaimed into force, the Act will further protect against the health and safety risks of on-farm trespassing.
""If there's one thing the COVID-19 outbreak has demonstrated, it's the importance of a steady and reliable food supply and the safety of those who feed us,"" said Ernie Hardeman, Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. ""I am more committed than ever to supporting our farmers, food processors and transport sector — the agri-food heroes who have worked so hard to keep food on our grocery store shelves and our kitchen tables throughout this crisis."" In recent years, farmers have faced increased levels of trespass and theft of livestock from their farms as well as mental heath stress due to these threats. Bill 156 will increase protections for those farmers while simultaneously protecting the right for people to participate in lawful protests on public property. The Security from Trespass and Protecting Food Safety Act, 2020 helps deter trespassers by:  Escalating fines of up to $15,000 for a first offence and $25,000 for subsequent offences, compared to a maximum of $10,000 under the Trespass to Property Act;Prescribing aggravating factors that would allow the court to consider factors that might justify an increased fine;Allowing the court to order restitution for damage in prescribed circumstances which could include damage to a farmer's livestock or from theft;Increasing protection for farmers against civil liability from people who were hurt while trespassing or contravening the act, provided the farmer did not directly cause the harm;Removing consent to enter a farm property when it was given under duress or false pretenses. ""Our government will always protect the right for people to participate in lawful protests. The Security from Trespass and Protecting Food Safety Act, 2020 does not change that. However, that right has never included trespassing onto private property and harassing farmers and their families,"" said Minister Hardeman. ""We need to do more to help our agri-food workers focus on contributing to a strong and safe food supply, instead of fearing for their and their family's safety from unlawful trespassing and harassment activity."" Prior to the bill's introduction, the Ontario government consulted with stakeholders across the province to ensure the right balance of protecting Ontario's farmers and the rights of people to participate in lawful protests. Over the coming months, the ministry will continue consulting with stakeholders to develop the regulations that must be put in place before the Act can be proclaimed into force. ""The Ontario Federation of Agriculture and its members appreciate the support of the Ontario government in taking the concerns of Ontario livestock and poultry farmers seriously and acting swiftly to address them by passing Bill 156,"" said Keith Currie, President of the Ontario Federation of Agriculture. ""On-farm trespass causes serious threats to the mental health and well-being of Ontario farmers and significant stress and harm to our animals. The intent of this act is to protect farms, our families and the safety of our food supply chain by addressing the ongoing threat of unwanted trespassing."" Last year, the government passed the Provincial Animal Welfare Services Act, 2019, giving Ontario the strongest penalties in Canada for people who are convicted of animal abuse. The province now has the first fully provincial government-based animal welfare enforcement system in Canada. If anybody in Ontario believes that an animal is being mistreated, they should call 1-833-9ANIMAL or 1-833-926-4625 and have a trained inspector investigate the allegation. ""Dairy farmers in Ontario take the welfare of the animals in our care and the quality of the milk we produce very seriously. The act goes a long way to keeping the integrity of the biosecurity measures we have in place for food safety, and to keeping our animals, families and homes safe from unauthorized visitors,"" said Murray Sherk, Board Chair of Dairy Farmers of Ontario. ""We appreciate the time and attention this government has dedicated to hearing first-hand from dairy farmers across the province and look forward to engaging further as the regulations for the act are considered.""

Quick Facts

The act received broad support from many organizations, including: Rural Ontario Municipal Association, Association of Municipalities Ontario, Ontario Federation of Agriculture, Chicken Farmers of Ontario, Ontario Pork, the Ontario Livestock Transporters’ Alliance, Dairy Farmers of Ontario, Food and Beverage Ontario and the Ontario Mutual Insurance Association.
Nearly 130 municipalities have passed or supported council resolutions calling on the government to strengthen protections for farm families, employees and animals.
Minister Hardeman first introduced Bill 156 on December 2, 2019.

Ontario Proposes to Further Protect Water Resources
Government Consults on Enhancements to its Water Quantity Management Program

June 18, 2020  3:05 P.M.

Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks


TORONTO — The Ontario government is seeking public input on its water quantity management proposal. The proposal aims to protect the long-term sustainability of surface water and groundwater and ensure these important resources are responsibly managed and safeguarded now and into the future, as committed in the province's Made-in-Ontario Environment Plan. The proposal would also give municipalities a greater say in allowing companies to withdraw groundwater in their communities for bottled water. 
""We can't take our water for granted - it is a vital resource for our health and well-being, and to the way of life we all enjoy,"" said Jeff Yurek, Minister of the Environment, Conservation and Parks. ""Ontarians can be confident our water resources are protected by good policy based on solid science and evidence, but we must always be prepared to adapt. Based on initial input from our stakeholders and Indigenous communities, we have put forward proposed enhancements to our water taking rules that will create a more flexible and robust program.""   The proposed changes include:  Requiring water bottling companies to have the support of their host municipalities for new and increasing bottled water takings, with an exemption for small businesses. Establishing priorities of water use in the province that can guide water taking decisions.  Assessing and managing multiple water takings together in areas of the province where water sustainability is a concern. Making water taking data available to the public to increase transparency of how Ontario manages water resources.   The Government encourages the public to provide their feedback on the water quantity management proposal, which is open for public comment on the Environmental Registry until August 2, 2020. These comments will help inform the updates to further protect water resources in Ontario.  The review of water resources in Ontario, which is supported by independent experts, found that the government's current approach to managing water takings is effective. The review also identified opportunities to build on our current framework to ensure that we can manage water takings sustainably in situations when water supplies may be limited. 

Quick Facts

In December 2019, the province extended the moratorium on new or expanded groundwater takings by water bottling companies to October 1, 2020. 
To ensure Ontario’s review of water taking resources was comprehensive, the ministry retained an expert water resources consulting firm, BluMetric Environmental Inc., to assess water resources in select areas of the province. 
The ministry’s findings on water bottling were independently validated by a panel from Professional Geoscientists Ontario.
In Ontario, water bottling companies are charged an additional $500 per million litres of groundwater taken to produce bottled water.
Water bottling is significantly less than 1 per cent of the total permitted water taken in Ontario.
Lakes and rivers in Ontario, including the Great Lakes, contain about one fifth of the world’s fresh water. 
Ontario’s drinking water continues to be among the best protected in the world.

Spring 2020 P3 Market Update Signals Government’s Commitment to Build

June 18, 2020  2:00 P.M.

Ministry of Infrastructure


TORONTO - The Ontario government continues to move forward with 37 major infrastructure projects across the province using the public-private partnership (P3) model. The projects were listed in the Spring 2020 P3 Market Update (known in the market as updates to the ""P3 Pipeline""), which was released today by Laurie Scott, Ontario's Minister of Infrastructure.
""The message today is clear, our government is moving from shovel ready to shovels in the ground,"" said Minister Scott. ""The P3 Market Update signals to the infrastructure sector that Ontario remains committed to major infrastructure projects including subways, highways, health care and community safety projects. This is stimulus that will create jobs and contribute to the economic recovery of our province."" The P3 Market Update is a list of public projects in the pre-procurement and procurement stages for which Ontario has committed funding. The list helps potential local and global private sector partners organize their time and resources to make sure Ontario gets robust, innovative and competitive bids for its P3 infrastructure projects. ""Ontario's unique P3 model is a proven, internationally-recognized approach that gets projects done on time and on budget,"" said Minister Scott. ""We look forward to continuing to work with our private sector partners to build these significant projects for the benefit of people today and for generations to come.""  Ontario's P3 model is part of the government's plan to build new infrastructure including transit, highways, schools and hospitals faster, improve productivity, help businesses get goods to markets, and create jobs. ""This spring's update is an important reassurance to industry and the people of Ontario,"" said Ehren Cory, Infrastructure Ontario President and Chief Executive Officer.

Province’s Exposure Notification App Important Pillar of Plan

June 18, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — As the province safely and gradually reopens, the Ontario government is enhancing case and contact management to quickly test, trace and isolate cases of COVID-19 to stop the spread of the virus and prepare for any potential future waves. These additional measures include a comprehensive case and contact management strategy, Protecting Ontarians through Enhanced Case and Contact Management, and, in partnership with the federal government, a new made-in-Ontario national app called COVID Alert.
Details were provided today by Premier Doug Ford and Christine Elliott, Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, and Dr. David Williams, Chief Medical Officer of Health. The government's enhanced strategy focuses on strengthening and standardizing case and contact management by: Ensuring that all new cases and their close contacts are identified early, contacted quickly, investigated thoroughly and are followed up with daily for up to 14 days;Supporting public health units with up to 1,700 additional staff from Statistics Canada;Improving technology tools by modernizing the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS) through the implementation of a new custom-built COVID-19 case and contact management system; andLaunching a privacy-first exposure notification app to alert Ontarians when they may have been exposed to COVID-19.""You can't manage what you can't measure. That's why our government has been relentless in building our testing and contact tracing capacity to track, trace, and contain the invisible enemy we face,"" said Premier Ford. ""As we take our contact tracing strategy to the next level today, I want to thank the federal government for providing more boots on the ground and supporting a privacy-first app that will protect both Ontarians and Canadians alike."" ""Along with the early detection of new cases through the ongoing implementation of our enhanced testing strategy, more effective and efficient case and contact management will ensure that we are able to stop the spread of COVID-19 as we gradually reopen the province,"" said Minister Elliott. ""To support these efforts, we are dramatically expanding staffing levels and getting on with the long-overdue work of replacing outdated systems that no longer meet the needs of public health units."" Ontario is providing updated case and contact management guidance for all public health units to ensure consistency across the province. To continue to ensure cases and their contacts are reached in a timely and effective way to prevent the spread of COVID-19, public health units will: Connect with cases, and with all individuals who have had close contact with a positive case, within 24 hours of being identified;Direct all close contacts to self-isolate for up to 14 days;Follow up with close contacts every day for the duration of their self-isolation; andAdvise testing of all appropriate close contacts.To augment the current provincial capacity of approximately 2,000 case managers and contact tracers, Ontario is providing additional contact tracing staff. New and expanded capacity will be provided through Statistics Canada with access to up to 1,700 additional staff, available to all provinces, for contact tracing. Public Health Ontario will continue overseeing the training and coordination of these additional resources. Over the summer and into the fall, Ontario will continue to build a supplementary pool of contact tracers from the Ontario Public Service and the broader public sector for additional surge capacity, as required. This will allow public health units to perform their other critical functions, including inspections of food premises and water in recreational facilities, and vaccinations. To help Ontarians stay safe as the province reopens and social interactions increase, Ontario will be partnering with the federal government to launch COVID Alert, a new privacy-first exposure notification app, within the next two weeks. The made-in-Ontario app was developed by the Ontario Digital Service (ODS) and a group of volunteers from Shopify. One of the overarching principles is ensuring the privacy and security for all users, which is why the government will leverage BlackBerry volunteer expertise to audit the security and privacy of the application, in addition to the province's internal security reviews. Users will be able to voluntarily download the app and be notified anonymously if they have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 14 days. In Ontario, the app will also provide users with quick access to Ontario's public health advice and resources, and recommend any necessary actions, such as monitoring for symptoms, self-isolation or appropriate next steps on getting tested. Using a national application will help ensure that Ontarians are notified, regardless of which province they are in, helping us towards the goal of ensuring we can all move more freely and safely. Ontario is also implementing a new user-friendly case and contact management system that will integrate with COVID-19 laboratory results from the Ontario Laboratory Information System (OLIS) data, making current processes significantly more efficient and reducing the administrative burden for public health unit staff. A single central system will enable the province to identify provincewide regional trends and hotspots, while protecting personal health information. Custom-built on the Salesforce platform, the new system will also allow for a remote workforce, enabling contact tracing to be quickly ramped up when required. Everyone should continue to follow public health guidelines to stay safe, including physical distancing with people not in your social circle, wearing a face covering if physical distancing is a challenge, washing your hands thoroughly and frequently, and, if you think you have COVID-19 or have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19, getting tested.

Quick Facts

iPHIS was implemented in phases starting on April 1, 2005, with full implementation across the province by the end of that year.

Approximately 97 per cent of new COVID-19 cases are currently being reached by local public health officials within one day, with guidance and direction to contain community spread.

The exposure notification app will not collect personal or location data. It uses Bluetooth technology to send out encrypted, anonymized codes to other nearby phones that have the app. The app was built using the Apple/Google framework for exposure notification to ensure that it leverages global best practices to protect privacy.

No Ontarian will be declined a test at an assessment centre (either through appointment or walk-in, per the processes of each individual assessment centre), especially those who are symptomatic or who are concerned they have been exposed to COVID-19. Visit Ontario’s website to find your local assessment centre and whether you need to call ahead to make an appointment.

Ontario Makes Major Investment in Mental Health and Technology to Support Students 
New resources will help students return to school with the tools they need to succeed

June 18, 2020 11:50 A.M.

Ministry of Education


VAUGHAN - The Ontario Minister of Education, Stephen Lecce, announced $15 million to purchase thousands of classroom computers, and $10 million to hire additional mental health workers. These new resources will help ensure students can return to school with the confidence and the tools they need to succeed. This funding represents the highest amount the Ministry of Education has ever dedicated to these two areas through the Grants for Student Needs (GSN).
Through consultations with Public Health Ontario, the Hospital for Sick Children and front-line workers, the government heard about the need for enhanced mental health supports to respond to COVID-19. This new $10 million investment will provide students with unprecedented direct access to regulated mental health professionals and significantly reduce wait times. ""We know that the COVID-19 outbreak has impacted student mental health and well-being,"" said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education. ""That is why our government is significantly increasing investments in supporting the mental health of students as we prepare for the reopening of schools. This investment represents a considerable increase in mental health funding that will help ensure critical front-line and wrap-around supports are helping those Ontario students who need it most."" Today's announced funding of $10 million is in addition to the government's commitment of $25 million in permanent funding to hire approximately 180 front-line mental health workers in secondary schools across Ontario. ""There is nothing more important than ensuring the health and safety of our children and youth, and that includes mental health,"" said Michael Tibollo, Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. ""Today's announcement will bring much-needed resources to support the mental health of Ontario's students, and moves us one step closer to creating a mental health and addictions system that works for all Ontarians.""  The province also recognizes that access to technology is more important now than ever as students prepare for a new environment which could include both learning at home and in-person learning. That is why the government is providing $15 million to secure up to 35,000 classroom computers. This new technology will help ensure students who face difficulty accessing technology are able to leverage these tools to succeed in the 2020-21 school year. ""COVID-19 is forcing the world around us to change, to adapt, and to embrace the digital landscape,"" said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Education. ""We will invest more in student computers, technology, and internet than any government in Ontario history because we want our youth to retain a competitive advantage. By delivering this funding, we are sending a signal to the country: Ontario is investing in our kids, closing the digital divide, and taking action to ensure all students have the best opportunity to learn when returning to school in the fall."" Access to digital learning resources, as well as internet connectivity and access to devices, have all been identified by school boards and other stakeholders as urgent needs during the current school closure period. The Government is proceeding with internet connectivity at all schools in Ontario, including all high schools by September 2020 and all elementary schools by September 2021. QUOTES: ""School Mental Health Ontario is proud to work together with Ontario school boards to advance student mental health through evidence-based mental health promotion, prevention, and early intervention services.  We welcome this significant new investment in the mental health of students. It will help schools to reach more students with needed supports, and enhances the power of prevention and wellness promotion. Overall, this commitment contributes to a stronger system of mental health support for children, youth, and families in our province."" - Kathy Short, Executive Director, School Mental Health Ontario ""Big Brothers Big Sisters Ontario is honoured to be a part of the provincial government's efforts and investment into the mental health and well-being of all students in Ontario. We are committed to supporting over 20,000 and counting vulnerable youth across our province. We are dedicated to being present for the families, children and youth who need our assistance and are proud to be part of Ontario's recovery efforts."" - Susan Ingram, Executive Director, Big Brothers Big Sisters of Ottawa  ""Technology in education fails when it diminishes the role of the teacher in the learning process. The Ontario Government is committed to solutions that maximize the role of teachers in improving student outcomes for important STEM subjects like math. Knowledgehook, trusted by teachers in 69 of the 72 school districts across Ontario, is used by over 150,000 math teachers globally. Today's announcement by Minister Lecce shows a commitment to help close the digital divide and prepare the next generation of Canadian problem solvers for the global economy by putting educators first."" - Travis Ratnam, CEO, Knowledgehook ""In the last few months, the Ontario government, school boards, teachers, administrators and parents have all worked together and gone to extraordinary lengths to help Ontario students transition to distance, remote or fully online learning. While there is no substitute for teacher-directed learning in the classroom, here at home in Ontario and around the world, we've seen what technology can do to help keep our education system resilient, and to make a real, positive impact in the way students learn."" - John Baker, President and CEO, D2L ""The necessary emergency measures have posed significant risks to the mental health of kids who have been away from their support networks at school. It is to be expected that returning to school will also present unique challenges after a prolonged period of closures. Improving access to mental health professionals and other resources is good news for children and their families."" - Dr. Ronald Cohn, President and CEO of The Hospital for Sick Children

Government protecting small businesses as the province safely and gradually reopens 

June 17, 2020  9:35 P.M.

Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing


TORONTO — Today, the Ontario government passed the Protecting Small Business Act, temporarily halting or reversing evictions of commercial tenants and protecting them from being locked out or having their assets seized during COVID-19. The legislation applies to businesses that are eligible for federal/provincial rent assistance for evictions from May 1, 2020 until August 31, 2020.
""We know COVID-19 has had a significant impact on small businesses, which are the backbone of our economy,"" said Steve Clark, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. ""This Legislation will allow us to protect small businesses and help them get back on their feet so they can continue to create jobs and participate in the rebuilding of the provincial economy."" Landlords and tenants are encouraged to participate in the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) for small businesses. The pause on evictions does not apply to those participating in CECRA for small businesses, as the program requires landlords to enter into a rent reduction agreement with their impacted small business tenants and commits them to a moratorium on evictions for three months. ""Pausing evictions of commercial tenants is another way we are supporting small businesses and providing much needed relief as we work to reopen the economy,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance and Chair of the Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee. ""Working with the federal government, we are providing more than $900 million in relief to tenants and landlords in Ontario through the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance for small businesses.""

Quick Facts

In partnership with the federal government, Ontario is committing $241 million to CECRA for small businesses, which will provide more than $900 million in support for small businesses and their landlords. 
CECRA for small businesses provides forgivable loans to eligible commercial landlords for the months of April, May, and June 2020. Small business landlords would be asked to forgive at least 25 per cent of the tenant's total rent, tenants would be asked to pay up to 25 per cent of rent and the provincial and federal governments would share the cost of the remaining 50 per cent. 
Tenants and landlords can learn who is eligible and how to apply at Ontario.ca/rentassistance. The application deadline is August 31, 2020.

Buy Local to Celebrate Ontario Craft Beer Week and Ontario Wine Week

June 17, 2020  4:00 P.M.

Ministry of Finance


TORONTO — The Ontario government is encouraging consumers to mark Ontario Craft Beer Week and Ontario Wine Week by supporting local beverage alcohol producers as the province takes additional steps to help the sector recover from the impacts of COVID-19.
The government is increasing choice and convenience for consumers by working to expand made-in-Ontario options at the LCBO. This includes increased marketing, converting available shelf space to profile Ontario products, and making more products available for sale, including bag-in-box wine and those made in the province. The supports are effective June 21 until October 2020.  ""Buying local not only supports Ontario's wineries, breweries, cideries, distilleries and other local producers, but it also means getting a quality product to enjoy responsibly,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance. ""Our alcohol sector told us they are being negatively impacted by the measures that have been necessary to contain COVID-19. That's why our government is taking steps to help these local businesses continue providing good jobs for people in Ontario and producing the products consumers enjoy."" This initiative is part of a number of ways the government is supporting Ontario's beverage alcohol sector, including:   Pausing increases to beer and wine taxes, previously scheduled to take effect in spring 2020;Temporarily allowing licensed restaurants and bars to sell alcohol with food takeout and delivery orders between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m.;Temporarily allowing licensed restaurants and bars to sell spirits at a lower price with food takeout and delivery orders;Allowing restaurants and bars to temporarily create or extend outdoor patio spaces to safely accommodate patrons and staff once licensed establishments are permitted to reopen for business;Making it easier for cideries to sell directly to consumers by temporarily removing the requirement for cideries to have five acres of planted fruit to qualify for an on-site store;Extending the Ontario Wine and Grape Strategy to 2021-22, providing $7.5 million annually for VQA Support, $4.8 million annually for marketing and promotion, $250,000 for research and $250,000 for benchmarking; and Extending the Small Cidery and Small Distillery Support Program to 2021-22, providing $2.6 million annually to help eligible businesses grow and scale up their operations. ""Our province is home to some of the best breweries and wineries in the world who produce top quality craft beers and world-class wines. Now more than ever, I encourage you to support Ontario's many great craft producers by choosing and responsibly enjoying local,"" said Ernie Hardeman, Ontario's Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. With most of the province in stage two of Ontario's Framework to Reopen Our Province, many people can now enjoy Ontario-made beverage alcohol on patios of their local bars and restaurants. ""People and businesses in Ontario have been significantly affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, including the beverage alcohol industry and workers,"" said Attorney General Doug Downey. ""These Made-in-Ontario businesses play an essential role in the success of our local economies and the vibrancy of communities in our province. Our government will keep working to support this important sector through these challenges.""

Quick Facts

This year, Ontario Craft Beer Week and Ontario Wine Week runs from June 14-20.
On Wednesday June 3, Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance, held a beverage alcohol sector industry roundtable to meet with stakeholders and listen to how COVID-19 is impacting their businesses. This meeting was part the Ontario Jobs and Recovery Committee’s ongoing consultations to ensure a strong economic recovery. 
The government is committed to upholding the highest standards for social responsibility, including the strong regulatory framework that is in place for alcohol sales, which includes a minimum age to purchase alcohol, mandatory staff training and minimum retail prices.

Province Enters Stage 2 of Reopening Amidst Extraordinary Progress in Stopping the Spread of COVID-19 and Protecting Public Health and Safety

June 17, 2020  1:00 P.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — Today, Premier Doug Ford issued the following statement reflecting on the province's response to an unprecedented international public health crisis:
""Three months ago, our government made the difficult, but necessary decision to enact a provincial Declaration of Emergency in response to the outbreak of COVID-19, closing down non-essential businesses and limiting organized public events and social gatherings. It marked the beginning of one of the darkest periods in our province's history. Our government, joined by thousands of frontline health care workers, volunteers, businesses, and the 14.5 million people who call this province home, rallied immediately to stop the spread of COVID-19. The collective call to action was inspiring, but as we all know, it has been a long and difficult road with losses far greater than anyone could have imagined. I am proud and grateful for how everyone from every corner of the province has gone above and beyond in the face of this global crisis. Since the first sign of the outbreak, we have been laser-focused on supporting our frontline workers and building the capacity that our health care system needed to respond to this threat. Thanks to the diligent work of our hospitals and their top-notch staff, Ontario now has a total of 21,425 acute care beds and 3,276 critical care beds, 2,583 of which are equipped with ventilators. During the peak of the outbreak, the system freed up between 5,000 and 6,000 acute care beds, and had preparedness plans in place to go up to 11,000 acute care beds if needed. Within weeks, we built a network of over 30 laboratories to ramp up our testing capacity, starting at about 3,000 per day in March to reaching over 20,000 a day in recent weeks. Ontario now leads the country in testing capacity. Public health units have also increased their capacity to conduct rapid case and contact tracing, respond to outbreaks, and support local response efforts. We have been tireless in our efforts to ensure frontline workers have the personal protective equipment (PPE) they need to carry out their heroic work in hospitals, long-term care homes and other care settings. We mobilized the manufacturing might of Ontario to make the PPE we need here at home and to showcase ""Ontario Made"" as the gold standard worldwide for quality medical supplies and equipment. Through the Ontario Together portal, thousands of leads on emergency supplies have resulted in more than $610 million in purchases of critical equipment, including 10,040 ventilators, 123 million masks, four million face shields, 173 million surgical gloves, and 21 million gowns. To fortify the iron ring of protection around our seniors, we have provided our long-term care homes with $243 million in emergency funding to hire staff, purchase supplies, and increase capacity. Thanks to our hospital partners, rapid response teams are working with 150 of our long-term care homes across the province to support infection protection and control and staffing needs. We are also incredibly grateful to our brave men and women in the Canadian Armed Forces who have been deployed to provide critical support in seven of our long-term care homes. Above all, the people of this province have shown the true Ontario spirit with countless individuals volunteering in their communities and caring for those in need. Thanks to our partnership with Spark Ontario, over 4,300 volunteers have signed up to help people affected by COVID-19. Thousands of volunteers, including retired nurses and medical students, put up their hand to manage the phone lines at Telehealth Ontario and assist with case management and contact tracing. Through Ontario's Health Workforce Matching Portal, over 24,400 volunteers have asked to be matched with organizations in need of help, including our long-term care homes. As we work to find a treatment or vaccine for COVID-19, we must remain ready for any scenario. I will continue to press the federal government to provide the necessary long-term and sustained funding commitment that will ensure Ontario has the strong health care system and the strong economic recovery it deserves. Our province alone faces up to $23 billion in additional cost pressures related to health care, protecting our most vulnerable seniors, and supporting our municipal partners in delivering critical services. Ottawa must come to the table with serious commitments to funding support. I want to thank each and every person in Ontario for their collective efforts during this unprecedented time. As we gradually reopen our economy, we will continue to support Ontario families and businesses, so they can get back on their feet quickly and get back to work safely. These are the challenges that define a province and its people. While tough times still lie ahead of us, if we stick together and keep looking out for each other, we will come back stronger than ever before.""

Canada and Ontario Support Beef and Hog Farmers During COVID-19
Funding will cover increased costs, while redirecting surplus pork to those in need

June 17, 2020 10:00 A.M.

Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs


WOODSTOCK — The governments of Canada and Ontario are investing up to $10 million in emergency assistance for beef and hog farmers. The funding will help cover the increased costs of feeding market ready cattle and hogs due to COVID-19 related processing delays, while redirecting surplus pork products to help those in need. This program will help ensure the country's food supply chain will remain strong and ready to recover as the economy gradually and safely reopens.
The beef cattle set-aside program will provide beef farmers with up to $5 million in support. Farmers can claim $2 per head of cattle per day to help pay for additional maintenance costs should they have to keep their market-ready animals on their farms for extended periods of time. The hog sector support program will also provide hog farmers with up to $5 million to help cover additional maintenance costs. Ontario is also providing up to $1.5 million to process and package surplus pork for food banks, to provide those in need with fresh, locally produced pork products. This will assist the pork processing industry with managing capacity while helping those in need. ""We are grateful to our hardworking farmers who are providing Canadians with safe and healthy meat products,"" said the Honourable Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. ""This investment is another way we are supporting the agricultural sector to ensure a stable meat supply and keep high-quality and affordable Canadian meat products on our grocery store shelves and kitchen tables."" ""During consultations with the pork and beef sectors, the need for emergency support to help them maintain their operations during COVID-19 was clear,"" said Ernie Hardeman, Ontario Minister of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. ""We understand the challenges that our farmers are facing and we are working with our commodity organizations to address their priorities and help our farmers manage through these unprecedented times."" Both the beef cattle set-aside and hog sector support programs are being offered through AgriRecovery initiatives, under the Canadian Agricultural Partnership. The provincial contributions are part of Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19. ""Ontario's Action Plan: Responding to COVID-19 provided $17 billion in relief, including additional resources for the health care system and direct support for people and jobs,"" said Rod Phillips, Minister of Finance and Chair of Ontario's Jobs and Recovery Committee. ""Throughout the pandemic, farmers have continued playing their vital role feeding the province and supporting our economy. We know these are challenging times  for our farmers so we are stepping up to help cover some of the increased costs they are facing."" ""I would like to thank Minister Hardeman, Minister Bibeau and our federal and provincial governments for their investment into the creation of a beef cattle set-aside program for Ontario,"" said Beef Farmers of Ontario President Rob Lipsett. ""This will be an important tool to have available to help manage potential disruptions within our processing sector. Having this safeguard in place, if it is ultimately needed, is critically important."" ""Ontario Pork appreciates the continued dialogue with the government during this world-wide crisis,"" said Eric Schwindt, Chair, Ontario Pork. ""The announced program is an important first step in helping family pork farms to navigate this stressful situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.""

Quick Facts

The Canadian Agricultural Partnership is a five-year, $3-billion commitment by Canada's federal, provincial and territorial governments to support Canada's agri-food and agri-products sectors.
The province is significantly expanding the Agri-food Workplace Protection Program and committing up to $15 million to enhance health and safety measures on farms and in food processing facilities. The Enhanced Agri-food Workplace Protection Program provides cost-share funding for farmers to purchase Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and implement workplace modifications and other measures. 
The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs has also partnered with the Workplace Safety & Prevention Services (WSPS) to provide agri-food businesses, organizations and associations with educational resources, tools and consulting services to help them implement COVID-19 health and safety protocols. Additional details about businesses that may qualify can be found on the WSPS website.
During the COVID-19 emergency, Foodland Ontario has promoted local foods of all kinds, including lamb and veal, to help consumers choose and buy local, and to market the important sectors that bring food to Ontarians’ tables.

Ontario Extends Emergency Orders
Province Focuses on Safe, Gradual Approach as Reopening Continues

June 17, 2020  7:00 A.M.

Office of the Premier


TORONTO — The Ontario government has extended all emergency orders currently in force under s.7.0.2 (4) of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act. This extension will be in effect until June 30, 2020 to ensure the government continues to have the necessary tools to safely and gradually reopen the province, while continuing to support frontline health care workers and protect vulnerable populations from COVID-19.
""Extending these emergency orders gives our frontline health care providers the necessary flexibility to rapidly respond to urgent needs and protect our most vulnerable,"" said Premier Ford. ""Even though we're seeing decreasing infection rates with increased testing levels, we can't let our guard down just yet. We need to keep these emergency measures in place to support our frontline heroes and we must all continue following the public health advice, so we can reopen more of the province safely and gradually."" While current emergency orders will remain in place until the end of the month, the government will continue to review each one on an ongoing, case-by-case basis to determine when and if they can safely be adjusted or lifted, as part of the province's framework to safely reopen the province. Over the past week, the government announced 31 public health unit regions across the province may proceed to Stage 2 of its Framework for Reopening the Province. This will allow additional businesses and services to reopen and more people to return to work. In addition, larger social gatherings of up to 10 people are now allowed in all parts of the province, and people are encouraged to create or join a social circle. Social circles are different from social gatherings. Social gatherings of people from outside your household are limited to 10 people. A social circle is voluntary, but if adopted should include all household members, and can include family and friends outside the household up to a maximum of 10 people in the social circle, who can interact and come into close contact with one another without physical distancing. To learn how to create a social circle, please see the step-by-step guide. To help stop the spread, people should continue to follow public health guidelines, including practising physical distancing, wearing a face covering where physical distancing is a challenge and washing their hands thoroughly and frequently. Anyone who is worried they may have COVID-19, or who may have been exposed to the virus, is encouraged to go for testing. A full list of emergency orders can be found on the e-Laws website under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act and at Ontario.ca/alert.

Quick Facts

The Government of Ontario declared a provincial emergency on March 17, 2020 under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act. The declaration of emergency was extended and is currently in effect until June 30, 2020.

Ministry of Transportation


COCHRANE - Today, Caroline Mulroney, Minister of Transportation, announced that the Government of Ontario is connecting Northeastern Ontario with a long-awaited highway bypass project in the Town of Cochrane. This project will improve safety and reduce travel times for families and truck drivers, while creating jobs in local communities as the province reopens the economy.
The project will connect Highway 652 to Highway 11, providing an alternate route for travellers and trucks moving goods and reducing traffic on municipal roads. It is anticipated that the bypass could divert approximately 960 vehicles and 195 trucks per day away from municipal roads. ""This is a critical project as it will make it easier and safer for both travellers and truck drivers by reducing traffic on local municipal roads,"" said Minister Mulroney. ""We understand the unique transportation challenges of the North and are committed to ensuring everyone has access to a safe transportation network that supports northern businesses, communities and families. This also includes optimizing bus services and options for passenger rail service."" The province is proceeding with the planning, preliminary design and environmental assessment for the extension of Highway 652 to Highway 11 at Cochrane. This is part of the government's plan to build safer and better highways, while improving and modernizing transportation for families and businesses in Northern Ontario. ""Our government recognizes the need to improve transportation options for the people and businesses of Northern Ontario,"" said Greg Rickford, Minister of Energy, Northern Development and Mines. ""Today, we are taking the next step in this important project that will better connect Northeastern Ontario and help grow the local economy.""

Quick Facts

Ontario is developing regional transportation plans that will help build a better transportation system to keep people and goods moving across the province, including Northern Ontario. This project is part of the province’s plan to get people where they need to go and support economic opportunities in the North. 
The bypass would provide a connection for travellers on Highway 652 to access Highways 11, 574 and 579. 
This is the first phase of the project, which is expected to take up to 2.5 years. Work is anticipated to begin in 2020. 
The bypass is expected to be 2-lanes wide and between 3 and 6 kilometres in length.
The planning, preliminary design and environmental assessment will review the connection to the Rockshield, Tembec and ONR industrial facilities.
