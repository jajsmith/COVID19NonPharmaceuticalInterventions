The initiative will support economic growth in the dairy sector and enhance food self-sufficiency in Newfoundland and Labrador. The Real Dairy Company of Newfoundland Ltd. – a new company consisting of 13 Newfoundland and Labrador dairy farmers and partner Glenstal Foods Limited of Limerick, Ireland – is proposing to establish a facility that will process milk into salted butter and skim milk powder, with potential to eventually expand into cultured products such as cream cheese, sour cream, and yogurt. Provincial Government funding for this project was identified to support employment in rural communities and help open new markets and products for renewable resource-based businesses during the COVID-19 global pandemic. Along with Provincial Government and private investment, the proponent is also seeking Federal Government funding to support this initiative, expected to employ eight to 10 people. More information on the dairy industry in Newfoundland and Labrador can be found in the backgrounder below. The Way Forward on Agriculture – Agriculture Sector Work Plan established growth targets to increase food self-sufficiency by at least 20 per cent by 2022, and to increase secondary processing of food products, including industrial milk. Quotes “Newfoundland and Labrador’s dairy sector is strong and vital, despite the gap left by the loss of local secondary dairy processing facilities in 2013 and 2016. With a combined production and processing value of $125 million annually – and a skilled workforce of more than 1,200 people at 24 dairy facilities across the province – our dairy producers have the knowledge and drive required to bring secondary dairy processing back to this province to create more local jobs and support food self-sufficiency. I’m pleased to offer the Provincial Government’s support for this important and welcome initiative.” Honourable Dwight Ball Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador “Newfoundland and Labrador’s dairy producers work tirelessly to ensure high-quality, nutritious, local dairy products are sustainably produced for, distributed to, and enjoyed by the people of the province. Our dairy producers have identified an exciting and much-needed opportunity to process milk into secondary products that can and should be made right here, the way our supply management system intended. I look forward to seeing this initiative move forward with the full support and cooperation of our federal counterparts.” Honourable Gerry Byrne Minister of Fisheries and Land Resources “We thank the Provincial Government, and particularly Premier Ball and Minister Byrne, for their wholehearted support of this exciting new initiative, and look forward to getting down to the business of once again processing local milk right here at home.” Lee Noel Chair, Dairy Farmers of Newfoundland and Labrador – 30 – Follow us on Twitter: @GovNL and @FLR_GovNL Media contacts Jeremy Reynolds Office of the Premier 709-729-3558 jeremyreynolds@gov.nl.ca Linda Skinner Fisheries and Land Resources 709-637-2284, 632-8167 lindaskinner@gov.nl.ca Lee Noel Dairy Farmers of Newfoundland and Labrador 709-636-1890 lee.noel@nf.sympatico.ca   BACKGROUNDER Information on the Dairy Industry in Newfoundland and Labrador Newfoundland and Labrador’s dairy sector is comprised of fluid milk consumed as table milk, and industrial milk utilized for further processing. Industrial milk can be processed into products such as butter, ice cream, milk powders, and cheese. The closure of two secondary dairy processing facilities in 2013 and 2016 eliminated most industrial milk processing in the province. Smaller niche processors produce less than one per cent of Newfoundland and Labrador’s industrial milk production. As a result, most industrial milk – approximately 16.5 million litres annually, is shipped out of province. The Deer Lake Industrial Park was selected as the site due to its proximity to dairy farms, adjacency to the Trans-Canada Highway, and available site services. The proponent’s initial product development will involve 20 million litres at start-up and increase to 30 million litres of industrial milk annually as new markets are developed.  2020 07 31 12:01 pm  "

FACT (Flexible Assertive Community Treatment) teams provide treatment for individuals 18 years of age and older who are experiencing serious mental illness. The teams offer individuals hands-on assistance with daily living activities, and provide continuous long-term support. FACT teams are often called hospitals without walls because they provide treatment such as medication administration when individuals are unwell and unable to do this themselves. FACT teams also closely monitor individuals, help with hospital admission when needed and also with discharge back to community as soon as possible. Through their long-term engagement with individuals and families and their assertive outreach approach, they help prevent unnecessary emergency room visits and hospital admissions and provide better opportunities for individuals to live well in their communities. FACT teams will be available up to 12 hours a day, seven days a week, from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. An after-hours service will also be available in the event of emergencies. Seven multidisciplinary teams, which include peer support will be available across the province beginning on August 3 in Deer Lake and St. Anthony. Teams in Grand Falls-Windsor and Gander will follow on August 6. St. John’s, Corner Brook, and Happy Valley-Goose Bay will have teams available in September. Work is also underway by the Department of Health and Community Services and the regional health authorities to establish another six teams by the end of 2020. More than 200 staff will work on these teams, and have received FACT training over the last several months. Referrals to the teams can be made by any individual seeking help, general practitioners, psychiatrists, family members or a community agency. For assistance, people can call their local community mental health and addictions office, 811 or visit www.bridgethegapp.ca. The launch of FACT teams is an initiative of Towards Recovery: The Mental Health and Addictions Action Plan for Newfoundland and Labrador. Since the release of Towards Recovery, the Provincial Government has been removing barriers to treatment, making it easier to access supports, changing how services are delivered and working towards eliminating the stigma associated with mental health and addictions. Quotes “We have made significant progress in transforming the way mental health and addictions programs and services are delivered in this province. The community-based services provided by FACT teams will allow individuals with significant mental health issues to receive the supports and care they need while living closer to home”. Honourable John Haggie Minister of Health and Community Services “We’ve long been aware that our mental health system contains gaps. The increasing involvement of lived experience over the last decade is helping to close the gaps with solutions that work. FACT teams, with the inclusion of standardized, trained peer support, is a demonstration of what holistic, person-directed, recovery-focused care can look like.

FACT (Flexible Assertive Community Treatment) teams provide treatment for individuals 18 years of age and older who are experiencing serious mental illness. The teams offer individuals hands-on assistance with daily living activities, and provide continuous long-term support. FACT teams are often called hospitals without walls because they provide treatment such as medication administration when individuals are unwell and unable to do this themselves. FACT teams also closely monitor individuals, help with hospital admission when needed and also with discharge back to community as soon as possible. Through their long-term engagement with individuals and families and their assertive outreach approach, they help prevent unnecessary emergency room visits and hospital admissions and provide better opportunities for individuals to live well in their communities. FACT teams will be available up to 12 hours a day, seven days a week, from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. An after-hours service will also be available in the event of emergencies. Seven multidisciplinary teams, which include peer support will be available across the province beginning on August 3 in Deer Lake, Corner Brook, St. Anthony and Happy Valley-Goose Bay. Teams in Grand Falls-Windsor and Gander will follow on August 6. A St. John’s team will be available in early September. Work is also underway by the Department of Health and Community Services and the regional health authorities to establish another six teams by the end of 2020. More than 200 staff will work on these teams, and have received FACT training over the last several months. Referrals to the teams can be made by any individual seeking help, general practitioners, psychiatrists, family members or a community agency. For assistance, people can call their local community mental health and addictions office, 811 or visit www.bridgethegapp.ca. The launch of FACT teams is an initiative of Towards Recovery: The Mental Health and Addictions Action Plan for Newfoundland and Labrador. Since the release of Towards Recovery, the Provincial Government has been removing barriers to treatment, making it easier to access supports, changing how services are delivered and working towards eliminating the stigma associated with mental health and addictions. Quotes “We have made significant progress in transforming the way mental health and addictions programs and services are delivered in this province. The community-based services provided by FACT teams will allow individuals with significant mental health issues to receive the supports and care they need while living closer to home”. Honourable John Haggie Minister of Health and Community Services “We’ve long been aware that our mental health system contains gaps. The increasing involvement of lived experience over the last decade is helping to close the gaps with solutions that work. FACT teams, with the inclusion of standardized, trained peer support, is a demonstration of what holistic, person-directed, recovery-focused care can look like.

The amendment to the Act would allow individuals with locked in pension accounts early access to a portion of their retirement income, if experiencing sufficient financial strain. The COVID-19 pandemic led to massive lay-offs and job losses, creating financial pressures for many individuals. Since its onset, the Provincial Government has received numerous emails and calls from individuals with locked-in pensions seeking access to retirement assets to assist with financial hardship due to COVID-19. Options are being considered for providing unlocking access to individuals who have previously transferred funds out of a pension plan into a locked in retirement vehicle, or may do so in the future. Newfoundland and Labrador will not consider options to allow unlocking of pension benefits for active pension plan members, consistent with other jurisdictions. Pension legislation is complex and changes to unlocking provisions could have an impact on a wide variety of stakeholders. Providing general unlocking access could challenge the continued stability of the pension system, so sufficient analysis and consultation with stakeholders is required. Individuals who have transferred funds from a registered pension plan into a locked-in retirement savings arrangement are encouraged to participate in the consultations process. Visit engageNL to complete the online questionnaire. Written submissions are also being accepted and can be emailed to ThomasDuggan@gov.nl.ca. Feedback will be accepted until September 30, 2020. Quote “In response to requests from individuals looking to access locked-in pension funds, we are carefully considering options to meet their immediate financial needs. Determining the proper balance in providing early access to one’s retirement benefits and ensuring those savings are there for retirement is a complex issue, and it is important we explore all perspectives. This is a significant decision for government and we welcome input during the consultation process.” Honourable Tom Osborne Minister of Service NL – 30 – Media contact Krista Dalton Service NL 709-729-4748, 685-6492 kristadalton@gov.nl.ca  2020 07 29 10:15 am  "

A key aspect of this change involves eliminating stigma, which is only possible through a new, person-centered, recovery-oriented approach to mental health and substance use. This approach focuses on better community services, enhanced training for medical professionals and first responders, and a new, modern hospital to serve people.” Honourable Dwight Ball Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador “This new hospital is one of many construction projects creating good construction jobs for Newfoundlanders and Labradorians. Local companies that have participated in our business-to-business sessions with the Newfoundland and Labrador Construction Association and we look forward to seeing more local companies working on the construction of this hospital and the new correctional facility next year.” Honourable Steve Crocker Minister of Transportation and Works “Today marks a major step forward on the province’s new adult mental health and addictions hospital. We look forward to continuing discussions with Eastern Health, health care providers, persons with lived experience and their families, community-based agencies and organizations, members on the Recovery Council and the Mental Health and Addictions Advisory Council, and the public to move this project forward. As part of Towards Recovery, this hospital demonstrates our unwavering commitment to design a better mental health and addictions system with early intervention supports and care provided in the community and when needed, a modern, state-of-the-art facility with recovery focused inpatient programming.” Honourable John Haggie Minister of Health and Community Services “Today is an important day as Eastern Health and its partners move forward in building the new adult mental health and addictions facility which will provide high quality, recovery-oriented, person-centered mental health care. The new facility is the culmination of years of hard work and dedication and would not have been possible without very important partnerships – between people with lived experience, community partners, Eastern Health, and the Provincial Government.” David Diamond President and CEO, Eastern Health “In the unprecedented time we are living in and with a future so uncertain, it is comforting to know that The Way Forward has not changed. The COVID-19 world crisis has reminded us that we all have mental health and that our mental health can be compromised at any time. Today’s announcement advances the commitment made by this government to the over 175,000 Newfoundlanders and Labradorians who live with mental health and addictions issues and their families. It shows that we do matter, that mental health matters. We are one step closer to a future that we’ve all dreamed of – where our mental health is as important as our physical health, where health is health.” Paula Corcoran Executive Director, CHANNAL – 30 – Learn more Video of New Adult Mental Health and Addictions Hospital Towards Recovery: The Mental Health and Addictions Action Plan for Newfoundland and Labrador Follow us on Twitter @GovNL, @TW_GovNL and @HCS_GovNL Media contacts Jeremy Reynolds Office of the Premier 709-729-3558 jeremyreynolds@gov.nl.ca Emily Gillingham Transportation and Works 709-729-1758, 730-4607 emilygillingham@gov.nl.ca Kathy Dicks-Peyton Health and Community Services 709-729-6986, 699-1982 KathyDicksPeyton@gov.nl.ca Tracey Boland Eastern Health 709-777-1412, 730-7759 TraceyL.Boland@easternhealth.ca Paula Corcoran CHANNAL 709-753-1138 pjacobs@channal.ca BACKGROUNDER Avalon Healthcare Partnership is a partnership consisting of 13 companies.

Funding from the Government of Canada, the Provincial Government departments of Tourism, Culture, Industry and Innovation, Advanced Education, Skills and Labour and Fisheries and Land Resources, the City of Corner Brook, as well as and Corner Brook Pulp and Paper Ltd. (CBPPL), is making it possible for Grenfell Campus-Memorial University and College of the North Atlantic (CNA), to embark on a major renovation and research initiative. A funding announcement Monday was attended by the Honourable Dwight Ball, Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador; the Honourable Seamus O’Regan, Minister of Natural Resources; Gudie Hutchings, Parliamentary Secretary for Women and Gender Equality and Rural Economic Development and Member of Parliament for Long Range Mountains; the Honourable Gerry Byrne, Minister of Fisheries and Land Resources and MHA for Corner Brook; Corner Brook Mayor Jim Parsons; VP and General Manager, Darren Pelley, CBPPL; Iris Petten, Chair, Memorial University Board of Regents; and, Liz Kidd, CNA President and CEO. A total of $8.9 million is being invested to support the Corner Brook Centre for Research and Innovation and related initiatives. This includes $5.3 million in Provincial Government funding to support an employer-sponsored training program to be developed and delivered by CNA. A further $2.9 million is being invested to enable Memorial University to complete the redevelopment of the Corner Brook Pulp and Paper Limited Human Resources building to house the Centre for Research and Innovation. This includes $1.2 million from ACOA, $1 million from the Emera Entrepreneurship/Innovation Funding, $679,682 from the Provincial Government’s Regional Development Fund, and $50,000 from the City of Corner Brook.

The centre, which will be housed in a vacant building provided by CBPPL who will be in charge of maintaining the facility, will support local and regional economic growth through innovation, research and training, and will serve as the hub of the regional innovation system. There are three related components to the project:  Development of an Innovation Centre in downtown Corner Brook; Research on the use of waste by-products of the mill and new product development; and, The development of training opportunities by CNA.  Regional and community partners are critical to this initiative, which aims to provide the foundation to spark larger, longer-term transformational change in the western Newfoundland region. Key stakeholder groups, such as Western Newfoundland Entrepreneurs, the DIY Society, the City of Corner Brook and Qalipu First Nation, have been consulted and will play a role in future programming. Additional research partnerships with businesses in the western region have also been confirmed, including with West Valley Farms, Anaconda Mining, Hammond Farm, and New World Dairy. Ultimately, key outcomes for the Centre of Research and Innovation will include infrastructure and capacity building, research and development, entrepreneurship and innovation, education and skills training and growth in the agricultural and forest sectors. Benefits are expected for all partners involved, including CBPPL, the two public post-secondary institutions, the City of Corner Brook and community sectors locally and throughout the province. This project will also act as a catalyst for continued communication and collaboration among all stakeholders in pursuit of sustainable growth and innovative practices.

44,44,2020-07-24,Canada,Newfoundland and Labrador,,https://www.gov.nl.ca/releases/2020/fin/0724n01/,Government Website,Provincial Government Releases 2020-21 Fiscal and Economic Update," In the 2020-21 fiscal year, the Provincial Government mobilized spending across government departments to protect the social and economic well-being of Newfoundland and Labrador residents and businesses during the COVID-19 crisis. At the same time, the related drop in the global oil price significantly reduced anticipated provincial revenues. Today, the Honourable Tom Osborne, Minister of Finance and President of Treasury Board, presented a 2020-21 fiscal update that reflects the anticipated impact of these combined pressures as government works to prepare Budget 2020. The current projected deficit for the 2020-21 fiscal year is $2.1 billion, an increase of $1.35 billion from the original Budget 2019 projection from April 2019 of a $796 million deficit for 2020-21. This change is a result of both revenue and expense changes. Revenue projections for 2020-21 decreased by $631 million, primarily as a result of the unanticipated decrease in the global demand for oil:  The average oil price projection is cut in half, from an original projection of $68 US per barrel to $34 US per barrel; This lower price of oil, combined with the longer than anticipated shutdown of the Terra Nova FPSO, has resulted in a projected decrease of $560 million in oil revenues; and A net reduction of $71 million from all other revenue sources.  During the same period, expenses increased by $720 million, including increases resulting from government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The most significant of these changes include:  $261 million in increased healthcare costs as a result of COVID-19 and other pressures; A $200 million contingency fund to address the impacts of COVID-19, approved by the House of Assembly on March 26, 2020. The current net impact of spending from this fund is $118 million; and $127 million as a result of changes to Budget 2019 assumptions on pensions and other post-employment benefits, as well as interest adjustments as a result of higher than anticipated borrowing costs.  These cash flow changes, combined with the delay in the commissioning of the Muskrat Falls project, have resulted in a projected borrowing requirement of $3.2 billion for 2020-21. Consequently, the provincial net debt is anticipated to reach $16.7 billion in 2020-21. As a result of the unanticipated negative economic impacts due to COVID-19, most economic indicators are underperforming when compared to original Budget 2019 projections. Employment projections have been reduced by 11,400 and Real GDP has been reduced by $1.8 billion. This update is a snapshot of current projections, and does not presuppose any Budget 2020 decisions. The Federal Government announcement regarding the Safe Restart Program on July 16 is also not included in this projection, as details on funding allocations are still being determined. Through this agreement, the province will receive a minimum of $146.3 million. The province is also recording a decrease in revenue of $225 million for 2019-20 as a result of the non-cash impairment of White Rose and Hibernia South Extension assets in oil and gas due to the significant decrease in the price of oil, as was announced by Nalcor in July. This changes the 2019-20 surplus estimate to $1.04 billion from the $1.27 billion projection provided in June 2020. Quote “Despite facing both a public health and a fiscal crisis, this province’s effective fiscal management and response to COVID-19 during these challenges is evident when you compare the impacts that other jurisdictions have reported during their recent fiscal updates. Budget 2020 will represent the next phase of our balanced fiscal approach as we lay the groundwork for addressing the new global realities and how they affect Newfoundland and Labrador.” Honourable Tom Osborne Minister of Finance and President of Treasury Board – 30 – Follow us on Twitter: @GovNL and @FIN_GovNL Media contact Marc Budgell Finance 709-729-2477, 689-0430 marcbudgell@gov.nl.ca  2020 07 24 10:15 am  "

To view the Report in its entirety, please go to www.oipc.nl.ca/reports/commissioner Report:           A-2020-009 Report Date: July 22, 2020 Public Body:  Department of Finance Summary:      The Applicant requested from the Department of Finance correspondence between the Department and a Third Party, Atlantic Lottery Corporation (ALC) relating to video lottery terminals. The Department gave notice to ALC that it intended to disclose some of the information. ALC complained to this Office, arguing that some of the information should be withheld based on sections 29 (policy advice or recommendations), 34 (disclosure harmful to intergovernmental relations or negotiations), 39 (disclosure harmful to business interests of a third party) and 40 (disclosure harmful to personal privacy) of the ATIPPA, 2015. The Commissioner in Report A-2017-004 found that ALC was not entitled to rely on sections 29 or 34, and had not met the test for sections 39 or 40, and recommended that the information be disclosed. The Department accepted the recommendation. ALC appealed the Department’s decision to the Supreme Court, which upheld the decision and dismissed the appeal. Another Third Party, the Beverage Industry Association of Newfoundland and Labrador (BIA) appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that it had not been given notice of the original decision by the Department and had therefore had no opportunity to make submissions. The Court set aside the Department’s decision and remitted the matter to the Commissioner for reconsideration after receiving submissions from BIA. On reconsideration the Commissioner found that ALC was not entitled to rely on sections 29 or 34, and that neither ALC nor BIA had met the tests for sections 39 or 40. The Commissioner therefore recommended that the information be disclosed. – 30 – Media contact Sean Murray Director of Research & Quality Assurance 709-729-6309  2020 07 23 12:05 pm  "

The Honourable Dwight Ball, Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, was scheduled to travel to Nunatsiavut in March, but plans were put on hold because of the coronavirus pandemic and the imposition of travel restrictions by public health officials. Discussions continued with officials and representatives of the survivors and their families, with plans to hold events this month. Despite all options being explored, it wasn’t possible under the present public health measures to accommodate the anticipated number of people interested in attending the public events, while ensuring the health of survivors, family members, and residents of Nunatsiavut.

Both governments thank and appreciate the engagement and support of residential schools survivors, their families and representatives for their efforts in trying to make appropriate arrangements for events in each Nunatsiavut community. Quotes “I regret that I am not able to deliver a sincere and personal apology from me, as Premier, on behalf of Newfoundland and Labrador. I commend the former students of residential schools, as well as their families, for demonstrating courage and strength in coming forward to talk about their experiences. An apology cannot undo the harm and the suffering that residential school students and their families endured, but it is an important step in the healing process for Inuit who were separated at a young age from their families, communities, culture and traditions.” Honourable Dwight Ball Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador “On behalf of the Nunatsiavut Government and Beneficiaries of the Labrador Inuit Land Claims Agreement, I want to extend my sincere thanks to Premier Ball for making every effort to deliver long-awaited apologies to residential schools survivors and their descendants, and for understanding the need to ensure all Labrador Inuit have the opportunity to participate in community events without restrictions.

58,58,2020-07-21,Canada,Newfoundland and Labrador,,https://www.gov.nl.ca/releases/2020/tcii/0721n01/,Government Website,Minister Davis Announces Framework to Address Short Term Accommodations," The Honourable Bernard Davis, Minister of Tourism, Culture, Industry and Innovation, today announced the province’s framework to address short term accommodations and plans to amend the Tourist Establishments Act. The Department of Tourism, Culture, Industry and Innovation, has developed a framework that focuses on a whole-of-government approach, working closely with various government departments, along with Hospitality Newfoundland and Labrador, to address the growth of unlicensed short term accommodations in the province. The framework was recently shared with Hospitality Newfoundland and Labrador executives and board members who were supportive of this approach. The first step is proposed amendments to the Tourism Establishment Act and Regulations, to meet the current realities of the tourism market and the industry, while still ensuring the Provincial Government has a role in oversight for all accommodations throughout Newfoundland and Labrador. The primary changes being recommended for amendment, include:  Amending the definition of a tourism establishment, to be more in line with the modern range of available accommodations (including all short term accommodations); Removing the mandatory requirement for Canada Select ratings; Removal of licenses being issued to tourism operators by the department and require registration with the department for all accommodations.  The proposed amendments are intended to ensure a level playing field for all accommodation businesses in the province’s tourism industry. The department is also working with Public Engagement and Planning to develop an online stakeholder engagement questionnaire for accommodation operators. Details on the engagement process will be communicated in the coming weeks. Quotes “Our government encourages and fosters conditions that support small business growth in the tourism industry. Supporting local, registered and licensed operators in the industry is vital. In saying that, we have reached a point where changes to our province’s tourism accommodations policies are needed and modernizing the Tourism Establishments Act is an important first step. We feel the legislation should apply equally to short term accommodations, as the time to level the playing field is now. Online accommodation platforms may be popular with travelers, but there is a need for short-term establishments to become registered and comply with applicable municipal and provincial regulations and taxation requirements. By directly engaging with accommodation operators, this will help to inform government of the improvements needed and how to assist the industry. We are committed to working on solutions and continue working with the tourism industry, throughout this process.” Honourable Bernard Davis Minister of Tourism, Culture, Industry and Innovation “At Hospitality NL, we have been advocating for a review of the Tourism Establishment Act for quite some time, and are pleased to work with our Provincial Government to ensure the legislation means more quality and regulated accommodations for this province.

The Honourable Gerry Byrne, Minister of Fisheries and Land Resources, today announced $100,000 to determine the feasibility of establishing seafood live holding and cold-storage logistics at Gander Airport and Port aux Basques. This funding supports efforts to create jobs in Newfoundland and Labrador’s fisheries and aquaculture sectors, and assists processors and aquaculture operators to expand their product lines and markets. Live holding and cold-storage capacity strategically located at Gander Airport and Port aux Basques could enable air shipment and delivery of fresh and live seafood products to Canadian, US, European, and Asian markets and provide as-needed holding for product stranded in Port aux Basques due to weather conditions. This initiative is part of a plan to support renewable resource-based businesses and employment in rural communities during the COVID-19 global pandemic through investments in the forestry, agriculture, fisheries and aquaculture sectors. Quotes “Newfoundland and Labrador’s $1.4-billion seafood sector depends on strong, reliable infrastructure to reach its global markets. This feasibility study – led by industry to support industry’s needs – will identify how best to ensure our high-quality products reach customers all over the world safely, and in excellent condition.” Honourable Gerry Byrne Minister of Fisheries and Land Resources “The Seafood Processors of Newfoundland and Labrador are pleased to be working with our Department of Fisheries and Land Resources on this important project. For the past two years our members have been engaging with partners such as the Gander International Airport Authority to identify ways to ensure our superior seafood products reach global markets. This initiative will provide us with the necessary tools and resources to help achieve that goal. We appreciate the support and encouragement from Minister Byrne who has been on board since our first discussions.” Francis Littlejohn Executive Director Seafood Processors of Newfoundland and Labrador Inc. “One of the benefits of living on a remote island in the North Atlantic is the pristine waters off our coast that enable hard-working Newfoundland and Labrador seafood farmers to cultivate organic blue mussels and oysters that are in high demand here at home and around the world. Being a remote island also periodically presents challenges of getting product to export markets in a timely fashion. Strategically placed live holding capacity at ports may be a logistical solution to enhancing and increasing live shellfish exports”.

A summary of the Report is included below. To view the Report in its entirety, please go to www.oipc.nl.ca/reports/commissioner Report:           AH-2020-001 Report Date: June 30, 2020 Public Body:  Workplace, NL Summary: The Complainant filed a request under the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act, 2015 (ATIPPA, 2015) for correction of personal information in a file held by WorkplaceNL relating to his application for compensation. The record in question is the report of a medical practitioner containing his opinions and observations of the Complainant’s injury and its impact on his ability to return to work. The record informed WorkplaceNL’s decision to deny the Complainant’s claim for compensation. Upon receiving the Complainant’s request for correction, WorkplaceNL determined that the record in question contained personal health information and was therefore subject to the Personal Health Information Act (PHIA) and processed the request pursuant to the provisions of that Act. WorkplaceNL refused to make the requested correction under section 62 of PHIA on the basis that it did not create the record and that the record was a professional opinion or observation within the meaning of section 62. The Complainant disputed the applicability of PHIA and applied to the Commissioner for a review of WorkplaceNL’s decision, also alleging WorkplaceNL had not discharged its duty to assist under section 13 of ATIPPA, 2015. The Commissioner determined, based on a plain reading of the provisions relating to “personal health information” in both Acts that WorkplaceNL had properly interpreted the request as being made under PHIA. The application of section 62 was previously discussed by the NL OIPC in Report AH-2014-001. Applying the analysis articulated in the earlier report, the Commissioner determined that WorkplaceNL properly refused to correct the information as it related to a professional opinion or observation. The Commissioner also found that ATIPPA, 2015 was not applicable and therefore WorkplaceNL could not have been in breach of section 13 of that Act. – 30 – Media contact Sean Murray Director of Research & Quality Assurance 709-729-6309  2020 07 14 4:10 pm  "

To view the Report in its entirety, please go to www.oipc.nl.ca/reports/commissioner Report:           A-2020-008 Report Date: July 10, 2020 Public Body:  Memorial University of Newfoundland Summary: The Complainant requested records from Memorial University of Newfoundland (“Memorial”) relating to the production of certain e-mail messages. Memorial withheld some records on the basis of section 30 (solicitor-client privilege), section 39 (business interests of a third party) and section 40 (personal privacy). The Complainant filed a complaint with this Office, alleging that Memorial had wrongly applied the exceptions to disclosure and had failed in its duty to conduct a reasonable search for records and to respond to the Complainant in an open, accurate and compete manner under section 13 of the Act. The Commissioner found that Memorial had properly applied the section 30 exception to the records; that it was not necessary to assess the application of sections 39 and 40; and that Memorial had fulfilled its duty under section 13 of the Act. The Commissioner therefore recommended that Memorial continue to withhold the records. – 30 – Media contact Sean Murray Director of Research & Quality Assurance 709-729-6309  2020 07 14 4:25 pm  "

98,98,2020-07-10,Canada,Newfoundland and Labrador,,https://www.gov.nl.ca/releases/2020/tcii/0710n02/,Government Website,Newfoundland and Labrador Welcomes Newest UNESCO Global Geopark," Discovery Geopark has become Newfoundland and Labrador’s first United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) recognized Global Geopark. With this distinction, Discovery Geopark becomes the fifth UNESCO Global Geopark in Canada, joining 161 other geosites to receive this recognition throughout the world. Located on the tip of the Bonavista Peninsula, the Discovery Geopark covers approximately 280 kilometres of coastline from Southern Bay to Bonavista, with 10 developed geosites that showcase the region’s diverse geological, natural and cultural diversity. Two geosites in Port Union contain Ediacaran fossils – some nearly 600 million years old, while the geosite located at Murphy’s Cove to Lodge’s Pond Trail is where internationally renowned Haootia quadriformis was discovered. This is the first fossilized evidence of muscular tissue, and possibly the oldest animal fossil in the world. Haootia is currently on display at The Rooms provincial museum. This announcement by UNESCO follows more than a decade of preparation by the Discovery Geopark committee, which has dedicated countless hours of time and resources toward planning, community outreach, research, and advocacy of geo-tourism. In addition to funding support from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Industry and Innovation and Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA), this project received assistance from the provincial Department of Natural Resources and Memorial University. UNESCO Global Geoparks are single, unified geographical areas where sites and landscapes of international geological significance are managed with a holistic concept of protection, education and sustainable development. Quotes “Congratulations to the Discovery Geopark Board and staff for their efforts and hard work to have the geopark recognized by UNESCO. Solidifying this designation raises the area’s geological significance on the world stage, and compliments the many high quality tourism experiences already found on the Bonavista Peninsula.” Honourable Bernard Davis Minister of Tourism, Culture, Industry and Innovation “I am pleased that the Provincial Government’s Geological Survey was able to provide technical support towards the efforts of the people from the Bonavista Peninsula area and their application for the Discovery Geopark to be designated a UNESCO Global Geopark. This designation will help inform people about the sustainable use and need for natural resources, while at the same time promoting respect for the environment and the integrity of the landscape. This complements our commitment to supporting the development of our geological resources in a responsible manner to the maximum benefit of our citizens.” Honourable Siobhan Coady Minister of Natural Resources “The designation of the Discovery Geopark as a UNESCO Global Geopark is a huge step forward for tourism in this spectacular part of Newfoundland and Labrador. This international recognition will help even more visitors discover the Bonavista Peninsula and its many hidden gems, while supporting local tourism as it recovers from COVID-19. Our message to our tourism sector is clear: we’ve been here for you with immediate measures, we’re here for you now as our economy reopens and we’ll get through this together. We’re working with you to support good jobs and help tourism in Newfoundland and Labrador come back strong.” Honourable Mélanie Joly Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages and Minister responsible for ACOA “Our government is delighted that Discovery Geopark has received UNESCO Global Geopark status. We commend the organization, all partners, communities in the region and everyone who played a role in its quest to become a UNESCO Global Geopark – you should all be proud of such an amazing accomplishment. This special designation will promote the unique culture and geological heritage on the Bonavista Peninsula worldwide, attract more visitors to the region and help generate new opportunities for tourism and economic growth.” Churence Rogers Member of Parliament for Bonavista-Burin-Trinity “Congratulations to the Discovery Geopark board and committee members on receiving UNESCO Global Geopark status. This grass roots project has been led by volunteers from throughout the Bonavista region for over a decade. Representatives from our not-for-profit, business and municipal sectors have worked with all levels of government through invaluable investments of time and resources to solidify this incredible designation. Today this UNESCO brand inscription on the Bonavista Peninsula, adds another valuable piece to our ever-strengthening tourism offerings, while enhancing sustainable economic growth in a rural area. Once again the Bonavista Peninsula has a reason to celebrate as we are highlighted on the international stage.” John Norman Chair, Discovery Geopark – 30 – Learn more Discovery Geopark UNESCO Global Geoparks Canadian Geoparks Network Follow us on Twitter: @GovNL and @TCII_GovNL Media contacts Eric Humber Tourism, Culture, Industry and Innovation 709-729-4819, 725-9655 erichumber@gov.nl.ca Lisa Lawlor Natural Resources 709-729-5777, 631-8155 Lisalawlor@gov.nl.ca Paul McGrath ACOA NL 709-689-5731 paul.mcgrath@canada.ca John Norman Discovery Geopark 709-468-8696 johnnorman21@gmail.com    2020 07 10 9:45 am  "

The regulations were amended after extensive review and consideration of feedback received during online public consultations hosted earlier this year by the Department of Fisheries and Land Resources at engageNL.ca. Department officials have also held discussions with hunting organizations and advocates who outlined their support for implementation of these changes. Additional information is available in the backgrounder below. Further details can also be viewed in the online Hunting and Trapping Guide at the Department of Fisheries and Land Resources website. Quotes “Amendments to our wildlife regulations recognize the tremendous value of enhancing traditional hunting activities in our province. Permitting the use of crossbows and .17 calibre ammunition builds upon the world-class hunting experiences already available in Newfoundland and Labrador, while attracting still more participants to this great pastime.” Honourable Gerry Byrne Minister of Fisheries and Land Resources “The Labrador Hunting and Fishing Association Inc. is encouraged by the proactive amendments to the Wildlife Regulations to permit the use of Crossbows and .17 HMR ammunition for hunting in Newfoundland and Labrador. These new regulations will better align hunting and trapping practices in Newfoundland and Labrador with other Canadian provinces and territories and will be welcomed by outdoor conservationists.” Mr. Tony Chubbs President, Labrador Hunting and Fishing Association Inc. – 30 – Learn more Regulations, Acts and Orders for Hunters/Trappers Hunting and Trapping Guide Follow us on Twitter: @GovNL and @FLR_GovNL Media contacts Craig Renouf Fisheries and Land Resources 709-637-2923, 640-6922 craigrenouf@gov.nl.ca Tony Chubbs Labrador Hunting and Fishing Association Inc. techubbs@cablelab.net BACKGROUNDER  Amendments to Provincial Wildlife Regulations Permitting the use of Crossbows  Amendments to provincial Wildlife regulations now permit hunters to allow the use of crossbows to hunt big game and small game species under a valid licence. Crossbows will now be considered another firearm incorporated for use on the regular big game licenses.  No special permitting will be required, however normal mandatory hunter safety training is required.  Crossbows are not permitted for use during the two-week early bow hunting season at this time. New user guidelines associated hunting with a crossbow, long bow or compound bow will be incorporated into the province’s current Firearms Safety/Hunter Education Program and updated in the online Hunting and Trapping Guide. Persons with disabilities advise that new regulations allowing the use of crossbows for hunting could also be beneficial in cases where upper limb mobility issues create challenges associated with being able to draw and hold a bowstring on a long bow or compound bow. Permitting the use of crossbows is consistent with regulations in other Canadian jurisdictions and is expected to enhance local interest and involvement in hunting as well as provide new opportunities for the outfitting sector to market by being able to promote new big game hunting experiences for Newfoundland and Labrador.  Permitting the use of Smaller Calibre .17 HMR Ammunition  Amendments to provincial Wildlife regulations now permit the use of .17 calibre rim fire HMR ammunition for hunting small game and furbearers. Ammunition manufacturers recommend that .17 caliber rimfire rifle ammunition is a suitable choice for target shooting, small game hunting and for safe and humane dispatch of furbearing animals caught in restraining traps. Permitting type .17 HMR rim fire ammunition for use in Newfoundland and Labrador is recognized as a highly accurate and efficient ammunition type for hunting small game in most other parts of Canada.   2020 07 10 10:30 am  "

Through Budget 2019, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador provided $1 million and the Government of Canada today announced $770,000 that will purchase and install 28 electric vehicle chargers across the province to support the transition to a clean energy future. Currently, there is limited charging station infrastructure available for public use in Newfoundland and Labrador, particularly outside the St. John’s area, to enable electric vehicles to travel long distances. This funding will help Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro to build a fast-charging electric vehicle network along the Trans-Canada Highway, connecting St. John’s to Port aux Basques, including one location in Gros Morne National Park. Fourteen sites will contain both a fast charger and a Level 2 charger. Construction of the first site is scheduled to start in September. Investments in electric vehicle charging infrastructure will facilitate increased demand for electric vehicles in the province, contributing to electrification efforts. Additionally, it will help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector, provide rate mitigation benefits, and provide operational savings for electric vehicle owners. These investments build on commitments from both the federal and provincial governments to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. This initiative also builds on the commitment from The Way Forward on Climate Change to develop a comprehensive long-term strategy to increase electric vehicle penetration in consultation with the electric utilities, municipalities and industry. Visit Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro’s Electric Vehicle Charging Network webpage for more information. Quotes “Electrification of Newfoundland and Labrador’s economy is a key energy priority given that 98 per cent of the province’s electricity will come from renewable energy by 2021. The development of the province`s first electric vehicle fast-charging network will enable electric vehicle owners to travel long distances and will remove one of the largest barriers to domestic electric vehicle ownership.” Honourable Siobhan Coady Minister of Natural Resources “One of our commitments in the Climate Change Action Plan is to develop a long-term strategy to increase use of electric vehicles in our province to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. With this fast-charging electric vehicle network, electric vehicle owners can now have increased confidence that when exploring our province or traveling across the Trans Canada Highway, they will have access to charging stations.” Honourable Derrick Bragg Minister of Municipal Affairs and Environment “Zero emissions vehicles are part of Canada’s net-zero future. Our government is working to give people in our Province greener options to get where they need to go.” The Honourable Seamus O’Regan Canada’s Minister of Natural Resources “Hydro is focused on meeting customer needs today, while also planning ahead for future electricity needs in Newfoundland and Labrador. As the electric vehicle market continues to expand, we have listened to customers and we’re excited to advance this initiative now, supporting a greener future for our province, and providing clean, renewable, road-trip-ready energy for years to come.” Jennifer Williams President, Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro  Learn more The Way Forward on Climate Change in Newfoundland and Labrador Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro Natural Resources Canada Follow us on Twitter: @GovNL, @NR_GovNL  and @MAE_GovNL Media contact Lisa Lawlor Natural Resources 709-729-5777, 631-8155 lisalawlor@gov.nl.ca Lynn Robinson Municipal Affairs and Environment 709-729-5449, 691-9466 lynnrobinson@gov.nl.ca Erin Squires Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro 709-737-1311 erinsquires@nlh.nl.ca Natural Resources Canada Media Relations 343-292-6100 nrcan.media.rncan@canada.ca Ian Cameron Press Secretary Office of the Minister of Natural Resources 613-447-3488 Ian.Cameron@canada.ca  2020 07 10 2:20 pm  "

The province continues to have no active cases. Two hundred and fifty-eight people have recovered from the virus. To date, 19,184 people have been tested.

115,115,2020-07-06,Canada,Newfoundland and Labrador,,https://www.gov.nl.ca/releases/2020/eecd/0706n01/,Government Website,Provincial Government Provides Plan for a Return to School for K-12 Students in September," Today the Honourable Dwight Ball, Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador and the Honourable Brian Warr, Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development, outlined a comprehensive plan for a return to school in September that will enable school districts and parents to plan proactively while prioritizing the safety and well-being of students and school communities. Current literature notes that children and youth are less susceptible to the risk of COVID-19 and that school closures increase inequalities in learning, particularly for those who are vulnerable. With this in mind, it is critical to balance the risks of returning to school with the impacts on the physical and mental health of students. The focus of the Newfoundland and Labrador K-12 Education Re-entry Plan is to maximize in-person attendance in the K-12 education system while ensuring health and safety measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission for students, all teaching staff, support workers and families.  The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador is following recommendations and the advice of various expert organizations including public health officials both provincially and nationally. The plan offers guidance on a wide range of operational areas including physical distancing measures, hygiene and cleaning protocols, transportation, food services, curriculum outcomes, assessment, and guidance for students with exceptionalities, among others. School districts will plan for three scenarios for the fall:  Scenario 1: In-school classes resume (near normal with health measures) Scenario 2: In-school classes partially resume (with additional health measures) Scenario 3: At-home learning (in-school classes are suspended/cancelled)  The preferred and anticipated scenario is that students will return to daily in-school classes at the beginning of the year. However, school districts are asked to prepare for implementing any of the three possibilities during the upcoming school year, including on short notice. Officials with public health and the department will be monitoring the situation closely and will provide any necessary updates prior to the beginning of the school year. The re-entry plan balances the need for provincial standardized approaches in some areas while also providing flexibility and recognition of the school districts’ ability to meet health guidelines in the most effective ways in their own communities. The Newfoundland and Labrador K-12 Education Re-entry Plan and associated documents can be found at the links in the Learn More section below. Quotes “This plan puts the safety of students, educators, staff and families first and is based on the expertise and advice of public health and medical professionals from the province, across the country and around the globe. We would be remiss if we did not make every effort to reopen schools, knowing the impacts that extended closures can have. By following public health measures I believe we can successfully live with COVID-19 in our school communities, as we are doing elsewhere in the province and throughout the world.” Honourable Dwight Ball Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador “We are preparing and hopeful that schools will reopen and daily classes will resume in September; however, we must also be prepared for all possibilities. The re-entry plan provides clear direction and the certainty that educators and families need to plan ahead and prepare for what the new school year may look like. I want to thank all of our education partners for their input and expertise in this planning process.” Honourable Brian Warr Minister of Education and Early Childhood Education “The plan set forth by the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador balances the educational, social, and emotional benefits of children attending school, with the risks of COVID-19. The plan also supports the importance of living safely with COVID-19.” Dr. Janice Fitzgerald Chief Medical Officer of Health “The Newfoundland and Labrador English School Board is committed to implementing a plan for September reopening of schools which will maximize the amount of in-class instruction for all students, within the parameters set by public health authorities, and keeping student and staff health and safety top of mind.” Goronwy Price Chair, Newfoundland and Labrador English School Board “The Conseil scolaire francophone provincial is focused on the well-being of all and learning excellence for our students.

The devices will be distributed as they become available through a public procurement process which is underway. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted how technology is central to education that is learner-centred and accessible from anywhere, allowing for the continuation of teaching and learning when there is an interruption to in-school classes. The investment will ensure equal access to education so that every student, regardless of their ability, location or socio-economic status, can continue their learning outside of the classroom, while providing teachers with the tools they need to effectively deliver remote instruction. It will also move the K-12 system toward a true digital learning environment, a cornerstone of both The Way Forward and the Education Action Plan, which includes the expansion of supportive technology across all nine focus areas of the Action Plan, such as inclusion, student mental health and wellness, mathematics and reading. Quotes “We are setting the foundation for a digital learning plan to not only address immediate needs in September, but to create quality learning opportunities into the future. It is a critical investment to support 21st century teaching and learning and supports the Education Action Plan, particularly for students with exceptionalities, through increased accessibility and expansion of supportive technology.” Honourable Dwight Ball Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador “Like jurisdictions around the globe, the pandemic has highlighted the need for enhanced digital learning. This significant investment will ensure we are able to provide all students, regardless of the situation with COVID-19, every possible opportunity to succeed. Teachers will have the technology and professional learning to empower them to teach in a virtual environment and students can interact in a meaningful way with their teachers.” Honourable Brian Warr Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development “This significant investment in technology for students and teachers recognizes the importance of having equity of access to digital learning opportunities. No matter how the 2020-21 school year evolves, this is an important investment in the present and future delivery of education in Newfoundland and Labrador. Our collective energies are now focused on September – and welcoming our students and teachers back to their classrooms, with all the necessary public health measures in place.” Goronwy Price Chair, Newfoundland and Labrador English School Board “An investment in technology is an investment in our students and teachers. This funding will enable stronger and more robust digital learning to ensure that our students and teachers are well equipped and that we are ready for any scenario, regardless of how COVID-19 unfolds.

Frounce interferes with a bird’s ability to eat and swallow. Affected birds are weak, lose weight, and may have food material stuck to the feathers around the face. The parasite spreads in bird droppings, or in birdseed regurgitated by sick birds, and accumulates wherever birds are feeding. Testing at the Canadian Wildlife Health Co-operative laboratory has confirmed the presence of frounce in Newfoundland and Labrador. The Department of Fisheries and Land Resources expects to see sick and dying songbirds throughout Newfoundland and Labrador for the fifth consecutive year in 2020. The parasite often contaminates bird feeders, leading to rapid transmission of frounce. To support healthy bird populations residents are encouraged to take down, empty, scrub and disinfect bird feeders with a 10 per cent bleach solution. Residents can replace bird feeders after the first fall frost when the risk of transmission is diminished. The public are reminded there is an abundance of natural food and water available to birds during the spring and summer months. More information on Avian Trichomoniasis, including a video showing clinical signs of Trichomoniasis in songbirds, is available from the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative. – 30 – Media contact Craig Renouf Fisheries and Land Resources 709-637-2923, 640-6922 craigrenouf@gov.nl.ca  2020 07 06 3:15 pm  "

Individuals, producer cooperatives, or associations are invited to submit proposals to explore the development of up to four abattoirs, possibly one in each region: Labrador, Western Newfoundland, Central Newfoundland, and Eastern Newfoundland. This initiative aims to address lack of access to proper slaughter and packing facilities in Newfoundland and Labrador, which has become an impediment to growth for the province’s beef and sheep sectors. The application form can be found online and the deadline for proposals is July 17, 2020. Commercial farmers or new farmers who have had past experience in raising beef cattle are invited to apply to raise up to 10 bred female purebred beef cattle to help advance the genetic diversity of the beef industry and grow the sector in Newfoundland and Labrador. The application form is online and the deadline for proposals is July 31, 2020. These initiatives are part of a plan to support employment in rural communities and help open new markets and products for renewable resource-based businesses during the COVID-19 global pandemic, including nearly $13 million to create jobs in the agriculture sector and assist farmers and producers. Quote “Newfoundland and Labrador produces less than one per cent of the beef we consume here. Our agriculture producers are ready to change that statistic by producing local, superior beef stock to increase food self-sufficiency. Increasing local red-meat production opens the door to establish certified abattoirs to process and store meat close to home.

The department is advising the public that there was a positive test result reported yesterday evening, Friday, June 19. The positive test result was from an asymptomatic employee at Eastern Health, who was not involved in direct patient care. The individual had COVID-19 in the past and had recovered. The test was done as part of a screening protocol, not because the individual reported symptoms of COVID-19. The individual’s close contacts, both professional and personal, have been notified. Out of an abundance of caution, close contacts are being tested. Local unions were notified last night. The public health evidence to date indicates that this is not a new case of COVID-19. The reason for this is that the test is quite good at detecting any viral genetic material that may be present even if the virus is no longer capable of producing infection. In people who have recovered from COVID-19, the presence of such material could produce a positive test result, but this does not mean there is an active infection. This means the total number of confirmed cases in the province remains at 261. There is no one hospitalized due to COVID-19. To date, 15,800 people have been tested.

World Refugee Day was established by the United Nations in recognition of the strength and courage of refugees forced to flee their homes and countries. Refugees often find themselves working to rebuild their lives in new and unfamiliar surroundings and require the solidarity and support of their host countries. Newfoundland and Labrador continues to work together with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and community partners, as well as employers, to support refugee resettlement and integration in the province, as part of The Way Forward on Immigration in Newfoundland and Labrador. The global theme of this year’s World Refugee Day is ‘Every Action Counts’, which highlights the positive contribution every individual can make in creating a more inclusive and equal world. World Refugee Day is a call to action for residents to learn more about refugee journeys, to better understand the circumstances that forced some of the newcomers who settle in Newfoundland and Labrador to leave their homes, and to assist in their settlement and integration in our communities. It is also a moment to celebrate the achievements of former refugees in our province. Newfoundland and Labrador continues to benefit from the diverse contributions of former refugees in the province. More information about World Refugee Day can be found online. Quote “World Refugee Day reminds us all of the profound and positive impact we have when we take action to welcome and support newcomers who arrive in our communities as refugees. By expressing our solidarity, we help refugees more fully participate in the social, cultural, and economic life of our province. In Newfoundland and Labrador, we all deserve to feel that we belong.” Honourable Christopher Mitchelmore Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Labour – 30 – Learn more World Refugee Day Follow us on Twitter: @GovNL and @AESL_GovNL Media contact Ryan Crocker Advanced Education, Skills and Labour 709-729-1795, 725-9595 RyanCrocker@gov.nl.ca  2020 06 19 2:41 pm  "

It coincides with Newfoundland and Labrador moving to Alert Level 2 in NLife with COVID-19: A Foundation for Living with COVID-19. The transition over the last two weeks, which included a sitting of the House of Assembly, has gone well. New training and building protocols have supported this safe transition. As we have no active COVID-19 cases and many commercial and retail businesses resume operations, the Provincial Government will continue its phased-in return of its employees. This notice provides time for our employees to make any required child care arrangements. Employees will be contacted by their supervisor to discuss this transition and to make plans for their return. Changes to program or service delivery associated with this transition, or the easing of public health restrictions, will be issued as they occur. However, online and telephone access to services by the general public is still preferred with urgent in-person matters by appointment only. Health and safety guidelines are in place to ensure that public service employees have access to a safe workplace, and the public has safe access to programs and services. Government thanks everyone for their understanding throughout this challenging time. As everyone in the province continues to adapt to living with COVID-19 in our communities, we must all follow public health guidelines: practice good hygiene; maintain a physical distance of at least two metres/six feet; wear appropriate protective equipment if you cannot maintain physical distancing; and stay home if you are sick or not feeling well. -30- Media contact Marc Budgell Finance and Human Resource Secretariat 709-729-2477, 689-0430 marcbudgell@gov.nl.ca  2020 06 19 4:30 pm  "

Such importation would never occur unless the importation stock is certified-free from Varroa. The only source for this stock is Western Australia. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations recognizes the disease-free status of Western Australian honey bees and considers this population essential to the future of world honey bee populations. As the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador seeks a certified Varroa-free/disease-free status for its honey bees, it would not be prudent to not accept other jurisdictions as ‘disease-free’ or ‘Varroa-free.’ Without this mutual acceptance of certified disease-free areas, it is unlikely that the province would ever acquire the disease-free certification that it desires. Without this mutual acceptance, commercial apiarists in Newfoundland and Labrador would not be able to restock their colonies in the unfortunate event commercial beekeepers suffer a loss that they cannot achieve restocking with local honey bees (overwinter colony mortality, rodent damage, etc.). If a commercial beekeeper did submit an importation request, and it was determined that the need for importation was warranted, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, under the current legislation, can provide a permit for importation. This is an extremely meticulous, secure and careful process, facilitated with and approved by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). The Government of Canada, through the CFIA, certifies the importation of Western Australia honey bees and oversees these importations. Rigorous protocols are strictly adhered to, through a permitting process (in tandem with CFIA), followed by a twelve-month quarantine from the date of entry, rigorous inspections during the quarantine protocol, and a final inspection one calendar year after the date of importation. Inspections are currently conducted by the Provincial Apiarist. As the Provincial Apiarist, it is my opinion that this process is sound and I am advising the Provincial Government to maintain its current policy under established parameters.” -30- Media contact Linda Skinner Fisheries and Land Resources 709-637-2284, 632-8167 lindaskinner@gov.nl.ca  2020 06 18 1:15 pm  "

Throughout the season, thousands of motorists will travel over our provincial roadways to enjoy all that this province has to offer. As the province continues to learn to live with COVID-19 and as residents travel and vacation at home this summer, I strongly encourage all motorists to keep the following simple rules top of mind, so we can avoid senseless tragedies on our highways. Don’t drink and drive. Do not use your cell phone while driving, and don’t text and drive. Adhere to posted speed limits, slow down in construction zones and make sure you reduce your speed when roads are wet or during foggy conditions. Wear your seat belt. Stay alert and do not drive fatigued or distracted. Mr. Speaker, this is also an important time to remind all Newfoundlanders and Labradorians that it is illegal to operate any type of motorized vehicle if your ability to drive is impaired by alcohol or drugs. Last year, motor vehicle collisions claimed approximately 2,000 lives in Canada, between five and six people a day. In addition, almost 10,000 more were seriously injured. Mr. Speaker, most of these collisions are preventable. Public safety is a top priority for the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador and we will continue to make improvements to the Highway Traffic Act to help make our roads and highways safer.

As restrictions have eased, the call to action is simple – to get out and explore the place we all love and call home. In the very near future, we will be launching our new marketing campaign, one that is about our unparalleled pride of this place. Our heart swells when we talk about home, which is more than a house and family – it’s a place and a state of mind. And for us, it’s an entire province. To discover more about the unique story of our home, I urge travellers to consider experiencing our many hiking and walking trails, parks, and museums. Discover one of our 11 Provincial Historic Sites opening in July, or learn more about those local registered attractions and experiences at one of our six Visitor Information Centres opening later this month. Mr. Speaker, by vacationing in our province, we are supporting hard hit, registered tourism businesses such as attractions, craft shops, restaurants and licensed accommodators. These businesses and their employees are our friends, neighbours, and families. They connect us to this place, our roots, and to our culture. And this summer, they need our help. To learn more about those businesses that are registered and licenced in our province, please visit our website newfoundlandlabrador.com.

Earlier this week, digital speed signs that display the speed of motorists travelling over the speed limit and warn them to slow down, began being installed in school zones on provincial roads. As of today, 10 signs have been installed and by the end of August, we anticipate that 165 signs will be installed at 81 schools zones. Mr. Speaker, in addition to showing speed and issuing a warning, the digital signs also display a second, flashing message to motorists travelling in excess of 10 km/h above the speed limit. These signs are similar to those you may have seen in school zones in municipalities. We have also been using them on some highways in our province and we know they are quite effective in promoting highway safety and reminding motorists to slow down. Mr. Speaker, we are also thankful to the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development and the province’s school districts for their work on this. This initiative will now lead to a safer environment for everyone walking to and from school. However, while we use more modern technology to promote highway safety, we all know how important it is for motorists to drive responsibly and cautiously, and we encourage all motorists to pay attention to all signs and slow down.

Discovery Day is no longer a statutory holiday in the province, but is recognized in collective agreements similar to St. Patrick’s Day, St. George’s Day, and Orangemen’s Day. Discovery Day originated from the Christian Holiday, St. John the Baptist Day. It is believed that John Cabot made landfall in Newfoundland on John the Baptist Day, and later, the day was celebrated as St. John’s Day. In 1963, the Hours of Work Act provided that the Lieutenant-Governor in Council could proclaim Discovery Day as an observed holiday. In 1992, the Shops’ Closing Act was amended to reduce the number of holidays and Discovery Day was no longer recognized as a Shops’ Closing holiday. In 1996, a proclamation was issued in accordance with the Labour Standards Act to establish a public holiday on June 24, 1997 in recognition of the 500th anniversary of Cabot’s landing. Today, the Provincial Government has determined that it is not appropriate to refer to the June 24 holiday as ‘Discovery Day.’ Before a new name can be established, consultations must take place with Indigenous governments and organizations in the spirit of reconciliation regarding this holiday. Building off those conversations, government is open to working with its partners in the community in a respectful manner that ensures the province’s memorials, statues and holidays are culturally-sensitive. Until consultations with the Indigenous governments and organizations are concluded, going forward the June 24 holiday be temporarily recognized as the June Holiday. Quote “The voices of people here locally and around the world are being heard. We have to ensure our communities reflect the people that live in them. Until those discussions are concluded, the former ‘Discovery Day’ will now be referred to as the June Holiday. Despite the name change, I want to assure those who previously enjoyed this holiday in June, that they will continue to do so. I wish all Newfoundlanders and Labradorians a safe and enjoyable weekend.” Honourable Dwight Ball Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador – 30 – Media contact Jeremy Reynolds Office of the Premier 709-729-3558 jeremyreynolds@gov.nl.ca Premier Ball signs a proclamation declaring that the former ‘Discovery Day’ holiday is to be referred to as the ‘June Holiday.’   2020 06 18 4:30 pm  "

This initiative aims to increase the variety and amount of produce we grow in Newfoundland and Labrador by planting crops and using agricultural techniques that are best suited to Newfoundland and Labrador’s specific growing conditions. Mr. Speaker, to address Newfoundland and Labrador’s food security needs during the COVID-19 pandemic – and thanks to the efforts of the dedicated staff at the Wooddale Centre for Agriculture and Forestry Development – we have prepared and delivered three million vegetable transplants to 65 eligible commercial farmers across the province. That’s nearly double the 1.7 million transplants delivered to 54 farmers in 2019. With proper planting and care, three million transplants have the potential to produce approximately 3.8 million pounds of vegetables – the equivalent of 63 tractor trailer loads of fresh, homegrown broccoli, cabbage, onion, kale, cauliflower, rutabaga and lettuce Newfoundlanders and Labradorians can buy from local markets come harvest time. Mr. Speaker, the agriculture sector is growing in Newfoundland and Labrador thanks to the farmers who are dedicating their lives to producing fresh, nutritious food.

Quote “Adults play an important role in promoting healthy active living for the children and youth in their lives. I encourage all adults to be active role models for their children by making physical activity a family priority. While we may be limited in the ways we can physically interact with others as we learn to live with COVID-19, now is an excellent time to discover new ways to be active in our own homes, backyards and communities.” Honourable Lisa Dempster Minister of Children, Seniors and Social Development – 30 – Learn more Healthy Active Living Resources ParticipACTION Recreation NL Follow us on Twitter: @GovNL, @CSSD_GovNL Media contact Gina MacArthur Children, Seniors and Social Development 709-729-3768, 730-2977 ginamacarthur@gov.nl.ca Minister Lisa Dempster and her family, who have taken the #ActiveFamilyPledge, enjoyed hiking the Skerwink Trail on the Bonavista Peninsula recently.

Newfoundlanders and Labradorians have long been known to support one another during difficult times. As we all learn to live with COVID-19 for the foreseeable future, government will continue our support to communities in our province. We will build on our strong relationship with Municipalities Newfoundland and Labrador to bring the best solutions to our community leaders. We are proceeding with our regular Municipal Capital Works projects and we are currently in the process of notifying communities so they can prepare and begin construction on their projects. We are also proceeding with notifying recipients of the next round of Investing in Canada Plan projects. Mr. Speaker, recently we announced new measures to help municipalities and local service districts, including a temporary local preference provision to the Public Procurement Regulations. This process presents a more timely process for municipalities, which results in quotes being obtained in approximately a week compared to a Request for Proposals process, which can take up to two months. The department also has a dedicated procurement team to assist with conducting these limited calls over the next few months. I was also pleased last week to join the federal Minister of Infrastructure and Communities, in announcing more than $31.5 million under the Gas Tax Fund to Newfoundland and Labrador for the 2020-21 fiscal year. In addition to more than $21.7 million for 276 communities, there is also $8.9 million for the Provincial Waste Management Strategy as well as funding for the Water and Wastewater Initiative. With the impact of COVID-19 on our communities, it was important municipalities receive the full amount of the Gas Tax Fund upfront this year so they can continue to strengthen services and build critical infrastructure. Mr. Speaker, now, more than ever, we need to be there for all of our communities and their residents as we continue to live with COVID-19. Thank you.  2020 06 16 1:45 pm  "

The new regional assessment is a significant improvement over the previous process which caused considerable delays in issuing authorizations for offshore exploration activities that typically take 30-60 days to complete. This was largely a result of a decision made in 2010 to move the responsibility for offshore environmental assessments from the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board (C-NLOPB) to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEAA). Through the new process approval timelines have decreased by 90 per cent – from 900 to as little as 90 days. In Advance 2030, we outlined the future of the offshore oil and gas industry of which there is tremendous potential – with over 650 leads identified to date, eight new entrants in the last six years, and resource potential of 52.2 billion barrels of oil and 199.6 trillion cubic feet of gas in just nine per cent of the province’s offshore. The regional assessment process allows us to be globally competitive while ensuring an effective environmental regime.  2020 06 16 1:50 pm  "

Sections of the Highway Traffic Act that involve automobile dealers had not been updated since they were introduced in 1988. There were also regulations pertaining to automobile dealers that had previously been found in the Licencing and Equipment Regulations under the Act. The amendments consolidate all provisions related to automobile dealers into one section to ensure readability and understanding. Changes to the legislation include standardization of terminology; authority to inspect dealerships; requirement for a Certificate of Conduct or Criminal Records Check for directors or officers of corporations and owners of sole proprietorships; requirement for a Certificate of Good Standing from the Registry of Companies when the dealership is incorporated; and the requirement for the payment of fines accumulated for vehicles owned and operated by a dealership. The additional duties of a dealer were also added, including the requirement for used vehicles to be inspected prior to being sold for road use. Prior to introducing the amendments, Service NL consulted with the Automobile Dealers Association of Newfoundland and Labrador (ADANL). Further consultations were conducted via correspondence with dealers who are not members of ADANL. Stakeholders were supportive of the proposed changes and informed they would be further consulted on specific regulations that would be put in place, following the introduction of changes to the Act in the House. Quotes “The changes we introduced to the Highway Traffic Act support a responsible and accountable automobile dealer sector, while also focusing on enhanced vehicle safety. In addition to enhanced consumer protection, setting minimum standards for all dealers will also reduce potential for harm when it comes to vehicle safety. This aligns with our government’s commitment to continue to strengthen the Highway Traffic Act.” Honourable Tom Osborne Minister of Service NL “Setting minimum standards for all dealers will reduce the potential for harm when it comes to vehicle safety. The Act, as it stands today, is outdated legislation and it is good to bring it up to today’s standards.

Minister Byrne also announced an investment of $300,000 for training and supports for the beekeeping industry, in partnership with the Newfoundland and Labrador Beekeeping Association (NLBKA). Consultations have been held between the Provincial Government and the NLBKA to discuss changes in the current legislation. The NLBKA is in full support of mandatory registration and inspections of beekeeping operations. The status of honey bees is unique here, with the province being one of the last places in the world that does not have Varroa mite (Varroa destructor), known to decimate honeybee populations. Varroa mites also transmit honey bee viruses and other pathogens that further weaken or ultimately kill entire colonies. In addition to being free of Varroa, our honey bee colonies are free of other invasive pests such as Small Hive Beetle, Honeybee Tracheal Mite, and Greater Wax Moth. The province’s pest and disease-free status is an important selling point for Newfoundland and Labrador-based bee products. There are approximately 130 beekeepers in the province, and between 800 and 900 bee colonies. By assisting with the pollination of plants, bees play an essential role in both the natural environment and agriculture. Quote “Having mandatory registration and inspection of beekeeping operations demonstrates our continuing commitment to develop agriculture and increase food self-sufficiency in Newfoundland and Labrador. By maintaining vigilance and good animal husbandry practices, beekeepers in Newfoundland and Labrador have been successfully keeping the Varroa mite from our shores. This proposed change in legislation allows us to take decisive action to better protect our valued parasite-free honey bee health status and develop our growing apiculture sector further still.” Honourable Gerry Byrne Minister of Fisheries and Land Resources – 30 – Learn more Follow us on Twitter: @GovNL and @FLR_GovNL Media contact Linda Skinner Fisheries and Land Resources 709-637-2284, 632-8167 lindaskinner@gov.nl.ca  2020 06 16 5:10 pm  "

In order to determine whether individuals qualify for compensation, in addition to working in an identified essential worker position they must also fall within the following hours and income thresholds during the 16-week eligibility period between March 15 and July 4, 2020.    Total Hours Worked (16 Week period) Maximum  Monthly Income (Gross) Lump Sum  Payment Amount   190-259 $1,000 $600   260-349 $1,400 $900   350-449 $2,000 $1,200   450-559 $2,500 $1,350   560+ $3,000 $1,500    Employers will begin to receive payments on behalf of the employees starting in July, and will then submit payments as part of their regular payroll remittance.The application for compensation will be available after the 16-week eligibility period, and will be administered by the provincial Department of Advanced Education, Skills and Labour. Employers must complete the application on behalf of all qualifying employees, providing proof of the employees’ eligibility. Employers can begin submitting applications on July 6, 2020 and will have until July 30, 2020 in which to apply. The province will provide an additional 10 per cent of the eligible amount to employers to offset mandatory related payroll costs from this process. Recipients of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit are not eligible for compensation through this essential worker program. Funding for this program includes an estimated $13.8 million from the Provincial Government and $52.5 million from the Federal Government. More information can be found in the backgrounder below. Quotes “Essential workers are not just first responders and those who work in health care, but also those on the front lines of retail, transportation, the restaurant industry and many other professions. Through this program, a diverse range of essential workers will receive compensation that recognizes their support in providing critical services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thank you for your commitment to the people of Newfoundland and Labrador.” Honourable Dwight Ball Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador “We are encouraging all employers to help us support their staff through the application process, and are providing compensation to help them offset their related costs. The Federal Government is contributing just under 80 per cent of funding for this program, allowing us to support lower income essential workers despite the economic challenges we currently face.” Honourable Tom Osborne Minister of Finance and President of Treasury Board – 30 – Learn More Public Safety Canada List of Essential Services and Functions in Canada During the COVID-19 Pandemic Follow us on Twitter: @GovNL and @FIN_GovNL Media contacts Jeremy Reynolds Office of the Premier 709-729-3558 jeremyreynolds@gov.nl.ca Marc Budgell Finance 709-729-2477, 689-0430 marcbudgell@gov.nl.ca BACKGROUNDER Information on the COVID-19 Essential Worker Support Program What is the Essential Workers Support Program? On April 15, 2020, the Government of Canada announced it would provide up to $3 billion in support to increase the wages of low-income essential workers across the country. Details of Newfoundland and Labrador’s program can be found here. I am an essential worker, how do I know if I am eligible and qualify under the program? To be eligible under the program, you must meet all of the following conditions:  Be a resident of Newfoundland and Labrador and legally authorized to work in Canada; Be employed or self-employed in any business or organization providing ‘essential services’ as defined in Public Safety Canada’s Guidance on Essential Services and Functions in Canada during the COVID-19 Pandemic; Have not received the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) during the eligibility period from March 15 – July 4, 2020; Have worked in both Alert Levels 4 and 5; and Meet the eligibility criteria for hours worked and income earned as detailed in the news release.  How much can an essential worker receive through the program? Designated essential workers will be eligible for the benefit based on the total number of hours worked over the 16-week period from March 15 – July 4, 2020, as outlined below:    Total Hours Worked (16 Week period) Maximum  Monthly Income (Gross) Lump Sum  Payment Amount   190-259 $1,000 $600   260-349 $1,400 $900   350-449 $2,000 $1,200   450-559 $2,500 $1,350   560+ $3,000 $1,500    Why is my employer being paid 10 per cent MERC? This is a taxable benefit for the employee. The ten per cent the employer will receive for Mandatory Employer Related Costs (MERC) is related to Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Employment Insurance (EI), and other related payroll costs (which could include payroll tax or other administrative costs) incurred by employers for any wages or benefits paid to employees. How do I apply for this benefit? This is an employer application process. The employer will apply on behalf of their employees. More information can be found online. How do I know if my employer is applying on my behalf? You will have to speak directly to your employer to confirm that an application has been submitted. My employer is not applying on my behalf. What can I do? Applying for the EWSP should be important to employers, as their success depends on the success of their employees. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed particular demands on lower-income workers in certain sectors, including those on the front-line in hospitals and nursing homes, those ensuring the integrity of the food supply, or providing essential retail services to this Province. Government needs employer’s assistance to help these essential workers. The EWSP is an employer application based program. If your employer has not applied, and you meet both the eligibility criteria and are an essential worker under the Federal Government’s listing, please contact your employer to request them to apply on your behalf. Why does my employer have to apply when the money is meant for the workers? We all need to work together to increase the wages of lower-income essential workers during this pandemic. Due to the large number of essential workers providing critical services in this province, the most efficient way to get this much needed income to those workers is through employer payroll. Where can I get further information? More information on the program can be found online. How long will it take individuals to receive their money? Employers will begin to receive payments on behalf of the employees starting in July 2020. Employers will then submit payments as part of their regular payroll remittance.  2020 06 15 11:45 am  "
210,210,2020-06-15,Canada,Newfoundland and Labrador,,https://www.gov.nl.ca/releases/2020/cya/0615n05/,Government Website,Statement of Concern – Unacceptable Delay in Establishing Inquiry for Innu Children in the Child Protection System," “In early September of 2019, I travelled to Nain to release my report on the Provincial Government’s child protection responses to Inuit children. The report contained 33 recommendations and was entitled ‘A Long Wait for Change.’ The title was carefully chosen and reflected the extraordinary and unacceptable amount of time for changes to be made for these vulnerable children. In part, the report documented decades of work to identify issues and recommendations for Indigenous children and their families and communities, and which included various Inquiries, Commissions, legislation, and reviews. It is troubling that many of my findings were neither new nor unique to this province. However, it put many issues in one place, and in a local context. And now here we are again. The Innu are still waiting three years after the Provincial Government made a commitment to establish a formal Inquiry into the treatment of Innu children in the same system. We know that some changes can be made immediately before the outcome of an Inquiry to make a difference in these children’s lives. Innu leadership has been clear that it expects a public process to build fundamental systemic change for the future. The recent death of an Innu youth by suicide and while in care further underlines their sense of urgency to get this process moving. But it should not be a sense of urgency for just the Innu.

The Transition House Association’s membership consists of ten provincially funded shelters in the province. These shelters are staffed by highly skilled and compassionate individuals whose mandate is to counsel and assist women who are facing violence. The Domestic Violence Help Line will have a single telephone number for the entire province. The service will detect the region from which the person is calling and route the call to the closest transition house. The caller will then be able to immediately speak with a trained professional who will assist them directly, or connect them to the appropriate service or organization in the community, including our women’s centres, Violence Prevention NL organizations, or medical and/or policing services. I am also pleased to say this new phone line will have full texting capabilities. Mr. Speaker, more information on the Domestic Violence Help Line, including the new toll free number, will be released in the coming days as soon as details are finalized. Mr. Speaker, I ask all Honourable Members to join me in thanking our transition houses and all women-serving organizations for the tremendous work they have done and continue to do as we make our way through COVID-19.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have postponed Public Service Week until such time as we can safely undertake the activities that make the week a highlight of the government calendar.

This year, more than ever, has demonstrated the talent, commitment, and sacrifices that public service employees make for the people of this province. Amidst the challenges of COVID-19, public service employees rose above and tirelessly gave of their professional and often personal time during what has been an especially difficult period. Mr. Speaker, it has been nothing short of professional excellence. I know I speak for every member when I say that we look forward to thanking you in person for your hard work and dedication. But until that time, I ask all members of this House to join me in reflecting on how members of the public service support us each and every day in serving the people of Newfoundland and Labrador, and to express thanks for the work that they do.

228,228,2020-06-11,Canada,Newfoundland and Labrador,,https://www.gov.nl.ca/releases/2020/tw/0611n09/,Government Website,Improvements Announced for Northern Labrador Ferry Service," The Department of Transportation and Works is announcing improvements to the ferry service for residents of northern Labrador communities to coincide with the second season of the Kamutik W beginning Sunday, June 14. In February, department officials met with officials from Labrador Marine, Nunatsiavut Marine, the Nunatsiavut Government and local stakeholders to review the inaugural season of the Kamutik W. Improvements beginning with the start of the service this year include:  An online tracking system for freight shipments to enable customers to follow the progress of their orders; The installation of racks at the freight shed in Happy Valley-Goose Bay to allow for better management of pallets and organization of shipments; The placement of all freight in containers to avoid damage from weather; and A revised weekly schedule with the vessel departing Happy Valley-Goose Bay on Sundays to enable more daytime departures from ports during the week and fewer late night departures.  In addition, the department anticipates work on upgrades at the Makkovik wharf to begin in July. To help prevent the spread of COVID-19, Labrador Marine has limited the number of passengers permitted to travel on the Kamutik W to 53 and all passengers will be required to practice physical distancing. More information on the service provider’s approach to prevent the spread of the virus is available on Labrador Marine’s website. In 2019, the Kamutik W transported 700 tonnes more freight than the amount of freight delivered in 2018 by the MV Astron and MV Northern Ranger. As the Kamutik W is starting service weeks earlier than last year, the department and Labrador Marine anticipate even more freight to be delivered in 2020. The Kamutik W enables residents of northern Labrador communities to drive their vehicles onto the ferry and continue their travels at their destination. Freight rates were also lowered by approximately 40 per cent and passenger rates by approximately 60 per cent prior to the start of the 2019 season. Quotes “Last year was the beginning of an enhanced marine service for northern Labrador communities. By working with our partners to make improvements to the service, we look to build on that first season so residents in coastal Labrador communities and businesses in Happy Valley-Goose Bay have an even more successful season in 2020.” Honourable Steve Crocker Minister of Transportation and Works “The Goose Bay port has an important role and responsibility to ensure freight and passengers move efficiently and safely to all the coastal communities that are serviced. I am pleased to see these enhancements and will continue to strive for improved opportunities for all districts in Labrador. We are stronger when we work together and in support of each other.” Perry Trimper MHA for Lake Melville -30- Learn more New Ferry Service Begins on Northern Labrador Coast Minister Crocker Announces Stronger, More Reliable Marine Services Transportation Network for Labrador Labrador Marine Coastal Service Follow us on Twitter: @GovNL and @TW_GovNL Media contacts Brian Scott Transportation and Works 709-729-3015, 725-9201 brianscott@gov.nl.ca Bonnie Learning Constituency Assistant to Honourable Perry Trimper, MHA for Lake Melville 709-896-7975 bonnielearning@gov.nl.ca  2020 06 11 4:03 pm  "

Although counter service was suspended due to the public health emergency, Service NL continued to provide the majority of services to clients through alternate service channels, such as online, email, teleservices and drop boxes. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted that as of today, in-person services for written and practical driver examinations are resuming with safety measures in place. However, I would be remiss if I did not recognize the incredible uptake in our online services available at MyGovNL.ca. Since the COVID-19 public health emergency, more than 98 per cent of vehicle renewals have been conducted online. This is compared to 75 per cent during the same time period in 2019. There has also been a significant uptake in the number of driver’s licence renewals conducted online, with over 92 per cent of drivers renewing via the web – an increase from 47 per cent during the same period last year. While Service NL is beginning a phased-in approach to various in-person services today, we ask residents to continue to use government’s online services available at MyGovNL.ca. I would like to thank staff of Service NL who have continued to provide services throughout the pandemic. I would also like to thank clients for their patience during this time and, as services resume, encourage continued safety practices. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  2020 06 10 2:15 pm  "

This $25 million program will provide financial assistance to eligible tourism and hospitality operators impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Tourism and Hospitality Support Program will allow eligible tourism operators to apply for a one-time non-repayable working capital contribution. Those with less than $100,000 in gross sales will receive a $5,000 contribution, while those with greater than $100,000 in gross sales, will receive a $10,000 contribution. Mr. Speaker, we know that a mix of supports is required to tackle some of the industry challenges arising from the pandemic, which is why we developed this short-term program to complement existing emergency supports announced by the Government of Canada to address the impacts of COVID-19. The tourism and hospitality industry provides over 20,000 jobs, and supports more than 2,700 businesses throughout our province. Our government recognizes the tremendous value of the industry in Newfoundland and Labrador and this new program commitment aims to provide some relief to many operators. I encourage eligible operators to visit the Department of Tourism, Culture, Industry and Innovation website to learn more about the program. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  2020 06 10 2:20 pm  "

The remains were repatriated from Scotland to Newfoundland and Labrador. It was a remarkable accomplishment, where we honoured the return of the remains during a solemn and moving occasion held at The Rooms on March 11. Where I was joined by Indigenous leaders and representatives. With their cooperation and leadership over the past five years, we achieved an important milestone in our history in Newfoundland and Labrador and our Reconciliation journey. The call to return the remains was spurred on by Chief Mi’sel Joe, who had this to say about the repatriation. “When you look at the history of the Beothuk people and how their demise came about, I think we owe it to them and their remains. And their spirit will never be free – we need to do something about that.” With the help of the Indigenous leaders and the federal Department of Canadian Heritage, we have done something about that. Repatriation honours the memory of the Beothuk and the important lessons their history can still teach us today. We trust their spirits may now freely roam over the lands and waters which they, and the Beothuk people, once so proudly occupied. The repatriation is an event of historical and cultural significance for all Indigenous peoples of Newfoundland and Labrador. However, this is not an end, but a continuation of further dialogue. While there has been much speculation about the final disposition of the remains, no decisions have been made. They will remain in a safe and secure manner at The Rooms until a decision on their final resting place is reached with Indigenous leaders in the Province. Thank you.  2020 06 09 3:35 am  "

At this time, government has also launched a new Mineral Lands Administration Portal (MinLAP) to help ensure a seamless regulatory process for mineral exploration companies and prospectors. Government is continuing with its Mineral Incentive Program, providing $1.7 million in financial assistance and training to support and encourage mineral exploration in Newfoundland and Labrador. The program includes junior exploration assistance and prospector assistance. More information on MinLAP and the Mineral Incentive Program is in the backgrounder below. As outlined in Mining the Future 2030, the Provincial Government is committed to supporting the mining and mineral exploration industries in Newfoundland and Labrador, as well as the quarry industry, and is doing everything possible to help them make a full recovery from the unpredictable global downturn caused by the pandemic. Mining, mineral exploration and quarrying are important industries for the province. With almost $4.3 billion in mineral shipments, over $48.6 million in exploration expenditures, and a quarry industry valued at nearly $30 million with greater than 5 million tonnes in quarry production in 2019, employment exceeds nearly 7,000 people. These industries create opportunities for local businesses, and increase the province’s ability to invest in programs, infrastructure, education and health care. Quotes “We have had many conversations with our mining industry to determine their needs and assist with continuing operations. Measures announced today will assist our mining, mineral exploration and quarry industries to weather this pandemic and continue to be a major economic contributor to our province.” Honourable Siobhan Coady Minister of Natural Resources “Mining Industry NL is fully appreciative of these measures to support our industry as we navigate through these unprecedented times. Mineral exploration and mining are integral to Newfoundland and Labrador’s economy, and the province’s mineral endowment is a key sustainable source of wealth for long-term recovery. Public investments in geoscience, the Mineral Incentive Program and an ongoing collaborative dialogue between government and industry to improve regulatory processes best positions the province to attract private investment into the sector and compete with other jurisdictions around the world.” Heather Bruce-Veitch Chair, Mining Industry NL Learn More Mining the Future 2030 – A Plan for Growth in the Newfoundland and Labrador Mining Industry Mineral Lands Administration Portal Mineral Lands Administration Portal Online Demonstration Mineral Incentive Program Junior Exploration Assistance 2019-20 Recipients Prospector Assistance Grant 2019-20 Recipients  Follow us on Twitter: @GovNL and @NR_GovNL Media Contacts Lisa Lawlor Natural Resources 709-631-8155 lisalawlor@gov.nl.ca Ed Moriarity Mining Industry NL 709-722-9542 edmoriarity@miningnl.com BACKGROUNDER Information on Supports for the Mining Industry Mineral Lands Administration Portal (MinLAP) The new Mineral Lands Administration Portal (MinLAP) is a modern system that provides a reliable legislated service to industry and will help ensure a seamless regulatory process for mineral exploration companies and prospectors.

Since the onset of COVID-19 and the implementation of a number of public health restrictions, the business community of Newfoundland and Labrador recommended a number of measures that would ease some of the pressures facing their industries. One suggestion was an online tool where businesses could provide feedback on how to reduce government red tape. The online portal is a single point of entry for all business stakeholders, community sector organizations and not-for-profit groups in the province for red tape reduction ideas arising from the challenges experienced in response to COVID-19. It is also a means for the sectors to dialogue with government on recommendations on issues not arising from the pandemic, but which could improve interactions. All feedback will be considered as government tries to streamline the regulatory process for businesses in the province. The business community, along with community and not-for-profit organizations, are encouraged to participate in the consultations process. Visit engageNL to complete the online questionnaire. Written submissions are also being accepted and can be emailed to RTInitiative@gov.nl.ca. Feedback will be accepted until August 31, 2020. Quote “Since the onset of COVID-19, we have been working closely with the business sector to help them work through the challenges they have been facing. We have also heard concerns from community organizations and not-for-profit groups. We have listened to their recommendations and, where possible, have implemented measures that provide a degree of relief.

And we know that businesses in Newfoundland and Labrador have faced significant challenges since the onset of the global pandemic. One of the industries hardest hit has been the tourism and hospitality sector. The thousands of registered and licensed operators in this industry create investment and employment opportunities, build stronger communities and diversify our province’s economy. These operators provide a significant contribution to our unique and vibrant tourism and hospitality sector in Newfoundland and Labrador. Their hard work and dedication have built up this vital industry and now more so than ever, they need to be supported. It was recently announced that non-essential travel within and around the province can occur in Alert Level 3 as part of our plan ‘NLife with COVID-19’, which is exciting news after the unprecedented times we have been living in the past few months. It is anticipated that we will move to Alert Level 3 on Monday June 8, which will create a variety of opportunities for residents to get out and move around and enjoy our beautiful province. In the coming weeks, we will be launching an exciting new marketing campaign with the sole focus on vacationing, right here at home. I encourage residents to start making their plans, to experience the sights and sounds of our local attractions located in every nook, bay or cove. By vacationing in-province, residents will provide direct support to registered tourism businesses such as local shops, restaurants and our many licensed accommodators, such as local hotels and motels, bed and breakfasts, cabins and lodges. There are many of these businesses that have seen bookings reduced by 100 percent due to travel restrictions because of the COVID-19 pandemic. We ask people to understand the importance of supporting local, registered and licensed operators and to express the importance of supporting this industry and all those businesses registered with Newfoundland Labrador Tourism. The people in this industry connect us to this place, our roots, and to our culture. This summer, our friends, neighbours, and families need our support, and they need us to vacation at home.” -30- Media contact Eric Humber Tourism, Culture, Industry and Innovation 709-725-9655 erichumber@gov.nl.ca  2020 06 05 4:34 pm  "

259,259,2020-06-04,Canada,Newfoundland and Labrador,,https://www.gov.nl.ca/releases/2020/exec/0604n02/,Government Website,New Regional Assessment Process Protects the Environment and Shortens Timelines for Exploration Drilling Program Approval," A new regional assessment process was announced today that maintains the strong protection of the offshore environment while significantly shortening timelines for exploration drilling program approval – a major consideration for companies looking to make global investment decisions. This is a significant improvement over the previous process which caused considerable delays in issuing authorizations for offshore exploration activities that typically take 30-60 days to complete. This was largely a result of a decision made in 2010 to move the responsibility for offshore environmental assessments from the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board (C-NLOPB) to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency (CEAA). As a result of this change, license issuance periods increased from an average of one year to over 900 days. This had a substantially negative impact on the Newfoundland and Labrador offshore sector’s global competitiveness. According to research carried out by the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), in Australia, the average environmental assessment time for an exploratory well is 144 days. In the United States Gulf of Mexico, the average is 96 days. In Norway, the average is 79 days and in the United Kingdom the average is 18 days. With the new regulations announced today, the regional assessment process allows the province to become more globally competitive while maintaining a strong and effective environmental regulatory regime. This is an important step in having routine, well understood and low impact activities, such as drilling offshore exploration wells, completed within a more predictable and timely regulatory process. The new regional assessment process will work as follows:  Not less than 90 days before a drilling program begins, an exploration company makes the Impact Assessment Agency aware of their plans. Once the Agency has posted receipt of this notification to its registry, the company may then submit an application to the C-NLOPB for its drilling program authorization. The C-NLOPB will then be responsible for ensuring that the company complies with all the conditions set out in the regulations. These are very robust conditions built upon the experience gained from previous exploration well programs that have gone through the CEAA environmental assessment process as well as upon the Regional Assessment Committee’s comprehensive review. This new process helps get to the decision to drill more quickly.  Quotes “Through our significant work with industry and the Federal Government in this priority area, we have a new regional assessment process for the province that will shorten timelines for exploration drilling program approval while protecting the environment; two important areas of consideration for companies looking to make global investment decisions. We look forward to continuing this work with the Federal Government to support the offshore oil and gas industry in Newfoundland and Labrador.” Honourable Dwight Ball Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador “Through Advance 2030, we outlined the future of the offshore oil and gas industry of which there is tremendous potential – with over 650 leads identified to date, eight new entrants in the last six years, and resource potential of 52.2 billion barrels of oil and 199.6 trillion cubic feet of gas in just nine per cent of the province’s offshore. The regional assessment process allows us to be globally competitive while ensuring an effective environmental regime. Newfoundland and Labrador can efficiently explore its offshore and hopefully make some great discoveries.” Honourable Siobhan Coady Minister of Natural Resources – 30 – Learn More News Release: The Government of Canada announces new regulatory measure to improve review process for exploratory drilling projects in the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador offshore News Release: Premier Ball, Minister Coady and Industry Leaders Unite in Support of Offshore Oil and Gas Industry News Release: Provincial Government Releases Advance 2030 – A Plan for Growth in the Newfoundland and Labrador Oil and Gas Industry Follow us on Twitter: @GovNL and @NR_GovNL Media Contacts Jeremy Reynolds Office of the Premier 709-729-3558 jeremyreynolds@gov.nl.ca Lisa Lawlor Natural Resources 709-631-8155 lisalawlor@gov.nl.ca  2020 06 04 10:20 am  "

This update provides an overview of the province’s fiscal situation as of March 31, 2020 as well as a look at the ongoing challenges presented by COVID-19 and low oil prices. The Provincial Government continued its record of rigid cost-control, holding expenses steady with a reduction of $35 million from the original projection. Government’s borrowing requirements also remained unchanged at $1.2 billion from the Budget 2019 projection. Revenue projections for 2019-20 decreased by $690 million, driven by a year of unprecedented challenges:  Reduced oil prices due to the oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, a lower than anticipated Canada to US exchange rate, shutdowns of Hibernia and the Terra Nova FPSO and other production changes resulted in $181 million of lower oil royalties than projected at Budget; Deferral of $108 million tax portion of the Atlantic Accord agreement based on consultation with the Auditor General; $203 million net reduction in provincial taxes; and $198 million net reduction in other provincial, federal and related revenues (including entities and government business enterprises).  The province also faced significant disruptions due to the January snowstorm event and COVID-19 measures implemented in mid-March, which combined to shut down Newfoundland and Labrador’s economy for three weeks in 2019-20. As a result, the province’s surplus for 2019-20 is revised to $1.27 billion, a reduction of $287 million from the Mid-Year Update estimate. It is anticipated that government will continue to see a reduction in revenues such as Personal Income Tax, Harmonized Sales Tax, deferred or waived fees, and other measures as a result of health restrictions put in place to protect the public during COVID-19. Furthermore, to date, the average price of oil in 2020-21 is just over $24 US per barrel, and oil revenues are expected to be significantly lower than in 2019-20. It is government’s intention that Budget 2020 will be delivered before the interim supply period concludes on September 30, 2020. Quote “2019-20 was a difficult fiscal year for Newfoundland and Labrador, and we face ongoing challenges with COVID-19. As we look toward Budget 2020, our response is going to require a measured and strategic approach on how we work with the Federal Government, on how we work with businesses and more.” Honourable Tom Osborne Minister of Finance and President of Treasury Board – 30 – Follow us on Twitter: @GovNL and @FIN_GovNL Media contact Marc Budgell Finance 709-729-2477, 689-0430 marcbudgell@gov.nl.ca  2020 06 04 11:21 am  "

Through our collective efforts we have successfully flattened the curve. As a result, and based on public health advice, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador has developed comprehensive plans to ensure public service employees’ gradual, safe return to the workplace. Over the coming days, employees who have been identified to return to the workplace will be contacted by their supervisor to discuss this transition. Any employee who is not contacted, should continue in their current work arrangement unless advised otherwise. Training materials have been prepared to assist employees returning to the workplace and will be available on PSAccess. This training will help ensure a safe transition, as well as highlight the new protocols that will be in place to ensure appropriate hygiene and physical distancing. This training is important for all employees, including those who have continued to work in government settings throughout the pandemic, as protocols will shift once the overall employee presence begins to increase. Changes to program or service delivery associated with this transition, or the easing of public health restrictions, will be issued as they occur. However, online and telephone access to services by the general public is still preferred with urgent in-person matters by appointment only. It is essential that appropriate health and safety guidelines are in place and followed to ensure that public service employees have access to a safe workplace, and the public has safe access to programs and services. Government thanks everyone for their dedication and patience. As everyone in the province continues to adapt to living with COVID-19 in our communities, we must all follow public health guidelines: practice good hygiene; maintain a physical distance of at least two metres/six feet; wear appropriate protective equipment if you cannot maintain physical distancing; and stay home if you are sick or not feeling well. -30- Media contact Marc Budgell Finance and Human Resource Secretariat 709-729-2477, 689-0430 marcbudgell@gov.nl.ca  2020 06 04 1:35 pm  "

Homeowners can qualify for the Residential Construction Rebate in one of two ways: Renovation Projects A 25 per cent rebate is available for renovation projects for principal residences, up to a maximum rebate of $10,000 (based on a $40,000 project). New Home Construction A rebate of $10,000 is available for new home construction on homes valued up to $350,000 before HST.

Today marks one year since the release of the Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. The report, entitled Reclaiming Power and Place, is comprised of evidence gathered from over 2,380 family members, survivors of violence, experts and knowledge keepers. It also delivered 231 Calls for Justice. The recommendations called on governments, institutions, social service providers, industries and all Canadians to address the tragic levels of violence directed at Indigenous people of all gender and sexual minorities. In the time leading up to the National Inquiry and while it was under way, the Provincial Government fully supported the knowledge gathering aspects of hearings and testimonials. Prior to the start of the National Inquiry, the province initiated consultations with Indigenous Governments, Organizations and people to gather views on issues and concerns for consideration by commissioners. A review of the Calls for Justice which apply to Newfoundland and Labrador has been undertaken by the Provincial Government and the information which is being collected is being used to inform the discussions with the Federal Government and other jurisdictions in Canada. The province believes there are many ways to end violence, including: increasing awareness, education and training, investing in leadership development, and capacity building. The Provincial Government administers a wide range of services, programs and engagements which align with the Calls for Justice contained in the Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. Some of these initiatives are included in the backgrounder below. Quote “As we continue critical discussions on the principles of a National Action Plan to Address Violence Against Indigenous Women and Girls, it is important to understand that this is a wide-ranging and comprehensive approach that demands involvement from all sectors of society and all governments. Governments and Indigenous people will forge the path ahead on how we respond and prevent violence. This will require meaningful, respectful, and culturally‐appropriate engagement with Indigenous leaders.” Honourable Dwight Ball Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador -30- Learn More Reclaiming Power and Place: The Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls What We Heard: National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Media contact Jeremy Reynolds Office of the Premier 709-729-3558 jeremyreynolds@gov.nl.ca BACKGROUNDER Provincial Services, Programs and Engagements which align with the Calls for Justice Contained in the Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls   The independent National Inquiry, established by the Federal Government in 2016, was under way from September 2016 to June 2019.   From March 7-8, 2018, the National Inquiry conducted community hearings in Happy Valley-Goose Bay, during which time the National Inquiry heard from individuals from across the province who shared information about their missing or murdered loved ones.   From October 15-18, 2018, the National Inquiry conducted Knowledge Keeper, Expert and Institutional Hearings in St. John’s, during which time approximately 14 individuals shared information about their work or research.   Within the Final Report, the Calls for Justice 1.1 to 5.25 are specifically directed to all levels of government, with government departments and agencies being implicated throughout the remaining Calls.   The Indigenous Violence Prevention Grants Program, managed by the Office for the Status of Women, supports Indigenous Governments and Organizations in the province in their efforts to prevent violence against Indigenous women and children, and to engage Indigenous men and boys in the prevention of violence.   A Provincial Indigenous Women’s Steering Committee advises the Provincial Government on social, economic and violence-related issues impacting Indigenous women.   The Provincial Indigenous Women’s Gathering, which has taken place annually since 2006, brings together Indigenous women from all areas of the province to connect, share experiences, and plan the necessary steps to aid in the improvement of the quality of life of Indigenous women in their communities.   The Provincial Government convened the province’s first Indigenous Leaders Roundtable in 2017 to discuss and advance goals shared with Indigenous communities.   Through a partnership with the Qalipu First Nation, eagle feathers were presented to the Provincial Court as another option for taking an affirmation or oath, to help create a more inclusive and accessible justice system that is sensitive to Indigenous cultures.   Two seats in the University of Saskatchewan’s College of Law program are assigned to Indigenous students from Newfoundland and Labrador to help foster a more representative justice system.   Cultural competency and trauma-informed training is offered to justice-sector employees to educate and inform staff of Indigenous cultures and traditions to improve the interactions and experiences of Indigenous people within the justice system.   Newfoundland and Labrador is increasing its use of restorative justice a practice with roots in Indigenous cultures. Current initiatives that support the principles of restorative justice include the Adult Diversion Program, Drug Treatment Court, and the Family Violence Intervention Court.   2020 06 03 1:01 pm  "

With this in mind, a local preference provision has been added to the Public Procurement Regulations. This provision will mandate an allowance of ten per cent for local suppliers for all procurements, to the maximum permitted under the Canadian Free Trade Agreement. These thresholds to which local preference will be added will be as follows:  Municipalities, local service districts, academic institutions, school districts and health authorities:  $105,700 (goods); $105,700 (services); and $264,200 (construction)     Crown corporations:  $528,300 (goods); $528,300 (services); and $5,283,200 (construction)     Departments, agencies and all other public bodies:  $26,400 (goods); $105,700 (services); and $105,700 (construction)    In addition to this preference provision, the thresholds at which open calls for bids are required have been increased to allow for more opportunities to direct business to local suppliers through a limited call process. The procurement process in Newfoundland and Labrador affects all public bodies including municipalities, health authorities, school boards, academic institutions and government departments and agencies, as well as businesses throughout the province. Under the previous procurement legislation, the thresholds provided in section 5 of the Regulations were $10,000 for goods, $50,000 for services (except architectural and engineering services), and $100,000 for construction for all public bodies. The new increased thresholds at which an open call for bids is required are as follows:  Municipalities, local service districts, academic institutions, school districts and health authorities:  $105,700 (goods); $105,700 (services); and $264,200 (construction)     Crown corporations:  $264,200 (goods); $264,200 (services); and $264,200 (construction)     Departments and agencies and all other public bodies:  $26,400 (goods); $105,700 (services); and $105,700 (construction)    Increasing thresholds provides flexibility for a more efficient procurement process, and also provides additional flexibility to direct business specifically to local enterprises. Additionally, government has also implemented a short-term increase to thresholds for engineering services for municipalities and local service districts from the current $100,000 to $264,200. This allows this year’s municipal construction projects to begin more quickly, to maximize support for construction and employment opportunities throughout the province. Quote “The business sector drives the economy of Newfoundland and Labrador, and we have been working diligently to find ways to help ease the pressures they are facing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Increasing thresholds and implementing a local preference provision enhances the flexibility to procure a number of items locally, thereby supporting our local economy.” Honourable Tom Osborne Minister Responsible for the Public Procurement Agency -30- Learn more Ministerial Statement – New Procurement Act Now in Effect News Release: Additional Provisions of Public Procurement Act Now in Effect Media contact Krista Dalton Service NL 709-729-4748, 685-6492 kristadalton@gov.nl.ca  2020 06 01 11:11 am  "

The 1,205 license reduction includes an additional 425 license reduction beyond the 780 announced in February 2020. This is the result of an extensive 2020 winter survey program that covered ten Moose Management Areas (MMAs) and identified three MMAs requiring quota reductions (MMAs 8, 28, and 44). This represents the largest number of MMAs ever surveyed in one season by the department.  For Labrador there is a total of 384 Either Sex moose licences – an increase of 15 licences compared to last year. For the 2020-21 season all island Moose Management Area seasons will open on the same date, including Moose Management Reduction Zones 100 and 101.  Effective for 2020-21 the moose hunting season starting date for the entire Island will be September 12, 2020 and close December 31, 2020, except in National Park zones. Bow-hunting seasons for moose in all island MMAs begins August 29, 2020. Other new initiatives and changes for 2020-21 include:  Moose/Caribou Jawbone Program: Beginning in 2020, successful big game hunters will be requested to submit the lower jawbone of a moose or caribou that has been harvested under their licence. A jawbone tag will be supplied with the licence (and) tags that accompany the big game licence. Jawbone drop boxes will be established at Department of Fisheries and Land Resources offices throughout the province.   Black Bear: Beginning fall of 2020, black bear licences in Labrador will only be able to be purchased using the online process or mail-in application process. Hunters may choose to login to the Wildlife Information Management System or file a paper application. Black bear licences will no longer be sold at vendor locations in Labrador.   Boundary Information:  Moose Management Area 51 previously known as Grand Falls is now named Baikie Lake.   Hunters are also encouraged to review the Hunting and Trapping Guide online at the Department of Fisheries and Land Resources website for important information regarding big and small game hunting regulations, season dates and hunter safety.

Report: A-2020-007   Report Date: May 29, 2020   Public Body: Department of Tourism, Culture, Industry and Innovation   Summary: The Department of Tourism, Culture, Industry and Innovation (the “Department”) received an access request for all records relating to the creation of a position for the Rooms and the decision to fill it with a specific individual. The Department provided records to the Complainant, however the Complainant indicated that they have reason to believe additional responsive records exist. The Commissioner found that the Department failed in its duty to assist under section 13 of the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act, 2015 (ATIPPA, 2015) by a combination of: by failing to advise the Complainant that the records likely to be of most interest would be in the custody of to the Rooms; narrowly interpreting the scope of the request; and by deleting a potentially responsive non-transitory record.    -30- Media Contact Sean Murray Director of Research & Quality Assurance 709-729-6309  2020 06 01 12:15 pm  "

Community gardens are not only a great source of fresh, local food – they are peaceful places to unwind, enjoy time outdoors, and get back to nature at a time when we need it most. Community gardening will look a little different this summer as we find innovative ways to work together safely, but more than ever this year, our community gardens can offer that sense of togetherness we’ve all been missing.

The objective of the Community Garden Support Program is to increase:  Food self-sufficiency Access to fresh foods Consumption of fruits and vegetables Awareness and appreciation of the importance of local food production and the agriculture sector  Safe Practices in Community Gardens  Limit the number of people in the garden at any one time to accommodate for physical distancing (maintaining a distance of two metres or arm’s lengths from others).  Consider offering a schedule with a sign-up sheet to control the number of people in the garden at any one time. Advise those who are ill or who are part of an at-risk population (e.g., the elderly, immunocompromised, etc.) that they should not visit the community garden. Remind people how to prevent the spread of COVID-19, such as by staying home if you are sick, physical distancing, washing your hands, and covering coughs and sneezes. If tools are shared, ensure tools are cleaned between uses Do not allow people to share gardening gloves. Encourage the use of non-medical masks by people in the garden. I frequent a Community Garden, how can I help slow the spread of the virus? There are a number of thing that can be done to help slow the spread of COVID-19, including:  Stay home if you are sick. Maintain physical distancing when you are in the garden. Use your own tools, where possible, rather than sharing tools that may be available. Use your own gardening gloves and do not share them with anyone else. Wear a non-medical mask, if available. Practice proper hand hygiene by washing your hands or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol when entering and exiting the garden.     2020 06 01 4:17 pm  "

Report: A-2020-006   Report Date: May 26, 2020   Public Body Memorial University   Summary: The Complainant, a Memorial employee, suspected that some person had accessed sensitive personal files. The files were stored locally on a Memorial computer assigned to the Complainant and had been temporarily migrated to another drive on Memorial’s network. The Complainant filed an access request for the logs of accesses to those files for a particular day. Memorial reviewed the request with its own Information Technology (IT) staff, and with the external consultant that had installed the servers, and responded to the Complainant that because file access is not logged on those servers, the requested records do not exist. The Commissioner was satisfied that file-level access logging had never been enabled on the relevant systems, and that consequently no responsive records exist. The Commissioner concluded that Memorial had fulfilled its duty under section 13 of ATIPPA, 2015 by conducting a reasonable search for records and responding accurately and completely to the Complainant.    -30- Media Contact Sean Murray Director of Research & Quality Assurance 709-729-6309  2020 05 26 11:50 am  "

The province and the offshore oil and gas industry has undergone tremendous challenges with the impacts of COVID-19. The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador has asked the Government of Canada to invest in our offshore oil and gas industry. The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador shares the Federal Government’s goals of environmental protection and reducing carbon emissions, including for the oil and gas sector, and has committed to achieving net zero by 2050. Supporting Newfoundland and Labrador’s offshore oil and gas industry is essential to supporting a sustainable low carbon economy and clean energy resources. The province’s offshore projects are already among some of the lowest carbon intensity emitting facilities in the world. The importance of the offshore oil industry to the economy of Newfoundland and Labrador cannot be overstated nor replaced by any other sector. The economic benefits related to the offshore industry accounted for nearly 30 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) between 2010 and 2017. The responsible choice is to invest in the Newfoundland and Labrador offshore. We can further reduce greenhouse gas emissions by making immediate investments and set the stage for this province to become a leader in clean energy. Recent correspondence to Prime Minister Trudeau from Premier Ball and The Council of Atlantic Premiers can be found here and here respectively. Further facts regarding the value of the offshore oil and gas industry in Newfoundland and Labrador are provided in the backgrounder below.  Quotes “This is an unprecedented time for the people of our province, the country and the world. COVID-19 is having a dramatic effect on our offshore oil and gas industry – an industry that has an immensely positive impact on the families and businesses of Newfoundland and Labrador. With our oil and gas industry representing such a significant portion of the provincial economy, the time is now to act and put measures in place so we can continue to deliver vital health, education and social services to Newfoundlanders and Labradorians.” Honourable Dwight Ball Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador “With four major producing projects, the offshore oil industry contributes significant value to the global supply chain. We have approached the Federal Government to enhance financial liquidity and accelerate exploration. It is vital that we get their support now to ensure the province’s low emission production can continue to be part of the global energy mix.” Honourable Siobhan Coady Minister of Natural Resources “Our offshore oil and gas industry is in crisis, thousands have lost their jobs, and Noia members fear for their future. We need the Government of Canada to provide us with immediate and specific help. While the challenge is unprecedented, the solutions are not, and have been used before in our offshore. Support is needed now so we can be globally competitive and lead the transition to renewable energy mixes and achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.” Charlene Johnson Chief Executive Officer, Noia “The success of Canada’s offshore oil and gas industry is not just critical to the economy of our province, but is also a centerpiece of our clean growth strategy. It is within our reach to set the global environmental standard for the offshore industry, and the solutions we develop here can be exported worldwide for the betterment of the planet. There are opportunities for immediate investments that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and set the stage for Newfoundland and Labrador to become an international leader in offshore clean tech.” Kieran Hanley Executive Director, Newfoundland and Labrador Environmental Industry Association “Our industry is facing some of the biggest challenges we have ever experienced. There is a critical and urgent need for the Federal Government to invest in our offshore oil and gas sector to help overcome these challenges and to position the province for success. With the right supports and policies, we have an opportunity to make Newfoundland and Labrador a place where companies want to do business as they revisit their capital plans worldwide and make crucial investment decisions that could benefit the province for decades.” Terry Abel Executive Vice President, Canada Operations and Climate, Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers “Collaboration between government, industry and universities is key to solving real world problems, and in the current environment that has never been more true. Memorial will continue to be a partner in the development and success of this province’s offshore oil industry by educating highly qualified professionals and leading innovative research and development to make the ever-evolving industry safer and more sustainable.” Dr. Vianne Timmons, OC President and Vice-chancellor, Memorial University “Since the inception of the oil and gas industry in Newfoundland and Labrador, with Federal Government support of the Hibernia project, there have been more than 20,000 construction jobs from communities all across our province, leading to a world-class workforce known internationally for their quality, productivity and safety achievements. Today we require assistance once again to ensure those individuals and families depending on continued work with current and planned oil and gas developments are not let down and left behind.” Darin King Executive Director, Trades NL -30- Learn More: Advance 2030 – A Plan for Growth in the Newfoundland and Labrador Oil and Gas Industry – Implementation Report 2018-19 Noia Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers Newfoundland and Labrador Environmental Industries Association Memorial University TradesNL Follow us on Twitter: @GovNL and @NR_GovNL  Media Contacts Jeremy Reynolds Office of the Premier 709-729-3558 jeremyreynolds@gov.nl.ca Lisa Lawlor Natural Resources 709-631-8155 lisalawlor@gov.nl.ca Ken Morrissey Noia 709-725-5172 kmorrissey@noia.ca Kieran Hanley Newfoundland and Labrador Environmental Industries Association 709-237-8190 kieran@neia.org Jill Piccott Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers 709-685-4812 jill.piccott@capp.ca Dave Sorensen Memorial University 709-685-7134 sorensen@mun.ca Corey Parsons TradesNL 709-832-5116 cparsons@tradesnl.com BACKGROUNDER Value of the Offshore Oil and Gas Industry in Newfoundland and Labrador  All four Offshore Newfoundland and Labrador projects are among some of the lowest carbon intensity emitting oilfields in the world.

This program aims to lower rent by 75 per cent for small businesses that have been affected by COVID-19. Under the criteria set out by the Federal Government:  The program will provide forgivable loans to qualifying commercial property owners to cover 50 per cent of three monthly rent payments that are payable by eligible small business tenants who are experiencing financial hardship during April, May, and June. The loans will be forgiven if the mortgaged property owner agrees to reduce the eligible small business tenants’ rent to no more than 25 per cent for the three corresponding months under a rent forgiveness agreement, which will include a term not to evict the tenant while the agreement is in place. Approved agreements would have a rent composition made up of the following: the small business tenant would cover up to 25 per cent of the rent, the program would cover 50 per cent of the rent and the landlord would cover the remaining minimum 25 percent. Impacted small business tenants are businesses paying no more than $50,000 per month in rent and who have experienced at least a 70 per cent drop in pre-COVID-19 revenues. This support will also be available to non-profit and charitable organizations.  The program, which will be administered by CMHC, is a collaboration between the Federal Government and provincial and territorial governments. The Provincial Government and the Federal Government will cost-share the program. – 30 – Media contact Marc Budgell Finance 709-689-0430 marcbudgell@gov.nl.ca  2020 05 25 1:55 pm  "

The reopening will allow teachers to begin concluding continuity of learning plans with students, as well as to prepare final report cards, and participate in planning in preparation for the next school year. This period will also be critical for teachers to access professional learning opportunities in preparation for September in such areas as technology and virtual learning, knowing that the education system must be prepared for every potential learning experience depending on the situation with COVID-19 at that time. Schools will not reopen to students and the school year for students will conclude on Friday, June 5. This decision has been made in consultation with the Newfoundland and Labrador English School District (NLESD), Conseil scolaire francophone provincial de Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador (CSFP) and the Newfoundland and Labrador Teachers’ Association. As previously announced, the school districts will issue report cards with final marks the week of June 22, with transcripts to be issued by the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development the week of July 6. The Provincial Government is working closely with the NLESD and CFSP, public health officials and the Newfoundland and Labrador Teachers’ Association on a comprehensive plan for September, which will encompass all aspects of the K-12 education system. The plan will be released by the end of June and will include potential requirements for both in-class and online learning – depending on the status of the pandemic, appropriate physical distancing measures, cleaning and disinfecting requirements, and provisions for busing and lunches, among other considerations. The NLESD and CSFP are communicating return to school plans for June 1 to school administrators.For the most up-to-date information related to COVID-19, please visit www.gov.nl.ca/covid-19.

A common theme expressed by farmers at all sessions was that nighttime moose depredation negatively effects their ability to realize maximum profit and the shooting of moose is one of the necessary tools to control crop damage on farms. The public consultations held in February and March provided an opportunity for input through four in-person sessions in Deer Lake, Wooddale, Clarenville and St. John’s and an online questionnaire hosted at engageNL.ca. Other key viewpoints expressed throughout the consultation process included:  Farmers being permitted to develop farm-specific depredation plans that effectively consider the circumstances of individual farms when implementing forms of acceptable wildlife control; The vast majority of crop damage occurs after daylight hours and throughout the night when moose typically feed; Public safety must always be a fundamental concern when shooting a firearm; and Considering use of non-lethal methods of wildlife control.  The complete 2020 Agriculture Depredation Policy Consultation Feedback Report can be viewed online at the Department of Fisheries and Land Resources website. Department officials are currently evaluating all data collected for consideration as part of the Agriculture Depredation Policy review. Quote “Crop damage caused by wildlife is having a real and significant impact on the bottom line for many of our farmers. This public consultation process has been successful in providing farmers and others with opportunity to provide meaningful input on how to potentially adjust the current Agriculture Depredation Policy to better reflect the requirements of farmers while addressing public safety.” Honourable Gerry Byrne Minister of Fisheries and Land Resources Learn More 2020 Agriculture Depredation Policy Consultation Feedback Report Public Consultations Seek Input on Preventing Crop Damage Due to Moose Follow us on Twitter: @GovNL and @FLR_GovNL – 30 –   Media contact Craig Renouf Fisheries and Land Resources 709-637-2923, 640-6922 craigrenouf@gov.nl.ca  2020 05 25 4:08 pm  "

A plan is being developed for instruction for September that will encompass various options depending on the situation with the COVID-19 pandemic at that time. While in-school instruction has been cancelled for the remainder of the school year, it is important that at-home learning continues. With six weeks remaining in the school year, we encourage parents and students to continue learning under the guidance of their teacher(s) as the Newfoundland and Labrador English School District (NLESD) and the Conseil scolaire francophone provincial de Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador (CSFP) continue to offer and strengthen supports for ongoing learning. Teachers will continue their engagement with students using a variety of online teaching tools such as Google Classroom and Google Meet. This also presents an opportunity for students to improve their final grades. School districts will issue report cards with final marks the week of June 22, with transcripts to be issued by the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development the week of July 6. Credit rescue and credit recovery options continue to be available to alleviate any negative impact on high school students, particularly those graduating or transitioning to post-secondary institutions. Equity and access to learning resources remains a priority for government and the school districts. Within the NLESD, 4,000 students have been identified as needing devices. To date, 2,500 of these students have received devices such as Chromebooks, iPads and laptops. The District has sourced the remaining 1,500 devices and these are in the process of being distributed. Solutions are also being found to address connectivity issues for the approximately 270 students who do not have access to the Internet. These include the use of MiFi devices, actual home Internet installation or the use of iPads with data cards and monthly packages included. The Provincial Government is working closely with the school districts, public health officials and the Newfoundland and Labrador Teachers’ Association on a comprehensive plan for September, which will encompass all aspects of the K-12 education system. This includes potential requirements for both in-class and online learning, depending on the status of the pandemic, appropriate physical distancing measures, cleaning and disinfecting requirements, and provisions for busing and lunches, among other considerations.

This is an unprecedented time for the province and the Provincial Government recognizes that many people are facing challenges. To help, residential and general service customers including businesses and other organizations whose rates are based on Holyrood fuel costs, will receive a one-time credit on their bills as early as July. This credit is expected to vary based on customers’ usage and is made possible due to fuel savings at the Holyrood Thermal Generating Facility. Rather than spread these forecast fuel savings monthly over the next year in the usual manner, government will request that the Board of Commissioners of Public Utilities adopt a policy so that a credit will be disbursed immediately up-front to help people and businesses now when they need it most. The Board of Commissioners of Public Utilities will determine the details of this initiative, including the amount and timing of the credit. As well, for customers who require flexible bill payments, government is providing up to $2.5 million to waive the interest on overdue accounts for residential and general service customers throughout the province. This includes residents, businesses and other organizations that are struggling as a result of COVID-19 and will be for a period of 15 months commencing June 1, 2020. Customers will be required to continue to make agreed upon monthly payments to their accounts. Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro and Newfoundland Power have already established COVID-19 policies to ensure that residential and business customers having challenges paying their bills will not be disconnected at this time and options for flexible bill payments are available to help keep their accounts in good standing. Customers who find themselves in a difficult financial situation may call Newfoundland Power at 1-800-663-2802 or Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro at 1-888-737-1296 to discuss options regarding flexible payment arrangements.

Quotes “During the COVID-19 pandemic, ratepayers are facing considerable challenges and many are unable to work, which is creating financial hardship. During this stressful time, we want to provide some relief on customers’ electricity bills.

Through financial measures for ratepayers – including the one-time credit, interest relief, no-disconnection policy, and flexible bill payment options – government, in partnership with Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro and Newfoundland Power, is doing everything possible to ensure residents are protected during this pandemic.” Honourable Siobhan Coady Minister of Natural Resources Learn More Follow us on Twitter: @GovNL and @NR_GovNL  Media Contacts Jeremy Reynolds Office of the Premier 709-729-3558 jeremyreynolds@gov.nl.ca Lisa Lawlor Natural Resources 709-631-8155 lisalawlor@gov.nl.ca  2020 05 14 11:43 am  "

332,332,2020-05-13,Canada,Newfoundland and Labrador,,https://www.gov.nl.ca/releases/2020/flr/0513n03/,Government Website,Minister Byrne Outlines Fishing Sector Support Recommendations Presented to Federal Government," The following statement was issued today by the Honourable Gerry Byrne, Minister of Fisheries and Land Resources: During the past several weeks fish harvesters and plant workers throughout Newfoundland and Labrador have been voicing genuine and serious concerns about the status of the 2020 fishing season as a result of the unprecedented impacts stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic on our province’s seafood industry.  Much of the frustration and anxiety being experienced is the result of uncertainty associated with anticipated federal government assistance regarding workplace safety, meaningful income support, and supports to offset financial impacts on vessel owners and plant operators. I fully share these concerns and recognize the potential impact on workers and our rural communities that rely on a viable fishing sector for their economic well-being.  That is why I have had frequent discussions since the onset of COVID-19 with the Honourable Bernadette Jordan, Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and Canadian Coast Guard, to highlight the need for federal support across the Newfoundland and Labrador fishing sector. Specifically, on April 24, I submitted three detailed proposals to Minister Jordan which outline specific income security, industry and safety support initiatives to assist Newfoundland and Labrador’s fishery and aquaculture industries mitigate the challenges associated with COVID-19. The full suite of recommendations presented to Minister Jordan can be viewed at the Department of Fisheries and Land Resources website. A proposal for Income Support includes recommendations to:  Extend all active regular and Employment Insurance fishing benefit claims until the date that a final decision is made about an individual’s relevant season opening; Ensure that Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security monthly payments are not clawed back from Canadian Emergency Response Benefit payments; Implement an income replacement initiative for older workers in the fish harvesting and processing sectors; and Implement a full income replacement program for those who don’t qualify for Employment Insurance benefits.  A proposal for Industry Safety includes recommendations to:  Establish a funding program to cover the full cost of COVID-19-related occupational health and safety requirements for the fishery and other food processors; and Provide supports to fishing enterprise owners and fish plant operators to procure the necessary personal protective equipment needed to operate safely.  A proposal for Industry Support includes recommendations to:  Institute mortgage and loan deferrals for fish harvesters and fish processors until 2021; Eliminate federal licenses and fees for the fishing sector in 2020; and Ensure all Canada Emergency Response Plan business programs have eligibility criteria that is inclusive for the fishing industry.  My advocacy, along with that of our Atlantic Canadian counterparts, has already helped secure federal government programs and investments including the elimination of duties on PPE, changes to the Canadian Emergency Response Benefit to include fish harvesters, and the $62.5 million to support the newly established Canadian Seafood Stabilization Fund for the fish and seafood processing sector. Rest assured, I plan to maintain this level of advocacy on behalf of our province’s fishing sector as the COVID-19 crisis continues to evolve. – 30 – Media contact Craig Renouf Fisheries and Land Resources 709-637-2923, 640-6922 craigrenouf@gov.nl.ca  2020 05 13 3:20 pm  "

As members of the public become more engaged in responsible outdoor activities and follow guidelines of NLife with COVID-19, outdoor enthusiasts are more likely to encounter a variety of wildlife with newborn young. Please observe wildlife from a distance and avoid taking matters into your own hands if newborn wildlife appear abandoned or displaced from parents. Any attempt to remove wildlife from their natural habitat is dangerous for the person and the animals. The parent may be just a short distance away and could become aggressive if they sense a threat. Conservation Officers will only handle wildlife if there is a public safety concern or circumstances warrant the animal’s removal; otherwise, wildlife are best left in their natural surroundings. While the department may relocate some injured or orphaned wildlife to Salmonier Nature Park for rehabilitation, the park is not equipped to manage high numbers of injured or orphaned animals. Possession and captive housing of wildlife by individual citizens is not permitted in Newfoundland and Labrador under the provincial Wild Life Act and Regulations. Anyone encountering what they believe to be an orphaned or injured animal should contact their local Forestry and Wildlife district office. -30- Media contact Linda Skinner Fisheries and Land Resources 709-637-2284, 632-8167 lindaskinner@gov.nl.ca  2020 05 07 10:17 am  "

Digital contact tracing apps, and related applications, are being explored in Newfoundland and Labrador and many other jurisdictions in Canada and around the world. They are new tools that, if effective, might add to the current public health initiatives required to respond to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Commissioners agreed that “Some of these measures will have significant implications for privacy and other fundamental rights. The choices that our governments make today about how to achieve both public health protection and respect for our fundamental Canadian values, including the right to privacy, will shape the future of our country.” The resolution includes a series of principles, arising from Canada’s privacy statutes and relevant best practices that governments, health agencies, and commercial third parties are encouraged to follow in the development and implementation of these applications. “Properly implemented, and if proven effective, such initiatives may leverage today’s modern technology to simultaneously achieve both greater public health protection and the protection of privacy as a fundamental human right; improperly implemented, they could involve the state or corporate surveillance of Canadians beyond that justified by the public health need and risk the misuse of our personal information,” said Commissioner Harvey. -30- Media Contact Sean Murray Director of Research and Quality Assurance 709-689-0368 Supporting public health, building public trust:   Privacy principles for contact tracing and similar apps Joint Statement by Federal, Provincial and Territorial Privacy Commissioners[1] May 7, 2020 The safety and security of Canadians is of grave concern in the current COVID-19 health crisis. The urgency of limiting the spread of the virus is a significant challenge for government and  public  health  authorities,  who  are  looking  for  ways  to  leverage  personal  information to contain and gain insights about the novel virus and the global threat it presents. In this context, we may see more extraordinary measures being contemplated. Some of these measures will have significant implications for privacy and other fundamental rights. The choices that our governments make today about how to achieve both public health protection and respect for our fundamental Canadian values, including the right to privacy, will shape the future of our country. One of the measures currently being contemplated or already being implemented in some jurisdictions within Canada and around the world is the launch of smart phone apps as a public health tool. Many of these apps are either for the purposes of contact tracing or for purposes of notifying individuals of the fact that they have been in close proximity of someone who has been confirmed or is assessed as likely to be a carrier of COVID-19, in order to help prevent further spread of the virus. Commissioners felt it important to issue a common statement to Canadians because these applications raise important privacy risks. While applicable privacy laws must be observed, some of them do not provide an effective level of protection suited to the digital environment, as was highlighted in a joint resolution last fall. This is why we invite our respective governments, insofar as they plan to use contact-tracing applications, to respect at least the following principles:   Consent and trust: The use of apps must be voluntary. This will be indispensable to building public trust. Trust will also require that governments demonstrate a high level of transparency and accountability.    Legal authority: The proposed measures must have a clear legal basis and consent must be Separate consent must be provided for all specific public health purposes intended. Personal information should not be accessible or compellable by service providers or other organizations.   Necessity and Proportionality: Measures must be necessary and proportionate and, therefore, be science-based, necessary for a specific purpose, tailored to that purpose and likely to be effective. To assist in determining whether the measure in question is justifiable in the circumstances, governments should consider the following:  Necessity: the public health purpose or purposes underlying a measure must be evidence-based and defined with some specificity. Is the purpose to notify users and advise them to take certain actions? Is it to assist public health authorities to better understand local conditions for resource allocation purposes? Is it for another purpose? Proportionality: the measure should be carefully tailored in a way that is rationally connected to the specific purpose(s) to be achieved, Effectiveness: the measure must be likely to be effective at achieving the defined purpose(s), and, Minimal intrusiveness: while the least intrusive option for the intended purpose should be chosen, and data minimization should be applied, where that cannot be achieved or demonstrated, governments should clearly communicate the rationale for the level of personal information that they need to collect. Purpose Limitation: Personal information must be used for its intended public health purpose, and for no other purpose.      De-identification: De-identified or aggregate data should be used whenever possible, unless it will not achieve the defined purpose. Consideration should be given to the risk of re-identification, which can be heightened in the case of location data.    Time-Limitation: Exceptional measures should be time-limited: any personal information collected during this period should be destroyed when the crisis ends, and the application decommissioned.   Transparency: Government should be clear about the basis and the terms applicable to exceptional measures. Canadians should be fully informed about the information to be collected, how it will be used, who will have access to it, where it will be stored, how it will be securely retained and when it will be destroyed. Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) or meaningful privacy analysis should be completed, reviewed by Privacy Commissioners, and a plain-language summary published proactively.   Accountability: Governments should develop and make public an ongoing monitoring and evaluation plan concerning the effectiveness of these initiatives and commit to publicly posting the evaluation report within a specific timeline. Oversight by an independent third-party – such as review and implementation monitoring by a privacy commissioner’s office – will help ensure accountability and reinforce public trust. While some privacy commissioners have the legal authority to conduct independent audits, it is encouraged that others be given this mandate by government through appropriate means. If effectiveness of the application cannot be demonstrated, it should be decommissioned and any personal information collected should be destroyed.   Safeguards: Appropriate legal and technical security safeguards, including strong contractual measures with developers, must be put in place to ensure that any non-authorized parties do not access data and not to be used for any purpose other than its intended public health purpose. Authorities must ensure the public are aware of associated risks and threats (e.g. online fraud or malware).

The October 11, 2019 suspension was due to the company’s failure to disclose to the department in a timely manner, all information regarding the fall 2019 salmon mass mortality event for all 10 sites, which constituted a breach of licence conditions for these sites. Minister Byrne reinstated the licences based on findings from the Memorial University of Newfoundland Marine Institute’s Independent Review of the Mass Mortality Event and the Mi’kmaq Alsumk Mowimsikik Koqoey Association (MAMKA) Post-mortality Event Environmental Monitoring Report. In the wake of the mass mortality event, MOWI has established numerous protocols and practices to better prevent or mitigate a similar event. Further, through consistent openness and transparency, the company has been proactive in its efforts to regain the public trust that was significantly impaired by the mortality event. Consistent with the findings of the Aquatic Animal Health Division of Fisheries and Land Resources, the Marine Institute report concluded the salmon mortality event was due to an unusual set of natural environmental conditions, including prolonged high water temperatures over consecutive days, and low oxygen. The report also notes the department properly followed and adhered to all required protocols. MAMKA – a collaboration of Mi’kmaq First Nation communities including Qalipu First Nation and Miawpuek First Nation – noted in its environmental report that the amount of shoreline affected at the time of the incident was small, with no impact found on seabirds. An investigation by the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner extensively considered whether the department should have publicly released information about this event earlier than it did. The Commissioner’s report concludes the department did not possess information about a risk of significant harm to the environment, or to the health or safety of the public, that it would have been obliged to disclose. In conclusion, Information and Privacy Commissioner Michael Harvey had no recommendations. In the wake of the mass mortality, the Provincial Government’s Aquaculture Policies and Procedures have been strengthened and now include world-leading policies that compel companies to publicly disclose federally reportable disease and abnormal mortality events, regardless of cause, in a timely manner. Failure to do so could result in license suspension or cancellation. MOWI has been working to ensure it is prepared to better prevent or mitigate abnormal mortality events by:  Contracting a  high-tech company to build new certified cages to accommodate deeper nets and develop real time monitoring systems/ aeration systems; Recording and submitting quarterly biophysical data reports to the department; Developing contingency plans and securing contracts for additional resources such as divers and seiners to reduce lags in incident response times; Preparing an incident management response plan to document and report information in a more efficient manner to the Provincial Government and the public; and Updating waste management and environmental management plans and incorporating clear protocols for fish disposal, emergency preparedness and mass mortality contingency planning.  Before restocking occurs on the 10 affected sites, the company must abide by department policies and conditions. -30- Media contact Linda Skinner Fisheries and Land Resources 709-637-2284, 632-8167 lindaskinner@gov.nl.ca  2020 05 06 11:32 am  "

In support of licensees, which includes lounges, bars and restaurants, effective immediately the NLC will waive liquor license fees for the 2020-21 fiscal year. Also, the NLC will work with the licensee community to return general list product in an effort to help with working capital. The NLC is also temporarily waiving warehousing service fees for microbrewers with annual production of 1,000 hectoliters or less for those who use the NLC’s distribution network. To further assist the province’s beverage industry, the NLC has been approved to implement a wholesale pricing discount for licensees, by providing a five per cent discount for wines and spirits, and ready to drink beverages. Additionally, government has approved an increase in product commission discounts for craft breweries, wineries, distilleries and cideries producing 1,000 hectoliters or less to 55 per cent for non-NLC distributed products. Government has also approved a temporary regulatory change to permit ferment-on premise operations (U-Brew) to bottle beverages for their customers that started batches of wine or beer prior to the COVID-19 health restrictions. The NLC will further support businesses through its distribution and marketing capabilities by listing products of local microbreweries not already supported in this way. The NLC also recently announced upgrades in its manufacturing facility, Rock Spirits, to install a canning line. These upgrades will support the NLC’s ability to enter into commercial agreements with local craft producers to can product for those who otherwise would not have this opportunity. Minister Osborne has also committed to bringing legislation forward that will allow for the temporary direct sale of alcohol to customers by restaurants and other licensed establishments that sell prepared meals for takeout/curbside pick-up and delivery. This legislation will also include changes to allow brewers, wineries and distilleries the ability to offer home delivery. By reducing costs, improving working capital, expanding access to the market through the NLC’s distribution and marketing capability, and making it easier for these establishments to sell alcohol directly to customers through pick-up and delivery services, the Provincial Government in partnership with the NLC is making strides toward economic recovery. Quotes “We appreciate the stress that this global pandemic is having on businesses. We have heard from this creative and tenacious sector of the business community and as a government we want to assure them that we listened. We respect their vital contributions to the province’s culture and economy, and the measures announced today are a direct response to what they have asked for. We are all in this together, and the Provincial Government is committed to supporting them as we work through economic recovery together.” Honourable Tom Osborne Minister of Finance and President of Treasury Board Minister Responsible for the Newfoundland and Labrador Liquor Corporation “This is a uniquely challenging time for many of our partners at NLC, and none more so than for our licensee community and microbrewers. Throughout the crisis, NLC has worked to support the province in its broader efforts through the highest safety measures in our retail locations, through supporting our small business partners like our Liquor Express outlets, and by redirecting our organization to produce hand sanitizer at no cost to the health care system and other first responders. The measures being announced today are very tangible ways we are once again stepping up and helping our licensee community, including lounges, restaurants and microbrewers weather the current storm – by reducing costs, improving working capital, expanding access to the market through NLC’s distribution and marketing capability, and making it easier for these establishments to sell alcohol directly to customers through pick-up and delivery services. We appreciate the immense difficulties they currently face, and we are standing side-by-side with them.

Forest fire-fighting staff and an air tanker responded to the fire, which burned an area of two hectares. Penalties for violating provincial forest fire regulations range from a summary offence ticket to a minimum fine of $500 to a maximum three months’ imprisonment. Subsequent offences may result in a minimum fine of $1,000 to a maximum three months’ imprisonment. Forest fire season is in effect for the island portion of the province until September 30. To reduce risk of COVID-19 exposure for fire fighters and other first responders, and to protect communities from risk of wildfires, permits to burn are only being issued for agriculture, silviculture and fire training purposes at this time. A Permit to Burn for these purposes can be obtained at a local Forestry and Wildlife District Office. Fires for agricultural purposes are only permitted during forest fire season if permission is obtained from a forestry official with the Department of Fisheries and Land Resources. Farmers requesting a permit in or near a forested area must be farmers with commercial sales, or new farmers developing land with an adequate protection plan established for the area to be burned. The department will only issue permits based on the current fire weather index, depot capacity, and availability of air tanker support. Permits may be cancelled or suspended if fire risk is high. In Labrador, the forest fire season is scheduled to start June 1, subject to weather conditions and wildfire risk, and will remain in place until September 30.

The plan, ‘A Foundation for Living with COVID-19’, includes five alert levels. Depending on which level the province is in, as determined by the Chief Medical Officer of Health, public health restrictions will be gradually relaxed. The province is currently in Alert Level 5. Effective immediately, households may now spend time with one other household bubble. People should not have close contact with anyone else outside the two household bubble. If someone is working and out in the public, people should be cautious about who is in their bubble, so as not to increase the risk to a vulnerable individual. The Chief Medical Officer of Health will carefully monitor each alert level to determine the pace at which the public health restrictions can be relaxed or strengthened. This depends on several factors including an increase in cases of COVID-19, the speed of community transmission, and the effectiveness of contact tracing. Based on the assessment of these factors, on Monday, May 11, 2020, the province will move to Alert Level 4. A complete list of the services and activities permitted during Alert Level 4 can be found in the backgrounder below. A complete list of the services and activities permitted during all alert levels will be available at www.gov.nl.ca/covid-19/. A Business Response Team has been established to support businesses as they prepare to re-open. Businesses who have questions will be able to email covid19info@gov.nl.ca or call call 1-833-771-0696  beginning 12:00 p.m. tomorrow (Friday, May 1). For the foreseeable future, all Newfoundlanders and Labradorians must continue to abide by the proven core personal public health measures. These measures include:  Stay informed, be prepared and follow public health advice; Wash your hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds; Use an alcohol based hand sanitizer in the absence of soap and water; Do not touch your face; Cough or sneeze into your sleeve or a tissue; Maintain physical distancing; Wear a non-medical mask or face covering when you are in public and unable to maintain physical distancing; Increase cleanliness and ventilation of public spaces and worksites; If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others; Work from home, where possible; and Shop online and use curb side pick-up, where possible.  Quotes “Our plan balances the relaxing of public health restrictions with the prevention of a future spike in COVID-19 cases. As we continue to adapt to living with COVID-19 at our doorstep and in our communities, there is room for optimism but we cannot rest on our laurels. We have to remain ever vigilant and respect the power of the virus.” Honourable Dwight Ball Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador “This plan marks a change of gear as we move out of the first wave of COVID-19. It lays out a path to enable us to live more normally, but in a way that protects us as best we can from the virus flaring up in the near future. It’s going to take discipline and determination to see it through.” Honourable John Haggie Minister of Health and Community Services “We have reached a turning point with COVID-19 in our province thanks to the incredible efforts of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians who have shown relentless spirit and determination in the face of adversity. As we navigate the next phase of living with COVID-19, we must proceed with caution and remain vigilant in following the public health measures in place.

Under the provincial Animal Health and Protection Act, a dog shall be kept safely tethered or penned up at all times unless it is:  Held on a leash by a person capable of restraining its movements; Being used by a person for the purpose of lawful hunting; Being used by a person to work in a lawful manner with sheep; or Kept or used for a purpose, e.g. service animal, and under conditions prescribed by regulation.

The day is set aside annually to remember and honour those who lost their lives or were injured due to a workplace tragedy. It also serves as a renewal to the commitment to improve health and safety in the workplace. Each year, the St. John’s and District Labour Council holds a ceremony in the lobby of Confederation Building to lay wreaths and pay respect to workers who lost their lives. This year, the Council will mark the National Day of Mourning with a virtual candlelight vigil at 12:00 p.m. These online gatherings are happening across the country to align with public health directives that are keeping essential workers safe through the COVID-19 crisis. The Council encourages residents of the province to show solidarity with frontline workers and remember fallen workers by lighting a candle and posting a photo to social media with the hashtag #WorkersDayofMourning and #StopthePandemicAtWork. In 2019, the lost-time incidence rate due to workplace injury or illness in Newfoundland and Labrador was 1.6 per 100 workers, among the lowest in Canada.

The federal initiative, announced on March 27, provides up to $40,000 in commercial loans to businesses to alleviate unusual financial pressures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Funding is provided to qualifying businesses through an application process designed by Export Development Canada and must be made through the business’s primary financial institution. The Credit Union Regulations, as currently worded, could impact the access for some provincial credit unions to this program which would provide much-needed financial assistance to existing commercial customers, especially small to medium-sized businesses. To support the province’s credit unions and their commercial members, government has amended the Regulations to provide all of the province’s credit unions with the ability to access federal commercial loan programs to help Newfoundland and Labrador businesses deal with the financial impacts from the COVID-19 public health emergency. Quote “Our government has listened to the concerns raised by our local business community arising from COVID-19, and we are working hard to find solutions within our control to help alleviate these difficulties. By amending the Credit Union Regulations, a number of small to medium-sized businesses in our province who bank with these institutions can now access funding which can be used to cover expenses such as rent, utilities and other critical operational expenses.” Honourable Tom Osborne Minister of Service NL -30- Learn more  Follow us @GovNL and @ServiceNL_  Canadian Emergency Business Account Credit Union Deposit Guarantee Corporation Media contact Krista Dalton Service NL 709-729-4748, 685-6492 kristadalton@gov.nl.ca  2020 04 24 3:14 pm  "

This is consistent with actions being taken by other forest fire fighting agencies in Canada to lower the risks associated with COVID-19 exposure. The minimum fine associated with the violation of the fire ban proclamation is $1,000.

The CERB supports Canadians by providing financial support to employed and self-employed Canadians who are directly affected by COVID-19. However, the Provincial Income Support Program provides financial benefits and other services to eligible low income people with no other means of support to assist in meeting daily living expenses. While some Income Support clients may qualify for the CERB because they had employment earnings in the last year; others will not qualify. It is important to note, individuals cannot receive both provincial Income Support and the CERB at the same time. Should Income Support clients receive the CERB, they will no longer qualify for Income Support, and benefits will be suspended immediately. An overpayment will be set up on Income Support files where there is an overlap in payments from the CERB. When Income Support benefits are suspended, individuals will need to apply for prescription drug coverage through Newfoundland and Labrador Prescription Drug Plan (NLPDP) by calling 1-888-859-3535 or going online. More information can be found in the backgrounder below.

As the global pandemic continues to evolve, the Provincial Government recognizes that this is an unprecedented time and focus remains on ensuring the health and safety of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians. At the same time, in the case of family visitation for children and youth in care, maintaining and supporting relationships between children and their families is important in order to ensure their connections, sense of belonging and attachment. Given the direction from the province’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, which limits the ability for in person contact, connecting through technology is one of the next best alternatives. The Provincial Government appreciates that this is especially difficult for children in care and their families who were used to having in person visits before COVID-19 and understands that some families are experiencing barriers to having video-based visits with their children. To reduce these barriers, the department has been exploring solutions. In consultation with the Office of the Chief Information Officer and Bell Canada, starting next week the department will begin supplying these impacted families that lack access to technology with additional resources to support video-based visits, where possible, with their children throughout the COVID-19 situation. This technology will also make phone calls, texts, and/or emails possible. The temporary suspension of in-person family visitation is reviewed on an on-going basis, with exceptional circumstances being considered by the department’s social workers. These actions are consistent with the direction of the Federal Government, other provinces and territories, and the Chief Medical Officer of Health for Newfoundland and Labrador to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 within the province, across the country and around the world.

Quote “Ensuring the safety and well-being of children and youth is at the heart of what we do each and every day. While the decision to temporarily suspend in person family visitation was not made lightly, it was done in the best interests of the children, youth and their families.

The pause on income tax refunds, including GST credits, for defaulted student loan borrowers who filed their income tax return on or after April 9, 2020 being diverted from the Canada Revenue Agency to the Provincial Government will be in effect until September 30, 2020.

An employer shall not require an employee to work on a public holiday, however an employer and employee may agree that a public holiday will be a working day for the employee. If the employee does work, is the employee entitled to double pay for those hours? Yes, as per section 17 of the Labour Standards Act. Are you worried that this will result in increased cost pressure to stores? This is an option for stores. Business owners will be able to make a decision if it is in the best interest of their businesses to open on Good Friday. Does this exemption apply to Easter Sunday as well?  No. What impact will this decision have on unionized businesses who are now permitted to open under this regulation? This will need to be determined by the union and the employer within the parameters of the terms and conditions that are contained in the collective agreement.  2020 04 06 2:56 pm  "

Discussions have been held with the province’s public post-secondary institutions regarding entrance requirements for the September 2020 term and the process for determining scholarship requirements.

The investment announced today will help provide certainty to community-based organizations that they can continue to deliver their programs and services. Additionally, the multi-year funding for the 22 community organizations that Premier Ball announced in April 2018 totaling $18 million annually over three years will continue. With approximately 16,000 people working in the community sector and thousands of volunteers throughout the province, the Provincial Government will continue to work collaboratively with community-based organizations to overcome potential issues and capitalize on opportunities to move the sector forward. Quotes “We appreciate the work of community-based organizations every day, and it is in times like the global COVID-19 pandemic that we are facing today that their importance is truly felt. They are our partners and are well-positioned to help families and communities that are in need. It is important that we all stand together in this unprecedented time and take every step we can to support our citizens. This investment of more than $120 million will go a long way towards supporting Newfoundlanders and Labradorians.” Honourable Dwight Ball Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador “I would like to extend a heartfelt thanks to all of the province’s community-based organizations for being leaders in their communities.

The financial support will be retroactive to the date the closures were effective (Tuesday, March 17 for child care centres and Thursday, March 19 for family child care homes). Families will be reimbursed for any fees paid after the closure date, receiving either a credit or refund from the child care service provider. Wage supplements for Early Childhood Educators provided by the Department of Education and Early Childhood Development will continue as normal. Further information regarding the process to receive funding will be released in the coming days. Minister Warr also announced today that options for the provision of regulated child care services to assist essential workers are being explored.

The Marine Institute facilitated ‘A Review of the 2019 Newfoundland and Labrador South Coast Cultured Atlantic Salmon Mortality Event’ at the request of the Provincial Government in October, 2019. The review committee consisted of subject-matter experts from the Marine Institute’s Centre for Aquaculture and Seafood Development, the Atlantic Veterinary College of the University of Prince Edward Island, and the University of British Columbia. The full report is available here. Consistent with the findings of the Aquatic Animal Health Division of Fisheries and Land Resources, the report concludes the cause of the salmon mortality event was an unusual set of natural environmental conditions – including prolonged high water temperatures over consecutive days, and low oxygen levels – and was not consistent with an infectious cause. The report provides a chronicle of factors that contributed to this event, including handling practices by the company that occurred during warm water temperatures. The report supports that the department properly followed and adhered to all required protocols. The review committee offers recommendations to improve reporting of, and strengthen responses to, future mortality events, and to prevent or mitigate similar events from occurring in future. The department has already enacted many of these recommendations through its aquaculture policy and regulation reform process, initiated in 2017, such as:  Enacting strict requirements for companies to publicly report on escapes, mortality events, and incidents, including quarantine or depopulation orders; Implementing new policies and procedures requiring companies to submit incident management system information to the department and other agencies for review and approval to ensure effective reporting, hazard analysis and corrective action to prevent incidents; and Requiring all finfish operators, by October 2020, to implement extensive, detailed mitigation measures addressing and preventing mortality events including, but not limited to, deeper nets and aeration devices. Additionally, by January 2024 all marine cage systems will be required to be more robust and meet specific standards.  Quote “I thank the external reviewers who participated in this thorough review of an extreme and unprecedented event in the history of our aquaculture industry. I am pleased to report that many of the recommendations outlined have already been adopted, or are currently underway, as part of our ongoing effort to update and strengthen Newfoundland and Labrador’s aquaculture policies and regulations. Our commitment to a strong, sustainable aquaculture industry regulated by the highest standards remains steadfast.” Honourable Gerry Byrne Minister of Fisheries and Land Resources – 30 –  Learn more:  Minister Byrne Directs Northern Harvest to Provide Full Disclosure of Further Salmon Mortality Events; Licenses Suspended Minister Byrne Clarifies Government Stance on Aquaculture Modernized Aquaculture Policy and Procedures Established to Meet Needs of Growing Industry Follow us on Twitter: @GovNL and @FLR_GovNL Media contact Linda Skinner Fisheries and Land Resources 709-637-2284, 632-8167 lindaskinner@gov.nl.ca  2020 03 19 9:32 am  "

Monitoring of the areas continues and the public are strongly encouraged to remain at a safe distance to avoid encounters with polar bears and to provide Conservation Officers with adequate space to perform their duties in a safe manner. The public are reminded that it is a violation of the Provincial Wild Life Act to harass wildlife. Residents are encouraged to keep pets inside or under close supervision, travel in groups when outdoors if possible, and never approach a fresh kill or carcass. Always adhere to the proper storage, collection and disposal of garbage to avoid attracting bears into communities and yards. Under no circumstances should residents approach a polar bear. While every situation is different, when encountering a polar bear take note of the bear’s behavior. If the bear does not see you:  Quietly back away and leave the area; Try to stay downwind of the animal; Keep an eye on the bear; and Never get between a bear and her cubs.  If the bear has seen or smelled you:  Remain calm; Give the bear space and a route to get away; Back away but do not run; If you must speak, do so calmly and firmly; and Avoid direct eye contact with the bear.

Conservation officers with the Department of Fisheries and Land Resources are monitoring the area and it is recommended residents take appropriate steps to avoid encounters with polar bears. Residents are encouraged to keep pets inside or under close supervision, travel in groups when outdoors if possible, and never approach a fresh kill or carcass. Always adhere to the proper storage, collection and disposal of garbage to avoid attracting bears into communities and yards. Under no circumstances should residents approach a polar bear. While every situation is different, when encountering a polar bear take note of the bear’s behavior. If the bear does not see you:  Quietly back away and leave the area; Try to stay downwind of the animal; Keep an eye on the bear; and Never get between a bear and her cubs.  If the bear has seen or smelled you:  Remain calm; Give the bear space and a route to get away; Back away but do not run; If you must speak, do so calmly and firmly; and Avoid direct eye contact with the bear.  Based on previous year’s observations of polar bear migration patterns, communities along the tip of the Northern Peninsula and South Coast of Labrador may observe polar bears during this time of year.

Health authorities have urged Canadians to engage in social-distancing in public areas. Temporarily allowing passengers to remain in their vehicles will help prevent further transmission of the virus. However, passengers may still be required to vacate their vehicles prior to departing, as per the captain’s discretion, due to weather conditions and the potential for unsafe travelling conditions. Crews are also required to maintain additional space between vehicles to allow for easier evacuation of passengers in the event of an emergency. This additional space may result in fewer vehicles for some trips. Based on advice from Dr. Janice Fitzgerald, Chief Medical Officer of Health for Newfoundland and Labrador, as of 7:00 p.m. on Saturday, March 14, anyone returning after travelling outside the country is required to self-isolate for a period of 14 days upon their return to Canada. Affected ferry passengers will be permitted to travel on provincial ferries to get home, but will be required to be isolated at the terminal and while onboard the ship. Passengers are encouraged to ask ferry crews about self-isolation procedures before boarding. Provincial ferries all have additional cleaners, sanitizers and soap and ferry captains and crews have been directed to enhance their cleaning schedule between and during crossings and in the evening. Crews have also been focusing on all high-touch surface areas, such as washroom facilities, hand rails, table tops, door handles, and children’s play areas. Crews are also conducting hourly checks of hand sanitizers, soap, and toilet paper to ensure that they are well stocked at all times.

This change in staffing model will increase the number of Conservation Officers available to address fish and wildlife enforcement issues. The department is undertaking a restructuring of enforcement personnel that will combine officers from the department’s Forestry Division and Fish and Wildlife Division into one integrated resource enforcement team under the newly formed Newfoundland and Labrador Resource Enforcement Division This new structure will be implemented in two phases, starting with Labrador in May at which time the number of resource enforcement positions in the region will increase from 12 to 16 with seven officers responsible for Western Labrador and the remaining officers responsible for Central Labrador and communities on the North and South coasts.  Conservation Officers in Newfoundland will then merge under the new division. This restructuring process brings very near to conclusion the work of staff that began when the Department of Fisheries and Land Resources was created in February 2017 to create a dedicated division that consolidates and better utilizes enforcement resources. These changes will not result in any loss of frontline enforcement positions. Once completed there will be a contingent of 90 highly skilled cross-trained conservation officers stationed throughout the province with authority to enforce a broader range of provincial inland fish, forestry and wildlife regulations. Quote “Consolidation of officers into one division allows for sharing of related skill-sets, experience and expertise and will lead to enhanced enforcement services in support of the protection of our wildlife, inland fish and forestry resources. Given the unique challenges facing sensitive wildlife in the region, Labrador is the appropriate location to unveil the department’s new enforcement structure.” Honourable Gerry Byrne Minister of Fisheries and Land Resources – 30 – Learn more Follow us on Twitter: @GovNL and @FLR_GovNL Media contact Craig Renouf Fisheries and Land Resources 709-637-2923, 640-6922 craigrenouf@gov.nl.ca  2020 03 12 11:30 am  "

The MHC is a grassroots movement of Indigenous and non-Indigenous men and boys who are standing up against violence towards women and children. This is the third year for the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly to participate in this Campaign. The inspiration for the MHC came to co-founders Paul Lacerte and his daughter Raven in 2011 during a moose hunt on their traditional territory along a section of highway where dozens of women have gone missing or been murdered. The goal of the Campaign is to end violence towards women and children, and to distribute ten million moose hide pins across Canada. Wearing the moose hide pin signifies a commitment to honour, respect, and protect women and children; and to work together to end violence against them. Members of the House of Assembly began the day in the Chamber with a prayer and presentation of their moose hide pins, which will be worn during House proceedings today. Quote “I am pleased that the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly is once again participating in this campaign, which seven years later has distributed more than 2,000,000 squares of moose hide across Canada. It has brought much-needed awareness to communities and organizations across this country on the tragic reality of gender-based violence, and started important conversations on how we can all work together to end violence towards women and children.” Honourable Scott Reid Speaker of the House of Assembly – 30 – Learn more For more information on the Moose Hide Campaign and how to become involved, visit: www.moosehidecampaign.ca Video message from Moose Hide Campaign co-founders Follow us on Twitter: @NL_HOA Media contact Bobbi Russell Policy and Communications Officer House of Assembly 709-729-1178 bobbirussell@gov.nl.ca  2020 03 11 9:20 am  "

In The Way Forward on Immigration in Newfoundland and Labrador, the Provincial Government set a target of welcoming 1,700 permanent residents annually by 2022. Since 2017, immigration has increased nearly 40 per cent and, according to preliminary data from Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada, the province welcomed 1,850 permanent residents in 2019. Most permanent residents settle in Newfoundland and Labrador through economic immigration programs. Most economic immigrants are nominated or endorsed by the provincial Office of Immigration and Multiculturalism, and are later assessed by the Federal Government on their eligibility to become permanent residents. In 2019, the provincial Office of Immigration and Multiculturalism increased the number of files it nominated and endorsed by nearly 25 per cent over the 2018 calendar year, a new record for Newfoundland and Labrador that indicates further growth in permanent residents in 2020. As a result, Minister Mitchelmore announced the province’s new target, increasing immigration to 2,500 permanent residents annually by 2022. This initiative delivers on commitments in The Way Forward to strengthen the province’s economic foundation. The Way Forward outlines all actions the Provincial Government is taking to achieve a strong, diversified province with a high standard of living, and can be viewed at thewayforward.gov.nl.ca. Quote “Increasing immigration is the result of continued collaborative efforts by a number of partners, including the Federal and Provincial Governments, community organizations, employers and businesses, and our communities. Thank you to everyone throughout the province who played a role in this success. We continue to work together with our partners to support even more newcomers to make Newfoundland and Labrador their new home.” Honourable Christopher Mitchelmore Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Labour – 30 – Learn more The Way Forward on Immigration in Newfoundland and Labrador The Way Forward on Immigration in Newfoundland and Labrador: 2019-20 Initiatives Follow us on Twitter: @GovNL and @AESL_GovNL Media contact Ryan Crocker Advanced Education, Skills and Labour 709-729-1795, 725-9595 ryancrocker@gov.nl.ca  2020 03 11 9:45 am  "

The transfer was arranged with National Museums Scotland by the federal Department of Canadian Heritage. The remains were transported through a careful and respectful process and transferred into the care of The Rooms in St. John’s. The repatriation of the remains represents a significant achievement in the long-running effort to return the Beothuk remains to the province.

The Provincial Government advises that the remains will stay at The Rooms until a decision on their final resting place is reached in consultation with the five Indigenous Leaders. Quotes “I am extremely pleased that through perseverance and the spirit of Reconcilation, our government and the Indigenous Governments and Organizations have been successful in our efforts to return the remains of Nonosabasut and Demasduit to their rightful home.

We understand how important these remains are to the Indigenous people of Newfoundland and Labrador, and we are pleased to have been able to support their efforts. I thank National Museums Scotland, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, and the Indigenous communities involved for their invaluable contributions throughout this process.” Honourable Steven Guilbeault Minister of Canadian Heritage “The voluntary repatriation of our brother, Nonosabasut, and our sister, Demasduit, has not only given Indigenous people closure, it has also given the people of our province closure. It signifies the end of exile for our Beothuk ancestors, who will finally receive the respect and honour they deserve by being returned home, and home is where their story began.” Saqamaw Mi’sel Joe Miawpukek First Nation “We honour the return of Tshiashinnut Numushum Nonosabasut and Nukum Demasduit.

The repatriation of their remains is significant for all Indigenous peoples in Newfoundland and Labrador, as it provides hope that others whose remains have been taken away from their homelands for the purpose of academic research will someday find rest and peace.” Johannes Lampe, President, Nunatsiavut “Today, we are honouring the Beothuk. We remember them with the return of Nonosabasut and Demasduit to the place they called home. Their story is an important part of all of our history. And while it’s a stark reminder of the tragic and horrific effects of colonialism, it provides us with an opportunity to take stock of the present and continuing colonial policies. It is a call for us all to work harder to be more diligent to learn from the past. Such policies must find no expression today or in the future. I commend Chief Mi’sel Joe for his tenacity in ensuring that the remains of Nonosabasut and Demasduit were returned. I acknowledge the leadership of Premier Ball, his government, the Government of Canada and the cooperation of Indigenous groups in this province for making it happen. This is a historic day.” Todd Russell President, NunatuKavut Community Council “The spirit of the Beothuk people is part of this land, and part of our shared history in Newfoundland and Labrador. It is with a sigh of relief that I, alongside the Indigenous Leaders of the province who came together to bring them home, see the remains of Nonosabasut and Demasduit returned to their ancestral territory. This is an event of historical and cultural significance, a marker of true reconciliation. I thank Saqamaw Mi’sel Joe for leading this effort and Premier Dwight Ball for inviting us to work together on this initiative at the first Indigenous Leaders Roundtable.

The remains of Nonosabasut and Demasduit were removed from their resting place at Red Indian Lake in the 1820s and became part of the Industrial Museum of Scotland (today’s National Museums Scotland) in the 1850s. The 1829 death of a Beothuk woman, Shawnadithit, marked the end of the Beothuk as a people and a culture in the province. The province acted on calls by Saqamaw Mi’sel Joe and requested repatriation of the remains from National Museums Scotland. National Museums Scotland advised the Province that such a request had to satisfy three conditions, as follows: The request must be made a national government; the request must have the support of a national museum; and the request must be supported by a community descended from the original Indigenous people. As there is no recognized community that is descended from the Beothuk, the province brought together the Leaders of the five Indigenous Governments and Organizations at the first-ever Indigenous Leaders Roundtable in 2017 to make this a priority. The five Leaders signed a declaration to support the repatriation. The province engaged the Federal Government and received confirmation from Canadian Heritage of its willingness to take leadership on the request and enter into discussions with National Museums Scotland. An important step was achieved in January of 2019 when National Museums Scotland announced an agreement had been reached with the Federal Government to transfer the remains of the Beothuk to Canada.  2020 03 11 8:15 pm  "

In fact, recent statistics from the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre show that, in 2019, Canadians lost over $98 million to fraud. During the month of March, the national fraud prevention campaign aims to help Canadians stand up to scammers who are costing them millions of dollars every year. It also helps educate and inform consumers on how to recognize, reject and report fraud. From school aged children to the elderly, from consumers to corporations – everyone is vulnerable to fraud. As the digital world becomes increasingly important in the lives of residents, fraudsters are creating more elaborate schemes. Knowledge is key, Mr. Speaker, and we must all be vigilant when it comes to fraud. Beware of any activity that does not appear to be legitimate. Report scams to authorities so they can warn other people and help minimize the chances of them spreading further. Tell your friends and family of any scams you are aware of to avoid them becoming a victim of this type of crime. During Fraud Prevention Month, and throughout the year, our government encourages consumers to learn about ways to protect themselves from fraud. We remain committed to raising awareness about fraud and providing consumers with the tools and information they need to protect themselves and others. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.  2020 03 10 1:50 pm  "

Last week, NLESD cancelled tours planned for Northern Italy. The district has now extended cancellations to all European destinations until the end of April. This is a difficult but necessary decision, which I fully support, to protect students and staff from risk of exposure and the possibility of quarantine while overseas, or self-quarantine upon their return to the province. The department and district continue to monitor other planned tours and these may also be cancelled as the situation evolves. We appreciate the continued advice and collaboration from our provincial public health officials, including the province’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, who supports a low-risk approach. We are also working with the school districts and public health officials to raise awareness about the importance of proper hygiene and handwashing practices to help reduce the risk of transmission. While there have been no reported cases of the virus in our province to date, we must be prepared. Information will be distributed to schools and there is information specifically on hygiene available on the Department of Health and Community’s website. I encourage parents to review this information and to discuss hygiene practices with their children. – 30 – Media contact Tina Coffey Education and Early Childhood Development 709-729-1906, 687-9903 tcoffey@gov.nl.ca  2020 03 10 2:10 pm  "

This includes ongoing discussion of human resource issues. The department has heard the concerns from family physicians and unions about sick notes. Asking employees to get a sick note increases the potential spread of infection. Following consultation with the regional health authorities and to address these concerns, regional health authority employees who are exhibiting respiratory illness symptoms will not be required to provide a sick note for absence periods of less than fourteen days. This decision is effective immediately and will be reassessed periodically, as the need arises. If you are experiencing symptoms following out-of-province travel, please call 811 to speak to a registered nurse. Symptoms have included fever, cough and difficulty breathing. You should call ahead and speak to your health care provider if you are concerned about your symptoms, or if you have a travel history to an area where cases have been confirmed. If you are severely ill and feel you need emergency medical attention, please call 911 and ensure you tell them about your travel history. For online information and updates on COVID-19 in Newfoundland and Labrador, please visit the Department of Health and Community Services website. To date, there are no cases of COVID-19 in Newfoundland and Labrador. Quote “This interim decision is to reduce the risk to employees and their loved ones, as well as those they look after.

From August to November 2019, 92.9 per cent of school busses inspected received a ‘pass’ rating. This means on the date of inspection the bus was found to be free of defects, or had minor defects that did not preclude the safe operation of the vehicle, either with or without passengers. Buses that do not pass inspection must be repaired and proof of the repair must be verified by Service NL before the bus can be returned to service. As part of government’s commitment to safety, all school buses registered in Newfoundland and Labrador are inspected a minimum of three times per year to ensure they continue to meet all provincial and federal safety standards. Each September, December and July, 100 per cent of buses are subject to mandatory inspections at an Official Inspection Station. Beginning in March, Highway Enforcement Officers conduct an inspection, at random, of a minimum of 30 per cent of the fleet again. At any time throughout the year, Service NL may choose to do additional inspections of an operator’s fleet, especially in cases where a complaint has been received. All complaints against school buses are investigated as soon as the complaint is received. The results of Service NL’s mandatory school bus inspections are published online.

As legislators, we are all keenly aware of the profound impact that the Muskrat Falls project has on ratepayers and the financial situation in Newfoundland and Labrador. In 2017, a public inquiry was called to:  Provide a greater understanding of whether all options were considered in the 2012 sanctioning; Secondly, why there are significant differences between the actual cost of the project and the estimated cost; and also Whether it was justified and reasonable for the project to be excluded from the Public Utilities Board oversight.  Mr. Speaker, we put a process in place to ensure all information was provided to the inquiry. Justice Richard D. LeBlanc received approximately six million documents and the report he delivered today is over 1,000 pages in length. The Muskrat Falls inquiry was a comprehensive and detailed investigation that is of great importance to the people of our province. I would like to thank Justice LeBlanc and everyone who participated in the inquiry, for their commitment and dedication. Mr. Speaker, while we can’t undo the past, we can learn from it and make informed decisions as we take actions to minimize the impact of this project on current Newfoundlanders and Labradorians and for future generations. Thank you Mr. Speaker.  2020 03 05 1:40 pm  "

We will use the lessons from Gander to begin implementation across the province over the coming year. This team is a positive contribution to collaborative maternity care in the community, and at James Paton Memorial Regional Health Centre.

As a result of the diligent work by our team of wildlife experts to highlight the plight of Labrador’s boreal caribou and the steadfast negotiating position taken by the province, we have been able to successfully leverage $5.4 million from the Federal Government devoted solely to the conservation and protection of Labrador’s Boreal Caribou – the Mealy Mountains, Lac Joseph, and Red Wine herds. This agreement builds on the efforts of Government to protect and allow for the recovery of the species and its critical habitat, and help change the trajectory of boreal caribou in Labrador from declining populations to stable populations. The agreement recognizes the wide range of threats to Labrador caribou and outlines a strategic approach that focuses on research, monitoring, and conservation. We now have the tools to secure enhanced guardianship and stewardship that will seek to address the challenge of unsanctioned hunting which is inhibiting the caribou’s recovery. Mr. Speaker, the boreal caribou of Labrador have long held intrinsic value in Indigenous culture and traditions. I am proud today to highlight this agreement, which formally recognizes the importance of Indigenous engagement and traditional Indigenous knowledge in the future recovery and protection of the herds. It will help forge a much needed broader, deeper partnership with Indigenous communities that focuses on specific, realized threats and which is integral to the successful recovery of boreal caribou in Labrador. As the implementation of this plan begins we look forward to continuing ongoing engagement with our Indigenous partners in Labrador, and indeed all those with a vested interest in the protection and recovery of Labrador’s precious caribou resource.

By establishing cooperative facilities throughout the province, we’re giving smaller-scale farmers who might not be ready to make a substantial financial investment into cold-storage infrastructure the boost they need to expand production, improve vegetable quality, and ultimately, improve food self-sufficiency in Newfoundland and Labrador.” Honorable Gerry Byrne Minister of Fisheries and Land Resources “Cold storage allows farmers to extend their marketing periods, meet wholesaler requirements for consistent quality and supply, and increase opportunities for secondary processing. Establishing cooperative cold storage facilities will give producers the infrastructure they need to increase production and improve vegetable quality. I encourage producers to consider this opportunity to expand and enhance our provincial vegetable sector.” Melvin Rideout, President, Newfoundland and Labrador Horticulture Producers Council – 30 –  Learn more Expression of Interest: Development of Cooperative Vegetable Cold Storage Facilities Canadian Agricultural Partnership Provincial Agrifoods Assistance Program The Way Forward on Agriculture Follow us on Twitter: @GovNL and @FLR_GovNL Media contacts Linda Skinner Fisheries and Land Resources 709-637-2284, 632-8167 lindaskinner@gov.nl.ca Melvin Rideout Newfoundland and Labrador Horticulture Producers Council 709-636-1258 melvinrideout@gmail.com  2020 02 19 1:50 pm  "

Ministers approved the release of the new Strengthening School Bus Safety in Canada report from the federal, provincial and territorial Task Force on School Bus Safety. The report reiterated the excellent safety record of school buses in Canada, based on a review of all aspects of school bus safety, including seatbelts. It noted that 79 per cent of incidents involving a school bus occurred outside the bus, either from the bus itself or passing motorists. The report also identifies potential technologies that can make school buses even safer, such as camera technologies, automatic emergency braking and extended stop-arms. As part of the ongoing dialogue around ensuring that commercial drivers across the country have the necessary knowledge and skills to safely operate their vehicles, ministers reached an important milestone by approving a Canada-wide training standard. This standard is for entry-level training of commercial motor vehicle drivers and will be included in the National Safety Code which provides support for all jurisdictions. These enhancements align with the numerous changes to the provincial Highway Traffic Act that have been made over the last several years in Newfoundland and Labrador, with an aim of improving road safety. Recent improvements to the Act include increased fines and tougher penalties for a number of offenses such as impaired driving; amendments regarding excessive speeding, street racing, stunting and move over provisions; a new offence for driving without due care and attention; introduction of a one-metre rule for cyclists and pedestrians; and changes to enable the use of image capture systems to help increase road safety on our province’s roads and highways, including in school zones.

The report highlighted concerns around the lack of transparency in the acquisition of specialty wines for the Corporation’s Bordeaux Futures program during the fiscal years 2007 to 2018. Decisions regarding these acquisitions rested solely with the former Chief Executive Officer (CEO), were not documented and did not follow the standard process for other product lines. These wines were purchased throughout the period in quantities that far exceeded customer demand and resulted in significant excess inventory of specialty wine. Further, instances were identified where the Corporation contravened federal and provincial legislation by knowingly selling and shipping, or arranging the shipping of, specialty wines directly to customers in other provinces. Prices for most of these wines were discounted in an effort to reduce the excess level of specialty wine. The report identified that the former CEO did not take appropriate action to address a known conflict of interest relationship with a close family member who conducted business with the Corporation. The audit found that the former CEO made decisions to purchase specialty wines which benefited this close family member and which influenced the performance of the CEO’s duties as a public office holder. In addition, the Corporation misrepresented information in its response to the Office of the Citizens’ Representative related to a 2016-2017 investigation of conflict of interest allegations involving the former CEO and the same close family member. In response to a recommendation of the Citizens’ Representative stemming from this investigation, government committed to complete a government-wide review addressing conflicts of interest within the broader public service, including Crown entities. This review is ongoing.

The Muskrat Falls Project, sanctioned in 2012 by the previous administration, has created an urgent issue facing the province today. If left unaddressed, this would have a devastating impact on Newfoundlanders and Labradorians, who would face unprecedented electricity rate increases and economic hardship. Both governments have agreed to undertake a financial restructuring of the projects to ensure that they are financially stable over the long-term and ratepayers are protected. The solution involves transitioning the Muskrat Falls/Labrador Transmission Assets revenue model to a traditional cost of service model which will ensure that equity returns from Nalcor are redirected to benefit ratepayers. The change to a cost of service model reflects the approach used for regulated utilities throughout North America. A more detailed explanation of the revenue model is included in the backgrounder below. With the Government of Canada’s involvement, monetizing suitable assets, such as our dividends from the Labrador Island Link, is also required to ensure a sustainable long-term solution. Related discussions are ongoing. To reduce cash requirements related to servicing the project’s debt, the Government of Canada is allowing a deferral of Sinking Fund and Cost Overrun Escrow Account payments if required. The formal agreement with both levels of government will be implemented by project commissioning. Residents will be further updated once the specifics have been finalized. Additionally, Canada is also prepared to work with provincial governments to consider opportunities for further electrification and decarbonization. In addition to discussions with the Federal Government, work is continuing on the Provincial Government’s rate management plan. The confirmation letters between the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador and the Government of Canada are online here. Quotes “We committed to protecting ratepayers from the negative impacts of the Muskrat Falls Project. We are delivering on that commitment. Working with the Government of Canada, we have extensively analyzed the true financial structure of the Muskrat Falls Project which was sanctioned by the previous government in 2012. We have identified a long-term solution on behalf of the people of the province.” Honourable Dwight Ball Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador “We are focused on protecting residents and businesses from increases in electricity rates due to the previous government’s legacy Muskrat Falls Project. In addition to discussions with the Federal Government, work is continuing on the approach to rate management, including electrification, export sales and cost control.” Honourable Siobhan Coady Minister of Natural Resources “For several years, the Muskrat Falls Project has had a negative effect on consumer confidence in this province, and the financial realities of the project have been the single largest downward pressure for our bond rating agencies, which has impacted every decision we’ve made as a government. With this agreement, we are putting this project on more sustainable footing and providing more certainty to ratepayers in the short and long term.” Honourable Tom Osborne Minister of Finance – 30 – Learn More  Presentation: Muskrat Falls Financial Restructuring Update News Release: Provincial Government Secures Enhanced Federal Loan Guarantee  News Release: Minister Coady Releases Interim Report on Muskrat Falls from Board of Commissioners of Public Utilities News Release: Landmark Atlantic Accord Agreement Achieved News Release: Premier Ball Releases Plan to Protect Residents from the Cost Impacts of Muskrat Falls Follow us on Twitter: @GovNL, @NR_GovNL and @FIN_GovNL Media contacts Jeremy Reynolds Office of the Premier 709-729-3558 JeremyReynolds@gov.nl.ca Lisa Lawlor Natural Resources 709-729-5777, 631-8155 lisalawlor@gov.nl.ca Marc Budgell Finance 709-729-2477, 689-0430 marcbudgell@gov.nl.ca BACKGROUNDER Last April, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador and the Government of Canada agreed to enter into a formal process to examine the financial structure of the Muskrat Falls Project. An expert team comprised of legal, financial, and electricity professionals has been analyzing the underlying reasons for projected rate increases, considering all available options to resolve cost drivers, and providing independent advice to advance further rate mitigation measures. As a result of work undertaken, both governments have agreed to a financial restructuring so the projects are financially stable over the long-term and ratepayers are protected. This involves changing the revenue model for the Muskrat Falls/Labrador Transmission Assets to a traditional cost of service model and redirecting equity returns from Nalcor to benefit ratepayers. The cost of service model reflects the approach used for regulated utilities throughout North America. The Muskrat Falls/Labrador Transmission Assets currently uses an internal rate of return financing structure – not normally used for such projects. Under this model, revenue requirements start low but escalate every year until 2070. Consequently, electricity rates would continually increase over time. Ratepayers could not bear such costs. By contrast, the cost of service model is traditionally used to compensate regulated utilities for the costs of providing electrical service, which includes a prescribed return on equity. The model has evolved over more than 100 years of utility regulation across Canada and the United States. Newfoundland Power and Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro use this approach, along with other regulated utilities providing electricity service across Canada and the US. This model is also used for the Labrador Island Link component of the Lower Churchill Project. The cost of service model has a revenue requirement starting slightly higher than the internal rate of return but then decreases over time as the project assets are depreciated, similar to a mortgage. Moving to a cost of service financing structure will allow costs related to the Muskrat Falls/Labrador Transmission Assets to gradually decline over time, therefore avoiding significant increases to electricity rates long-term. As stated in the rate management plan announced last year, the Provincial Government expects consumers will be paying approximately 13.5 cents per kilowatt hour in 2021 if costs increased due to normal Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro operations, and without any impact from Muskrat Falls. The Lower Churchill Project assets are:  The 824 megawatt Muskrat Falls hydroelectric generating station located in Labrador; The Labrador Transmission Assets, two transmission lines connecting 250 kilometres between Muskrat Falls and Churchill Falls; and The Labrador Island Link, a transmission line connecting 1,100 kilometres between Muskrat Falls and Soldiers Pond   2020 02 10 2:15 pm  "

These included next steps for occupational health and safety standards harmonization, the findings of the Expert Panel on Modern Federal Labour Standards, and how to better support workers through initiatives such as international labour standards on violence and harassment in the world of work. The ministers also discussed collaboration on labour matters between governments and partners, information sharing and worker protection for temporary foreign workers, as well as mental health in the workplace. The meeting was co-chaired by the federal Minister of Labour, the Honourable Filomena Tassi, and the Government of New Brunswick’s Minister of Post-Secondary Education, Training and Labour, the Honourable Trevor Holder. Collaboration was at the heart of the discussions, with all governments recognizing that working together will be especially important to reduce and eliminate trade barriers within Canada. This collaboration will increase consistency of regulation and will simplify regulatory requirements for businesses, allowing them to work more seamlessly across multiple jurisdictions. In January 2019, labour ministers endorsed the National Occupational Health and Safety Reconciliation Agreement that aims to reduce or eliminate trade barriers within Canada. All jurisdictions have now signed the Agreement and progress is being made towards its implementation. Ministers also discussed perspectives for Canada to meet the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. Minister Tassi and the Nokiiwin Tribal Council provided an overview of a collaborative project to make appropriate tools and resources available to First Nations communities and individuals in support of the implementation of Bill C-65, new legislation to better address harassment and violence in the workplace. When it comes into force, the legislation will apply to federally regulated workplaces including First Nation Band Councils. Ministers committed to continuing to work together and with all partners to foster strong federal, provincial and territorial collaboration on these issues for all Canadians. Quotes “All Canadians deserve a safe and healthy workplace. That’s why our government will continue to work with our provincial and territorial colleagues and Indigenous peoples in implementing health and safety requirements that will improve working conditions to better protect Canadian workers.” Honourable Filomena Tassi Canada Minister of Labour “My counterparts and I recognize that harmonizing workplace health and safety standards across the country can significantly reduce barriers to trade and business development. We will continue seeking ways to improve work environments, to the benefit of employees and employers, while maintaining these important standards.” Honourable Trevor Holder New Brunswick Minister of Post-Secondary Education, Training and Labour – 30 – Les ministres canadiens responsables du travail se rencontrent pour discuter d’importants enjeux relatifs aux milieux de travail Learn more Follow us on Twitter: @GovNL and @AESL_GovNL Media contacts Dustin Fitzpatrick Labour 819-654-5611 dustin.fitzpatrick@labour-travail.gc.ca Ryan Crocker Advanced Education, Skills and Labour 709-729-1795, 725-9595 RyanCrocker@gov.nl.ca  2020 02 06 4:30 pm  "

New screening protocols are being implemented to respond to novel coronavirus. Anyone who has been in Hubei province, China in the 14 days prior to their return to Canada is being asked to self-isolate (away from work and school) and monitor themselves and their children closely. The self-isolation period is 14 days from their last day in Hubei province. Those in self-isolation can receive supporting health information from Newfoundland and Labrador Public Health by contacting 811. People who have travelled from any other part of China in the 14 days prior to their return to Canada are asked to closely monitor their health. These timelines apply to those newly-arrived in Canada and those who have already returned. Anyone who meets either of the above criteria, who develops a fever, cough or difficulty breathing, should call 811 to receive further information. Screening is now in place at 10 Canadian airports. People who have been in Hubei province, China in the 14 days prior to their return to Canada, will be asked questions about their health by Canada Border Services Agency personnel and provided with information about symptoms and self-isolation, if applicable. To date, there have been no cases of novel coronavirus in Newfoundland and Labrador. The five confirmed cases in Canada are directly connected to Hubei province or someone in the same household. The risk of novel coronavirus to Newfoundlanders and Labradorians remains low. The best way to reduce your risk of any respiratory virus is to wash your hands well, and reduce spread by practising good cough and sneeze etiquette, and staying home if you are unwell. Newfoundland and Labrador public health officials are working closely with their colleagues across Canada to ensure cases of novel coronavirus are quickly identified and managed. Our regional health authorities are prepared to respond to any suspected cases. For more information, visit www.health.gov.nl.ca/health/publichealth/cdc/coronavirus/ or www.canada.ca/coronavirus.

Signs with a message that “Distracted Driving Kills” will be installed at various locations on highways with the highest traffic volumes and near entry points to the province. The department will also begin sharing the message over social media. According to statistics released by the RCMP, 24 people died in 18 vehicle collisions in areas policed by the RCMP in Newfoundland and Labrador in 2019. Fifty per cent of those collisions involved vehicles that crossed the centre line into the path of an oncoming vehicle, which could indicate impaired driving or distracted driving. Distracted driving includes behaviors such as using a mobile device, texting, reading, programming a GPS, watching videos, eating and drinking while driving, smoking or vaping, grooming, adjusting the radio, listening to loud music and talking to passengers. Government has taken a number of steps in recent years to encourage safe driving habits:  Released a report on its highway construction camera pilot project that found close to 50 per cent of vehicles that passing through the construction zones were in violation of the construction zone speed limit with some vehicles travelling in excess of 110 kilometres per hour in 50 kilometre-per-hour zones; Made amendments to the Highway Traffic Act to allow for cameras to be used as a means of increasing compliance with the rules of the road and help improve safety in construction zones and school bus zones; Using digital display speed signs on some highways, which is proven to be effective in getting drivers to reduce their speed; and Launched NL 511 which provides easy access to our highway driving condition and construction reports as well as highway cameras to make it easier for travellers to plan for safe trips before they travel.  The new distracted driving signs will be installed when summer maintenance activities begin this spring. Quotes “Driving on our highways requires full attention. A vehicle collision caused by distracted and dangerous driving is a collision that could have been prevented. By installing these signs along provincial highways, we will be sending a constant reminder to everyone that we all need to pay attention to the road.” Honourable Steve Crocker Minister of Transportation and Works “Losing a loved one or suffering serious injury because of distracted driving is needless and unnecessary. If we are to be truly successful in ending distracted driving, societal change is necessary. We all have a part to play in instilling a culture of road safety in our province.” Honourable Sherry Gambin-Walsh Minister of Service NL “Nothing is more painful than losing someone in a senseless, preventable automobile crash due to distracted driving. Our husbands, Randy Ralph and Shannon Pittman, lost their lives following a horrific automobile crash caused by a distracted driver. As a province, we must work together to eliminate such actions. These distractions can kill, ruin the lives of those left behind, and destroy the future planned with those killed. Installing distracted driving highway signage will send a very powerful message to drivers. The goal is to reduce distracted driving and save lives. No other life should be lost due to preventable driver inattentiveness.” Mrs. Sarah Pittman and Mrs. Frankie Ralph – 30 – Learn more Provincial Government Releases Report on Highway Construction Cameras Pilot Project Proposed Changes to Highway Traffic Act Will Allow for Further Improvements to Public Safety Residents Reminded of Legislation Coming into Force Aimed at Improved Road Safety Follow us on Twitter: @GovNL, @TW_GovNL and @ServiceNL_ Media contacts Brian Scott Transportation and Works 709-729-3015, 725-9201 brianscott@gov.nl.ca Krista Dalton Service NL 709-729-4748, 685-6492 kristadalton@gov.nl.ca  2020 02 03 10:55 am  "

A summary of the Report is included below. To view the Report in its entirety, please go to www.oipc.nl.ca/reports/commissioner    Report: A-2020-003   Report Date: January 31, 2020   Public Body: Memorial University   Summary: Memorial University (“Memorial”) received an access request for records relating to correspondence about a committee at Memorial. Memorial disclosed records to the Complainant with redactions under sections 29, 32 and 40 of the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act, 2015 (ATIPPA, 2015). The Complainant alleged that Memorial failed in its duty to assist under section 13 of ATIPPA, 2015, alleging that Memorial’s search did not meet the standard of reasonableness. The Complainant also alleged that Memorial refused to provide some of the records in their native format, as he requested under section 20(1)(b) of ATIPPA, 2015. The Commissioner determined that Memorial had conducted what seemed to be a reasonable search but based on the specific wording of the request and facts of this case the search was flawed.

In April 2019, government amended the Environmental Protection Act and began drafting regulations to ban the distribution of retail plastic bags, which can be found online here  . Consultations on whether and how to implement the ban were held in March 2019, and more than 3,000 submissions informed the drafting of the regulations. Since the passing of the legislation, residents, businesses, governments and organizations have been actively decreasing the amount of plastic waste created by these bags and working to put alternatives in place. To address the broader category of packaging, the Provincial Government is continuing to work with the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment to establish an Extended Producer Responsibility program for the management of packaging and printed paper as a long-term strategy. This builds on the province’s ongoing work with the council on the Zero Plastic Waste Strategy as part of the Ocean Plastics Charter. Quote “By banning the use of single use plastic retail bags, we will all be playing a part in protecting the environment and improving the waste management system. I encourage anyone distributing or using these bags to use the time between now and July 1 to start new shopping habits and consider potential alternatives to retail plastic bags.” Honourable Derrick Bragg Minister of Municipal Affairs and Environment Learn more Plastic Bag Regulations Consultations on Ban of Single Use Plastic Bag – 30 – Media contact Lynn Robinson Municipal Affairs and Environment 709-729-5449, 691-9466 lynnrobinson@gov.nl.ca  2020 01 29 12:00 pm  "

WNS has been known to be present in this province since 2017 when a case was confirmed in Western Newfoundland. Since then the disease has been discovered at additional locations throughout the western portion of the Island and the fungus that causes the disease has also been detected recently in the Happy Valley-Goose Bay area of Labrador. WNS was first discovered in New York State in 2006 and has since spread through the northeastern United States and Maritimes where it has had a devastating impact on hibernating bats. Both the Little Brown Myotis and the Northern Myotis in Newfoundland and Labrador are susceptible to WNS which can result in the animals exhausting limited energy reserves and becoming severely dehydrated, often leading them to perish inside their overwintering sites or on the winter landscape while searching for food and water. The public is asked to report any locations where bats are known or suspected to be hibernating, or whether bats have been observed to hibernate in any non-typical underground sites, such as abandoned root cellars or old wells. The public is also urged to avoid entering any known or suspected hibernation site, and to report sites to officials with an accompanying GPS coordinates and photographs when possible. Visiting such sites could unknowingly spread fungal spores of the disease. It is important to never touch bats with bare hands. To report a bat sighting or a suspected bat shelter please contact provincial Wildlife Research Ecologists at 709-637-2025 or the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative toll-free bat line at 1-833-434-BATS (2287).

It is an internationally recognized day dedicated to creating awareness about the importance of protecting personal information. On the occasion of Data Privacy Day 2020, the Atlantic Information and Privacy Commissioners (IPCs) have jointly decided to draw the attention of citizens of the region to the privacy implications of facial recognition technology. Atlantic IPCs have noticed the increasing use of facial recognition technology by public bodies and private companies in countries around the world. While the use of this technology by Canadian public bodies to date has been relatively limited, its application in the United States, Europe and Asia in settings such as schools and in public areas appears to be spreading rapidly. As this technology continues to mature and additional applications are developed, there is little doubt that Canadian public bodies will explore its use to enhance their delivery of goods and services. Atlantic IPCs feel that in every such instance, the privacy implications that arise with the use of this technology need to be carefully considered by public bodies and weighed against the potential benefits. Indeed, Atlantic Canadians should be aware of the privacy implications and consider them carefully. Atlantic IPCs are of the opinion that the onus is on public bodies to educate and consult with the public. In this spirit, Atlantic IPCs have provided the attached backgrounder to provide residents of the Atlantic region some basic information on facial recognition. – 30 – Learn more Data Privacy Day Follow us on Twitter: @OIPCNL Media contact Sean Murray Director of Research and Quality Assurance 709-729-6309 Backgrounder The Facts about Facial Recognition What is Facial Recognition? Facial recognition is the process by which a person can be identified or otherwise recognized from a digital image. Facial recognition is one form of biometric identification; others include fingerprints, voice recognition and retinal scans. Facial recognition is based on unique, measurable characteristics that can be used to verify or recognize identity. When using facial recognition software, the computer takes a picture of an individual and creates a unique numeric representation for the face. This is then compared to a database of facial images, such as a driver’s licence database, in an attempt to identify the individual. Further information on this process is available in Investigation PC-010005-1 from the Ontario Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner (OIPC) and in Automated Facial Recognition in the Public and Private Sectors, produced by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. How does Facial Recognition Work? Facial recognition can be used to either confirm (authentication) or discover someone’s identity (identification). Authentication is generally used to grant access to facilities or equipment. Identification often involves ensuring public safety, such as maintaining the security of high traffic public places in airports and sports arenas. The Ontario OIPC discussed this further in Privacy and Biometrics, which was issued in 1999. It explained that the “one-to-many” match is used to identify a person by comparing the image to all others stored in its database. For example, law enforcement may use this strategy to identify criminals. Authentication is a “one-to-one” search where an image on file is compared to the individual; there is no searching or matching to a central database. Accuracy of Facial Recognition Software While the use of 3D images has improved the accuracy of facial recognition systems, the risk of false positives (wrong person is identified) or false negatives (a person who should have been identified is not) remains. The accuracy of the match can be impacted by such things as the quality of the image, changes that occur to faces over time and the quality of the algorithm used. When using facial recognition for identification, the system will search for similar images. This basically places individuals in a “digital line-up”. False positives will occur. Identical twins, for example, will probably be flagged each time identification is completed, as there is a second individual in the system with a different name but very similar facial features. In general, facial recognition software is complemented by manual review of matches when such issues arise. Consistent Use / Scope Creep By its nature, facial recognition is privacy invasive; it has the ability to identify individuals and link them to other information holdings. Further, an image collected for one purpose could be used for a different purpose without the individual’s knowledge or consent. In 2011, rioting broke out in Vancouver after the loss of a game in the Stanley Cup playoffs. The Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) offered the use of its facial recognition software to assist police in identifying alleged vandals and rioters. The Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner for British Columbia investigated this use in Investigation Report F-12-01, which concluded, in part: I conclude that ICBC must immediately cease responding to requests from police to use the facial recognition database for the purposes of identifying individuals for police absent a subpoena, warrant or court order. Use of Facial Recognition in Atlantic Canada for Drivers’ Licences and Identification Cards In Atlantic Canada, facial recognition is being used by provincial governments to confirm the identity of individuals seeking a driver’s licence or government-issued photo identification card. Once a photo has been taken, facial recognition software compares the picture of the individual with the picture on file, and searches for other matches to verify the identity of the individual. These actions are intended to reduce the risk of identity theft and fraud and help prevent suspended drivers or fraudsters from getting a driver’s licence or photo identification card. The Information and Privacy Commissioners for Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador have each questioned their respective governments on the need for such technology as well as the safeguards needed to protect such information from misuse. They have each committed to monitor and address any further expansion of these programs.  2020 01 28 11:00 am  "

697,697,2020-01-27,Canada,Newfoundland and Labrador,,https://www.gov.nl.ca/releases/2020/eecd/0127n01/,Government Website,Celebrating National Family Literacy Day," The importance of reading as a family and participating in literacy-related activities are being celebrated as the Provincial Government recognizes today as National Family Literacy Day. Family Literacy Day is a national awareness initiative created by ABC Life Literacy Canada in 1999 and held annually on January 27 to raise awareness of the importance of reading and engaging as a family in other literacy-related activities. Some schools in the province are also celebrating Family Literacy Week 2020, which also focuses on families reading together. The Provincial Government has invested in a variety of literacy initiatives that focus on early learning. The Department of Education and Early Childhood Development provides support to public libraries, family resource centres, child care centres and family child care homes. A K-12 literacy plan, Learning for a Lifetime and Parent Resource Kits that encourage learning at home are also available to families. To date, through the Education Action Plan, the number of early learning and literacy resources in schools has increased, including 48 new reading specialists, 100 teaching and learning assistants, and 26 additional teacher-librarians. Overall, 350 teacher resources are being added over a three year period to ensure students have access to the supports they need. In October 2019, the Provincial Government launched The Way Forward on Adult Literacy, a five-year action plan to help adult Newfoundlanders and Labradorians get the literacy skills they need to lead healthier, more productive lives and fully participate in the province’s economy. Supported by $60 million in funding over five years, the Adult Literacy Plan identifies 30 actions the Provincial Government and its partners will take to provide adult learners with increased opportunities to strengthen their literacy skills by improving the province’s adult literacy system. The plan was developed based upon engagement with key stakeholders such as adult learners, adult literacy service providers, Indigenous groups, community organizations, industry, labour, and post-secondary education institutions. To view the complete plan, visit The Way Forward on Adult Literacy. Quotes “Reading and participating in learning activities are essential for children to become successful in school and in their journey through life. Adult support and a strong foundation at home contributes to a child’s success in school. Reading together is an opportunity to strengthen relationships among family members and encourage lifelong teaching. Today and every day, I encourage students, educators and families throughout Newfoundland and Labrador to take the time to read and learn together.” Honourable Brian Warr Minister of Education and Early Childhood Development “This Family Literacy Day, I look forward to continuing our government’s efforts to help make sure Newfoundlanders and Labradorians have the opportunity to acquire and enhance their literacy skills. While we often think of literacy as reading and writing, literacy skills are so much more. Strong literacy skills enable us to learn, create, and communicate. Literacy includes essential skills that directly impact our ability to find, understand, and collaborate using printed and written materials in different situations. This is why The Way Forward on Adult Literacy is crucial not only to helping individuals and their families achieve their goals, but to building an even stronger workforce and growing the economy.” Honourable Chris Mitchelmore Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Labour “Literacy is a key component of student learning and is the foundation of the work we do daily in all areas of the curriculum. On this day, we are all encouraged to set an example for students by modelling and sharing our genuine interest in not only books, but other types of media as well, like magazines, graphic novels, newspapers, blogs and online texts and more. The Newfoundland and Labrador English School District is pleased to support Family Literacy Day, and promote the importance of literacy in every aspect of life.” Tony Stack CEO/Director of Education, Newfoundland and Labrador English School District – 30 – Learn more ABC Literacy Canada Education Action Plan The Way Forward on Adult Literacy.

The person affected became ill in late 2019, and was hospitalized. They have since recovered. The substance of concern is a cannabis product, which was not available for further testing. As per the Personal Health Information Act, no further details regarding this case, the individual or their location in the province will not be released. To date in Canada, there have been 16 confirmed or probable cases of vaping-associated lung illnesses. While the person affected in Newfoundland and Labrador used a cannabis product, others affected across the country have used nicotine vaping products or flavour-only vaping products. Vaping is not harmless. It can increase your exposure to harmful chemicals, and the long-term health effects are unknown. Vaping is not recommended for youth, pregnant women, or non-smokers. Given the recent and ongoing concerns about vaping-associated lung illness, and the limited overall understanding of the short and long-term health risks, the safest approach for people who use cannabis, is to avoid smoking or vaping cannabis extracts. If you use vaping products, never modify them or add any substances not intended by the manufacturer. Youth who vape should seek support to quit completely. If you vape and want to quit, please advise  your health care provider about your vaping history, especially if you have respiratory symptoms, so they can advise on the safest and most effective way to do so. Quotes “I am worried about the increase of vaping in Newfoundland and Labrador and its popularity with youth. Vaping is a significant public health concern. If you don’t already smoke, don’t vape.” Honourable John Haggie Minister of Health and Community Services “Our goal is to protect the health of all Newfoundlanders and Labradorians. We are working with our community partners, as well as our federal, provincial and territorial colleagues, to determine how to best address and prevent this new and evolving illness. We strongly encourage individuals not to use cannabis vaping products.” Honourable Lisa Dempster Minister of Children, Seniors and Social Development “The emergence of vaping-associated lung illness is quite concerning, and we will continue to monitor for cases. To reduce your risk of this illness, we recommend that you do not vape any products. If you vape or smoke and wish to quit, please see your health care provider for advice on safe and effective ways to do so.” Dr. Janice Fitzgerald Chief Medical Officer of Health – 30 – Learn more Public Advisory: Residents Reminded About the Risks of Cannabis Use Information on Vaping-associated Lung Illness Follow us on Twitter: @GovNL, @HCS_GovNL and @CSSD_GovNL Media contacts Kathy Dicks-Peyton Health and Community Services 709-729-6986, 699-1982 kathydickspeyton@gov.nl.ca Gina MacArthur Children, Seniors and Social Development 709-729-3768, 730-2977 ginamacarthur@gov.nl.ca  2020 01 16 4:15 pm  "
