0,2020-10-05 16:25:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020HLTH0053-001866,Government Website,"Joint statement on B.C.’s COVID-19 response, latest updates","  Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, and Stephen Brown, deputy minister of health, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are announcing three 24-hour reporting periods. In the first reporting period from Oct. 2 to 3, we had 130 new cases, from Oct. 3 to 4, we had 108 new cases and in the last 24 hours, we have had a further 120 new cases.“This represents a total of 358 new cases, including eight epi-linked cases, for a total of 9,739 cases in British Columbia.“There are 1,353 active cases of COVID-19 in the province, 3,010 people who are under active public health monitoring as a result of identified exposure to known cases and 8,115 people who tested positive have recovered.“Currently, 66 individuals are hospitalized with COVID-19, 16 of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 3,580 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 4,980 in the Fraser Health region, 220 in the Island Health region, 548 in the Interior Health region, 322 in the Northern Health region and 89 cases of people who reside outside of Canada.“There have been four new COVID-19 related deaths, for a total of 242 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There have been three new health-care facility outbreaks: one at Langley Lodge, one at White Rock Seniors Village and one at Chartwell Crescent Gardens. The outbreak at Holy Family Hospital has been declared over. In total, 16 long-term care or assisted-living facilities and three acute-care facilities have active outbreaks.“There has been one new community outbreak at the MSJ Valhalla Distribution Centre in the Fraser Health region. There also continue to be exposure events around the province. Public alerts and school notifications are posted on the BC Centre for Disease Control's (BCCDC) website and on all health authorities’ websites.“Many of us are thinking ahead to Thanksgiving celebrations this weekend. New guidance for safer celebrations while COVID-19 remains in our communities is now available on the BCCDC website.“This year, make your celebrations large in thanks but small in size. While many of us would often travel to friends and family to spend time together, now is the time to stay closer to home and have a smaller gathering instead.“If you are getting together with your ‘safe six’ for Thanksgiving, limit your time together prior to or following your meal, seat guests as far apart as possible and opt for individual servings instead of a buffet. And always remember if you are at all feeling ill, show you care by staying home and away from others.“The modelling data released today tells us as a direct result of so many people paying attention to the public health precautions and doing the right thing, we are making a difference and flattening our curve.“The work of public health teams throughout the province has been extremely effective, and contact tracing has shown the majority of new cases are connected to a known case or cluster, which means uncontrolled transmission is limited.“Additionally, much like other aspects of our society that are now open, we have seen exposures in our schools. However, importantly, schools are not a major source of transmission.“While the number of overall cases has risen, we have fewer hospitalizations than in the spring. This is in part because many of the recent cases of COVID-19 are those who are younger and, as a result, less susceptible to severe illness.“While this highlights that no one is immune to COVID-19, the fewer people with severe illness mean we continue to have capacity in our health-care system for those who need additional care.“Our actions today have a direct impact on how the province will fair tomorrow. What we do for Thanksgiving will make a difference for Halloween and the next celebration after that.“This weekend, give thanks to your neighbours, friends and family for doing their part to keep you safe. We are stronger together by staying apart, so let’s continue to find new ways to support each other and show we care – at a safe distance.”Quick Facts: Assisted living, long-term care homes and seniors’ rental buildings with ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks are as follows: Vancouver Coastal Health Banfield Pavilion long-term care facility Haro Park Centre long-term care facility (second occurrence) Point Grey Private Hospital long-term care facility  Fraser Health Chartwell Crescent Gardens long-term care facility Cherington Place long-term care facility Evergreen Hamlets long-term care facility George Derby Centre long-term care facility Harrison West at Elim Village long-term care facility Kin Village assisted-living facility Langley Lodge long-term care facility (third occurrence) Milieu Children and Family Services Society community-living facility New Vista Care Home long-term care facility Rideau Retirement Centre independent-living facility Thornebridge Gardens assisted-living facility Peace Portal Seniors Village long-term care facility White Rock Seniors Village long-term care facility   Learn More:BCCDC’s safer celebrations guidance: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/social-interactions/safer-celebrationsTo learn more about today’s modelling presentation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/COVID19_Going_Forward_Oct_2020.pdfGuidance for Halloween during COVID19: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/social-interactions/halloweenTo find the provincial health officer’s orders, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topics/covid-19-novel-coronavirusTo see a map of COVID-19 cases by local health area, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/dataIf you are experiencing symptoms, find a collection centre near you to get tested: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testingFor mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca Or: www.anxietycanada.comFor a listing of the community exposure events, go to: BCCDC (flights, work sites, etc.): http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/public-exposures Fraser Health: fraserhealth.ca/covid19exposure Interior Health: https://news.interiorhealth.ca/news/public-exposures/ Island Health: https://www.islandhealth.ca/learn-about-health/covid-19/outbreaks-and-exposures Northern Health: https://www.northernhealth.ca/health-topics/outbreaks-and-exposures Vancouver Coastal: http://www.vch.ca/covid-19/public-exposuresFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/ Or follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19 Or call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit: Facebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews  YouTube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBCA backgrounder follows.

1,2020-10-02 12:12:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020FLNR0061-001863,Government Website,New deer disease suspected in B.C.,"  The Province is tracking the outbreak of a possible new disease in deer on the Gulf Islands.Adenovirus hemorrhagic disease (AHD) is suspected as the cause of death of over 60 deer on at least two Gulf Islands. However, further testing is needed to confirm a definitive diagnosis.While there is no known human health risk from the virus, and there is no evidence that it can be transmitted to humans, hunters in the area are being advised not to consume meat from animals found dead, obviously ill or acting abnormally prior to death. As well, research indicates that it is not transmissible to livestock and pets.A network of wildlife professionals has assisted provincial wildlife health staff to investigate the possible emergence of AHD since deer were discovered dead on Galiano Island in September. Samples from these animals were sent to Canadian and United States laboratories to confirm the cause of the disease.Since its initial discovery in California, AHD cases are recorded in the western United States annually with outbreaks in some locations. With improved diagnostic tools, wildlife health experts recognize the disease more often. There are outbreaks underway in California and Oregon. However, B.C. has never documented the disease.Cervids (mule deer, white-tailed deer, elk, moose and caribou) are all susceptible to the disease. Members of the black-tailed deer family (including mule deer) appear to be most severely affected. In addition, fawns are far more susceptible than adults and suffer much higher rates of death. The disease course is usually rapid and fatal as the virus damages small blood vessels in the lungs and intestines.Acute signs of the disease include difficulty breathing, foaming or drooling from the mouth, diarrhea (sometimes bloody) and seizures. More chronic symptoms include ulcers and abscesses in the mouth and throat. Anyone observing deer displaying these signs should report it to the Wildlife Health Laboratory at 250 751-7246.Learn More:For more information on AHD in B.C., or any other wildlife disease, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/wildlifehealth    "

The jury will have an opportunity to make recommendations aimed at preventing deaths under similar circumstances. A jury must not make any finding of legal responsibility or express any conclusion of law.An inquest is a formal process that allows for public presentation of evidence relating to a death. The jury will certify the identity of the deceased and how, where, when and by what means death occurred.The BC Coroners Service looks to gather the facts surrounding why a death took place. It is not a fault-finding agency. It provides an independent service to the family, community, government agencies and other organizations.  During the COVID-19 pandemic, in compliance with physical and social distancing requirements set out by the provincial health officer, the BC Coroners Service was required to postpone several inquests. The BC Coroners Service is in the process of rescheduling those inquests and will announce confirmed dates, times and locations once those confirmed details are known.Livestreaming provides a way for the public and media to virtually attend an inquest when COVID-19 measures prevent physical attendance. The same rules apply as for in-person attendance at an inquest.Learn More:Reproduction, broadcasting and publishing, including through social media, of the BC Coroners Service live video stream and its content are prohibited. For more information, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/life-events/death/coroners-service/inquest-schedule-jury-findings-verdicts/2020For more information on inquests, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/life-events/death/coroners-service/inquest-schedule-jury-findings-verdictsBC Coroners Service: http://www.gov.bc.ca/coroners/    "

If you’ve never met the person before, then maintaining two metres distance is very important.“However, for your household bubble and ‘safe six’ friends, closer is okay, unless someone is more vulnerable to severe illness from COVID-19. For classmates and colleagues who you see most days, the safe distance lies somewhere in between.“The easiest way to set these new routines and help to protect our communities as we progress into respiratory season is to stick with the same group of friends, the same colleagues or classmates.“While a provincial election has been called today, B.C.’s COVID-19 response plan will continue uninterrupted. As has been done since the start of the pandemic, a daily COVID-19 update will be provided to keep everyone in B.C. informed.“Like other parts of our economy, the provincial health officer has also worked with Elections BC to set the guidelines for a safe election process.“The guidelines include how political parties and their candidates need to keep themselves, their staff and volunteers, and their communities safe during the campaign, as well as how the elections process needs to occur to ensure the safety of everyone.“Let’s take this first day of fall to set our personal safety plans for the season ahead. The actions we take today will help ensure the well-being of our communities tomorrow, so let’s do all we can today and every day to keep COVID-19 low and slow.” Quick Facts: Assisted living, long-term care homes and seniors’ rental buildings with ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks are as follows: Vancouver Coastal Health OPAL by Element assisted-living facility Point Grey Private Hospital long-term care facility Royal Arch Masonic Home long-term care facility (second outbreak) Yaletown House long-term care facility  Fraser Health Bear Creek Villa independent-living facility Cherington Place long-term care facility Evergreen Hamlets long-term care facility Kin Village assisted-living facility Milieu Children and Family Services Society community-living facility New Vista Care Home long-term care facility Normanna long-term care facility Rideau Retirement Centre independent-living facility   Learn More:To find the provincial health officer's orders, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topics/covid-19-novel-coronavirusFor the last modelling information presented on Sept. 3, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/COVID19_Going_Forward_Sept_2020.pdfTo see a map of COVID-19 cases by local health area, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/dataIf you are experiencing symptoms, find a collection centre near you to get tested: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testingFor mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca Or: www.anxietycanada.comFor a listing of the community exposure events, go to: BCCDC (flights, work sites, etc.): http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/public-exposures Fraser Health: fraserhealth.ca/covid19exposure Interior Health: https://news.interiorhealth.ca/news/public-exposures/ Island Health: https://www.islandhealth.ca/learn-about-health/covid-19/outbreaks-and-exposures Northern Health: https://www.northernhealth.ca/health-topics/outbreaks-and-exposures Vancouver Coastal: http://www.vch.ca/covid-19/public-exposuresFor the second monthly progress report on B.C.’s surgical renewal plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020_surgical-renewal-commitment-progress-report-June-July-2020.pdfFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/ Or follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19 Or call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit: Facebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews A backgrounder follows.

These projects will quickly bring the benefits of modern internet access to families, students, workers and businesses throughout rural B.C.“Rural and Indigenous communities are an essential part of the province’s economic engine. Now is the time to invest in modern infrastructure so people living outside the city can also benefit from today’s technologies,” said Anne Kang, Minister of Citizens’ Services. “Ensuring people have the connectivity they need to be successful is a key part of our recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. This investment will bring real and lasting benefits to families, workplaces and communities throughout B.C., ensuring the province emerges stronger than ever.”This funding will help accelerate investments by internet service providers and will be vital to restarting the economy in rural British Columbia. Work completed as part of this funding is expected to bring or improve connectivity in 200 communities, including 75 Indigenous communities, and benefit up to 50,000 households.“It is so important for people in rural and Indigenous communities to be able to connect with family, friends and businesses in the rest of the province,” said Michelle Mungall, Minister of Jobs, Economic Development and Competitiveness. “This funding is expected to create more than 720 provincewide jobs that British Columbians can count on to support their families and benefit communities throughout B.C.”Projects supported through this funding will include technologies such as fibre, satellite and Wi-Fi to deliver a broader range of connectivity benefits to more British Columbians. It will also fund an additional 140 kilometres of highway cellular and Wi-Fi at rest stops, which could include inland ferry terminals and emergency satellite call boxes.The Province of B.C. intends for this next phase of the program to be administered by Northern Development Initiative Trust, which manages the Connecting British Columbia program.Applications will begin being accepted in October 2020. Internet service providers must complete their projects by October 2021.The new Economic Recovery Intake further strengthens the B.C. government’s commitment to continue to work with internet service providers to ensure that citizens and businesses have the digital infrastructure needed to help rebuild and strengthen the economy.Quick Facts: The Connecting British Columbia program provides grant funding to internet service providers to build vital connectivity infrastructure, including projects to bring fibre to entire regions or make final connections to homes and businesses. The $90-million Economic Recovery Intake is in addition to the $50-million 2019 expansion of the Connecting British Columbia program. Northern Development Initiative Trust is responsible for overseeing and administering the existing Connecting British Columbia program. Since July 2017, projects supported through the Province’s Connecting British Columbia program are underway or complete in over 500 communities, including 87 Indigenous communities. Internet service providers that would like to submit an application for new transport and last-mile infrastructure builds are encouraged to apply to one of the Phase 3 quarterly intakes of the Connecting British Columbia program.

We're particularly excited about being the leaders in farm-gate cannabis sales. The WLFN craft cannabis farm-gate facility that is currently under construction will create jobs and stimulate tourism and represents a significant boost for the region's economy.”The agreement supports WLFN’s interests in operating retail cannabis stores that offer a diverse selection of cannabis products from licensed producers across Canada, as well as a cannabis production operation that offers farm-gate sales of its own craft cannabis products.The agreement-making provision was included in provincial cannabis legislation to allow some flexibility within the provincial framework to address an Indigenous government’s community-specific interests. Entering an agreement under section 119 allows Williams Lake First Nation to pursue its vision for participation in the cannabis industry, while upholding the public health and safety principles of federal and provincial cannabis laws.“This is another important step in supporting economic development across B.C.,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “The new agreement will create jobs, boost the local economy and help diversify BC’s cannabis industry.”The Province supports the growth of a diverse, robust legal cannabis industry, inclusive of Indigenous and rural communities.

The ministry will be seeking public input on the concept this fall.The ministry has also had discussions with the city about longer-term improvements to the intersection to support future growth and development in the area. The public consultation will seek input on what people in Pitt Meadows and area envision as a long-term improvement at this major intersection. This feedback will help ensure that any preliminary upgrades are compatible with the long-term improvements envisioned for this area.The ministry is finalizing its engagement plan and the public will be notified when online engagement begins this fall.

We’re opening the door for a multitude of new, exciting business opportunities for B.C. farmers, fishers, ranchers and processors and I know they’re looking forward to providing more of their delicious products in the North.”Health facilities are an important market for B.C. foods. Some examples of current B.C. produced or processed products and suppliers to Northern Health’s facilities include: chicken/Sunrise Farms frozen green beans and peas/Sysco cheese/Paradise Island falafels/Amana Foods Inc applesauce/Sun-Rype Products Limited frozen blueberries/Snowcrest Foods cakes, squares/Original Cakerie Through Feed BC, the Ministry of Agriculture is working with supply-chain partners to increase opportunities for northern producers and processors interested in selling to B.C.’s public-sector institutions. Business development skills, guidance on how to sell to institutions, and targeted training for more northern producers to acquire food safety certifications required by health facilities will help support food production and open new markets in the region.Northern Health supports the health and wellness of more than 300,000 British Columbians in an area covering more than 600,000 square kilometres and operates 27 hospitals and residential care facilities serving over 1.9 million meals per year.Quotes:Michael Hoefer, regional director, capital planning and support services, Northern Health –“Northern Health is committed to continuing to work with our food suppliers and food distributors to include even more B.C. foods on our menu. Supporting BC producers while preparing healthy meals with local ingredients for our patients and residents meets the values of our communities in the North.”Jennifer Oravec, business development specialist, Sysco –“Sysco will now have available for Northern Health and other customers frozen rhubarb, blueberries, peas and green beans that are grown and processed in B.C.”Kieran Christison, owner, Daybreak Farms – “We are a family farm based in Terrace and we are proud to produce our products in the North, for the North. The Feed BC program is such a great opportunity for producers in the northern region to showcase their products. Hospital patients and long-term care residents need the best care. They are our family, friends and neighbours, and Feed BC ensures that we are feeding them the best of local and nutritious products.”Quick Facts: Feed BC is working to build the provincial food supply, support jobs and businesses for farmers, fishers, ranchers and food processors, and offer more B.C. foods to patients, students and other clients. In the provincial health-care system, Feed BC now has partnerships with the Interior, Fraser and Northern Health authorities. The BC Food Hub Network supports increased regional processing capacity, furthering the opportunity for more B.C. food products in public institutions and other markets.  The City of Quesnel is working to develop Sprout Kitchen, a regional food hub that will provide producers and processors access to shared commercial processing space, equipment and services. B.C.'s non-commercial food service purchases are approximately $398 million annually, most of which are for government-supported facilities. This represents a significant opportunity for B.C.’s agriculture and food sector. Feed BC leads and supports numerous initiatives that encourage, inspire and support the shift to more B.C. foods, build valuable supply chain partnerships, and grow capacity and awareness about supply and demand to better connect B.C. producers and processors and government foodservice opportunities.

Effective immediately, the measures are enacted under the provincial state of emergency, using the extraordinary powers of the Emergency Program Act (EPA) in ongoing support of B.C.’s COVID-19 response and economic recovery plan.“We released our economic recovery plan last week, and we have an opportunity to lead the country as we support a strong recovery. Now, more than ever, we all need to follow the guidelines of the provincial health officer,” Farnworth said. “These updated measures ensure police have the tools necessary to continue enforcing the PHO’s orders on unsafe gatherings.”In addition to previously announced ticketing measures on gatherings and events, the measures announced today include the following provisions, which are also subject to ticketing and enforcement: The holding of any event in a banquet hall is prohibited. Nightclubs must cease operating as nightclubs. Background music or other background sounds, such as from televisions, must be no louder than the volume of normal conversation. Liquor sales for onsite consumption must cease by 10 p.m. Unless a full meal service is provided, premises must close by 11 p.m. and all patrons must vacate the premises. If a full meal service is provided, premises may stay open, but liquor must not be served until 11 a.m. the following day. Liquor must not be consumed on premises by owners, operators or staff after 11 p.m. Liquor service at private events must cease at 10 p.m. If food or liquor serving premises hold private events, like wedding receptions, the same rules that hotels and other venues must follow apply to these premises.  The enforcement focus will continue to be on $2,000 fines to owners, operators and organizers for contraventions of the PHO’s orders. Individual patrons may be levied with $200 fines.In addition to enabling action from police, the Province is enlisting compliance and enforcement staff from provincial ministries to support enforcement and help issue tickets. This includes liquor, cannabis and gaming inspectors, community safety unit inspectors, and conservation officers.Violation tickets expand the Province’s compliance and enforcement toolkit to support the COVID-19 response. Police and other provincial compliance and enforcement officers will independently exercise discretion to issue tickets for EPA order violations under the Offence Act’s Violation Ticket Administration and Fines Regulation (VTAFR).If violation tickets do not act as a deterrent, or in cases of particularly egregious contraventions or for repeat offenders, police can recommend charges in relation to the offence.Working in partnership with local governments and other agencies, a comprehensive and integrated compliance and enforcement regime has been built. These violation tickets build on existing tools, such as the ability to suspend or revoke the business or liquor licenses of problematic operators.Quick Facts: The specifics around orders of the PHO, including the numbers allowable at gatherings and events, will continue to be set at the direction of the PHO. To report concerns around order violations from event organizers, venues or individuals, contact your local government’s bylaw office.

This has been a goal for a long time and I am proud to be part of making it happen. Congratulations to the Northern Health Authority, the Prince George community and the entire region for this breakthrough.""The current hospital is outdated and too small to safely accommodate the needs of a growing and aging regional population. Local leaders have specifically identified cardiac care as an important service gap for a new facility to address.Northern Health submitted a concept plan to the provincial government in December 2017, which was amended in February 2020. Treasury Board approved that concept plan – securing funding for the project in the government’s 10-year capital plan.The business plan phase will now get underway and will finalize details, such as scope of the new facility and budget. This includes providing details for a variety of acute care services for the facility, including new mental health, surgical and cardiac units. This stage takes approximately 12 to 18 months. Upon approval of the business plan, the project will proceed to procurement, then construction.This announcement builds on government’s investments in the North, including new and expanded hospitals in Terrace, Fort St. James, Dawson Creek and Quesnel, delivering public health-care in state-of-the art centres.UHNBC was built in 1958 and was originally called Prince George Regional Hospital. Additions were completed in 1978 and 2003. There are 10 additional buildings that make up the 216-bed UHNBC site.    "

The targeted launch for both programs is 2022.The Ministry of Attorney General’s Liquor Distribution Branch will also launch an Indigenous Shelf Space Program, estimated to start in 2021. The program will highlight cannabis products produced by B.C. Indigenous producers in BC Cannabis Stores, helping consumers easily identify those products and make purchasing decisions.“These steps will help grow the legal cannabis industry in B.C. in an inclusive way,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “By making it easier to know more about the product, those who choose to use cannabis can make careful decisions about what types of product they want to buy and what sectors of the industry they want to support.”Highlighted products will be available at private B.C. cannabis retail locations, as well as through the BC Cannabis Stores online site. Learn More:To find a licensed non-medical cannabis retailer, visit: https://justice.gov.bc.ca/cannabislicensing/mapTo find a public retailer, visit: https://www.bccannabisstores.com/pages/store-locations    "

I want youth in care to be assured that they will be able to continue receiving the supports they count on and won’t have the added stress of aging out during these challenging times,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “Especially right now, youth in our care need and deserve to feel supported and safe and our government wants to make sure that happens.”To ensure youth who are set to age out of care continue to have a safe place to stay during the pandemic, youth currently living in foster care, contracted residential agencies or with relatives through the extended family program, will be able to stay in their placements past their 19th birthday— and youth on Independent Living Agreements and Youth Agreements will continue to receive financial support past their 19th birthday — until March 31, 2021.“I applaud and celebrate this government's leadership in this response, which will give youth the time to effectively transition from care,” said Katherine McParland, executive director of A Way Home Kamloops. “Continued government support will ensure youth have opportunities to achieve critical developmental milestones, such as education and employment, by providing a solid foundation of a home during COVID-19, as well as ensuring youth do not age out into homelessness. This response shows government is listening to the voices of youth and has created a holistic response that will ensure youth find stabilization and wellness in these unprecedented times.”For the next year, government will also maintain emergency measures that allow easier access to life-skills supports and rehabilitation supports through the Agreements with Young Adults (AYA) program. This includes allowing young adults in the program to take part in a wider range of life-skills programs and cultural learning options, as well as online programming, with fewer required hours of participation per week. As of Oct. 1, 2020, more flexibility is being granted for young adults to access mental health and rehabilitative supports while participating in the AYA program — along with a lower hourly requirement for these programs.“We’ve heard from youth and youth advocates that easily accessible life-skills and mental health supports are an important stepping-stone between aging out of care and living as an adult and we saw that these initiatives we brought in during the pandemic proved successful in reaching a broad range of youth from care,” Conroy said. “Not everyone is ready to go to school or start working right away, so we’re making it easier for young adults to get the supports they need to thrive.”Government first announced emergency measures in March with a June 30, 2020, expiry date. In June, government extended the measures until Sept. 30, 2020.Social workers will continue transition planning with young adults who are ready to move on from their placement. For youth who are about to age out of care and need additional supports, social workers will be working to make needed changes to housing agreements so that young adults can stay in place past Sept. 30, 2020. AYA program staff will also be working with young adults in the program to modify agreements where needed.These interim measures further complement government’s COVID-19 Action Plan to provide income supports, tax relief and direct funding for people, businesses and services, as well as the recently announced Economic Recovery Plan.Quick Facts: The AYA program provides financial support for eligible young adults between the ages of 19 and up until their 27th birthday who are attending an education, vocational, rehabilitation or life-skills program or participating in cultural learning. Life-skills programs provide guidance in areas like handling finances, grocery shopping, meal planning and resume writing, to help young people achieve their goals. Cultural learning can include things like language learning, learning land-based practices, family mapping, or connecting with cultural knowledge keepers, Elders or cultural mentors. Other emergency measures related to the AYA program intended to support young adults through school and program closures due to COVID-19, and allow support past the age of 26 to account for these closures, will come to an end Sept. 30, 2020, as schools and programs resume.

This is an improved relationship that opens the door to meaningful cooperation and collaboration based on the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, including steps for land reconciliation in relation to a return of our traditional territory. Our shared commitment to stewardship and protection of the lands and waters of British Columbia and protection of endangered species and habitat is an essential element of our values to protect our lands and resources for this and future generations. Like we have always done, Snuneymuxw people welcome new relationships, support prosperity and business development in the mid-Island area, and will work with all of our partners to bring new opportunities. This step today was made possible by the leadership of our people for many generations, and will serve to support our children and grandchildren to know our identity, Nation and lands are recognized and supported by all.”The Land Transfer Agreement includes a land package of more than 3,000 hectares of Crown lands near the City of Nanaimo, providing Snuneymuxw with culturally and economically significant lands at Mount Benson and Mount McKay. The agreement will result in economic growth and as many as 160 new jobs through innovative forestry partnerships that build on the Mid-Island Regional Forestry Initiative signed in 2017 between Snuneymuxw and industry.Public engagement on Snuneymuxw’s future planning for the Mount Benson and Mount McKay lands will be a priority leading up to the eventual transfer of the lands. This engagement will inform future land use after the parcels are transferred. These lands are home to key wildlife habitats and popular recreational spots for the public. Snuneymuxw has confirmed that access to The Great Trail of Canada will remain in place and 300 hectares on Mount McKay will be conserved to provide habitat for elk and deer populations.As part of the agreements, Snuneymuxw has agreed to discontinue litigation launched against the Province in 2001 over concerns that log booming in the Nanaimo River estuary impacts its Douglas Treaty rights to fish – an example of the benefits of reconciliation through negotiation instead of resolution through the courts.Quotes:Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation –“These agreements represent a significant step forward in reconciliation with Snuneymuxw First Nation and a further strengthening of our government-to-government relationship based on recognition of rights. Snuneymuxw has been working with local forestry companies on a strategy to reinvigorate the forest industry in the region and these agreements support this work – helping to create jobs and ensure stability and economic growth throughout the region, which will benefit everyone living in the central Island.”Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development –“We’ve been making changes to enhance the benefits that local First Nations derive from forestry and these agreements will increase First Nations’ participation in the forest economy. This is an important step forward for long-term reconciliation between Snuneymuxw and the Province and in this case will also provide predictability for log storage operations in the Nanaimo River estuary.Jeff Zweig, CEO, Mosaic –“Congratulations to Snuneymuxw on concluding these important new agreements that create welcomed opportunities to the mid-Island forestry sector. Snuneymuxw has been working with us for many years to strengthen prosperity and sustainable development in the region, and these agreements provide a path to significantly accelerating the positive outcomes.”Quick Facts: The land parcels include 1,003 hectares at Mount Benson and 2,097 hectares at Mount McKay. The Mount McKay parcel overlaps with Stz’uminus First Nation’s traditional territory, and each of the Hul’qumi’num Treaty Group member First Nations (Cowichan Tribes, Halalt, Lyackson, Ts'uubaa-asatx, and Penelakut). Consultation with each of these First Nations has started and will conclude prior to the land transfers taking place. The Mount Benson parcel overlaps with Snaw-naw-as First Nation. Consultation has been initiated and will conclude prior to the land transfers taking place. The Snuneymuxw First Nation is a large Coast Salish, Hul’q’umi’num-speaking Nation located in and around Nanaimo and Gabriola Island.

We’re doing things differently, making investments to help more students thrive in learning environments as soon as possible.”The Government of B.C. is providing an additional $5.8 million to ensure construction could begin on the Regent Road Elementary, while the Surrey School District is providing $1.5 million, for a total budget of $33.3 million. With shovels now in the ground, the 655-seat school is scheduled to open in September 2022, eliminating the need for about 26 portables at nearby schools.Since September 2017, the Province has announced $410 million for 26 school capital projects in the Surrey School District, 15 new or expanded schools and land purchases for four future schools. These investments are helping to create nearly 8,900 new student seats in Surrey between 2018 and 2023.“This is an exciting time for students and families in Cloverdale, who now have the certainty they were looking for with construction underway to build the new Regent Road Elementary school,” said Laurie Larsen, chair, Surrey Board of Education. “We appreciate the added investment from the Province to ensure this school can open its doors in September 2022 and provide a modern and optimal learning environment for our students.”In the last three years, government has announced over $2.1 billion for 103 school capital projects, creating nearly 29,000 seismically safer student seats and more than 13,000 new student seats at new and improved schools throughout B.C.To continue this momentum, Budget 2020 includes a record $2.8 billion for seismic upgrades and replacements, new and expanded schools and land purchases for future schools.Learn More:For more information about the new Regent Road Elementary school: https://www.surreyschools.ca/departments/BMGS/projects/projectdetails/Pages/regentroad.aspxA backgrounder follows.

The model helps people resolve family law matters by providing information, assessment and consensual dispute resolution. Where appropriate, it helps family members reach agreement without going to court. When court is required, it helps identify and narrow the issues and prepare the parties for court. “The expansion of this project to Surrey is a significant step in the transformation of family justice in British Columbia,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “By helping people resolve their disputes earlier and with less conflict, we’re keeping the focus on the best interests of families and children.”The model provides services to families in a less adversarial environment. In Victoria, it has reduced court time and the number of matters brought to court for family disputes. To launch the new model, effective Dec. 7, 2020, the Surrey registry will adopt the early resolution aspects of the new Provincial Court Family Rules in addressing parenting arrangements, child support, contact with a child, guardianship of a child, spousal support, relocation and protection from family violence. The Surrey Justice Access Centre will provide an initial needs determination and an assessment with a family justice counsellor. The assessment will identify legal and non-legal issues and determine whether it is appropriate for the individual to participate in consensual dispute resolution. Parties may be referred to free parenting education and, if appropriate, at least one free consensual dispute-resolution session through the Justice Access Centres and Family Justice Centres. Alternatively, people may hire private mediators or collaborative law professionals. People seeking orders for priority parenting matters or protection orders on a time sensitive basis will proceed directly to court. The new process supports earlier and more durable resolutions, which reduces conflict and builds skills that can help prevent future conflict. Learn More:Find out more about the Victoria Early Resolution and Case Management Model: www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/life-events/divorce/family-justice/your-options/early-resolutionNew Provincial Court Family Rules being implemented in May 2021: https://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/bcgaz2/bcgaz2/v63n10_120-2020    "

We’ve heard from vulnerable people and from communities that they need more specialized care for those living with really severe mental health challenges,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “These six new ACT teams will deliver the care people need to get better and rebuild their lives as well as help stabilize and resolve the challenging situations that some communities have seen in the past few months.”The new teams will be located in: Vancouver Victoria Maple Ridge Kelowna Nanaimo Cowichan Valley/Duncan They will provide flexible, individualized support – including community living, psychosocial supports and recovery - for adults with serious, complex and often persistent mental health challenges that make it difficult to manage day-to-day activities. Most ACT clients have not responded well to traditional outpatient mental health services.“We are thrilled to welcome more supports to our vibrant community and know that the expertise and experience of a new ACT team will provide a connection to vital services that many people living with severe mental health challenges have been looking for,” said Bob D’Eith, MLA for Maple Ridge-Mission. “To have a qualified team of professionals working together to support someone’s unique circumstances is the best way to get them on the right path, and that’s what this team will do in our community.”The teams are mobile and deliver 24/7 services in the community, such as in client homes, work, parks and recreation locations, rather than in a traditional office setting. This makes these teams well suited to deliver services to all British Columbians, including those living in supportive housing or in encampments.Up to 60 new staff will be hired to support six new teams.ACT teams are the highest standard for delivering community-based mental health services for people with serious challenges. Existing teams have resulted in substantially improved outcomes for people with higher needs, as well as the communities where they live.“In Nanaimo, we’ve been working hard to get more help for people living with serious mental health challenges, because the need is great,” said Sheila Malcolmson, MLA for Nanaimo. “People are still struggling with housing, social supports and substance use, so we’re bringing in a new team to help. Getting a new ACT team in our community means more people will get the right combination of mental health supports and services.”Team services differ by community but can include: crisis assessment and intervention, housing supports, psychiatric/psychological treatment, medication management, supports for substance use disorder, work-related services, family support, healthy lifestyle choices and social/recreational activities. Services are delivered by a team of mental health practitioners from a variety of disciplines, including psychiatrists, social workers, nurses, substance-use specialists, peer support workers and vocational specialists who tailor the support to the unique needs of each client.

The funding for Indigenous cultural safety and cultural humility training has already been allocated to communities.The cultural safety and cultural humility CEPF stream supports eligible applicants to provide emergency management personnel with training to more effectively partner with and assist Indigenous communities during times of emergency. This includes increasing opportunities to educate emergency management personnel, emergency management professionals in training, and others working in the emergency management system on the history of Indigenous peoples, as well as the concepts of cultural safety, cultural humility and its importance to Indigenous peoples.“We learned many lessons during the unprecedented wildfire and flooding seasons in 2017 and 2018, including the importance of  working together to improve emergency services for First Nations communities,” said Jennifer Rice, Parliamentary Secretary for Emergency Preparedness. “We’ve worked hard as a government to make sure communities are prepared for emergencies, and this funding has been a key part of that effort.”For future intakes of the CEPF, the Province is also announcing the allocation of the remainder of available funding, which includes: $7.9 million for structural flood mitigation (Nov. 20, 2020) $2.5 million for flood risk assessments, mapping and mitigation planning (January 2021) $2 million for Emergency Support Services training and upgrades (February 2021) $2.1 million for Emergency Operations Centres and training (March 2021) Since the September 2017 Budget update, communities and governments around B.C. have received more than $52 million through the CEPF.

Highway 4 will close weekdays between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. to allow crews to safely facilitate smaller blasts and remove the rock debris from the roadway. This closure window will happen Monday through Friday, not on weekends.Smaller and more precise daytime blasts, with sufficient time to clear debris, will help boost safety for people and will limit unplanned highway closures like those experienced by drivers in the early spring of 2020.The weekday closures will be consistent and will allow people who live in neighbouring communities to plan their day and driving activities accordingly.The new plan has been made following extensive onsite geotechnical investigations, which have determined that the safest time to blast is during daylight hours. This will allow for safe and efficient removal of loose rock after each blast.Daytime blasting and scheduled road closures are expected to be required until spring 2021. Next spring, after the bulk of the challenging blasting is complete, conditions will be re-evaluated to determine if night-time blasting can safely resume.As the project progresses, the ministry will have more information on overall project completion dates.

This includes culture, leadership, curriculum and learning environments. The MHiS Strategy is the result of extensive research and collaboration between education and community partners.“We know that when it comes to the health and well-being of young people, starting early and addressing small problems before they become big ones can make all the difference down the road,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “COVID-19 has impacted everyone in B.C., and our students deserve access to vital supports to help them thrive – now more than ever.”Improving mental health in schools is an integral part of government’s plan to build the comprehensive system of mental health and addictions care that British Columbians deserve, as outlined in A Pathway to Hope. For the 2020-2021 school year, the government has invested $3.75 million for new and existing mental health activities for students, families and educators. Since September 2017, the Province has committed to an investment of $13.9 million in funding for school district mental health initiatives and grants spanning four years.  “Children and teens face social and emotional challenges that are even more complex during the pandemic,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “I am proud to work with the Ministry of Education to promote positive mental health and wellness. Together we are making life better for B.C.’s kids.”  People in British Columbia may be experiencing an increase in mental health and substance use challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially those with pre-existing conditions. Help is available for people of all ages, and people are encouraged to seek support.

This represents a $25,000 increase for each playground from last year’s investment, made possible through the Playground Equipment Program (PEP). The PEP is a part of the Province’s commitment to update aging infrastructure in B.C. schools to provide safe, enjoyable and accessible learning environments.“Now more than ever, outdoor play is incredibly important for our kids. I’m proud that students throughout the province have access to the outdoors on safe, accessible and modern playground equipment thanks to these investments,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “The PEP relieves parents of the burden of fundraising for playground equipment, so they can focus on their kids.”Playgrounds help promote physical activity and healthy lifestyles, encourage children to share, develop conflict resolution skills and overcome challenges. Playing outside helps reduce anxiety, improves focus and enhances students’ attention spans.The PEP was launched in 2018. Since then, government has invested $15 million to provide 141 new playgrounds to schools throughout the province, benefiting more than 35,000 students. Every school district has now received at least one new playground. The program relieves parents of some of the responsibility for fundraising for playground equipment and provides access to communities that do not have the fundraising capacity to buy the playground equipment students need.“The BC Confederation of Parent Advisory Councils (BCCPAC) strongly commends the ministry for its continued support of local parent advisory councils, the recognition of the pressure on parents to fundraise to replace aging or non-existent playground structures and the hundreds of hours parents volunteer to ensure that their communities have play spaces,” said Andrea Sinclair, president, BCCPAC. “From the conception of this program, BCCPAC has long worked with the ministry to ensure that all new playgrounds are accessible for each and every one of our children. Parents strongly believe accessible playgrounds should not be dependent on the school community’s ability to raise funds. This program alleviates some of the inequities in the public education system.”School districts have the opportunity to apply for the funding by sending a list of priorities in their capital plan submissions in June of each year. Playgrounds are funded based on greatest need. Priority is given to schools where there is no playground at all, then to schools where the existing playground is aging. School districts that did not receive funding this year may receive it next year if they reapply.Quick Facts: This playground investment is a part of government’s school capital plan to ensure students have safe, positive learning and play spaces, no matter where they live. Budget 2020 includes a record $2.8 billion for new and improved schools for B.C. students. Since September 2017, the Province has announced more than $2 billion for school capital projects. This includes $749 million to add more than 13,000 new student seats in B.C. schools, eliminating the equivalent of about 520 portables.

This review was completed in 2018 by a balanced committee of special advisers, including an employer and a labour representative and included recommendations based on a thorough public consultation.The review identified one important area regarding successorship protections for the forestry sector that needed further consultation before any further recommendations could be made. For this reason, government intends to establish an industrial inquiry commission (IIC) under the code to review contract tendering in the forestry sector, outside the scope of any Indigenous or First Nations interests.“Protecting workers’ job security and benefits will help with the economic recovery of the B.C. forestry sector,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “That’s why we’ll appoint an IIC to reach out to industry experts, unions and employers to better understand successorship and contract tendering in the sector.”The outcome of an industrial inquiry commission will help guide future potential changes to the Labour Relations Code or the code’s regulations.Improving fairness for workers and ensuring balance in workplaces are shared priorities between government, the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Learn More:To read the recommendations for amendments to the Labour Relations Code report, visit: https://engage.gov.bc.ca/app/uploads/sites/121/2018/10/Labour-Relations-Code-Review-Panel-Report-1.pdf    "

This was not an equal opportunity pandemic: for those who were already disadvantaged, the impacts have been even more difficult.“Women, and especially women of colour, are one of the groups at risk of long-term economic insecurity as a result of the pandemic because many work part-time and are in jobs that tend to be over-represented in some of the hardest hit service sectors.“Women are also most likely to be in a caregiving role – for children or elderly parents – sometimes both.“Our immediate response included financial supports for people whose ability to work has been affected, help for people facing violence, supports for vulnerable people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, and increased funding to assist child care providers, just to name a few.“Our recovery plan goes even further to support those who need it most. This includes training people who have lost work, new job creation, investments in more child care spaces and safe schools, and increased supports for hard-hit sectors, such as the arts, culture, tourism and small business, where so many women workers and entrepreneurs make their livelihood.“And, as always, we need diversity and collaboration. Many organizations recognize that ideas and innovation won’t happen if everyone at the table looks the same and has the same experiences. All organizations and businesses must strive for gender equity as not only the right thing to do, but necessary for innovation.  “Having different perspectives is vital and it’s the best way to build back our communities with all of the talent and lived experience we have available.“As B.C. implements its COVID-19 economic recovery plan, it’s important that all people – especially those who already face disadvantages – are supported to have best possible opportunity to move forward.”For more information on Stronger BC for Everyone: BC’s Economic Recovery Plan, visit: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/    "

Applicants can receive up to 50% of the cost of equipment and installation to a maximum of $80,000 per fast-charging station. Increased rebates of up to 90% of projects costs to a maximum of $130,000 per station are also available for Indigenous-owned fast-charging stations. The program is being delivered by the Fraser Basin Council on behalf of the Province.“By working together with local governments and First Nations across the province, we’re making it more convenient for people to use electric vehicles and supporting clean economic opportunities as we build our recovery from COVID-19,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “This CleanBC investment will help people benefit from a better driving experience, lower fuel and maintenance costs and zero tailpipe pollution.”In addition to the funding for the expansion of the EV public charging network, a range of rebates for new EVs and home and workplace EV charging infrastructure are available to British Columbians through the CleanBC Go Electric program.CleanBC is a pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. CleanBC was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s emission targets.Quick Facts: B.C. has more than 2,000 public charging stations around the province, including more than 150 fast-charging stations. EV owners can save big on fuel costs – about $1,800 every year for the average B.C. driver.

The second intake will open in October 2020 and builds on the success of $1.65 million distributed to 13 projects in the province in 2019. “Great design and innovation are resulting in better, more energy-efficient buildings showing the world that people in B.C. are hard at work as we respond to the challenges and opportunities of climate change and economic recovery,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “Our economic recovery will be stronger as a result of the investment we are all making to reduce emissions and build a better, cleaner B.C. for everyone.”This funding is part of BC’s Economic Recovery Plan, which outlines government’s next steps moving forward from the COVID-19 Pandemic. The plan outlines historic new investments in health care, getting people back to work, supporting businesses and helping communities.Winton Homes in Prince George was one of the successful 13 projects, receiving $250,000 to manufacture highly energy-efficient prefabricated wall, floor and roof assemblies suitable for the northern B.C. climate. CORE Energy Recovery Solutions was another recipient, awarded $200,000 for the development of high-efficiency heat and energy recovery ventilators for moderate and cold climate zones.The second intake of the CBBIF will provide funding through four different streams: material, component and system manufacturing (up to $1,000,000 per project)    digital technology solutions (up to $500,000 per project) demonstration projects (up to $250,000 per project) open call for innovations (up to $500,000 per project) CleanBC commits the Province to achieving ambitious greenhouse gas targets, while simultaneously supporting a vibrant economy for British Columbia. The CBBIF supports these goals by helping the building sector to develop innovative and affordable energy-efficient and low-carbon building solutions.  CleanBC is a pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. CleanBC was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s emission targets.Learn More:To learn more about the CleanBC Building Innovation Fund, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/electricity-alternative-energy/energy-efficiency-conservation/programs/cleanbc-building-innovation-fundTo learn how CleanBC puts B.C. on the path to a cleaner, better future, visit: https://cleanbc.gov.bc.ca/For a backgrounder with the successful CleanBC Building Innovation Fund projects from the first intake, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.09.21_%20CBBIF_Recipients.pdf    "
43,2020-09-19 10:15:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020LBR0031-001805,Government Website,Protecting temporary foreign workers in B.C.,"  Temporary foreign workers who come to B.C. to work will be better protected now that the employers who want to hire these workers will be required to register with the Province as of Dec. 15, 2020.Employers who wish to hire foreign nationals through three federal programs — the Temporary Foreign Worker Program, the Home Child-Care Provider Pilot or the Home Support Worker Pilot — have until Dec. 15 to register with the provincial government. There is no fee for registering. The process takes 20 minutes to complete, on average.“Our government is committed to ensuring that regardless of your immigration status, if you're working in B.C., your rights and protections are the same as any worker,” said Harry Bains, Minister of Labour. “These important protections for vulnerable workers in our province are long overdue and will ensure they are not taken advantage of.”B.C. has created the registration requirement to ensure fair working conditions for all workers in the province. This means people from abroad who come here are paid for the hours they work, have a job description that matches the work they perform and ensures their rights and safety are protected while on the job.“Temporary foreign workers are integral to our agricultural sector and B.C. relies on them for important jobs like harvesting the crops we depend on for our daily meals and to build our province’s food security,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “The new registration requirement for employers will help ensure foreign workers are fairly treated.”The registration requirement will allow the Province to identify which employers hire temporary foreign workers and will enable inspection of those employers and enforcement of provincial law. Until now, there has not been a system that registers and certifies employers who hire workers from other countries.“Caregivers arriving in B.C. as foreign workers have sacrificed so much to care for our children and our loved ones. This employer registry is a powerful step forward in ensuring that they are protected, valued and continue to thrive here,” said Marla Brock, CEO of Kidcoover, a child care agency. “For all that these workers do to move our economy forward, we must always champion initiatives that raise awareness of their rights and protections and keep their employers within the sightlines of government.”This employer registry is the final step in implementing the Temporary Foreign Worker Protection Act, passed in fall 2018. Last year, B.C. established a licensing requirement for recruiters of foreign workers and launched the recruiter registry. Approximately 150 recruiters in B.C. are licensed and in good standing.These actions, like the Temporary Foreign Worker Protection Act, the recruiter registry and the employer registry provide transparency into recruiting, hiring and employing foreign nationals. These changes strengthen the protections government has put in place, make it easier to find employers who mistreat workers and level the playing field for law-abiding employers.Improving fairness and safety for all workers is a shared priority between government, the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts: When in force, an estimated 5,000 employers are anticipated to require an employer’s certificate of registration to hire temporary foreign workers in B.C. With this new process, B.C. joins other provinces in Canada that have registration requirements for employers of foreign workers, including Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia. Under the federal government’s Temporary Foreign Worker Program, employers can hire foreign workers to fill temporary labour and skills shortages.

Eligible employees will receive training designed to increase their knowledge of recyclable materials, further enhance computer literacy and develop skills such as conflict resolution and communication.“The people who make the Binners’ Project a reality are the unsung heroes of our community and a leading example of grassroots environmental stewardship,” said Melanie Mark, MLA for Vancouver-Mount Pleasant. “I am proud that our government is investing in enhancing the skills and potential of my constituents. This program is what social, economic and environmental justice looks like.”“We are so excited to get the training program up and running,” said Landon Hoyt, director, Binners’ Project. “Having a customized curriculum that takes into account the particular needs of the binners to build their capacity as leaders and expert waste diverters will take our social enterprise programs to the next level.”Davin Boutang, Binners’ Project community specialist and former binner, said: “As a grassroots initiative, it’s always been important that training and leadership comes from the binners. Not only will this training build their skills to help them grow within the project, but it fits with our mission of building community from the ground up.”Quick Facts: Over $19 million was invested in CEP projects around B.C. in 2019-20.

People in the sport community have felt the effects of COVID-19 profoundly, and many will see reduced access without provincial funding support.“For many athletes and families, local sport organizations provide the important physical, mental and social benefits sports offer, which we need more than ever,” said Lisa Beare, Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture. “This funding will help local organizations so they can continue to support children, families and our communities with healthy activities.”The fund will help local sport clubs and organizations pay bills, society dues, salaries and/or maintenance fees while weathering the impacts of the pandemic, helping them to plan for an eventual full return to sport. The application process is open until Oct. 16, 2020.“COVID-19 has had a significant financial impact on local non-profit sport organizations, resulting in a great number being at risk of disappearing,” said Charlene Krepiakevich, CEO, viaSport. “As sport begins to safely return to communities, this funding will help maintain the viability of these organizations and retain the opportunities they have worked so hard to create for British Columbians.”Rural and remote communities, as well as under-represented populations, such as Indigenous peoples, girls and women, low-income individuals, persons with disabilities and newcomers, are disproportionally impacted by a reduction in physical activity opportunities as a result of COVID-19. This funding program seeks to ensure these opportunities remain in place by providing support to local sports organizations in rural, remote and urban communities throughout B.C.“This financial support from the provincial government for local sport organizations is really huge during these volatile times. The support will help our club, Kamloops Classic Swimming, continue ‘developing good citizens one stroke at a time,’ which is our mantra,” said Brad Dalke, head coach, Kamloops Classic Swimming. “It will ensure our staff can continue working with our athletes, ages six to 23, to maintain healthy, balanced lifestyles and good mental health in these unusual times.”Quick Facts: As of Sept. 15, 67 sport-specific plans had been completed by provincial sport organizations, with 26 being updated for Phase 3 of returning to sport. This means more than 500,000 British Columbians are now able to return to sport. Local sports organizations include baseball and soccer teams, gymnastics and swim teams. This funding will ensure people of all ages, backgrounds and levels of ability are able to enjoy the physical and mental benefits sport offers. As of September 2020, the Province, through viaSport, provided $11 million in accelerated funding to provincial, disability and multi-sport organizations. Provincial sport organizations in B.C. are also being supported through a $3.9-million investment from Canadian Heritage, which was recently increased from $3.4 million. The funding is part of the $72-million COVID-19 Emergency Support Fund for Sport Organizations and will support B.C.’s provincial, disability and multi-sport organizations.

Residents started moving in on Sept. 1, 2020.The project was built in partnership with PC Urban Properties through BC Housing’s HousingHub program, which was created in 2018. It works with community, government, non-profit and private-sector partners to help create new affordable rental housing and home-ownership options for middle-income British Columbians.“This has been a really unique and successful partnership with the Province and with the City of Kelowna to build safe, high-quality, attainable housing for middle-income earners,” said Brent Sawchyn, CEO, PC Urban Properties. ""We are proud to have delivered this multi-use project ahead of schedule and we are excited to welcome people in. Leasing the apartments has exceeded expectations, which is testament to the need for this type of housing in Kelowna.”The development includes a second six-storey building, which will provide 77 rental homes for people with middle incomes. Construction is expected to be complete by December 2020.“Providing a variety of options across the housing spectrum is essential to meeting the needs of all Kelowna residents,” said Colin Basran, mayor, City of Kelowna. “As more of the population relies on rental housing, purpose-built rental housing in Kelowna will only become more important so residents have access to attainable and affordable housing.”Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts: The Province, through the HousingHub, provided interim construction financing of approximately $39.5 million for the 157-unit project in Kelowna. The monthly rents for apartments are: one bedroom: $1,300/month two bedroom: $1,780/month  Including these homes, the Province is working in partnership to build nearly 1,300 new affordable homes for people with a range of incomes in Kelowna and West Kelowna.

47,2020-09-19 08:00:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020IRR0054-001820,Government Website,Long-term agreement guarantees 25 years of revenue shared with First Nations,"  First Nations in B.C. and the provincial government completed and signed a 23-year agreement on Sept. 16, 2020, that will see the Province share approximately $3 billion in gaming revenue.The agreement supports Indigenous self-government and self-determination, strong, healthy communities and services that make life better for First Nations communities and people.“Being able to count on this secure and long-term revenue can transform communities and lives – as two years of initial funding already started to show,” said Premier John Horgan. “Locking in these revenues for 25 years is part of our government’s ongoing commitment to reconciliation, ensuring First Nations can plan for the long term and invest in the services they decide their communities need to thrive and prosper.”More than 97% of eligible First Nations in B.C. have joined the First Nations Gaming Revenue Sharing Limited Partnership and started receiving their share of new revenue in September 2019 under an interim two-year agreement. The completion of the long-term agreement guarantees their share of gaming revenue for the subsequent 23 years.“This agreement marks an exciting commitment from the Province to B.C. First Nations, as it relates to gaming revenue, that inspires hope regarding the application of United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and informs how we can engage in successful government-to-government relations,” said Judith Sayers, co-chair, BC First Nations Gaming Commission. “We look forward to building on these successes with positive results from the upcoming Phase 2 negotiations, including enhanced First Nations access to gaming opportunities.”The agreement is the first major multilateral agreement with First Nations that substantively incorporates the UN Declaration, following the passage of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act in November 2019.“In the first two years of the agreement, we’ve seen many success stories from First Nations and their utilization of gaming revenues,” said Michael Bonshor, co-chair, BC First Nations Gaming Revenue Sharing Limited Partnership. “We look forward to continued positive impact for B.C. First Nations.”First Nations determine how their communities will benefit best from the revenue. The revenue may be invested in: health and wellness; infrastructure, safety, transportation and housing; economic and business development; education, language, culture and training; community development and environmental protection; and capacity building, fiscal management and governance. “With this funding, First Nations can continue to build on plans that will make a real difference in their communities,” said Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. “Already, we’ve seen communities able to start new projects building housing and community centres, protecting homes from wildfires, and expanding language programs – and there will be many more examples in the years ahead.”The long-term agreement will provide certainty for First Nations in B.C. to share in the Province’s gaming revenues for 25 years. In 2019, the Province made amendments to the Gaming Control Act, establishing an entitlement to 7% of the BC Lottery Corporation’s net income.The BC First Nations Gaming Revenue Sharing Limited Partnership is governed by a five-person board of directors. In addition to administering the distribution of funding to eligible First Nations, it provides regular reporting to an independent auditor jointly appointed by the Province and the limited partnership.Quotes:David Eby, Attorney General –“This partnership reinforces our government’s commitment to work alongside First Nations, sharing guaranteed long-term funding that will build up communities and give Indigenous peoples improved access to the services that they rely on, now and into the future.”Kukpi7 Judy Wilson, Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs –“B.C. reached this momentous agreement after years of persistence by our leadership. The agreement is certainly a testament to the drive of our First Nations in B.C. to see self-determination and self-governance become the cornerstones of healthy, empowered First Nation communities. This agreement not only helps First Nations use gaming revenue to build strong, sustainable economies, but sets a precedent for how the United Nations Declaration can be meaningfully incorporated into future accords to foster and support Indigenous leadership and resiliency.”Robert Phillips, political executive, First Nations Summit –“We are very pleased this long-term agreement has been finalized. These annual funds will provide B.C. First Nations the ability to address a vast array of community needs. As we have said before, these annual investments into communities will measurably enhance the economy of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities, supporting the concept that healthy Indigenous economies ultimately benefit all British Columbians.”Regional Chief Terry Teegee, British Columbia Assembly of First Nations –“The benefit and impact of this long-term agreement will be significant in promoting and enhancing community-driven priorities and initiatives. This funding will flow directly to First Nations, subsequently supporting First Nations’ goals and projects. We are beginning to see free, prior and informed consent as components of government-to-government agreements, thanks to the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act. I look forward to the ongoing discussions and the completion of negotiations related to Phase 2, implementing gaming operations and jurisdiction within our own territories, which will empower First Nations to operate and manage their own gaming institutions.”Quick Facts: As part of an interim agreement, the Province transferred $194.84 million in August 2019 for the first two years. The next payment will be transferred in April 2021. In 2018-19, the B.C. government collected $1.4 billion in net revenue from gaming activities. Under the long-term agreement, 7% of net provincial gaming revenues per year will be distributed to First Nations communities through 2044-45 based on the following formula: 50% base funding (divided equally among eligible First Nations); 40% based on population; and 10% for geographically remote communities.

We are also reporting 40 historic cases that were tested between Aug. 11 and Sept. 16 for people who did not have personal health numbers. All these cases have been previously investigated and managed by Vancouver Coastal Health, but had not been entered into the data system. This brings our total to 7,842 cases in British Columbia.“There are 1,803 active cases of COVID-19 in the province, 3,075 people who are under active public health monitoring as a result of identified exposure to known cases and 5,797 people who tested positive have recovered.“Currently, 59 individuals are hospitalized with COVID-19, 20 of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 2,817 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 4,007 in the Fraser Health region, 196 in the Island Health region, 492 in the Interior Health region, 244 in the Northern Health region and 86 cases of people who reside outside of Canada.“There have been three new COVID-19 related deaths, for a total of 223 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks and the outbreak at Royal Arch Masonic Home long-term care facility (second outbreak) has been declared over. In total, 10 long-term care or assisted-living facilities and five acute-care facilities have active outbreaks.“There have been no new community outbreaks, although there continue to be community exposure events.“Alerts are posted on the BC Centre for Disease Control’s (BCCDC) website, as well as on health authorities’ websites, providing details on where the potential exposure occurred and what actions to take – whether you need to self-isolate or monitor for symptoms.“For schools, public health teams will contact individuals through contact tracing. Schools will continue to issue alerts when a school exposure has occurred and action is required. Supporting these protocols, the BCCDC website and health authorities are also publishing notifications.“We need to push the COVID-19 curve back down and we have the knowledge, the tools and resources to do just that. Always using your layers of protection and choosing to stick with your ‘safe six’ will help all of us this weekend and every weekend ahead.“The cases we are seeing today are a direct result of how we spent our Labour Day long weekend. Let’s break the chain of transmission and turn this trend around.“No one intends to pass the virus onto friends or family, but it is very easy to do. It can take up to two weeks for symptoms of COVID-19 to develop and in that time, we can inadvertently spread it to others.“That is why the actions we take as individuals today are so important to the well-being of our communities tomorrow. Let’s choose safe, let’s choose small and let’s choose to protect the people we care about most.”Quick Facts: Assisted living, long-term care homes and seniors’ rental buildings with ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks are as follows: Vancouver Coastal Health OPAL by Element assisted-living facility Point Grey Private Hospital long-term care facility  Fraser Health Bear Creek Villa independent-living facility Cherington Place long-term care facility Evergreen Hamlets long-term care facility Kin Village assisted-living facility Milieu Children and Family Services Society community-living facility New Vista Care Home long-term care facility Normanna long-term care facility Rideau Retirement Centre independent-living facility   Learn More:For a listing of the community notifications, including school notifications, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/public-exposuresTo find the provincial health officer's orders, including amended orders from last week, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topics/covid-19-novel-coronavirusFor the last modelling information presented on Sept. 3, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/COVID19_Going_Forward_Sept_2020.pdfTo see a map of COVID-19 cases by local health area, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/dataIf you are experiencing symptoms, find a collection centre near you to get tested: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testingFor mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca Or: www.anxietycanada.comFor a listing of the community exposure events, go to: BCCDC (flights, work sites, etc.): http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/public-exposures Fraser Health: fraserhealth.ca/covid19exposure Interior Health: https://news.interiorhealth.ca/news/public-exposures/ Island Health: https://www.islandhealth.ca/learn-about-health/covid-19/outbreaks-and-exposures Northern Health: https://www.northernhealth.ca/health-topics/outbreaks-and-exposures Vancouver Coastal: http://www.vch.ca/covid-19/public-exposuresFor the second monthly progress report on B.C.’s surgical renewal plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020_surgical-renewal-commitment-progress-report-June-July-2020.pdfFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/ Or follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19 Or call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit: Facebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews     "

($105,000): The Fédération des Parents Francophones de la C.-B. aims to meet the growing demand for francophone child care by changing the delivery model. The expected result of the project is the creation of 50 new French-language daycare spaces.  Embracing Indigenous Peoples and Culture ($63,000): The Collège Éducacentre plans to develop an action plan aimed at bringing together staff and students, the francophone and francophile community and Indigenous peoples. With the support of an Indigenous expert, activities will be integrated in all the college’s programs starting with early childhood education and education assistant programs.  A Place of Gathering – French-language Resource Centre in B.C. ($75,000) L’Alliance française de Vancouver intends to create a multi-media centre and library. The space will enable francophones and francophiles, irrespective of mobility and language proficiency, to retrieve resources and be a place for gathering.  Les P’tits Matins & Maman Poule ($7,000) There is currently no French early literacy programs in the West Kootenays or in Nelson, despite high demand. The Kootenay Kids Society, in partnership with L’Association des Francophones des Kootenays Ouest, will deliver a parent/child playgroup program and a French early literacy program geared to children six years old and younger.  The funding is part of a five-year commitment made in Budget 2018, totalling $1.25 million for French-language services. This is the third year of funding to support the B.C. Francophonie.

This construction project will create jobs for people on Vancouver Island and help support B.C.’s economic recovery.”The 3.2-hectare (eight acre) piece of land at the Royal Bay development in Colwood will include a new approximately 14,000 square-metre facility. It will use mass timber construction and meet CleanBC energy efficiency standards. Building construction will generate more than 950 direct and indirect good-paying jobs.   The proposed facility will house the Royal BC Museum’s archives, collections and research department. It will improve research activities by providing dedicated research labs and learning spaces. It will also improve access to the museum’s vast collections. The new building will offer learning opportunities for students, both in person and online.  The collections and research building will hold the following collections, as well as the BC Archives: birds and mammals botany fish entomology history paleontology modern history In October, crews will begin preparing the site for construction, including surveying and earthworks. The government will undertake a competitive procurement process in the coming months to select a design-build team to lead the development of the project. Project funding details will be released upon successful execution of the contract with the successful bidder. Government expects the project to break ground in winter 2021 and to be complete in summer 2024.This is the first phase of the Royal BC Museum modernization project. The main museum and public galleries will remain at the downtown site in Victoria. The B.C. government is committed to redeveloping the museum space downtown and will announce plans in 2021.Quotes:Daniel Muzyka, board chair, Royal BC Museum –“We are thankful to the Province for delivering on its commitment to modernize the Royal BC Museum. We’re excited that this new building will protect the collections and also make them more accessible to the people of B.C.”Ron Sam, chief of Songhees First Nation –“Our Nation is looking forward to participating in the modernization of the Royal BC Museum. This project is an opportunity to tell the stories of our people, our history and our culture in the provincial museum in our territory. This is another important step on the path of reconciliation.”Mitzi Dean, MLA for Esquimalt-Metchosin –“I am so excited the B.C. government chose Colwood as the new home of B.C.’s treasured collections and archives. I know this project will bring jobs and increased economic activity to our communities and become an iconic landmark.”Rob Martin, mayor of Colwood –“The Royal BC Museum is an important part of the fabric of B.C. as holders of the history of our province.

To reduce vehicle dependency and support the Province’s CleanBC goals, the strategy builds on work done in some areas across the south island and weaves together new thinking to identify ways to expand transportation options for people. This planning is important today, as the population of southern Vancouver Island is expected to increase by more than 23% in the next two decades.Colin Plant, Capital Regional District board chair, thanked the Province for the collaboration and the acknowledgment of the Regional Transportation Plan. “The strategy is a good start, and I look forward to working together on implementing the medium- and longer-term strategies,” said Plant. “We are particularly interested in advancing active transportation and in investments that tie affordable housing to connected mobility corridors.”The South Island Transportation Strategy focuses on improvements to transit and active transportation. Advancing these priorities requires partnerships with Indigenous, local and regional governments and BC Transit.“Congestion continues to be a challenge in getting people moving in Greater Victoria and throughout the south island,” said Erinn Pinkerton, president and chief executive officer, BC Transit. “I am pleased to see a focus on public transportation in the South Island Transportation Strategy as a transportation solution people can rely on that is better for the environment while reducing congestion.”The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure will be working with partners to support the implementation of identified short-, medium- and long-term improvements, including: more electric vehicle charging stations strategically located in the region; bike lockers at key community locations; developing new park and ride stalls in the Capital Regional District (CRD) and Cowichan Valley Regional District (CVRD); encouraging the growth of inter-regional trails in the CRD and CVRD; the addition of bus lanes on the Old Island Highway; and improvements to transit stops serving Indigenous communities. “We're thankful for the engagement and consultation of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure in the development of this important plan,” said Aaron Stone, chair, Cowichan Valley Regional District. “A strong transportation system for the south island will have a great impact in addressing important climate action and social-equity objectives for our region. Moving forward, we will continue working closely with the ministry, BC Transit and other stakeholders to meet our transportation needs today and into the future.”Each of the identified priorities supports the goals of the strategy: to ensure sustainable options for a variety of travel modes, to strengthen connections between travel modes and improve connections between communities, to improve the safety and reliability of the transportation network and to support and encourage active transportation options.While work on the strategy gets underway with partners at the community level, the ministry will continue to improve the safety and reliability of provincial highway infrastructure on southern Vancouver Island.The ministry is committed to continued investments in active transportation improvements as part of current and future provincial highway improvement projects to ensure roads, bridges and interchanges are designed and built with the safety and convenience of people walking, cycling and wheeling in mind.Work is advancing on the proposed Highway 17/Keating Cross Road flyover project. The Leigh Road/Highway 1 Four-Laning and Median Barrier Project is well underway, and improvements to Highway 14 near Sooke are under construction.For an immediate, positive impact to transit, the ministry is looking at adding transit queue jumper lanes along the Highway 17 corridor. As a medium-term improvement, the ministry will look at expansion of transit priority lanes on Highway 1 toward the western communities, building on the success of the 4.4-kilometre bus lane corridor along Highway 1/Douglas Street.By bringing transportation, regional growth planning and land use together, some of the region’s anticipated growth can be better distributed. By integrating park and ride facilities and bike and pedestrian trails with transit service at regional hubs, it means outlying, less expensive areas of the region become more accessible, making for more affordable housing options.Improving active transportation on southern Vancouver Island is part of the B.C. government’s Active Transportation Strategy, Move. Commute. Connect. Today, about 5% of all daily travel within the capital region is by bicycle. The strategy supports the government’s commitment to ensure new bridges and interchanges are designed to make walking, cycling and transit safe and convenient, so more people are encouraged to use modes of active transportation.The strategy is part of CleanBC, a plan to help transform how people move around, while encouraging more active transportation in communities. CleanBC is a pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. CleanBC was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s emission targets.Learn More:Read the South Island Transportation Strategy and supporting technical documents online: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation/transportation-reports-and-reference/reports-studies/vancouver-island/south-island-transportation-strategyRead more about the Province's CleanBC Plan at: www.cleanbc.gov.bc.ca  Move.

Investing in sustainable transportation is helping communities across the province build back better from the pandemic.”The Safe Restart Agreement will see TransLink, BC Transit and BC Ferries receive one-time operating funding relief. This will protect service levels across the province and ensure services remain affordable as part of BC’s Restart Plan. TransLink will receive $644 million, BC Transit will receive $86 million and BC Ferries will receive $308 million. Funding provided to BC Transit will be used to support municipal partners who receive fare revenue as part of the provincial-municipal partnership to deliver BC Transit services throughout the province.“Our public transit systems are vital for people to get where they need to go – to work, to school, to shop or visit friends,"" said Claire Trevena, B.C.'s Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “Efficient, effective and affordable public transit is an integral part of BC’s Restart Plan, and this funding demonstrates our commitment to that.”All three agencies have seen significant impacts due to the pandemic. Ridership declines early in the pandemic meant revenue plummeted. While ridership is increasing as B.C.’s economic recovery continues, financial challenges remain. The agencies have also incurred extra costs for making sure there are additional safety measures in place during COVID-19. This funding will cover losses to date and those projected through the current and next fiscal years.The Province will formalize the Safe Restart funding relief through contribution agreements with each transportation agency. These agreements will contain terms and conditions that help ensure the continuation of appropriate and affordable services that communities depend on.“Transportation is vital to restarting our economy,” said Bowinn Ma, Parliamentary Secretary for TransLink. “I’m very pleased with the 50-50 cost-sharing funding agreement in place today that ensures our transit agencies can continue to serve British Columbians. It will continue to take a collective effort from all of us to ensure we emerge from these unprecedented times a stronger, healthier and more resilient B.C.”The provincial government has been working closely with BC Transit, TransLink and BC Ferries to fully understand the operational and financial challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as determining the funding needed to help ensure service levels are maintained throughout the province and they remain affordable.  Quotes:Kevin Desmond, CEO, TransLink –“I very much welcome this important funding relief, which will greatly assist by covering the substantial losses TransLink is incurring as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. It recognizes that transit is an essential service and will enable us to continue delivering reliable service levels for our region in support of BC’s Safe Restart, particularly over the coming months as our economy gradually reopens and our customers return to using transit more regularly. The funding also allows us to continue our enhanced public health and safety measures on transit and ensures that we can maintain a state of good repair across our region’s transportation network.”Erinn Pinkerton, president and CEO, BC Transit –“Having access to affordable and reliable public transportation is key to maintaining sustainable communities, especially during a public health crisis. This funding will allow BC Transit and our local government partners to continue providing essential transportation services as we welcome customers back onboard who are returning to school, work and other activities.”Mark Collins, president and CEO, BC Ferries –“We thank the federal and provincial governments for working with us to address the impact COVID-19 has had on transportation and on the ferry system. This investment can help us to maintain essential ferry service that B.C.’s coastal communities rely on and supports the economic recovery of our province.”A backgrounder follows.    "

As a result of the measures announced today, and more to come, residents will benefit from cleaner, healthier, lower carbon communities.”The program offers two streams of funding: organic waste processing infrastructure projects and residential curbside collection programs. Eligible applicants include Indigenous governing bodies, regional districts and municipalities. Funding will be provided through cost-sharing arrangements, with the province providing up to two-thirds of eligible project costs and applicants contributing the remainder.“Diversion of organics reduces GHG emissions and extends the lifespan of landfills,” said Maja Tait, mayor of the District of Sooke and president of the Union of B.C. Municipalities. “This is a substantial investment by the Province that will increase the volume of organics diverted, producing more high-value compost.”The new CleanBC Organic Infrastructure and Collection Program follows the successful implementation of a provincial-federal funding partnership, the Organics Infrastructure Program, which recently provided funding for 13 compost facility projects throughout the province.It is anticipated the program will fund up to 18 organics infrastructure projects and provide up to 86,000 residential units with curbside collection programs. Formal applications can be submitted beginning Oct. 1, 2020, until Jan. 14, 2021. Successful recipients are expected to be announced in June 2021.In addition, B.C. remains committed to preventing food waste through the popular Love Food Hate Waste campaign that helps residents make their food go further with less waste. Uneaten leftovers and spoiled food make up over 25% of the waste discarded from a household. While composting food waste is better than sending it to the landfill, preventing food from being wasted in the first place is the best solution.CleanBC is a shared priority between government, the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and supports a commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.'s emission targets.Quick Facts: Projects to be funded are estimated to result in a reduction, by 2035, of up to 300,000 tonnes of CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent – a standard unit for measuring carbon footprints from different GHGs). This is the same as removing over 105,000 cars from the road for one year. It is estimated seven new jobs are created with every 1,000 tonnes of organics diverted from landfills. Organic waste currently represents 40% of material sent to municipal landfills in B.C. A key target of CleanBC is a reduction of 0.7 megatonnes of GHGs by 2030 through diverting organics from landfills, converting organic waste into useful products and capturing methane to be used as a cleaner fuel source.

Criminal jury trials resumed on Sept. 8, 2020.Under this temporary suspension, civil jury trials will resume on Oct. 4, 2021, with any trial taking place before this date to be heard by a judge alone. In addition, neither plaintiffs nor defendants will be permitted to adjourn cases to a later date in order to have the matter heard by a jury, unless the court orders otherwise.This change effectively extends the direction by the chief justice of the Supreme Court of B.C. to cancel civil jury trials up to and including January 1, 2021. Other provinces, including Alberta and Saskatchewan, have also temporarily suspended civil jury trials as a result of COVID-19.The suspension of civil jury trials will help to minimize any delays arising from the impact of additional safety measures required in courts as a result of COVID-19, such as the need to find alternative locations or rearrange rooms to allow for physical distancing, installing plexiglass barriers and hand wash stations in the courthouse, and carrying out enhanced cleaning and regular health screenings.Quotes:David Eby, Attorney General –“As we resume operations in B.C. courts under this ‘new normal,’ we must do all we can to work through the backlog of cases and give individuals access to justice in a timely manner. We have made these changes in consultation with key sector stakeholders, working together to find the best way forward with civil jury trials in British Columbia while adapting our court system to keep individuals safe during the pandemic.”Craig Ferris, president, Law Society of British Columbia –“While civil jury trials are fundamental to our justice system, the extraordinary circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted access to our courts and introduced pressures that require exceptional measures. The law society supports this temporary initiative as a way of ensuring the public can still have their cases heard while everyone works through this current crisis.”Jennifer Brun, president, Canadian Bar Association, British Columbia Branch –“Over the coming months, we must all adapt to this new reality by following the advice and recommendations of our provincial health officer. That holds true in our courts too, and we support the extraordinary measure of suspending civil jury trials for a year to keep those in our justice system safe during this pandemic.”Learn More:The order-in-council suspending civil jury trials will be posted on BC Laws: www.bclaws.ca/    "

The Foundation Agreement provides real immediate benefits today for our Nation and its members. It also outlines how we will work together to fully enact Aboriginal rights and title. I’m thankful to the Chiefs before me who have gotten us here. Standing on the shoulders of our ancestors, present and future generations of Lake Babine Nation members will reach new heights that the Foundation Agreement enables,” said Chief Gordon Alec of Lake Babine Nation.Chief Alec, Scott Fraser, B.C.’s Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation, and Carolyn Bennett, federal Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations, joined together by videoconference to sign the Lake Babine Nation Foundation Agreement and celebrate the beginning of the journey it represents.“The Foundation Agreement with Lake Babine Nation is ambitious, comprehensive and puts us all on a path to reconciliation and a better future,” said Premier John Horgan. “Guided by the principles in the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act, it is an exciting example of the new and innovative agreements B.C. is creating in collaboration with First Nations and the federal government. Together, we’re finding solutions that are more flexible and better address the vision First Nations have for their own futures.”The agreement provides immediate land and financial benefits totalling approximately $200 million, while setting the stage to negotiate further agreements, such as self-government and Aboriginal title. It provides a roadmap for how Lake Babine Nation and the provincial and federal governments will work together to implement Lake Babine self-governance, boost economic development, collaborate on major land and resource decisions and promote community health and well-being. It sets out a series of commitments, with both early actions and areas for longer-term work, that build on each other in stages.The Foundation Agreement provides a comprehensive and transformative 20-year vision and framework. It is the beginning of the path forward to implement Lake Babine Nation’s vision of self-determination: a prosperous, self-sufficient, healthy, unified and self-governing Nation. This, in turn, will help develop strong, long-lasting relationships between Lake Babine Nation, the Crown, local government and industry.“This agreement advances reconciliation, renews our relationship and breaks down colonial structures. Our work to renew and transform our relationship with Lake Babine Nation based on the affirmation of rights, respect, co-operation and partnership helps to build a fairer Canada,” Bennett said. “This agreement charts the path forward to implement Lake Babine Nation’s vision of self-determination and promote social and community well-being, regional economic growth and implementation of rights and title. At this time, when the pandemic has magnified systemic issues and long-standing inequities, today’s signing is a welcome example of acknowledging the progress that can be made in closing those gaps by furthering self-determination.“Canada and the Province of B.C. support Lake Babine Nation’s vision of a new self-governance model founded on the Nation’s Indigenous laws, customs and practices that empowers Lake Babine Nation to meet their current political, social and economic needs and aspirations. Resources to support the development of such systems are part of the agreement. It also provides a collaborative path to implement Lake Babine Nation Aboriginal title through constructive dialogue.“We are breaking new ground with this agreement, moving beyond the denial of Indigenous rights into a new government-to-government relationship that fosters transformative change in our relationship with Lake Babine Nation, makes a real difference on the ground for Lake Babine members and brings stability and prosperity to everyone in the region,” Fraser said. “Our focus is to build on the positive relationships Lake Babine Nation has developed with neighbouring communities and the business and natural resource sectors, so we can all work together in a sustainable way to grow the regional economy and create jobs.”Forestry is an economic pillar in the northern central interior of B.C. The agreement will increase Lake Babine Nation’s participation in the sector and provide an economic boost for the entire region. Funding will also help support and strengthen social program delivery in areas such as children and family services, education and language, and justice programs. This reconciliation agreement advances self-determination and self-government by working toward Lake Babine Nation assuming direct control and responsibility for service delivery jurisdiction.“The agreement will enhance Lake Babine Nation’s participation in the forest sector so that they can directly benefit from forest resources in the area, and it will also provide an economic boost for the entire region.,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development.The Foundation Agreement offers an innovative new model for future agreements across B.C. and a concrete example of how the Province and Canada are working with Nations to put the principles of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples into practice.Quick Facts: The Foundation Agreement includes an initial set of benefits valued at about $200 million: $43 million in funding and 20,000 hectares of land valued at approximately $150 million. The agreement commits the parties to further negotiations to recognize and implement Lake Babine Nation rights, including self-determination and Aboriginal title. Lake Babine Nation is comprised of five communities, Old Fort, Tachet, Fort Babine, Woyenne, and Donald’s Landing, and over 2,500 citizens.

About $1.36 million has been earmarked for rent forgiveness, which benefits 592 Land Act tenure holders and 443 Park Act permit holders.“We want to help people who own or run outdoor recreation companies, because they are important to rural economies and they’ve been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “By offering rent relief, we hope that they can continue to contribute to the well-being of remote communities throughout British Columbia.”Many commercial recreation operators in backcountry areas of Crown land have continued to be significantly impacted by travel restrictions and other factors during the COVID-19 pandemic.“B.C.’s world-renowned and much-valued parks system is important to the economic health of rural and remote communities, providing opportunities for tourism and commercial recreation activities, in addition to increasingly welcome outdoor recreation for British Columbians and visitors,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “The pandemic-related travel restrictions have severely impacted many commercial park operators who have been asking for relief. By forgiving rents, we are responding to the needs of these businesses that continue to offer safe and healthy outdoor experiences in our provincial parks during these challenging times.”How it works: This rent forgiveness is aimed at commercial recreation operators whose primary purpose is outdoor recreation activities, with ancillary uses related to transportation, accommodation or food and beverage. Eligible holders of commercial recreation tenures and park-use permits (under the Land Act and Park Act) will have one year of annual base rent (owed to the provincial government) waived for invoice due dates between May 1, 2020, and April 30, 2021. Tenure and permit holders who are eligible for rent forgiveness will receive a notification letter. Tenure holders and permit holders who pay Land Act or Park Act “client days” rent, with invoice dates between May 2020 and April 2021, will receive rent forgiveness for their base rent (e.g., $500 for a licence of occupation), but not for client day rent. (Note: “client day” rent typically is $1 to $6 for each client participating in a guided adventure activity within a 24-hour period.) Although rent forgiveness will not apply to client day rent for guiding, an interest-free payment plan agreement is available to tenure holders for at least six months to help address the financial impacts of the pandemic. Tenure holders are encouraged to contact staff in their local ministry lands office for more information. Rent forgiveness does not apply to rent that is based on revenue sharing, such as: client days for guiding (tenures under Part B of the Adventure Tourism Policy) all-season/ski resorts (under the All-Season Resort Policy or the BC Parks Ski Resort Policy)  “B.C.’s tourism industry is among our province’s biggest economic drivers and has been one of the hardest hit by the pandemic. We are helping all aspects of this important industry respond, recover and work towards resiliency following COVID-19,” said Lisa Beare, Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture. “This initiative will provide financial relief to eligible tenure and permit holders adversely affected by the pandemic.”The B.C. government will continue to monitor the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the commercial recreation sector over the coming months.“With the announcement of a one-year rent forgiveness package for eligible commercial recreation businesses, the Adventure Tourism Coalition would like to thank the B.C. government for its recognition of the important role that our industry plays in the socio-economic well-being of British Columbia, particularly in our rural areas,” said Brad Harrison, chair of the Adventure Tourism Coalition. “The COVID-19 crisis has hit our sector extremely hard.

I would like to acknowledge in particular the work by former Chief of the Lower Nicola Indian Band, and our past chair of Spayum Holdings LP, Aaron Sumexheltza,” said Jordan Joe, Chief of the Shackan Indian Band and a director with Spayum Holdings Limited Partnership.The lands will be transferred via Spayum Holdings, a consolidated development corporation owned by the five Nicola Valley First Nations. Spayum anticipates investing $40 million and creating hundreds of permanent and temporary jobs during development of the site. The development will also reopen the landmark Merritt Gateway rest stop for travellers on the Coquihalla Highway.“Supporting the Nicola Chiefs in this important business opportunity will benefit residents and visitors to the Nicola Valley, and is a positive example of our government's efforts to advance reconciliation with the Nicola Valley First Nations through new economic development opportunities,"" said Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. “This important step strengthens our government-to-government relationship with the Nicola Valley First Nations, creates job opportunities for members within their communities and shares in the prosperity of the province.”The parcel, known as the Gateway 286 lands, is key to the First Nations’ development strategy, which will support the economic and social health of the Nations, help build community strength and well-being and promote the First Nations’ culture and history.“We continue to strengthen our government's relationship with the Nicola First Nations, as part of our commitment to support economic and social development priorities,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “We look forward to continuing to strengthen that relationship through further opportunities and collaboration to foster regional prosperity.”The Coldwater Indian Band, Lower Nicola Indian Band, Nooaitch Indian Band, Shackan Indian Band and Upper Nicola Indian Band, as a collective of local First Nations, sought the transfer of the Gateway lands for more than two decades. Completing the transfer affirms the Province’s commitment to support the Nicola Valley First Nations in the important business opportunity they are pursuing at the Gateway lands.In March 2019, Premier John Horgan signed a letter of commitment to work collaboratively with the Nicola Valley First Nations on economic development, including transferring the Gateway 286 lands. The land transfer process under the Land Act, including public consultation and consultation with neighbouring First Nations, has been completed.The site previously held the Merritt tourism information centre, which closed in January 2018. The land transfer and development plan for the property is supported by the City of Merritt.“The City of Merritt is pleased to come together in partnership with the local Nicola Valley Indigenous communities to welcome this transfer of land at Exit 286.

Once the UPCC opens in November 2020, it will be located at 100 – 4420 Chatterton Way.“People in the Saanich community have told me that they need more access to primary care,” Lana Popham, MLA for Saanich South. “This urgent and primary care centre in North Quadra will give residents better access to team-based urgent and primary care, closer to home. I am proud that our government is listening to people and creating meaningful solutions that will make life easier and healthier for all.”It is anticipated that the health-care team will include family physicians, nurse practitioners, registered nurses and allied health professionals. Once fully staffed, the team will serve thousands of residents and will work to connect patients without a consistent family physician or nurse practitioner to one at the centre or in the community.The North Quadra UPCC will offer urgent and ongoing team-based care and virtual care to people who need to see a health-care provider, but do not require the emergency department.It will also provide seamless access to patient information across sites and will proactively improve care, using data. The UPCC is also expected to provide extended hours of operation.This is the 20th urgent and primary care centre to be announced under the government’s primary care strategy and the fifth to be announced in the Island Health region.The first centre is located in Langford and has surpassed 47,000 patient visits since opening in November 2018.The second centre in Nanaimo has served more than 36,000 patient visits since opening in September 2019. The third is in James Bay in Victoria, and has served more than 5,000 patient visits since opening in April 2020. The fourth one to be announced was the Esquimalt centre, which is scheduled to open in late spring 2021.To further improve access to primary health-care services in the Island Health region, the Province has also established nurse practitioner primary care clinics in Nanaimo and Victoria.Quotes:Leah Hollins, board chair, Island Health – “The urgent and primary care centre in North Quadra will have a positive impact on all those living in the community and surrounding area who are looking for local, same-day access to health-care services. It will mean a team of health professionals working together at one location to provide same-day care and, for those who do not have a care provider, facilitate connections to primary care to better support their immediate and long-term care needs.” Dr. Kathleen Ross, president, Doctors of BC – “We look forward to the integration of the North Quadra UPCC in hopes it will strengthen primary care in the community and ensure people there have access to the health care services they need while also supporting long-term relationships between patients and their family doctor.”Michael Sandler, executive director, Nurses and Nurse Practitioners of BC —“Nurses and Nurse Practitioners of BC are pleased to see that the knowledge, skills and expertise of the entire health-care team will be utilized to improve access to health care for all British Columbians through urgent and primary care clinics. We believe that this approach will be pivotal in ensuring B.C. families can access health-care services, and we are excited to see the opening of another urgent and primary care clinic in B.C.”Dr. Vanessa Young, South Island Division of Family Practice – “The South Island Division of Family Practice is pleased that one of the next urgent and primary care centres will open in North Quadra. We anticipate these new resources and funding for longitudinal primary care will help address a twenty-year long crisis in our south island communities. As a key resource in advancing our primary care future within South Island Division communities; we look forward to continuing to work closely with our health authority, Ministry of Health, First Nations and patient partners on a meaningful stakeholder engagement process to ensure the UPCC delivers on its promise of improved local health-care services in line with community needs.”Drs. Tim Troughton and Katharine McKeen, co-chairs, Victoria Division of Family Practice –“The Victoria Division of Family Practice is pleased that a majority of the new resources and funding for the North Quadra UPCC is directed to longitudinal primary care. We look forward to working closely with all our partners to make sure the new UPCC will address community needs and improve access to regular, ongoing care as well as urgent same-day and after-hours care.”Quick Facts: Primary care is the day-to-day health care given by a health-care provider. Urgent primary care is the care that people need within 12 to 24 hours, for conditions such as sprains, urinary problems, ear infections, minor cuts or burns. Urgent and primary care centres are part of a comprehensive strategy to transform B.C.’s health system by bringing together and co-ordinating with health-care providers, services and programs to make it easier for people to access care, receive followup and connect to other services they may need.

Similar to clinics led by family doctors, it will provide patients with more opportunities to get attached to a primary care provider and to receive the care they need when they need it the most.“We are implementing innovative ways to give people more access to primary health-care services. Nurse practitioners are part of B.C.’s primary care strategy and work together with doctors and other health-care professionals to improve the primary care system in the province,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “This is the third nurse practitioner primary care clinic that we are establishing under our strategy and the first in Victoria. These clinics will connect more people with the care they need, closer to home.”The clinic is undergoing renovations and has begun gradually registering area residents without a primary care provider since Aug. 10. In the first two weeks, the clinic received over 1,000 registration requests. People who do not have a primary care provider and who live within the clinic’s catchment area can become a patient by completing a registration form.As of Sept. 10, more than 550 patients and families have been registered and are able to book virtual primary care appointments with clinic nurse practitioners. In-person and same-day, team-based primary care appointments will be available at 1139 Yates St. once renovations are complete.Health Care on Yates is open for virtual care appointments Monday to Friday 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Once renovated, hours will expand to Monday to Thursday, 8:30 a.m. to 8 p.m., Fridays 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and Saturdays from 8:30 a.m. to noon. Currently, six full-time equivalent (FTE) nurse practitioners are employed by the clinic. When fully staffed, the clinic will include registered nurses, a social worker and a mental health and substance use clinician, for a total of 10 FTE health-care staff and four medical office assistants.As a team, they will work to attach approximately 6,800 people without a primary care provider to a nurse practitioner over the next three years and will integrate into a primary care network, along with other primary care clinics in Victoria.“The clinic would not be possible without the dedication of Island Health, Nurses and Nurse Practitioners of BC, and committed local nurse practitioners,” Dix said. “We will continue our collaborative work to make sure that clinics led by nurse practitioners become an integral part of health care throughout the province.”The B.C. government will provide annual operating funding of approximately $2 million when fully staffed, as well as fund one-time startup costs of $445,500.This is the third nurse practitioner primary care clinic in B.C. and the second to be announced on Vancouver Island. The first clinic opened in Nanaimo in June 2020 and the second opened in Surrey in September 2020.Learn More:To learn more about the Province’s primary health-care strategy, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018PREM0034-001010To learn more about the Province’s strategy to increase the number of nurse practitioners, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018HLTH0034-000995To learn more about the Province’s strategy to recruit and retain more family medicine graduates, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018HLTH0052-001043Two backgrounders follow.

These programs are helping to build and expand language skills so our children can grow and succeed during their school years and beyond.”The 2020 Vancouver Sun’s Raise-a-Reader week 2020 will run from Sept. 18-25. The annual, week-long campaign supports literacy by increasing awareness and raising money to fund community-based programs throughout B.C. This campaign highlights the importance of literacy development when families read, play and learn together.Some of the literacy programs offered in B.C. communities include: book walks, parent-child Mother Goose programs, Books for Babies, family language carnivals, parent-child reading workshops (Come Read with Me), one-on-one tutoring, book purchases, literacy kits and writing workshops for youth. The programs are offered in a variety of settings including parks, community centres, libraries and schools.This year on Sept. 22, Decoda Literacy Solutions has created a team trivia challenge where British Columbians can donate, join a team and play trivia online through Zoom, Google Hangouts, Facebook messenger or text message.Examples of B.C. community programs that benefit from Raise-a-Reader funds include: Castlegar - The Columbia Basin Alliance for Literacy co-ordinated the funds to support programs like Mother Goose with the Circle of Indigenous Nations Society: stories, rhymes, songs and cultural teachings were offered, as well as a chance to meet other parents and Elders in the community. Quesnel - The Literacy Society used Raise-a-Reader funds for five programs, including community storytelling sessions where parents, caregivers and children attended nine, two-hour interactive sessions to learn age-appropriate storytelling and craft-making skills. Kamloops - The Comfort, Play, Teach program was held at Kamloops Immigrant Services, a family literacy program that builds literacy skills and family connections. Lower Mainland - The Canucks for Kids Education Centre used Raise-a-Reader funds for the Get Ready 2 Read (GR2R) program. The GR2R program is a child- and-adult-focused family literacy program, delivered in several settings and locations in partnership with Britannia Community Services Centre and Edmonds and Maywood Community schools in Vancouver. “Raise-a-Reader helps children and families across B.C. develop the literacy skills they need to succeed at home, at school and in the community,” said Margaret Sutherland, executive director, Decoda Literacy Solutions. “And today, literacy matters more than ever. We are grateful to the Province of B.C. for its ongoing support for Raise-a-Reader and to the many individual donors who support the campaign each year.”Raise-a-Reader was launched by the Vancouver Sun in 1997. Since 2009, the total provincial investment is nearly $6 million in support of literacy programs offered through public libraries, Indigenous organizations, community literacy organizations, schools and family resource centres. The government’s $500,000 investment flows through Decoda Literacy Solutions, the only provincewide literacy organization in B.C., to community programs throughout the province.“The Vancouver Sun’s Raise-a-Reader program recognizes that literacy is a critical tool in helping to lift children and families out of poverty,” said Harold Munro, editor-in-chief, Vancouver Sun. ""We are grateful to the provincial government and commend them for, once again, joining with us in this campaign to improve lives across B.C. Their generous donation and the many contributions from other institutions and Sun readers, truly make a difference.”Quick Facts: Since 1997, the campaign has raised more than $18 million for literacy initiatives in B.C. During the annual Raise-a-Reader Week, the campaign features daily stories in the Vancouver Sun’s print and online editions highlighting community literacy programs. This year, people can donate to the campaign through the Canada Helps website, supported by the Decoda Literacy Foundation. Last year, over 17,500 children, parents and caregivers attended 3,500 family literacy sessions made possible with support from Raise-a-Reader, in addition to thousands of books and learning materials distributed to family literacy programs, schools and libraries around B.C.

The Umbrella Multicultural Health Co-op Community Health Centre is managed by the Umbrella Co-op, a non-profit organization that services a specialized population of immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers. Fraser Health, among other partners, supported Umbrella Co-op with planning for the newly expanded centre as part of the Province’s overall primary care strategy.“Our primary care strategy provides increased and improved access to everyday health care to people throughout the province, like those living in New Westminster,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “We’ve listened to the people experiencing difficulties in accessing primary care, and we are enhancing services in Umbrella Co-op as part of our primary care strategy, making sure that no one is left behind.”Located at 715 Carnarvon St., Umbrella Co-op has 4.74 full-time equivalent (FTE) health-care providers. This includes general practitioners and cross-cultural health brokers who provide primary health care for approximately 400 patients every year. Cross-cultural health brokers are the first point of contact for patients who need to access services, but require some support to do so. They provide language interpretation, bridge cultural gaps between physicians and patients, help patients navigate the health-care system and support patients to access social services and programs that address social determinants of health, including housing, poverty, language barriers, social isolation and food security.As part of B.C.’s primary care strategy, Umbrella Co-op will partner with Fraser Health to recruit 4.86 FTE additional health professionals over the next three years, including nurse practitioners, registered nurses, a social worker, a counsellor, a physiotherapist, a clinical lead and an additional 4.67 FTE cross-cultural health brokers. These new hires will support Umbrella Co-op to provide team-based, comprehensive longitudinal primary care, as well as increase existing health services that respect the diversity of culture and language in the community.Once fully staffed, the centre will also provide services such as longitudinal care, physiotherapy, clinical counselling and a social determinants of health program. In addition, the existing mobile clinic service supporting Spanish-speaking migrant farm workers in the Fraser Valley will expand to travel once per week to isolated communities.The team of health-care providers is expected to provide more than 25,000 patient visits per year and will work to attach more than 1,800 patients to a consistent primary care provider at the centre or in the community.“We know immigrants and newcomers in New Westminster and across the Lower Mainland do not have access to consistent everyday health care in a culturally appropriate way,” said Judy Darcy, MLA for New Westminster and Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “That’s why I am proud that our government is making a difference in minority communities by bringing Umbrella Co-op into B.C.’s primary care strategy. Thanks to new supports from the Province, more people experiencing language and cultural barriers will receive the care they need.”The additional supports will be implemented starting in December 2020. By next year, the community health centre will operate seven days a week, serving patients with extended hours and more access.To support the improvements of the Umbrella Co-op Community Health Centre, the Province will provide annual funding of $1.66 million when fully established, as well as $271,000 of one-time funding.Umbrella Co-op is the third Community Health Centre in B.C. to be announced as part of the Province’s primary care strategy and the second one in Metro Vancouver. In June 2020, RISE Community Health Centre opened its main location in Vancouver.Quotes:Dr. Victoria Lee, president and CEO, Fraser Health – “The Umbrella Multicultural Health Co-op Community Health Centre plays an integral role in community-based services in New Westminster, as they provide integrated, people-centred care that reflects the broader determinants of care. The clinic plays an invaluable role in our community in ensuring newcomers and other vulnerable populations have comprehensive supports needed to stay well and to manage their health concerns.”Esther Hsieh, executive director, Umbrella Multicultural Health Co-op –“Umbrella Co-op is thrilled that the Ministry of Health supports the community health centre model and recognizes how our organization enhances health equity for racialized ethnocultural communities. We look forward to working with all of our partners, stakeholders and community members to expand our services to better meet the needs of people facing language and cultural barriers in New Westminster and its surrounding areas.”Quick Facts:  Umbrella Multicultural Health Co-op Community Health Centre will be a key clinical service model within the Fraser Northwest, Burnaby and future primary care networks. Together with local primary care networks and communities, the centre will work towards providing accessible, timely, comprehensive and co-ordinated primary health care services for newcomers to Canada located in New Westminster and the surrounding areas. Umbrella Multicultural Health Co-op is a registered charity and is supported through project revenues, private donations and grants. It was incorporated in 2010 and was founded with the administrative support of the BC Multicultural Services Society, an organization dedicated to promoting access to health care and health equity for immigrants and refugees. There are approximately 100 health authority-run community health centres and 30 community-governed community health centres in British Columbia. These centres focus on integrating services and programs in primary care, health promotion and community well-being. They also work to address social determinants of health by linking with other social-sector agencies and services.

This a period of hope, new beginnings and reflections on the past year, which also marks the 5,781st year of the Hebrew calendar.“Rosh Hashanah gatherings and services won’t be the same this year. Families and friends will be celebrating differently, by connecting to their synagogue virtually or having dinner within their small household bubbles. But the spirit of this time of year remains the same.“The Jewish new year is a day of celebration and reminds us to reflect on our common values and what connects us, rather than what divides us.“On behalf of British Columbians, I send best wishes to everyone celebrating Rosh Hashanah.“L’shanah tovah u’metukah!”For French and Hebrew translations: http://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020PREM0088-001779#translations    "

The site is large enough to allow for a future expansion to meet the needs of K-12 francophone students in that community.The CSF has been operating École Collines-d’Or, an elementary francophone school, in the existing facility on a short-term lease from the Kamloops-Thompson School District. The facility has an operating capacity of 88. Last year’s enrolment for grades K-8 was 87 students.“We are very pleased with this announcement, which will further the CSF’s mission by providing stability for francophone students in Kamloops,” said Marie-Pierre Lavoie, president, CSF Board of Trustees. “The CSF is delighted that the collaboration with the Ministry of Education and the Kamloops-Thompson School District has allowed the CSF to acquire a school site so that it can begin planning for the facilities required to provide K-12 francophone education.”The primary school was built for School District 73 in 1981. The one-storey building includes four classrooms, a staff room, administration office space and an activity room. The school was closed by the Kamloops-Thompson School District in 2006 due to declining student enrolment.This investment is part of the Province’s work to provide equal educational opportunities to francophone students in British Columbia. The Ministry of Education is also working with the CSF to fund and acquire school sites for francophone students in identified communities throughout the Province.Earlier this year, government provided $11.5 million for the CSF to buy property in Penticton for École Entre-Lacs so French-speaking students in that community could have a permanent home for their education.The CSF also opened the new École des Pionniers-de-Maillardville in Port Coquitlam, another facility that will provide a permanent home for francophone education. The new school was completed in 2019.Quotes:Rhonda Kershaw, chair, Kamloops-Thompson Board of Education –“We are pleased to be in a position to sell Oak Hills Elementary to Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique in support of both the francophone school district and the Ministry of Education. The SD73 board wants to acknowledge the ministry’s significant capital investment in the Valleyview Secondary expansion, and we are encouraged other Kamloops projects are high on the priority list for additional capital investment in our district.”Suzana Straus, présidente de la Fédération des parents francophones de Colombie-Britannique –“The acquisition of École Collines-d’Or by the CSF now makes it possible to create a space in which students can develop and grow throughout their school years. We also hope that in the future, this site will be able to accommodate classes up to Grade 12, as well as early childhood services for francophone families in Kamloops. The support from the Ministry of Education is a step in the right direction in recognizing the educational needs of the province’s francophones.”For a French translation: http://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020EDUC0069-001768#translations    "

Today’s announcement shows our government is taking action on much-needed improvements.”Identifying property required for future infrastructure improvements along the Highway 99 corridor does not mean that the preferred solution for the crossing has been determined. That decision will be made by government following the business case review.  In the interim, safety improvements are underway inside the existing tunnel for drivers who use this route every day. As part of a suite of $40 million in improvements to the existing tunnel, lights on the tunnel walls and ceiling are being converted to an LED standard to increase visibility and better illuminate the tunnel for drivers, save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Tunnel drainage is being improved to prevent ice buildup and water from pooling at the entrances. The ventilation and electrical systems will also be upgraded. These additional safety improvements are scheduled to be complete by spring 2021.Learn More:For more information, visit: https://engage.gov.bc.ca/masseytunnel/    "

It connects people to school, work, as well as important attractions and services on Vancouver Island. Our investments in improved road safety also make it easier for pedestrians and cyclists to get around whether they’re commuting or staying active,” said Catherine McKenna, federal Minister of Infrastructure and Communities. “Canada’s Infrastructure plan invests in thousands of projects, creates jobs across Canada and builds stronger communities.”With the recent opening of central components of the project, such as the McKenzie Avenue exit loop ramp and free-flowing traffic on Highway 1, people are experiencing shorter morning and afternoon commutes – especially those who live in Langford, Colwood and Sooke – and work in Victoria.“The traffic congestion at this intersection had long been a source of frustration,” said Claire Trevena, B.C.’s Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “People are now saving time on their commutes, and transit users and those who cycle are also benefiting from improvements made.”The new interchange significantly improves safety and reduces traffic congestion for drivers, transit users, pedestrians and cyclists. Cyclists and pedestrians are already benefiting from the new Galloping Goose Trail Bridge that crosses McKenzie Avenue, allowing people to choose active transportation for their commutes or recreation.The dual right turn on-ramp from McKenzie Avenue to Highway 1 North has opened, reducing traffic congestion on McKenzie during peak periods. Bus priority lanes will soon be open, improving travel times for people using transit.“On behalf of Langford residents, we are excited to see the substantial completion of the McKenzie Interchange project,” said Stew Young, mayor of Langford. “This project will significantly decrease commute times, allowing Langford residents to get home faster to spend more time with their families and loved ones.”Previously, the Highway 1-McKenzie intersection had been the number 1 bottleneck in the province outside of the Lower Mainland. In December 2019, the Trans-Canada Highway opened to free-flow traffic, which dramatically cut down on the commute times for people. Now the partial cloverleaf designed loop ramp is complete, making this an even quicker and easier drive.“We’re grateful for the continuous improvements the Province is making in our transportation infrastructure between Colwood and other areas of our region,” said Rob Martin, mayor of Colwood. “These improvements do more than move cars. They allow people to spend less time in traffic and more time with their families and enjoying other activities that promote well-being.”The project also provides safety benefits for students at nearby schools, who no longer need to walk along the shoulder of the busy Trans-Canada Highway or cross the highway at a traffic signal to get to and from school.Work on the stormwater treatment pond and final landscaping is continuing through the fall. People who travel through the intersection will still see active construction as the final pieces of the project are finished. Drivers are asked to continue to observe the direction of traffic control personnel and signage through the construction site.Making investments to improve active transportation is part of the B.C. government’s Active Transportation Strategy, Move. Commute. Connect. The strategy supports the government’s commitment to ensure new bridges and interchanges are designed to make walking, cycling and transit safe and convenient. The strategy is part of CleanBC, a plan to help transform how people move around, while encouraging more active transportation in communities. CleanBC is a pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. CleanBC was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s emission targets.Provincial construction sites have protocols and policies in place following the requirements of the provincial health officer to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. These measures include physical distancing and other protocols to ensure worker and public safety.Quick Facts: The Highway 1 McKenzie Interchange Project is a grade-separated interchange on the Trans-Canada Highway at the intersection with Admirals Road and McKenzie Avenue in Saanich. The project included: construction of a new interchange at the intersection of Highway 1 and Admirals Road/McKenzie Avenue; realignment and widening of the Galloping Goose Trail with a new pedestrian/cyclist bridge over McKenzie Avenue; a new multi-use bridge over Highway 1 to link to the upgraded Galloping Goose Trail; and upgraded transit facilities with dedicated transit lanes.  The total cost of the Highway 1 Admirals Road/McKenzie interchange is $96 million.

72,2020-09-18 05:45:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020EDUC0071-001798,Government Website,Strong in-class student participation for September restart,"  As the first full week of school comes to a close, early attendance numbers show more than 85% of K-12 public school students returned for in-class learning, with increased staffing and supports, according to a Ministry of Education survey.“It’s been incredible to see so many students being able to connect with their teachers, support staff and classmates again, and that school districts developed remote options for other students across B.C.,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “Both as a parent and as Minister of Education, I’m grateful to educators and staff for the innovation, collaboration and hard work that went into getting schools ready for this safe restart, with local solutions to meet the specific needs of students and families.”  The Ministry of Education surveyed school districts and independent schools to find out what investments they were making and how they were supporting students and staff during the pandemic. To date, 44 public school districts and 129 independent schools have reported to the ministry.  In the summer, Fleming directed school districts to connect with families in their community to determine their return to school plans – and to confirm if they planned for their child to attend school classes. As part of this, all school boards were given the authority to offer remote options to students within their districts, as well as the tools needed to increase their existing programs to meet any demand. If a family needed alternative learning options, school districts were expected to work with families to provide remote options that keep children connected to their school communities.Every school is following the strict provincial health and safety guidelines co-developed for K-12 with the teachers, school leaders, the Office of the Provincial Health Officer, parents and Indigenous rightsholders. Each district is using additional provincial and federal funding to meet its local needs and configurations of its schools.In preparation for the September restart, many school districts hired staff and added staff hours. Of the school districts that have responded to date, 1,526 new positions have been created: 624 additional teachers hired in 34 school districts and 157,000 additional staff hours; 73 educational assistants hired in 12 school districts and 5,100 additional staff hours; 542 custodial staff in 38 school districts hired and 386,000 additional staff hours; and 287 positions such as school counsellors, bus drivers or administrative staff in 23 school districts and 38,000 additional staff hours. To support students who are either learning remotely, or for secondary students in some regions who are having a blend of online and in-class learning, districts created locally developed programs and made investments in new technology. Thousands of laptops and tablets have been purchased for remote or online learning. School District 39 (Vancouver) used restart funding to purchase 2,000 devices for students, School District 61 (Greater Victoria) purchased 1,660 new devices and School District 44 (North Vancouver) purchased 1,100 devices.As part of implementing the health and safety guidelines, there are over 20,400 hand-sanitizing stations available for students and staff. Of the survey respondents, 88% upgraded their air filtration systems.    The ministry has also provided funding for 1.5 million non-medical masks, enough for every public-school staff member and student to have at least two masks. To date, respondents of the survey have purchased more than 2.1 million items of personal protective equipment (PPE), including transparent masks for hearing-impaired people and face shields for staff. In addition, Canadian Shield has donated an additional 54,500 face shields for K-12 schools in B.C. This adds to the inventory of PPE that will be available for students and staff.To support families, funding has allowed districts like School District 61 (Greater Victoria) to expand the number of students receiving meal programs, and School District 59 (Peace River South) brought in family support workers to assess the needs of families living in remote communities, ensuring they are connected to meal programs close to home.School districts also created local solutions for mental health support. School District 71 (Comox Valley), has added four youth and family counsellors, provided trauma-informed training for all staff, created a community resource guide and is hosting a webinar series. School District 62 (Sooke) is providing all staff with trauma-informed training, and it has also implemented a mental health literacy program for secondary students.  The Province is making a first-of-its-kind, made-in-B.C. mouth rinse gargle sample collection available for school-aged students who require a COVID-19 test. This new saline method doesn’t require a health-care professional to collect the sample, and it is intended to encourage more students to get tested if they have symptoms.      Quick Facts: The Province provided $45.6 million for a safe K-12 school restart. To support B.C.’s response, the federal government is also providing up to $242.4 million in one-time funding for the 2020-21 school year, with the first half of the payment in September. B.C.’s Ministry of Education has developed a five-stage approach to operate schools, depending on risk of transmission and guidance from the provincial health officer. This helps school districts know what to expect if there is a significant change to school operations required as part of B.C.’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The mouth rinse sample collection will be offered through local health authorities.

Throughout the pandemic, the ministry consulted extensively with business owners, sector associations and marketing organizations to hear their priorities for recovery and ideas to help British Columbia remain a globally competitive destination. B.C.’s COVID-19 Economic Recovery Plan includes a cross-government approach to help all aspects of the tourism industry recover, create jobs and grow the economy.Investing in the resilience of B.C.’s visitor economy:  A new Tourism Task Force will bring together leaders from business, labour, First Nations and not-for-profits to seek innovative ideas on how to best position the industry for the 2021 season. The Province is allocating $50 million in the Economic Recovery Plan for new measures that result from the task force’s work. The Province will invest $19 million to support small municipalities that are dependent on tourism to build, adapt and diversify their tourism infrastructure. This program will create job opportunities in the communities and prepare for the future. The Province will invest nearly $14 million to support targeted tourism development partnership initiatives in the six tourism regions across B.C. to help the industry recover from COVID-19.  Destination BC will invest an additional $5 million to continue to market British Columbia domestically and secure its spot in the international tourism market. International bookings are often made one year before the date of departure. The new Community Economic Recovery Infrastructure Program will invest $100 million in projects that make life better for locals and improve the experience for visitors. The elements that support the tourism sector include: $20 million for tourism infrastructure projects supporting destination development. Local governments, not-for-profits and Indigenous Nations will be able to apply for project funding to help bring back visitors through investments in tourism infrastructure and amenities in communities; $20 million to support economic recovery for rural communities; and $20 million for investments in unique heritage infrastructure, including funding for First Nations to repair, renew or develop Indigenous cultural heritage infrastructure.  Investing in businesses and tourism workers: The Province will invest $300 million for Small Business Recovery grants that many tourism-related businesses will be eligible for. This program will enable small businesses to access professional advice and grants to support recovery for companies heavily impacted by the pandemic and most likely to recover. The grant amounts will be scalable based on the size and annual pre COVID-19 revenues of the business, to a maximum of $30,000. Hard-hit tourism operators will be eligible to receive a top up of up to $10,000, for a maximum grant of $40,000 based on overall eligibility criteria. The provincial government estimates that 15,000 small businesses will benefit from the program and help protect more than 200,000 jobs throughout B.C.To spur new growth, effective immediately, government is providing a temporary PST rebate on select machinery and equipment to make it easier for businesses to make the kinds of investments that will allow them to grow and become more productive. Effective Sept. 17, 2020, eligible businesses will receive a 100% PST rebate on select machinery and equipment purchases. This program will run for one year, ending on Sept. 30, 2021. Eligible businesses can recover 100% of the PST they pay on select purchases and leases of machinery and equipment over that period. To be eligible, a business must be incorporated.The provincial government is also implementing a new hiring incentive rebate. Employers that hire new people or bring people back who lost their jobs during the height of the pandemic measures are eligible for a credit equal to 15% of any increase in total payroll paid for the last quarter of 2020. The B.C. Increased Employment Incentive will go to businesses that hire back employees or restore work hours/wages that were reduced as a result of COVID-19. In addition, to ensure the greatest impact on job creation, the benefit is also available to businesses that increase employment even if they may not have been negatively impacted by COVID-19.Recognizing the demand for online services during the pandemic, the provincial government is providing $12 million to support businesses that want to build an online presence, boost their e-commerce operations, or increase their digital marketing capacity. In addition, $2 million will be available to support restaurants, tourism businesses and other types of businesses to create digital marketing tools.As B.C.’s visitor economy starts to rebound, businesses will need access to skilled workers. A new $15 million fund for Indigenous skills training and education will provide opportunities for up to 1,250 Indigenous people whose employment has been impacted by COVID-19. First Nations will be able to access the fund to provide educational programs in their communities, including for tourism skills training. In addition, another $20 million is available for short-term skills training for up to 2,800 people to fill in-demand jobs in the community, region or province with a goal of helping them find employment.The B.C. government is helping eligible outdoor adventure businesses, fishing and hunting lodges, guest ranches, ecotourism lodges, seasonal campgrounds and other commercial recreation operators during the COVID-19 pandemic. Holders of Land Act tenures and Park Act permits that are commercial recreation operators may qualify to have the annual base rent they pay to the government waived for one year. About $1.36 million has been earmarked for rent forgiveness, which benefits 592 Land Act tenure holders and 443 Park Act permit holders.

The Province is investing $26 million to upgrade provincial side roads and forest service roads, and another $26 million in safety improvements to the access road that connects Huu-ay-aht community of Anacla and the nearby village of Bamfield to Port Alberni – opening up new destination development opportunities for these communities.Tourism business owners located outside urban centres identified air access as a key driver of visitation to their communities. The Province is investing nearly $16 million to improve small, rural airports through air access grants.Improving the visitor experience: Visitors are increasingly becoming conscious of their eco-footprint and seeking out destinations that promote active living. The provincial government is investing $17 million to fund projects that improve the safety of transportation networks like local paths and rail trails. BC Parks had record visitation over the summer, and with this level of demand expected to continue in the future, government is investing $5 million in parks infrastructure.In addition, visitors are increasingly expecting to have access to high-speed internet and Wif-Fi at destinations. Expanding connectivity in rural areas not only improves the visitor experience, but also allows business owners to effectively promote their operation and access new markets. The Province will invest $75 million to expand high-speed internet services for rural communities and an additional $15 million to improve Wif-Fi and cellular connectivity along major highways and at key rests stops.Many visitors are attracted to a destination because of its museums, galleries and theatres. The arts and culture sector has also been deeply impacted by the pandemic, threatening the ability of many venues to continue operating. The provincial government is investing $21 million to provide additional relief to the sector over the short term, while helping organizations adapt their operations and artistic practices to the realities of the pandemic.

75,2020-09-17 16:35:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020HLTH0052-001794,Government Website,"Joint statement on B.C.’s COVID-19 response, latest updates","  Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are announcing 165 new cases, including two epi-linked cases, for a total of 7,663 cases in British Columbia.“There are 1,705 active cases of COVID-19 in the province, 2,949 people who are under active public health monitoring as a result of identified exposure to known cases, and 5,719 people who tested positive have recovered.“Currently, 57 individuals are hospitalized with COVID-19, 22 of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 2,714 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 3,937 in the Fraser Health region, 196 in the Island Health region, 489 in the Interior Health region, 241 in the Northern Health region and 86 cases of people who reside outside of Canada.“There has been one new COVID-19 related death, for a total of 220 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There are two new health-care facility outbreaks, one at Delta Hospital and one at Peace Arch Hospital, both in the Fraser Health region. In total, 11 long-term care or assisted-living facilities and five acute-care facilities have active outbreaks.“There has been one new health-care facility outbreak at Delta Hospital in the Fraser Health region. In total, 11 long-term care or assisted-living facilities and four acute-care facilities have active outbreaks.“There have been no new community outbreaks, although there continue to be community exposure events.“Alerts are posted on the BC Centre for Disease Control’s (BCCDC) website, as well as on health authorities’ websites, providing details on where the potential exposure occurred and what actions to take – whether you need to self-isolate or monitor for symptoms.“For schools, public health teams will contact individuals through contact tracing, and schools will continue to issue alerts when a school exposure has occurred and action is required. Supporting these protocols, the BCCDC website and health authorities are also publishing notifications.“COVID-19 requires compromise and give and take. Today, our focus is to have as much as possible open and functioning in our communities – our essential services, workplaces and schools – while limiting our exposure to higher-risk activities and locations.“This give and take is a sacrifice for all of us, but is one that will keep us safe in the weeks and months ahead.“Containing the spread of the virus in our communities is core to our COVID-19 response and that is why getting tested as soon as you have symptoms is so important.“Today, a new made-in-B.C. sample collection program has been launched for all K-12 students across the province. One of the first of its kind worldwide.“For school-aged children four to 19, a mouth-rinse gargle is now available at COVID-19 collection centres around the province. Unlike the nasopharyngeal swab method, this new saline method doesn’t require a health-care professional to collect the sample.“Taking the step to get tested is how you protect your friends and loved ones, and for K-12 students there is now an easier alternative.“Not only is the new method more comfortable for younger people, a B.C. company will provide the collection tube, reducing the province’s dependency on the global supply chain for this sample method.“As well, the restriction on gatherings to no more than 50 people is another protection layer to contain the spread. It is important to remember that 50 people is an upper limit that needs to be scaled down based on the space you are in.“As we have seen, many businesses are only be able to safely accommodate just a few people, and the same applies for our homes – inside or out. Regardless of our location, when socializing with others, smaller is always safer.“The compromise to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe also includes seeing fewer friends and family members, for now.“Our small groups need to be the same small groups. Spending time with different friends on different days significantly increases our personal risk and is a continued source of transmission in our province.“So, when planning our activities, whether is a play date for your kids, or a weekend dinner party, ask yourself if the people are part of your ‘safe six’?“The restrictions and precautions are not forever, but they are needed right now. By stepping back now, we can protect those who are most vulnerable and keep the people we care about safe.“Let’s continue to make to September the month to get ready for the respiratory season, to hold steady with our layers of protection and step back from our social interactions and step forward with the routines that will keep our communities and our loved ones safe.”Quick Facts: Assisted living, long-term care homes and seniors’ rental buildings with ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks are as follows: Vancouver Coastal Health OPAL by Element assisted-living facility Point Grey Private Hospital long-term care facility Royal Arch Masonic Home long-term care facility (second outbreak)  Fraser Health Bear Creek Villa independent-living facility Cherington Place long-term care facility Evergreen Hamlets long-term care facility Kin Village assisted-living facility Milieu Children and Family Services Society community-living facility New Vista Care Home long-term care facility Normanna long-term care facility Rideau Retirement Centre independent-living facility   Learn More:For a listing of the community notifications, including school notifications, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/public-exposuresTo find the provincial health officer’s orders, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topics/covid-19-novel-coronavirusFor the last modelling information presented on Sept. 3, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/COVID19_Going_Forward_Sept_2020.pdfTo see a map of COVID-19 cases by local health area, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/dataIf you are experiencing symptoms, find a collection centre near you to get tested: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testingFor mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca Or: www.anxietycanada.comFor a listing of the community exposure events, go to: BCCDC (flights, work sites, etc.): http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/public-exposures Fraser Health: fraserhealth.ca/covid19exposure Interior Health: https://news.interiorhealth.ca/news/public-exposures/ Island Health: https://www.islandhealth.ca/learn-about-health/covid-19/outbreaks-and-exposures Northern Health: https://www.northernhealth.ca/health-topics/outbreaks-and-exposures Vancouver Coastal: http://www.vch.ca/covid-19/public-exposuresFor the second monthly progress report on B.C.’s surgical renewal plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020_surgical-renewal-commitment-progress-report-June-July-2020.pdfFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/ Or follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19 Or call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit: Facebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews  YouTube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBC    "
76,2020-09-17 14:10:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020PREM0052-001780,Government Website,New plan maps next steps forward in B.C.’s economic recovery,"  Premier John Horgan and Carole James, Minister of Finance, have released Stronger BC for Everyone: BC’s Economic Recovery Plan.The plan outlines the latest steps the Government of British Columbia is taking to help people, businesses and communities recover and come out of COVID-19 stronger and better prepared. B.C.’s total provincial response to the COVID-19 pandemic exceeds $8.25 billion. “As British Columbians, we’ve been through a lot recently. We know our recovery won’t happen overnight, but by focusing on people and taking care of each other, we will ensure there are better days ahead for all of us,” said Premier Horgan. “The steps we are taking now will improve health care, get people back to work, support B.C. businesses and strengthen our neighbourhoods and communities.”British Columbia entered the pandemic as an economic leader in Canada, making it among the best-positioned provinces to support a strong recovery. Since moving forward with a safe restart plan in mid-May, B.C. has had stronger-than-expected consumer spending, housing activity and employment gains. As of August 2020, almost 250,000 jobs had been restored, equal to 62% of the total jobs lost due to the pandemic.“When COVID-19 first hit, we acted quickly to keep people safe and support those in need. While we are now starting to see hopeful signs of recovery, we know many people are still struggling and there is a lot of work left to do,” said James. “British Columbians are pulling together, and we’ll be there to support them every step of the way. Our province has a strong foundation to build a recovery that creates opportunities for all.”The next steps in B.C.’s recovery plan will help build a stronger, more resilient economy for everyone. Making health care better by hiring 7,000 new front-line health-care workers. This includes thousands of health-care aides to manage outbreaks in long-term care homes and 600 contact tracers to help stop further spread in the community. The plan will also increase support for mental health care in the workplace and introduce a new Hospital at Home initiative that will allow patients to receive medical services in their own home from a team of health professionals. Creating jobs and opportunities by investing in targeted and short-term training in the skills people need to get work in high-demand fields, including for those who want to move into new, front-line health, child care and human-service positions. The plan will also expand Indigenous skills training and accelerate the creation of affordable child-care spaces so that more parents, particularly women, can get back to work. It includes investments of over $100 million to support tourism-related businesses and communities.     Helping businesses grow and rehire with a 15% refundable tax credit based on eligible new payroll. It will also introduce a small- and medium-sized business recovery grant to support approximately 15,000 hard-hit businesses, while protecting as many as 200,000 jobs. Tourism operators will be eligible for a special top-up. The plan will also provide a temporary 100% PST rebate on select machinery and equipment to make it easier for eligible businesses to make the kinds of investments that will allow them to grow and become more productive.  Supporting strong communities by investing over $400 million to revitalize community infrastructure and support local governments to provide the valuable services people depend on. This includes $100 million in infrastructure grants for shovel-ready projects that will create jobs right away. The plan also earmarks over $1 billion in provincial and federal investments to help keep people moving, whether by transit, TransLink or BC Ferries. An additional $540 million in combined federal/provincial funding will help B.C. communities address other local challenges impacted by COVID-19. The plan includes $1.5 billion in economic recovery spending measures that respond to immediate needs. This money was earmarked for recovery spending in the spring. It is in addition to $660 million in tax measures and more than $1.86 billion in federal and provincial restart funding for municipalities, transit and education. It also builds on B.C.’s record $22-billion investment in public infrastructure over the next three years. Those capital projects are estimated to create 100,000 direct and indirect jobs over the life of the projects.The next steps in B.C.’s recovery plan build on the progress it has made with new investments to support programs that will help expand CleanBC, reduce air pollution and tackle climate change, while preparing for its impacts and creating good, new jobs.In developing the plan, B.C. engaged nearly 50,000 British Columbians in every region of the province, to hear their priorities and ideas through online surveys and virtual or telephone town halls. Premier Horgan and James also convened a series of meetings with business, labour and Indigenous groups, economists, youth, green technology experts, faith leaders and many more. The plan reflects what the Government of B.C. heard during these extensive public consultations.The BC Green Party caucus was consulted on the development of this plan, which builds on shared priorities in the Confidence and Supply Agreement, including creating jobs, acting on climate change and building a sustainable economy that works for people.Learn More:Find out more and download the full report at: https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/Find out more about the public engagement at: https://engage.gov.bc.ca/recoveryideas/    "
77,2020-09-17 13:15:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020AEST0054-001770,Government Website,Province invests in mass timber project for new student housing,"  Students attending the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) in the coming years will have access to hundreds of new, affordable and environmentally friendly on-campus housing beds.“Students throughout the province have told our government the lack of affordable housing has stood in the way of their education and aspirations, and we committed to fixing this problem,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “Building these new homes is answering a call to action from students and communities to support innovation and create more affordable, cleaner and greener housing.”On Thursday, Sept. 17, 2020, Mark announced the new student housing project at BCIT, valued at nearly $115 million. The Province is investing $108.8 million towards BCIT’s new student housing project as part of government’s 30-point plan on housing. BCIT is contributing $6 million towards this project. The plan includes a BC Student Housing Loan Program for public post-secondary institutions that provides access to funds to help finance student housing projects over six years. This project will be the first investment in new student housing beds at BCIT in 38 years.The investment will support the construction of a 464-bed, 12-storey student housing project at BCIT’s Burnaby campus. The project will be designed to reflect Indigenous culture in the region, and to support Indigenous learners by providing community spaces on the ground floor. The new building will be constructed using mass timber, a sustainable product that is cost effective, quicker to build and has a lower carbon footprint compared to traditional concrete construction.“Mass timber is key to diversifying and creating a more resilient forest sector as we work to transition to high-value over high-volume production,” said Ravi Kahlon, Parliamentary Secretary for Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “It’s great to see the ripple effects from the expanded use of sustainably harvested, low-carbon wood products in B.C. buildings. It helps combat climate change and brings people back to work in forestry-related jobs, while this project creates housing for hundreds of future BCIT students.” B.C. is a leader in the use of mass timber as an innovative way to reduce the carbon footprint of the building sector, while supporting well-paying jobs for people in communities throughout the province. This project will also support regional economic development, creating about 700 direct and indirect jobs in local communities through the manufacturing process.The Province’s investment means opportunities for local workers in the forestry sector, strong partnerships with First Nations and greater economic opportunity, while also making a significant contribution to advancing CleanBC. The energy-efficient design supports the Province’s commitment to CleanBC and will meet Step 4 of the BC Energy Step Code.Funding student housing is part of the government’s 10-year housing plan, Homes for BC. This includes a $1.9-billion investment through the Building BC: Community Housing Fund to create more than 14,000 new affordable rental homes for low- to moderate-income British Columbians.Since February 2018, the Province has funded an additional 2,439 student beds at post-secondary schools, compared to the 130 beds funded during the previous 16 years.CleanBC is a pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. CleanBC was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s emission targets.Quotes:Janet Routledge, MLA Burnaby North – “For many people, the lack of on-campus student housing is a major barrier to opportunity. New beds at BCIT will take some of the pressure off students, while freeing up affordable rentals for people in their community. Today’s announcement is not just about student housing but also about reducing our carbon footprint. Mass timber is a sustainable and value-added product that can be made in B.C. It will create hundreds of well-paying jobs helping all British Columbians.”Mike Hurley, mayor, Burnaby – “By increasing affordable housing for students, we’re also taking the pressure off local rental markets, giving more options to other renters. Students have enough stress in their lives without having to worry about finding a place to live they can afford.”Kathy Kinloch, president, BCIT – “This investment will allow BCIT students to access sustainable on-campus housing to support their journey to a new or expanded career through an industry-relevant applied education. This new mass timber housing project is a key component of BCIT’s commitment to support the future social and economic prosperity of the province in a way that respects our spectacular natural environment.”Quick Facts: The Province is investing $450 million in the construction of approximately 5,000 student beds over six years. An additional 3,000 student beds will be built through non-government partnerships and institutional self-financing, for a total of about 8,000 new beds by 2028. As of September 2020, the B.C. government is almost halfway to its target of funding approximately 5,000 student homes on campuses throughout the province. In mass timber buildings, the primary load-bearing structure is made of solid or engineered wood. These buildings can be one-fifth the weight of comparable concrete buildings, while still meeting performance standards for safety, structural resilience and fire protection.     "

Childcare BC has three key pillars: affordability, accessibility and quality: www.gov.bc.ca/childcareAffordabilityChild Care Fee Reduction Initiative: Introduced in April 2018, the Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative helps lower the cost of child care for parents at approved licensed child care facilities by up to $350 a month per child. To date, more than 63,000 child care spaces have been approved for a reduction, saving parents more than $214 million since the program launched in April 2018. Providers who have been approved for the initiative are listed online: www.gov.bc.ca/childcare/optinAffordable Child Care Benefit (ACCB): Introduced in September 2018, the Affordable Child Care Benefit saves eligible parents up to $1,250 a month per child. Families earning up to $111,000 may be eligible for savings, and the benefit will support around 80,000 B.C. families. As of August 2020, approximately 53,000 families are receiving some level of support through the benefit, helping to put more than $305 million back into parents’ pockets since September 2018.  www.gov.bc.ca/affordablechildcarebenefitTaken together, the Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative and Affordable Child Care Benefit are already making a significant difference for B.C. parents.Since September 2018, more than 32,700 children have accessed child care for no more than $10-a-day through a combination of these initiatives and our $10-a-day prototype sites.Universal Child Care Prototype Sites: Under the Early Learning and Child Care agreement with the Government of Canada, the B.C. government is investing $60 million to create Universal Child Care Prototype Sites throughout B.C. Launched in fall 2018, this project has converted approximately 2,500 child care spaces at more than 50 child care facilities around B.C. into low-cost spaces to model child care at a cost of $200 a month, or less, per child: www.gov.bc.ca/childcareprototypesites  AccessibilityChildcare BC New Spaces Fund: Launched in July 2018, the Childcare BC New Spaces Fund helps improve access to child care throughout the province by supporting the creation of new licensed spaces over the next three years. www.gov.bc.ca/childcare/newspacesfundStart-Up Grants: In June 2018, the B.C. government launched the Start-Up Grant program, which supports individuals and unlicensed child care providers to become licensed. Applicants can apply for funding to help them cover the costs of becoming licensed, including training and application fees for licensing, hiring replacement staff while taking a course and buying equipment for a child care facility. Becoming licensed allows providers to care for more children and will help to enhance the quality of child care around British Columbia: www.gov.bc.ca/childcare/startupgrantsMore than 20,000 new licensed child care spaces have been approved for funding across Childcare BC’s space-creation initiatives, with more to come.Childcare BC Maintenance Fund: Introduced in June 2018, the Childcare BC Maintenance Fund helps eligible child care providers to maintain existing spaces by providing funding to help them with minor repairs or to replace equipment in order to meet licensing standards. The fund also helps cover relocation costs for eligible providers, so they can quickly move their operations if needed, and continue to support B.C. children and their families. In 2019-20 the ministry approved more than 800 applications for funding: www.gov.bc.ca/ccmaintenancefundQualityA key goal under Childcare BC is to improve the quality of B.C.’s child care system through enhanced supports for early childhood educators (ECEs) and other child care professionals. Quality will be achieved by enhancing training and development opportunities, as well as addressing wages and recruitment in the sector.Early Care and Learning Recruitment and Retention Strategy: Early childhood educators are an essential part of the Province’s goal to deliver quality child care to B.C. families. To this end, Childcare BC is delivering investments to better support ECEs over the first three years of its 10-year plan. On Sept. 5, 2018, the Province launched an Early Care and Learning Recruitment and Retention Strategy that lays out key aspects of the quality pillar of Childcare BC: www.gov.bc.ca/childcare/ecestrategyECE Wage Enhancement: Since early 2019, ECEs working in licensed child care facilities have been eligible for a wage enhancement of $1 per hour, which increased to $2 per hour in April 2020. To date, the Province has invested more than $33 million to provide more than 12,000 early childhood educators with the wage enhancements.ECE Education Support Fund: In September 2018, in partnership with the Early Childhood Educators of BC, the Province announced an enhanced bursary program for students enrolled in Early Childhood Education programs at recognized post-secondary institutions in B.C. The Province has made significant investments to improve supports to B.C.’s early care and learning professionals, including investing approximately $16 million to provide roughly 8,000 bursaries and workforce-development supports for students pursuing a career in child care: www.ecebc.ca/programs/student_bursary.htmlProfessional development funding: In March 2019, the Ministry of Children and Family Development announced a $6.3-million investment through Early Learning and Child Care to improve access to professional development opportunities for early care and learning professionals. Six organizations have used this funding to expand and improve the availability of professional learning opportunities, including the launch of the online Early Years Professional Development Hub to provide bursaries for access to communities of practice, workshops and conferences, and to improve access to post-secondary education for Indigenous students.Early Childhood Pedagogy Network: In January 2020, the Ministry of Children and Family Development expanded this professional learning opportunity to more ECEs throughout the province. Child care professionals now have access to more than 30 teaching specialists, known as pedagogists, in child care programs and post-secondary programs throughout the province, helping them to stay up to date with the latest early childhood education philosophies and practices.Post-secondary seat expansion: To increase training and development opportunities for ECEs throughout the province, the Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training is investing $7.4 million over three years to fund an additional 820 ECE graduates at B.C.’s public post-secondary institutions.Early Learning and Child Care (ELCC) AgreementInvestments under Childcare BC are complemented by the B.C. government’s three-year, $156-million ELCC agreement with the Government of Canada, which was signed in February 2018. The following outlines ELCC investments in addition to the $16.3 million for quality child care, the $60 million for Childcare BC Universal Prototype Sites, and the $13.7 million for new spaces through UBCM.Aboriginal Head Start: The B.C. government is investing $30 million to expand Aboriginal Head Start programs around the province, with over 30 communities benefiting from more than 600 new licensed child care and early learning spaces. These programs provide culturally based, inclusive child care and early learning, family bonding and prevention services, with services available to families at no cost.

This includes ensuring affordable fares, as well as access and reliability of service. The funding helps communities recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.“What we heard from the public is that while the current ferry service works well for some, there’s lots of room for improvement for those who most depend on it – those who live in ferry-dependent communities,” said Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “Our vision is that travel by coastal ferries is seamless, equitable and compatible with the needs of coastal communities and our natural environment. These may sound like basic principles for any transportation service, but these are all areas where we’ve heard improvements need to be made.”The ministry heard from survey participants that their greatest concern with the existing ferry service is affordability, followed by scheduling and reliability. People expressed an interest in travelling without a personal vehicle if there were improvements, such as better parking at terminals or improved connectivity to other travel modes like public transit, taxi, ride hailing or cycling, or dedicated passenger-only ferry services in more accessible locations.  Participants expressed strong support for all four themes that emerged during the first phase of engagement. The key themes indicated that coastal ferry services should: support efficient end-to-end travel of people and goods; be equitable and accessible; mitigate and be responsive to climate change; and reflect the values of coastal communities. Trevena will be meeting with BC Ferries Board, the BC Ferry Authority, its shareholders and the BC Ferries commissioner to discuss the feedback.Learn More:A Vision for Coastal Ferry Services, Phase 2 Engagement Summary of Feedback report: https://engage.gov.bc.ca/app/uploads/sites/593/2020/09/7707-Coastal-Ferries-Phase-2-Report.pdf    "

The partnership will support upgrades to four of the company’s trucks to be compatible with an overhead trolley system that is planned to be installed on a new laneway on a steep section of the mine-haul road. This is expected to reduce local air pollutants and 55,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) – roughly equal to taking 20,000 cars off the roads for a year.“Our government is working with businesses to create new opportunities through CleanBC to reduce emissions and build on our global reputation as a place for clean investment,” said Bruce Ralston, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources. “Through the CleanBC Industry Fund, we’re investing in innovative projects that will support good jobs and a cleaner, better future for people in communities across B.C.”The Copper Mountain pilot project will help prove the effectiveness of the trolley technology in British Columbia for wider application. It will replace diesel used by the haul trucks to transport mine material to a surface processing facility with clean electricity. This will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.“Our company is committed to low-carbon mining,” said Gil Clausen, president and CEO of Copper Mountain Mining Corporation. “We are pleased to be in partnership with the provincial government and CleanBC to produce high-quality minerals, while minimizing our impact on the environment. With the success of this trolley project, we plan on incorporating an electric trolley system into Copper Mountain’s life of mine plan, which we see reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30% to 50%. By working together, we’re investing in a cleaner future that will see significant global opportunities for companies like ours that find innovative ways to lower our carbon footprint.”CleanBC is a pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. It was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s emission targets.Quotes: Merran Smith, co-chair of B.C.’s Climate Solutions Council, and executive director of Clean Energy Canada –  “Metals and minerals are, literally, what make the electric cars, solar panels and wind turbines we need to fight climate change. And the mining industry can also be part of the transition it’s helping build. It’s encouraging to see British Columbia’s mining companies joining others around the world upgrading their trucks and equipment to electric or even hydrogen versions. I look forward to seeing it continue.”Michael Goehring, president and CEO, Mining Association of B.C. –  “British Columbia has some of the lowest greenhouse gas emission-intensive mines and smelters in the world. We are a leading supplier of low-carbon metals and minerals that are essential for electric vehicles, renewable energy infrastructure and consumer technologies. This investment from the CleanBC Industry Fund will help lower emissions further and support employment in local communities.”Quick Facts: The Copper Mountain project is part of the CleanBC Industry Fund, which uses carbon tax revenues paid by industry to fund emission reduction projects around the province.

The higher fine is about quadruple the current fine of $81. It will help increase safety by making drivers more aware of how opening their car door unsafely can seriously injure an approaching cyclist. At the same time, a public education and awareness campaign is being launched.Increasing safety and helping reduce cycling collisions is an initiative of Move. Commute.

The area’s steep terrain makes it difficult for wood grinders and traditional chip trucks to reach harvesting sites after logging is finished. However, with this funding, the uneconomic waste wood fibre could be hauled out at minimal additional cost by logging contractors already working in the area.Lavington Pellet Limited Partnership in the Okanagan Valley is a joint venture between Pinnacle Renewable Energy and Tolko Industries Ltd. The project began in the winter of 2019-20 and is expected to last until March 2022.“These companies are working together to support local jobs and produce a marketable wood product from residual fibre, while also reducing carbon emissions,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “The crucial financial support provided by the Forest Enhancement Society of BC made this innovative project possible.”The collaboration between FESBC and local forestry companies not only helps improve air quality by burning less wood waste, but also supports good-quality jobs for British Columbians in their communities. The strategy has resulted in a consistent supply of wood fibre for Lavington Pellet Limited Partnership.“This funding allowed us to reduce carbon emissions through the utilization of harvest waste,” said Jason Fisher, vice-president fibre, Pinnacle Renewable Energy. “Harvest residuals are more costly to handle, process and transport than mill residuals, especially in areas with challenging geography like the regions around Lavington. FESBC’s support for this project turned into local benefits and helps us turn B.C. wood waste into a global carbon solution.”The residual waste recovered by Lavington Pellet Limited Partnership was stored in Lumby and processed in the spring, when mill curtailments and road use bans were in effect. Having the additional waste fibre available for processing reduced layoffs for 35 direct employees and 80 truck drivers.“It’s a win-win project that supports the environment, local industries and the economy by providing employment opportunities for local contractors,” said Dave Conly, operations manager, FESBC.Quick Facts: It is estimated that this project will reduce the generation of carbon dioxide by the equivalent of about 33,600 tonnes. By using the fibre to make wood pellets to produce energy (instead of burning it in slash piles), the release of more potent greenhouse gas emissions such as methane and nitrous oxide is also avoided.

I'm very proud of those individuals.”The firefighters are being deployed to Redmond, Ore. and will be deployed as needed to assist with the dire wildfire situation. British Columbia is also in direct contact with Oregon and Washington about the potential to send an additional 200 personnel in the coming days and weeks.“Here in British Columbia, we’ve been fortunate to have experienced a moderate wildfire season, but our neighbours to the south have not been so lucky,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural development. “B.C. firefighters who are willing to be deployed out of the country during this challenging time deserve a lot of credit for their professionalism.”Given the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic in the province and in the U.S., the B.C. firefighters and staff will be taking extraordinary precautions to safeguard the health of everyone participating in this deployment, both during their time in the U.S. and on their return to Canada.BC Wildfire Service personnel will remain within their own “bubble” and conduct their firefighting operations separately from American firefighters, as co-ordinated by the U.S. Forest Service and other relevant authorities. Since the pandemic began, the BC Wildfire Service has been taking extra precautions in this province to protect its staff from possible exposure, including physical distancing and enhanced safety and sanitation protocols.The American request for assistance was made through the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, which co-ordinates the mutual sharing of firefighting resources between B.C. and other jurisdictions. All associated costs will be covered by the jurisdiction that requested the resources, including BC Wildfire Service staff quarantine time upon their return to Canada.Sufficient personnel and resources remain in the province to respond appropriately to any fire activity in British Columbia, considering the current and forecasted fire situation.Learn More:For the latest information on current wildfire activity, burning restrictions, road closures and air quality advisories in B.C., go to: http://www.bcwildfire.caFollow the latest B.C. wildfire news: onTwitter: http://twitter.com/BCGovFireInfo on Facebook: http://facebook.com/BCForestFireInfo A backgrounder follows.

The report provides several important insights on the state of off-dock drayage and potential opportunities to realize efficiencies and provide more flexibility for companies and how they deploy their fleets.Based on the report findings, the consultation will look at opportunities to make targeted adjustments to rates, policy and regulation to ensure fair and equitable working conditions that support a stable, efficient and competitive container-trucking sector. It is expected that the commissioner will prepare recommendations by this fall.Under direction from the minister, the ministry partnered with the Office of the British Columbia Container Trucking Commissioner to take a closer look and consult with industry on off-dock trips. They will also look for opportunities to enhance efficiencies, competitiveness and promote fairness in the Vancouver gateway. Cascadia Partners was tasked with preparing a report intended to help better understand the flows of off-dock container movements that support containerized shipping throughout the Lower Mainland to help inform policy and decision making.This report builds on the work government has completed over the last three years. In May 2018, government increased trip rates and hourly wages by 2.6% for licensed container-truck drivers at the port. The minimum daily call-out rate was raised from $200 to $300. In July 2019, base rates were again increased across the board by 2% and a $25 positioning move rate was implemented to improve incomes for truckers.Government also enhanced the commissioner’s powers to implement changes to rates and remuneration, while continuing to ensure drivers were being appropriately paid.“We heard clearly that more needed to be done to help improve conditions for truck drivers,” Trevena said. “That’s why we’ve worked to put more money in the pockets of drivers.

These changes are intended to increase the amount of processing of wood products done within British Columbia, leading to more B.C. jobs, rather than having that processing done after export.Under the amended MFPR, the maximum dimension of lumber to be considered a sawn-wood product will be 0.1 square metres (approximately 12 inches by 12 inches). This will require further domestic processing of lumber prior to being eligible for export. Additionally, the regulation amendments will require that in the Coast area, lumber that is made from western red cedar or cypress must be fully manufactured. Products that do not meet these new criteria will require a provincial export permit and payment of a fee in lieu of manufacture to be eligible for export.MFPR, introduced in 2003, defines the criteria that products must meet to be considered manufactured under the Forest Act. Under the current regulation, logs that are squared off up to a maximum dimension of 0.2 square metres (approximately 17 inches by 17 inches) are categorized as a sawn-wood product and may be exported without further manufacture.These changes were initially set to come into effect July 1 but were postponed due to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. This additional time allowed the forest industry to recover from the challenges associated with the pandemic and to better prepare for the resulting market impacts.Reinvigorating B.C.’s forest sector to improve both environmental standards and jobs for local communities is a shared priority between government, the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.

The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 2,660 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 3,835 in the Fraser Health region, 195 in the Island Health region, 485 in the Interior Health region, 237 in the Northern Health region and 85 cases of people who reside outside of Canada.“There have been no new COVID-19 related deaths, for a total of 219 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks. In total, 11 long-term care or assisted-living facilities and three acute-care facilities have active outbreaks.“There have been no new community outbreaks, although there continue to be community exposure events.“Alerts are posted on the BC Centre for Disease Control’s (BCCDC) website, as well as on health authorities’ websites, providing details on where the potential exposure occurred and what actions to take – whether you need to self-isolate or monitor for symptoms.“Beginning today, the BCCDC website will also link to regional health authorities' school notification pages, providing the date and type of notification (outbreak, cluster or exposure) for impacted schools. Fraser Health’s school notification page is available now and the other regional health authorities will have theirs ready soon.“As we learn more and better understand where the risks exist, we will continue to adjust our COVID-19 approach and response in B.C. to protect those who are most vulnerable. This is our priority for not only COVID-19, but the second equally concerning pandemic of overdose deaths.“Today, a new provincial health officer order has been put in place to increase the number of health professionals authorized to provide safer alternatives to the toxic drug supply.“This new order is about connecting more people to treatment and doing all we can to save lives by supporting people who use drugs to do so safely.“As we work to support each other, one of the biggest concerns with COVID-19 is the unidentified spread of the virus in our communities. This is why getting tested as soon as you have symptoms is so important.“With the knowledge of new cases or clusters, public health teams can quickly complete contact tracing, notify those who may be exposed and more importantly, contain the further spread.“It doesn’t help to shame and blame those in our communities who have the virus, because it quite often discourages others from coming forward and getting tested, putting all of us at risk.“Rather, we need to show compassion and care, not judgment, when there is a new case in our community.“Large gatherings have been a steady source of transmission. However, many of the new cases we are seeing in the past weeks are from small gatherings where people see different groups of friends on different days – inadvertently spreading the virus to many people.“Let’s not forget that if we are close enough, doing enough and with enough different people, the likelihood of transmitting the virus significantly goes up. That is why it is so important to make our social interactions a ‘small and safe six,’ keeping to our immediate households and the same close friends only.“September is our month to get ready for the respiratory season, to hold steady with our layers of protection and go forward with the routines that will keep our communities and our loved ones safe.”Quick Facts: Assisted living, long-term care homes and seniors’ rental buildings with ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks are as follows: Vancouver Coastal Health OPAL by Element assisted-living facility Point Grey Private Hospital long-term care facility Royal Arch Masonic Home long-term care facility (second outbreak)  Fraser Health Bear Creek Villa independent-living facility Cherington Place long-term care facility Evergreen Hamlets long-term care facility Kin Village assisted-living facility Milieu Children and Family Services Society community-living facility New Vista Care Home long-term care facility Normanna long-term care facility Rideau Retirement Centre independent-living facility   Learn More:For a listing of the community notifications, including school notifications, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/public-exposuresTo find the provincial health officer’s orders, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topics/covid-19-novel-coronavirusFor the last modelling information presented on Sept. 3, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/COVID19_Going_Forward_Sept_2020.pdfTo see a map of COVID-19 cases by local health area, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/dataIf you are experiencing symptoms, find a collection centre near you to get tested: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testingFor mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca Or: www.anxietycanada.comFor a listing of the community exposure events, go to: BCCDC (flights, work sites, etc.): http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/public-exposures Fraser Health: fraserhealth.ca/covid19exposure Interior Health: https://news.interiorhealth.ca/news/public-exposures/ Island Health: https://www.islandhealth.ca/learn-about-health/covid-19/outbreaks-and-exposures Northern Health: https://www.northernhealth.ca/health-topics/outbreaks-and-exposures Vancouver Coastal: http://www.vch.ca/covid-19/public-exposuresFor the second monthly progress report on B.C.’s surgical renewal plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020_surgical-renewal-commitment-progress-report-June-July-2020.pdfFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/ Or follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19 Or call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit: Facebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews  YouTube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBC    "

I am issuing a provincial health officer order to expand the health professionals who are able to provide safer, accessible alternatives to the toxic street drug supply and help more people find their pathway to hope.”The order, issued under the Health Professions Act, authorizes registered nurses and registered psychiatric nurses to prescribe pharmaceutical alternatives to street drugs to help separate more people from the poisoned street drug supply to save lives and provide opportunities for ongoing care, treatment and support. New nursing standards will be introduced, along with training and education, and access to expert consultation and pathways to connect people to broader addictions and primary care. “Before the COVID-19 pandemic began, B.C. was making progress and overdose deaths were coming down for the first time since 2012,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “We’re seeing these tragic spikes in deaths across Canada, but I’m proud that we’re the only government responding across the full continuum of care by providing more overdose prevention services and outreach teams, doubling youth treatment beds, increasing adult beds and counselling services. And today, we’re announcing a significant expansion of access to safer prescription alternatives to the toxic drug supply. Each life lost to overdose is a tragedy and we are taking every preventative measure possible to save more lives and connect more people to treatment and supportive services.”In addition to the public health order, the Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions and the Ministry of Health are working with the Office of the Provincial Health Officer to develop an updated policy directive for prescribers and health authorities, which builds on the existing risk mitigation clinical guidance released in March 2020 in partnership with the BC Centre on Substance Use.The policy directive is being urgently finalized and is expected to be released as soon as possible in order to: expand eligibility criteria to prioritize reducing overdose events and deaths, and reach individuals with opioid-use disorder, other substance-use disorders or individuals with a history of accessing the toxic street drug supply who are at high risk of overdose and other drug-related harms; carefully expand the types of medications that can be prescribed and dispensed by doctors, pharmacists and nurses; increase access points to allow for dispensing medications from health authorities and community pharmacies; and continue to commit to ongoing evaluation and monitoring and support evidence-based care planning. The policy will continue to place a strong emphasis on clinicians working with people who use drugs on their individual goals, including opportunities – as people stabilize – to access substance-use services, such as harm reduction, treatment, counselling and mental health supports and recovery-oriented services.  People with substance-use disorder and addictions can currently access safer pharmaceutical alternatives by talking to their doctor, nurse practitioner, community care team or by calling 811. People will be engaged by trained clinicians who follow core principles and standards of care, including culturally safe practices and trauma-informed care that put people’s needs and goals first.This work is part of the B.C. government’s plan to build the comprehensive system of mental health and addictions care that British Columbians deserve, as outlined in A Pathway to Hope, B.C.'s roadmap for making mental health and addictions care better for people in British Columbia.Implementing A Pathway to Hope is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Sherri Kensall, interim board chair, Nurses and Nurse Practitioners of BC –“The Association of Nurses and Nurse Practitioners of BC  is very pleased with the decision to expand the group of health professionals that can prescribe pharmaceutical alternatives to street drugs by including registered nurses and registered psychiatric nurses. In doing this, we have taken an important step in leveraging nursing knowledge by expanding scope in such a way that will have a direct and beneficial impact on harm reduction. Every day British Columbians are losing their lives to a crisis that has only accelerated in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Nurses stand ready at all levels to interact with people who use substances and will utilize supportive harm reduction, coupled with increased prescriptive authority as well as expanded access to referral for ongoing treatment and support to save countless lives.”  Dr. Kathleen Ross, president, Doctors of BC –“Increasing prescribing access for this high-risk population to allied health-care providers working on the ground makes logistical sense, and we hope that by expanding team-based care to include RNs working in this field, more lives will be saved during the overdose crisis. We support these game-changing treatment options, and hope that as we proceed, a viable partnership among all health care providers working in this environment will help to identify and change any areas that aren’t working. We must be able to meet the needs of patients.”  Geraldine Vance, CEO, BC Pharmacy Association –“As health professionals and those on the front lines, we know the government, the BC Centre on Substance Use and others are doing what they can to address this devastating health crisis. B.C.’s pharmacists support the efforts in making sure the right person gets the right medication when they need it. Pharmacists have and will always be partners with patients’ prescribers.”Guy Felicella, peer clinical advisor, Overdose Emergency Response Centre –""This is what an emergency response looks like. This will provide a lifeline to people who use drugs. It says to them that their lives matter and offers hope to them, their families and their communities. Now the work begins to move forward with building a system of care that connects people to harm reduction, treatment and recovery — a system that meets people where they’re at, wherever they’re at, and offers multiple pathways to care.”Katrina Jensen, executive director, AVI Health and Community Services – “Safe supply programs save lives by providing pharmaceutical alternatives to the increasingly toxic street drug supply. These measures are an important step in the right direction to urgently expand access to programs that we know work. Safer supply significantly reduces the risk of overdose death and helps improve the health of people who are using substances.”Quick Facts:  On March 26, 2020, the Province and the British Columbia Centre on Substance Use released interim clinical prescriber guidance to help people living with addictions stay safe during COVID-19. In August 2020, there was a 259% increase in dispensed hydromorphone for patients from a pharmacy compared to March 2020. More than 3,000 clinicians have attended webinars about the new guidance since it was introduced in March 2020. Prior to COVID-19, illicit drug overdose deaths were declining for the first time since 2012. The BC Centre for Disease Control estimates that nearly 6,000 deaths have been averted since April 2016 due to lifesaving supports put in place, including increased distribution of naloxone, the establishment of more overdose preventions sites and improved access to medication-assisted treatment.

Between Aug. 21 and Sept. 12, 14 violation tickets were issued, including eight $2,000 violation tickets to owners or organizers contravening the PHO’s order on gatherings and events, and six $200 violation tickets to individuals.“We’re asking British Columbians to do the right thing and continue taking the health of your family, friends and neighbours seriously,” said Farnworth. “We’ve put measures in place to protect people and deal with those who insist on breaking the rules. We all need to take personal responsibility and make choices that will keep our communities safe.”The state of emergency is extended through the end of the day on Sept. 29, 2020, to allow government to continue to take the necessary actions to keep British Columbians safe and manage immediate concerns, such as recent outbreaks in some areas of the province.Actions taken in the previous two weeks to support British Columbians include: investing $1.6 billion in a fall and winter preparedness plan that will significantly build upon and strengthen measures that respond to the health-care requirements of COVID-19; boosting funds for school-based wellness programs and supports by $2 million to enhance mental health programs and support a safe return to school; protecting jobs and workers impacted by COVID-19 with an online variance application that simplified the process to extend temporary layoffs, resulting in approval of more than 500 variances that protect more than 9,100 jobs across a variety of sectors; delaying implementation dates to April 2021 for changes to provincial sales tax and B.C.’s carbon tax to help businesses and families through the COVID-19 pandemic and recovery; and continuing the Province’s emergency order protecting eligible businesses from being evicted, which will remain in place for the duration of the federal Canadian Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program. On July 10, the COVID-19 Related Measures Act came into force. The legislation enables provisions created for citizens and businesses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to continue as needed should the provincial state of emergency end.The extension of the provincial state of emergency is based on recommendations from B.C.'s health and emergency management officials. Farnworth made the original declaration on March 18, 2020, the day after Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, declared a public health emergency.Quick Facts: Declarations of provincial states of emergency may be issued by the minister responsible under the Emergency Program Act. The provincial government can extend the period of a declaration made by the minister responsible for further periods of up to 14 days at a time.

And if we do have symptoms, contact 811 to arrange to get tested.“Testing allows for rapid contact tracing. It means public health teams are able to quickly notify those who may be at risk and contain the spread to the others in the community.“As teachers and youth get back to the classroom, public health teams have been there and are working closely with schools to manage and contact trace any time a COVID-19 case arises.“This is time to get ready for the fall and winter seasons, to set the routines that ensure we stick with six people and avoid activities that will put ourselves and those we care for at risk.“Let’s continue to monitor ourselves for symptoms and to modify our activities so we can all manage COVID-19 as it remains in our communities. Let’s take the precautions we need to that will protect ourselves, our loved ones, our Elders and our communities.”Quick Facts: Assisted living, long-term care homes and seniors' rental buildings with ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks are as follows: Vancouver Coastal Health OPAL by Element assisted living facility Point Grey Private Hospital long-term care facility Royal Arch Masonic Home long-term care facility (second outbreak)  Fraser Health Bear Creek Villa independent living facility Cherington Place long-term care facility Evergreen Hamlets long-term care facility Kin Village assisted living facility Milieu Children and Family Services Society community-living facility New Vista Care Home long-term care facility Normanna long-term care facility Rideau Retirement Centre independent living facility   Learn More:For information on protecting yourself during poor air quality situations, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/prevention-public-health/wildfire-smoke To find the provincial health officer’s orders, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topics/covid-19-novel-coronavirusFor the last modelling information presented on Sept. 3, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/COVID19_Going_Forward_Sept_2020.pdfTo see a map of COVID-19 cases by local health area, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/dataIf you are experiencing symptoms, find a collection centre near you to get tested: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testingFor mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca Or: www.anxietycanada.comFor a listing of the community exposure events, go to: BCCDC (flights, work sites, etc.): http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/public-exposures Fraser Health: fraserhealth.ca/covid19exposure Interior Health: https://news.interiorhealth.ca/news/public-exposures/ Island Health: https://www.islandhealth.ca/learn-about-health/covid-19/outbreaks-and-exposures Northern Health: https://www.northernhealth.ca/health-topics/outbreaks-and-exposures Vancouver Coastal: http://www.vch.ca/covid-19/public-exposuresFor the second monthly progress report on B.C.’s surgical renewal plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020_surgical-renewal-commitment-progress-report-June-July-2020.pdfFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/ Or follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19 Or call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit: Facebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews  YouTube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBC    "

The team of health-care providers will include family physicians, nurse practitioners and health-care professionals, ranging from registered nurses, traditional wellness co-ordinators and cultural safety facilitators to allied health-care professionals, social workers and clinical pharmacists.These new networks will see community partners, local health-care providers and Indigenous partners work together to ensure patients have access to a full range of team-based primary care services, from maternity to end of life, for all of their day-to-day health-care needs. In addition, they have been designed to address primary care priorities of individual communities such as: providing better access to chronic disease and chronic pain management; improving access to mental-health and substance-use services; culturally safe and appropriate care for Indigenous peoples; helping to co-ordinate services for vulnerable people with complex health issues; and providing comprehensive services for people living in poverty. For people and families, it means getting faster, better access to their primary care team or provider, including evenings and weekends, as well as being connected to appropriate services and supports in the community.The primary care networks will be in Comox, southern Vancouver Island, Cowichan, Oceanside, White Rock/South Surrey, Chilliwack/Fraser rural, Mission, Central Okanagan, Central Interior rural, Kootenay Boundary, East Kootenay and Vancouver.Over the next three to four years, across all networks, the team of health-care providers will see hundreds of thousands of patient visits annually.“About 17% of people in British Columbia report not having a primary care provider. This means that these people often have to wait long hours in walk-in clinics or at their local emergency departments to get the care they need. Our primary care strategy and the networks are providing a real solution to people so they can get the care they need, closer to home,” Dix said.Indigenous partners, including community leaders, have been involved in the development of primary care networks, from planning to governance, and advise on the implementation of primary care. Local Elders will be supported to offer traditional knowledge, cultural support, and leadership to their communities. For Indigenous peoples, this will mean more co-ordinated and culturally safe and appropriate primary care support such as traditional healers and Indigenous navigators.Over the next years, these new networks are expected to help connect approximately 300,000 people to a local primary care team or provider, while providing team-based and culturally safe care to B.C. residents. The primary care networks are a result of a partnership between the Ministry of Health, local health authorities, Divisions of Family Practice, municipalities and local Indigenous partners.British Columbia has 39 primary care networks underway, including 12 in Vancouver Coastal, 14 in Fraser Health, five in Island Health, five in Interior Health and one in Northern Health, with more coming.Learn More: To learn more about the Province’s primary health-care strategy, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018PREM0034-001010To learn more about the Province’s strategy to increase the number of nurse practitioners, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018HLTH0034-000995To learn more about the Province’s strategy to recruit and retain more family medicine graduates, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018HLTH0052-001043Two backgrounders follow.

I am so proud of our government’s partnership with the City of Nanaimo to create the first navigation centre on Vancouver Island.”BC Housing will issue a request for proposals to encourage experienced and eligible non-profit partners to apply for the role of operating the centre, which will provide additional levels of support not offered in many traditional shelters.“After years of inaction on housing by the previous government, we are delivering homes for people of all incomes. That includes supportive housing and other homes for people with limited resources,” said Doug Routley, MLA for Nanaimo-North Cowichan. “This new navigation centre will play an important role in the housing system, helping to bring people in off the street and connecting them with permanent housing.”The approximately 60-bed centre will be referral only and provide integrated clinical health supports, as well as culturally appropriate services of Indigenous peoples.BC Housing and the City of Nanaimo are working with Island Health to determine the specific support services that will be available.“Navigation centres provide the opportunity for individualized care that are adapted based on a person’s unique needs and circumstances,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “While we believe in an overall housing-first approach to homelessness and poverty, this centre will provide additional support that people may need with compassion and expertise.”Residents referred to the navigation centre will be able to stay until longer-term housing is secured. This centre is the second of two announced as part of Budget 2020. The first location was announced in August and will be located in Vancouver: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020MAH0090-001460“Having a navigation centre with the necessary wraparound services for people who require higher levels of supports than provided in traditional shelters, in particular, mental health and substance use supports, is much needed in Nanaimo,” said Leonard Krog, mayor, City of Nanaimo.A location for the navigation centre is being identified. A non-profit partner is anticipated to be selected in fall 2020. The navigation centre is expected to be open and operating by spring 2021.Quick Facts: Through provincial investments made since 2017, nearly 850 homes are complete, under construction or in development for people with a range of incomes in Nanaimo. Over 350 supportive homes are complete, under construction or in development for people experiencing homelessness in Nanaimo, including 190 proposed homes as a result of a partnership between the Province and the City of Nanaimo: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020MAH0079-001271 Learn More:For information on how BC Housing is supporting British Columbians during the COVID-19 outbreak, visit: https://www.bchousing.org/COVID-19    "

This was made possible by the herculean efforts of staff, faculty, administrators, parents and students themselves, whose sole focus has been on mitigating COVID-19 health risks.“The provincial health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, has been very clear about the need for individuals, organizations, communities and our province to work together in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and follow orders and guidelines around social gatherings.“To learn that some students are blatantly ignoring the advice and orders of Dr. Henry and gathering in large numbers is unacceptable, completely irresponsible and could lead to enforcement measures.“I expect better from all of our students in the post-secondary system. I hope that this behaviour is not replicated going forward at UVic or any other post-secondary institution in the province. It undermines the efforts of so many other students and staff who are working to keep campuses open and safe.“I understand that returning to campus this fall is an exciting time after months of physically distancing and limiting our social activities, but no one wants to contract or unintentionally spread COVID-19 to our friends and family.“I appreciate that most students are following Dr. Henry’s direction and that staff are working hard to provide safe campuses and learning environments.“We are all in this together, and we all need to do our part to hold the line against COVID-19.”    "

The Province has invested $8 million toward the $37.3-million project.“The advanced health-care technology housed in this new training facility at TRU will ensure students throughout B.C.’s Interior will have access to much needed health-care training close to home,” said Ronna-Rae Leonard, B.C.’s Parliamentary Secretary for Seniors. By investing in cutting-edge technology and training facilities, our government is bringing high-quality health-care training to every community in our province. Students at TRU will now be better equipped for a rewarding career in health care, helping deliver the high standard of services British Columbians deserve.”The three-storey building will be a hub for knowledge with classrooms, patient simulation labs, a home-care simulation lab, seminar rooms, student lounges, research space and breakout rooms. The building’s lab space will have 48 beds, three times the former number of beds in the existing Ken Lepin Building.The building’s patient simulation labs are equipped with advanced technology that will replicate the work environments for a variety of hospitals and laboratories. This centre will enable students to learn in an innovative, cohesive space that greatly improves their quality of education.Nurses and health-care assistants are in-demand health occupations. There are over 5,000 job openings for registered nurses, practical nurses and health-care assistants in the Thompson-Okanagan forecasted by 2029. Provincewide, the number of health-care job openings projected over the next 10 years is more than 78,000.According to the 2019 BC Labour Market Outlook, there will be more than 141,000 job openings between 2019-29 in the health-care and social assistance sector, for a total of 16.5% of job openings.Quotes:Brett Fairbairn, president and vice-chancellor, TRU – “TRU will have capacity to improve access for students, improve transition into the labour market, enrich research opportunities and simulate the full spectrum of health-care environments. For this, I am proud of today’s opening.”Rani H. Srivastava, dean, TRU school of nursing –“This new space for the TRU school of nursing will help us continue to educate and develop world-class health-care workers. This space will enable students to be work ready once they are done their program.”Lisa Bonang, TRU student, bachelor of science in nursing program – “This new building will transform how my classmates and I learn to be the future health-care workers in B.C.

It’s exciting to look towards a future high-speed connection that will make moving around on the North Shore and Greater Vancouver easier and greener.”The Burrard Inlet Rapid Transit study will help inform the long-term Transport 2050 planning, led by TransLink and the Mayors’ Council.  The study led by Mott MacDonald Canada resulted in five possible routes for future planning consideration:  Downtown Vancouver to Lonsdale via First Narrows (tunnel crossing)  Downtown Vancouver to Lonsdale via Brockton Point (tunnel crossing)  Downtown Vancouver to West Vancouver via Lonsdale (tunnel crossing)  Downtown Vancouver to Lonsdale via Second Narrows (new bridge crossing)  Burnaby to Lonsdale via Second Narrows (new bridge crossing) Connecting Lonsdale City Centre with Vancouver’s metropolitan core and the regional rapid transit network, while considering compatibility with existing and future land use, is one of the recommendations put forward by the Integrated North Shore Transportation Planning Project (INSTPP). That project was led by Bowinn Ma, MLA for North Vancouver, in 2018. Work on the remaining recommendations of INSTPP continues through NXSTPP (Next Step), a working group that includes all levels of government on the North Shore. The group works in partnership to improve mobility both in and around the region.“People living in North Vancouver are eager to embrace socially, environmentally responsible ways to travel that allow them to beat the traffic,” Ma said. “This exciting technical feasibility study is the first-ever co-ordinated effort by the Province in partnership with Indigenous governments, municipalities and TransLink to identify a potential rapid transit solution across the Burrard Inlet for people who live, work and travel throughout Metro Vancouver.”The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, the districts of North Vancouver and West Vancouver and the cities of Vancouver and North Vancouver contributed joint funding towards the study. TransLink oversaw the technical work.Making investments to improve transit is part of the B.C. government’s CleanBC plan. Initiatives in the CleanBC plan aim to make transit a more accessible and efficient option for all British Columbians, reducing congestion and carbon pollution. CleanBC is a pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. It was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.'s emission targets.Learn More:Burrard Inlet Rapid Transit Study: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/9-15_Burrard_Inlet_study.pdfCleanBC: https://cleanbc.gov.bc.ca/A backgrounder follows.

Let’s help our public health teams to protect our loved ones by doing our part – every day.“The symptoms of COVID-19 can be mild, making it easy to inadvertently spread the virus to others. We have seen this in many of the recent workplace and community exposures that trace back to private gatherings, large and small.“Social connection is important for our mental and emotional well-being, but now is the time to stick with six, to keep our groups small and spend time with only people we know.“Let’s set the routines at work, at school and when spending time with friends and family that will carry us through the pandemic.

The policy changes will also increase economic opportunities and strengthen B.C.’s provincial food system.Policy changes being shared with ranchers, abattoirs, local governments and health authorities for consideration include: increasing the amount of meat that can be processed annually by Class D and E licence holders, and expanding the criteria of who and where their meat can be sold to;  developing alternative models of licensing mobile abattoirs to improve service for smaller-scale producers; exploring a pilot program for conducting certain inspection components virtually; and renaming the current “Class A, B, D and E licenses” to more intuitive categories. The ministry is also collecting input on a number of topics to support public health and a safe meat supply, such as: updating licensee training on slaughter practice, animal welfare and food safety to ensure provincially consistent and effective learning opportunities for rural producers; revising the code of practice for abattoir operators with required standard operating procedures to bring consistent practices and improved clarity for administrators and operators; and increasing the frequency of government inspector visits to rural abattoirs to an annual basis to ensure awareness and compliance with all requirements.

We know that so many people are dealing with addictions challenges across the province right now, and they need access to services when they need it,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “This commitment ensures that when women and girls reach out for help, Westminster House Society will be there to help them on their healing journey.”Westminster House Society is a long-term residential recovery centre based in New Westminster tailored specifically for women with addictions. The society will receive $45,000 to fund crucial services for its wellness program. The program takes a holistic and progressive approach that includes meditation, Zumba, acupuncture, yoga and cultural exploration.The program works to help women by teaching coping strategies for stress and fostering healthy habits, creating a desire for recovery and re-establishing feelings of hope and happiness.“Wellness is an important component for women to build recovery capital so that women can have long-term sustainable recovery,” said Susan Hogarth, executive director, Westminster House Society. “People with substance-use disorder can recover from addiction with the right supports, and thanks to the Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions, we have been able to continue to provide the wellness program to our residents.”Expanding access to addictions treatment and supports is an integral part of A Pathway to Hope, B.C.’s roadmap for making mental health and addictions care better for people in British Columbia.

Cancer doesn’t wait for global pandemics, and we know that early detection can save lives,” said Premier John Horgan. “Our new lung cancer screening program will mean more treatment options, faster recovery and better outcomes for people around the province. It’s part of our work to keep people safe and healthy – no matter what they’re dealing with.”  The target population for this new cancer screening program will be adults aged 55 to 74 who smoke or have a heavy smoking history. It’s expected the first participants could be receiving scans by spring 2022.“In 2020, an estimated 3,300 people in B.C. will be diagnosed with lung cancer,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “Through early detection with this new lung cancer screening program, we will see survival rates dramatically improve. Similar to our other cancer screening programs, British Columbia is leading the way. We are proud to be the first province in Canada to establish a lung cancer screening program.”It is anticipated approximately 300 people will be diagnosed each year through the program. They will be diagnosed earlier, giving them more treatment options.“This is a truly important day for British Columbians,” said Dr. Kim Chi, vice-president and chief medical officer, BC Cancer. “Our clinicians and scientists have been working for years to get to this point, which is being made possible by the leadership and investment from the government of British Columbia and our valued funding partners, the BC Cancer Foundation and the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer.”This lung cancer screening program supports other recent actions the government has taken to invest in early cancer diagnosis and treatment, including the addition of regional cancer centres at the second Surrey Hospital and Burnaby Hospital, and the expansion and investment in BC Cancer centres throughout the province with new state-of-the-art PET/CT scanners in Kelowna and Victoria.British Columbia was also one of the first jurisdictions to create a cervical and breast cancer screening program.Quotes:Benoit Morin, president and chief executive officer, Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) – “More people die of lung cancer than colon, breast and prostate cancers combined. With the new lung cancer screening program, we will have the opportunity to make a tangible difference in the lives of thousands of British Columbians, thanks to early detection and intervention. This program is an excellent example of what’s possible through meaningful, focused partnership. To that end, PHSA and BC Cancer are grateful for the support of Premier Horgan and Minister Dix, the BC Cancer Foundation and the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer.”Sarah Roth, president and chief executive officer, BC Cancer Foundation –“We are here to change outcomes for people who face cancer. Donors have driven innovation and research into lung cancer screening at BC Cancer for the past decade. Today, thanks to generous individuals across B.C., we raised $1.75 million for vital equipment and startup costs. We are proud to be a part of Canadian history, as the Government of B.C. launches the first life-saving lung cancer screening program.”Cynthia Morton, chief executive officer, Canadian Partnership Against Cancer – “I congratulate British Columbia’s Premier, Health Minister and the BC Cancer team for leading the way in committing to organized lung cancer screening. The partnership is proud to be part of this work, and we know that more provinces and territories will follow in the months ahead. This is groundbreaking news for all people living in Canada. Lung cancer kills more people than colon, breast and prostate cancers combined in Canada because it is often detected at a late stage. We can change this with organized screening programs for people at high risk of developing the disease. Implementing lung cancer screening programs is a priority in the Canadian Strategy for Cancer Control. The partnership acts as the steward of the strategy and works with partners to embrace proven, life-saving new approaches to detecting and treating cancer at the earliest stage possible. We will continue to work with our partners in all provinces and territories to see lung cancer screening programs available for people at high risk of the disease.”Quick Facts: Six British Columbians die of lung cancer each day. Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in Canada and worldwide. Lung cancer is the third most-common cancer in males and the second most-common cancer in females. Lung cancer primarily affects people aged 50 years and older. 70% of all lung cancers are currently diagnosed at an advanced stage, and when symptoms are already present.     "

This change ensures strata corporations have advanced warning of cost increases and has time to seek other insurance options if desired. As well, insurance agents will be required to disclose their commission amount, or a reasonable estimate, to strata corporations. Insurers who fail to meet these disclosure requirements face penalties of up to $25,000 for an individual or $50,000 for a corporation.  Lastly and effective immediately, referral fees to strata property managers from strata insurance transactions are prohibited. These changes will bring further transparency to the strata insurance market and help strata corporations maintain their financial sustainability by providing them the information they need to make informed decisions about their insurance needs.These amendments followed the interim report released by the B.C. Financial Services Authority (BCFSA) in June 2020. The report found that strata premiums have risen by approximately 40% throughout the province on a year-over-year basis, with deductibles experiencing up to triple-digit increases over the same period.The BCFSA will be releasing their final report and recommendations on the rising costs of strata insurance in B.C. in fall 2020.

The Province will also consider other bylaws as they are submitted.The Province is also laying the groundwork to allow local governments to ban certain types of plastic products. The Province is proposing to draft a new regulation under the Community Charter to allow local governments to ban single-use plastics, such as shopping bags, plastic straws and polystyrene foam take-out containers, without requiring provincial approval.“Every measure that prevents plastic from entering our ocean or removes it from our coasts and ocean is important,” said Chloé Dubois, president, The Ocean Legacy Foundation. “Policy measures like these are a crucial next step. I am thrilled to see our coastal communities lead the way with single-use plastic bans, as well as provincial regulations and policy supporting these and other laudable efforts to help reduce the estimated eight million tonnes of plastic that, on a global scale, enter the world’s ocean each year.”More than 35,000 responses to the CleanBC Plastic Action Plan engagement highlighted the need to move toward provincewide bans on certain products. The What We Heard report on the plan’s engagement is available onlne: https://cleanbc.gov.bc.ca/plastics“We will develop a legal framework to allow for provincial bans on single-use items, such as straws, take-out containers, shopping bags and other priority items. As we initiate this work, we will continue to consult to make sure solutions are manageable, take into consideration economic recovery and are phased in practically,” Heyman said. “We will also ensure that specific products continue to be available to people who live with a disability or need them for health reasons. We will align our actions with federal government initiatives if they occur on a reasonable timeframe.”In addition, the Province is expanding the number of single-use products to be recycled through industry-funded residential recycling programs, including plastic cutlery, sandwich bags, stir sticks and other items. Details on how residents can participate will be part of future consultations.The ministry is also exploring adding recycling programs for materials such as mattresses, electric-vehicle batteries, propane canisters and more. It will also look to improve recycling of packaging in the industrial, commercial and institutional sector. Additionally, feedback is being sought on how to address lost fishing gear that pollutes oceans and shorelines. A policy intentions paper has been posted on government’s engagement website to give stakeholders and the public an opportunity to review and comment on the proposed changes.Working with Encorp Pacific (Return-It), the ministry is introducing a minimum 10-cent deposit on all beverage containers. Also, for the first time, milk and milk-alternative containers are scheduled to be added to the deposit and refund system.“The changes to the B.C. Recycling Regulation reinforce B.C.’s leadership in protecting the environment and extended producer responsibility performance in Canada,” said Allen Langdon, president and CEO, Return-It. “These changes provide additional incentives and we encourage all British Columbians to participate by returning their beverage containers for recycling to improve recovery and keep plastics and other beverage containers out of our landfills, oceans and waterways. We commend the B.C. Ministry of Environment for its leadership.”The B.C. deposit-refund system has also been improved to allow for electronic refunds, making it even easier for British Columbians to recycle. As new cashless, low-touch Return-It Express systems continue to come online, consumers who drop off their tagged refundable beverage containers to select locations can have their refund processed electronically. Refunds can be sent to consumers’ bank accounts through e-transfer or donated to a community-based organization.These changes support the Province’s CleanBC efforts to prevent plastic waste, divert more waste from landfills and create a cleaner, better future for everyone. These and future efforts are being guided by feedback received from British Columbians. They also reflect the feedback received by Sheila Malcolmson, Parliamentary Secretary of Environment, during engagement in her role as special advisor on marine debris and abandoned vessels.“Last year, I toured many coastal communities to hear first-hand the challenges they are facing with marine debris, including plastics,” Malcolmson said. “Every person and organization I heard from, including local governments and First Nation communities, expressed their fears for the marine environment and their commitment to being part of the solutions.”CleanBC is a pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. CleanBC was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s emission targets.Quick Facts: B.C. is a leader in creating extended producer responsibility (EPR) recycling programs. It has more programs than any other jurisdiction in North America. B.C. has 22 industry-led EPR recycling programs covering 14 different product categories of consumer products, such as packaging, electronics and electrical products, residual solvents, beverage containers, tires and household hazardous wastes. 315,000 tonnes of plastics, such as those in electronics, beverage containers and other packaging, are already captured annually in B.C.’s EPR programs. Over the last 25 years, more than 20 billion beverage containers have been diverted from landfills and waterways in B.C.  Including single-use and packaging-like products in the EPR system is expected to capture millions of single-use plastic items annually. These include items like plastic cutlery and cups and packaging bought for home use, such as plastic sandwich bags.

130,2020-09-11 13:00:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020FLNR0058-001711,Government Website,Government embarks on new approach to old forests,"  The B.C. government is taking a new, holistic approach as a first step for the benefit of all British Columbians to protect old-growth forests.This will include the protection of nine areas throughout the province, totalling almost 353,000 hectares.In a break from the divisive practices of the past, government will engage the full involvement of Indigenous leaders and organizations, labour, industry and environmental groups to work together in conserving biodiversity while supporting jobs and communities, especially on the coast and Vancouver Island. The actions government is taking are informed by the independent panel report, A New Future for Old Forests.“For many years, there has been a patchwork approach to how old-growth forests are managed in our province, and this has caused a loss of biodiversity. We need to do better and find a path forward that preserves old-growth forests, while supporting forest workers,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “Those who are calling for the status quo to remain are risking crucial biodiversity loss, while those who are calling for immediate moratoriums on logging are ignoring the needs of tens of thousands of workers. Our government believes in supporting workers, while addressing the needs of old-growth forests, and these values will guide our new approach.”In July 2019, government appointed panel members Garry Merkel and Al Gorley to lead an old-growth strategic review. They gathered input and examined old-growth management from a variety of perspectives. On April 30, 2020, they submitted 14 recommendations to the Province in their report.Merkel and Gorley outline a four-phased process government should undertake to develop and implement an old-growth strategy. The strategy consists of immediate actions in the first six months, near-term actions over six to 12 months, mid-term actions over six to 18 months and long-term actions over 18 to 36 months.Initial actions government is taking in formulating an old-growth strategy include: engaging the full involvement of Indigenous leaders and organizations to review the report and work with the Province on any subsequent policy or strategy development and implementation; deferring old forest harvesting in nine areas throughout the province totalling 352,739 hectares as a first step, and committing to engaging, initiating or continuing discussions with Indigenous leaders; beginning work to address information gaps, update inventory and improve public access to information, and bring management of old forests into compliance with existing provincial targets and guidelines; and involving industry, environmental groups, community-based organizations and local governments in discussions regarding the report recommendations and the future of old-growth forests in B.C., and the social, economic and environmental implications for communities. ""Al and I appreciated engaging with people from all across the province in developing our recommendations,” Merkel said. “We have provided our recommendations to the minister and look forward to government’s response. We are also pleased that the Province has agreed that the first step in improving old-growth management is to adopt a government-to-government  approach with full involvement of Indigenous leaders, governments and organizations in proposed changes.”Further work is also underway to protect up to 1,500 exceptionally large, individual trees under the Special Tree Protection Regulation. This builds on government’s announcement in 2019 that it would develop a permanent approach to protecting big, iconic trees.“Through this work to manage old-growth forests, we have an opportunity to embrace our commitments under B.C.’s Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act and work together with Indigenous peoples in visioning on economic development and planning for land-based decisions that impact their territories,” said Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. “We acknowledge and respect the traditional knowledge of Indigenous peoples that has been cultivated over millennia, because it is critical to a future for old-growth forests that ensures Indigenous peoples and all the generations to come continue to benefit from them.”Learn More:Read the report: https://engage.gov.bc.ca/oldgrowthMore information about British Columbia’s commitment to forest stewardship is available at: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resourcesA backgrounder follows.

Dennis Sr. “By working in a respectful way with Huu-ay-aht to make upgrades to the Bamfield Road a reality, we see that the Province is ready to work on true reconciliation with First Nations and is honouring the importance of the safety of our community. We want to thank Premier John Horgan and Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation Scott Fraser for the commitment they made to this project. The upgrades they announced today will make Bamfield and Anacla safer places to live, and it will open up economic opportunities for our communities to prosper together in the future.”Funding for safety upgrades and hard surfacing the road with a seal coat will help make the road safer and more reliable. The project also supports the Huu-ay-aht vision for economic growth and diversification in the regional economy, supporting job creation for local businesses in forestry, tourism and construction.“We have worked in partnership with Huu-ay-aht First Nations on a solution that will make the trip to and from Bamfield and Anacla a safer one, helping to avoid heartbreaking tragedies and bringing peace of mind to everyone who travels the road,” said Premier John Horgan. “This project is part of our ongoing work to support a robust recovery from COVID-19 and a more secure future for British Columbians – built around people and strong, resilient communities.”After the fatal bus crash in September 2019, the Province struck a working group with Huu-ay-aht First Nations and local forest companies to explore safety and reliability upgrades and develop options for consideration.“Huu-ay-aht First Nations have been advocating for these road improvements for many years. Their partnership is central to this important project, which will support reconciliation goals, our treaty relationship and, most importantly, safer travel for Huu-ay-aht members to and from their community,” said Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation and MLA for Mid Island-Pacific Rim. “This project is also key to building the critical infrastructure the communities in this region need to thrive.”The road is the main transportation link between Port Alberni and the communities of Bamfield and Anacla for medical, emergency and community access for Huu-ay-aht First Nations members, Bamfield residents, forest companies and their employees, and tourists. It is also the key route to the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre.“The Province is honouring our Elders and the Nation’s sacred principles of ʔiisaak (Utmost Respect), ʔuuʔałuk (Taking Care of…), and Hišuk ma c̕awak (Everything is One) with today’s announcement. Our Nation was forever changed when Tayii Ḥaw̓ił Art Peters, my grandfather, was killed on the Bamfield Road,” said Tayii Ḥaw̓ił ƛiišin (Derek Peters) of Huu-ay-aht First Nations. “It is tragic that it took the loss of so many to highlight the need for chip-sealing the road, but we honour the ones we have lost by doing everything we can to prevent the loss of life along this vital link in the future.”The total cost of the three-year upgrade project is estimated at $30.7 million. The Province will contribute $25.7 million to the project. Huu-ay-aht will contribute the additional $5 million for the project and manage the project with technical support from the consulting firm Urban Systems. Huu-ay-aht will also provide in-kind resources, including gravel from gravel pits on their treaty lands, which are expected to result in significant cost savings for the project.In addition to safety improvements from the seal-coat hard surfacing, due to its smoother surface, the seal-coat will cut greenhouse-gas emissions by decreasing travel times. Better travel times are also expected to reduce costs for the region’s forestry sector by about $16 million over five years, by lowering fuel consumption and reducing wear and damage to vehicles. The road will also have improved drainage through new and upgraded culverts, which will greatly reduce the likelihood of closures due to flooding. Improved drainage will also mean better road reliability for residents, industry and tourists during the rainy season.Quotes:Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure –“We are pleased to see this collaborative approach will lead to upgrades as well as a hard surface of the road with a seal coat. This project will increase safety along Bamfield Road.”Lisa Beare, Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture –“Development of roads like the one to Bamfield add to our tourism infrastructure, encourage people to explore lesser-known areas in our province and disperse tourism dollars to more rural and remote communities. All of these factors contribute to the recovery of tourism in these areas and mean jobs for people in both the near and long term.”John Jack, chair of Alberni-Clayoquot Regional District –“This investment will produce generational benefits for the entire region, its neighbours and the Island as a whole. A road improvement like this will increase the health, economic and social prospects of both the Huu-ay-aht lands and Bamfield area. Connecting communities with transportation infrastructure will not only unlock the value in the lands, but also the potential in the people on the land even more.”Josie Osborne, vice-chair of Alberni-Clayoquot Regional District, and mayor of Tofino –“The safety and reliability of road access is always a top concern for rural and remote communities, so today’s announcement represents a very significant investment for residents and workers in Anacla and Bamfield. Living on the West Coast almost 50 years after the road from Port Alberni to Tofino and Ucluelet was paved, I know that the benefits of this investment will be felt for generations to come.”Bob Beckett, Bamfield director of Alberni-Clayoquot Regional District – “While today’s announcement is wonderful news for the entire Alberni-Clayoquot Region, on the eve of the first anniversary of the UVic bus crash last September, I must also acknowledge that nothing we have done or can do will erase the loss and pain that these families will live with the rest of their lives. I acknowledge and thank Chief Robert Dennis and the entire Huu-ay-aht Nation for their vision, leadership and investment, those from Bamfield and the regional district for their years of advocacy for improvements to the road and, of course, Premier Horgan and Minister Fraser for their support and ultimately approval for the project.”Sharie Minions, mayor, Port Alberni –“The lives lost on this road over the years have highlighted the need for this work time and time again. It’s important to remember that each tragedy has represented the loss of a family member — a child, or a sibling, a mother or a father. Today, we would like to thank Premier Horgan and the provincial government for remembering with us those who have been lost, and investing in this critical infrastructure to keep us all safe moving forward.”Jamie Cassels, president, University of Victoria –“The University of Victoria is incredibly grateful to the Huu-ay-aht First Nations and B.C. government for their partnership and investment to improve this essential travel corridor that is used by thousands of students from universities and other institutions to visit the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre, with its world-class research and learning opportunities. The families of students who were on the bus in last year’s tragic accident were clear in their desire for the road to be improved. All of us at the university welcome the safety and quality improvements to the road as we all work together so no one has to endure the loss of a loved one while travelling through this beautiful region.”Sean Rogers, director, Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre –“We were overjoyed to hear from Minister Fraser that the Province is partnering with Huu-ay-aht First Nations in support of our calls for safety upgrades to the Anacla/Bamfield road. This project will be transformational for the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre and ensure that generations have the opportunity for safe passage to experience life-changing exploration and discovery in this beautiful environment.”Jeff Zweig, CEO, Mosaic Forest Management –“As owner of portions of the road, we strongly support this investment to help manage the increasing traffic and make travel safer for all users. Congratulations to Huu-ay-aht on its leadership in working with the Province and landowners to develop solutions.”Shannon Janzen, vice-president, Partnerships & Sustainability and chief forester and TFL 44 board member, Western Forest Products –“Today’s announcement is a positive step forward towards enhancing this important transportation link for local communities and the Alberni Valley more broadly. Given the need for Huu-ay-aht citizens and residents of Bamfield to use the road, Western has supported communities’ requests to upgrade the road and we look forward to continuing to support our partners, the Huu-ay-aht First Nations, going forward.”Quick Facts: Huu-ay-aht First Nations, located in the Barkley Sound region on the west coast of Vancouver Island, are part of the Maa-nulth First Nations, which reached a treaty agreement with the federal and provincial governments in 2011. Since it opened for public use, eight Huu-ay-aht members have lost their lives on the Bamfield Main Road.

Canada’s infrastructure plan invests in thousands of projects, creates jobs across the country and builds stronger communities.”The four-lane interchange at 216th Street provides access to Highway 1 eastbound and westbound. It officially opened on Sept. 4, 2020. The interchange also supports active transportation in the region by providing new pedestrian and cycling access across Highway 1.“The Township of Langley has grown significantly in recent years, and safe access has been identified as a priority,” said Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “This new interchange provides an alternative crossing of Highway 1, relieving traffic congestion at the 200th and 232nd street interchanges and providing additional access to the freeway.”As part of this project, Highway 1 has been widened from four lanes to six lanes between 202nd and 216th streets. High-occupancy vehicle (HOV) ramps will be extended to and from 202nd Street. The HOV corridor is now continuous from Grandview Highway in Vancouver to 216th Street in Langley.“This much-anticipated new interchange is an important transportation link that will greatly enhance travel for residents, businesses and visitors,” said Jack Froese, mayor, Township of Langley. “Not only will it reduce congestion, create shorter commute times and move people and goods more efficiently throughout our region, the HOV lanes and improved access for walkers and cyclists will encourage people to make transportation choices that are better for the environment.”To accommodate the new interchange, 216th Street has been reconstructed and widened between 80th Avenue and Telegraph Trail. Noise-mitigation measures have been included on both sides of the highway and along the west side of 216th Street from the highway to 88th Avenue. Final works, including landscaping and cleanup, will be ongoing throughout September.The majority of project work on 216th Street north of the new interchange has been funded separately by the Township of Langley to a maximum of $5.3 million, including the widening of 216th Street to Telegraph Trail and the noise wall on the west side of 216th Street.The Highway 1 - 216th Interchange Project is valued at $61.9 million, with the Government of Canada contributing up to $22.3 million under the New Building Canada Fund’s Provincial-Territorial Infrastructure Component-National and Regional Projects. The Government of British Columbia contributed $27.3 million and the Township of Langley contributed $12.3 million.Learn More:More information on the Highway 1 – 216th Interchange project is available online: www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation/transportation-infrastructure/projects/highway1-216th    "

Drought condition maps throughout B.C. can be accessed at the provincial drought portal (link to portal below).Water conservation is everyone’s responsibility. Maximum water conservation is being urged for all areas where low flows are approaching a critical environmental flow threshold for ecosystems and fish. Residential, agricultural and industrial water users in areas affected by drought should observe all water conservation bylaws, watering restrictions and advice from their local government, irrigation district or water utility.General water conservation tips:At home: Limit outdoor watering. Do not water during the heat of the day or when it is windy. Consider planting drought-tolerant vegetation. Take shorter showers. Do not leave taps running. Install water-efficient showerheads, taps and toilets. On the farm: Implement an irrigation scheduling program using real-time weather data. Schedule irrigation to match crop needs and soil storage capacity. Improve water system efficiencies and check for leaks. Focus on high-value crops and livestock. Industry: Reduce non-essential water use. Recycle water used in industrial operations. Use water-efficient methods and equipment.

This community health centre is governed, owned and operated by Island Sexual Health Society, in partnership with Island Health.“Community health centres play a vital role in the communities they serve, as they help address the unique health needs of residents in the region,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “We’ve listened to the people in Victoria and included Island Sexual Health as an integral part of our primary care strategy to further improve access to primary care in the region. Thank you to Island Sexual Health and all partners for making this a priority in your community.”  Located at 101-3960 Quadra St., Island Sexual Health currently has 4.3 full-time equivalent (FTE) health-care providers, including registered nurses and general practitioners, who are providing sexual health care for more than 9,000 patients every year.As part of B.C.’s primary care strategy, Island Sexual Health Society will partner with Island Health to recruit approximately 10.9 FTE additional health professionals, including nurse practitioners, registered nurses, general practitioners, a counsellor and a community health worker. This enhancement is to include team-based, comprehensive primary care, and increased capacity and access to existing sexual health services.Once fully staffed, the centre will provide primary care services including chronic disease management, physical and mental health assessments, management of complex sexual health care, gender-affirming care, sexually transmitted infection testing, HIV treatment, wound care, treatment and support, immunizations and group programs and counselling.The fully staffed team of health-care providers is expected to provide more than 57,000 patient visits per year and will work to attach a minimum of 4,900 patients to a consistent primary care provider at the centre or in the community.“I am proud that our government is making a difference in the lives of people in Victoria by bringing Island Sexual Health Society into B.C.’s primary care strategy,” said Carole James, MLA for Victoria-Beacon Hill. “Residents will have improved access to the sexual health services and primary care they need.”Planning for an expanded space has started. Renovations are expected to be completed in fall 2020. Four additional examination rooms will be added to the centre, bringing the total number of examination rooms to 10. This includes a room equipped to provide virtual appointments and a large meeting space for group education and teaching sessions.To support the expansion of the Island Sexual Health Community Health Centre, the Province is providing annual, ongoing funding of approximately $2.6 million, as well as just over $1.1 million of one-time funding, through Island Health.“This provincial funding will not only ensure that people in Victoria continue to access the sexual health care they need, closer to home, but it will also give people more access to primary care services, something that is much-needed in the community,” said Rob Fleming, MLA for Victoria-Swan Lake. “It will amplify the great work that Island Sexual Health has been doing for decades.”Island Sexual Health Community Health Centre will also support primary care network planning in Victoria. It is the second community health centre in B.C. to be announced as part of the Province’s primary care strategy and the first one in Victoria. In June 2020, RISE Community Health Centre opened its primary location in Vancouver.Quotes:Mitzi Dean, MLA for Esquimalt-Metchosin –“This is great news for the community and the capital region as a whole. I’m looking forward to the expanded services that I know will make a real difference in the lives of thousands of residents in the region who rely on the Island Sexual Health Community Health Centre for necessary health-care services.”Leah Hollins, board chair, Island Health –“Island Health is pleased to be partnering with Island Sexual Health to expand its services for South Island residents. This innovative care model recognizes the vital connection between sexual health and primary care, and provides a person-centred approach to health-care delivery.”Bobbi Turner, executive director, Island Sexual Health –“Island Sexual Health is thrilled to participate in the Ministry of Health’s advancement of community health centres in British Columbia. This expansion not only allows us to continue providing valuable sexual health services for all community members, but also signals the renewal of Island Sexual Health as a full-service community health centre. We are truly grateful for the support of both the Ministry of Health and Island Health in making this possible.”Quick Facts:  Island Sexual Health Community Health Centre is a non-profit organization that has been serving the Greater Victoria region and Gulf Island communities since 1969. Island Sexual Health is not accepting external or self-referrals for primary care at this time. Further details will be available in late fall following clinic renovations. There are approximately 100 health-authority run community health centres and 30 community-governed community health centres in British Columbia. These centres focus on integrating services and programs in primary care, health promotion and community well-being, as well as work to address social determinants of health by linking with other social sector agencies and services.

These gains are offset by increased prudence to help B.C. weather the long road ahead.”The Province’s first quarterly report confirms revenue declines in taxation, natural resources and other sources that were anticipated in July. However, the overall impacts on revenues and expenses are lower, with a $5.7-billion decline from Budget 2020, compared to a $6.3-billion decline shown in the July scenario. Improvements from July’s update include better than expected employment gains, retail sales and housing activity, resulting in revenue gains in provincial sales tax, personal income tax and property transfer tax.The updated deficit forecast includes a $1-billion forecast allowance as part of government’s commitment to economic prudence in response to the heightened uncertainty brought by COVID-19.The first quarterly report also includes a summary of COVID-19 investments to date, with details of the $7.6 billion in COVID-19 response measures that have supported people and businesses since the beginning of the fiscal year.The COVID-19 Action Plan has included supports such as workers benefits, rent supplements, income and disability assistance supports, and economic recovery funding. Another $1.8 billion in temporary relief measures for people and businesses include supports such as the Climate Action Tax Credit, pandemic pay for front-line workers and the reduction of school tax for commercial properties.As part of the COVID-19 Action Plan, $1.5 billion has been earmarked for economic recovery measures to be announced in September.Learn More:To read B.C.’s First Quarterly Report, visit: www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/finances/reports/quarterly-reportsFor information about BC’s Restart Plan, visit: http://gov.bc.ca/restartbcTo learn more about the supports and services available for people, businesses and communities through the pandemic, visit: gov.bc.ca/covid19For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://covid-19.bccdc.ca/ Or follow the BCCDC on Twitter: @CDCofBCFor the provincial health officer’s orders, notices and guidance, visit: gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including travel, transportation and essential service information, call (toll-free) 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week, or visit: gov.bc.ca/Covid19A backgrounder follows.

137,2020-09-10 09:30:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020EMPR0046-001696,Government Website,Province invests in hydrogen to help transition to cleaner energy,"  The Government of British Columbia has allocated $10 million to the construction and operation of 10 hydrogen fuelling stations in the province, as well as three years of support for Hydrogen BC.Hyrodgen BC is a new entity of the Canadian Hydrogen Fuel Cell Association (CHFCA), with a focus on British Columbia.“For British Columbia to reach its CleanBC targets, we must shift how we produce and consume energy,” said Bruce Ralston, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources. “Hydrogen will play a significant role in B.C.’s sustainable energy future, generating environmental and economic benefits across the province.”The minister made the funding announcement on Thursday, Sept. 10, 2020, in Vancouver at f-cell+HFC 2020, an online conference where international specialists discuss solutions for clean energy focused on hydrogen and fuel cells.Hydrogen BC is a new provincial partnership that will co-ordinate stakeholders in the sector to promote and accelerate the use of hydrogen technologies in B.C., including fuelling stations and vehicles. Hydrogen BC operates as part of the CHFCA. Its membership is expected to be made up of automakers, major energy and industrial gas companies, hydrogen fuelling infrastructure suppliers, universities, non-governmental organizations, governments and fleet users, such as ports, carshares and transit agencies.British Columbia has the largest hydrogen fuelling network and the first public hydrogen fuelling station in Canada. There are currently three public hydrogen fuelling stations operating in the province (including one opened on June 25, 2020), with three more to open by the end of 2021. The three operating stations are in Vancouver, Burnaby and North Vancouver. The three stations under development are in Saanich, Kelowna and Burnaby.The development of hydrogen fuelling stations in B.C. helps the province achieve its targets in the Zero Emission Vehicles Act and supports its leadership in Canada with the highest per-capita electric-vehicle adoption.B.C. is home to world-leading hydrogen technology companies. The development of hydrogen fuelling stations leads to the development of good jobs. British Columbia’s zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) sector includes an estimated 250 companies that provide 6,000 full-time equivalent jobs (up by 2,150 from 2015) and contribute $600 million to the provincial gross domestic product (GDP) – almost double the 2015 GDP contribution of $373 million. Combined with indirect and induced economic impacts, the B.C. ZEV sector supports over 10,400 full-time equivalent jobs and contributes $1.1 billion to B.C.’s GDP. “Through our CleanBC climate and economic plan, we’re working with industry to support the transition to cleaner technologies like hydrogen to help meet our emissions reductions targets and support good jobs for people across the province,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “Sustainably produced hydrogen holds enormous potential to change the way we fuel our vehicles and address the challenge of clean, low-emission heavy-duty truck transportation as we work together to build a cleaner, better B.C. following the impacts of COVID-19.”The $10 million in funding comes before the fall 2020 release of a hydrogen strategy for British Columbia. The strategy will set out a vision for how B.C. will meet its clean energy goals by supporting the use of hydrogen to reduce pollution and will identify more job opportunities for British Columbians.Hydrogen plays an important role in B.C.’s sustainable energy future and provides opportunity for sectors to deliver safe and cost-efficient emissions reductions. Fuel production and refining sectors will be able to create less carbon-intensive fuels for use in B.C.’s existing infrastructure. The natural gas sector can blend hydrogen into natural gas distribution systems to reduce pollution associated with generating heat and hot water. The transportation sector can use hydrogen in fuel-cell electric vehicles to help replace diesel used in medium- and heavy-duty transportation.CleanBC is a pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. It was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s emission targets.Quote:Mark Kirby, president and CEO, CHFCA – “The CHFCA is pleased to continue and expand its collaboration with the B.C. government’s Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources to accelerate the deployment of hydrogen fuelling stations and zero-emission hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles in British Columbia. With ministry support, the CHFCA’s Hydrogen BC branch will engage the private sector and stakeholders, leveraging the additional $10 million funding for new hydrogen fuelling stations. This leads to at least 10 additional stations to complement the current seven stations in the province, and will ensure that B.C. stays at the forefront of the vital hydrogen energy and fuel cell sector, even as interest, activity and investment ramps up around the world.”Quick Facts: Shifting away from higher-emitting fossil fuels is essential if B.C. is to meet the CleanBC target to reduce emissions by 80% in 2050. Hydrogen alone has the potential to reduce the province’s emissions by 31% of the 2050 CleanBC target in the best-case scenario. Hydrogen fuelling takes three to five minutes for an average-sized tank. The range of light-duty hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles is 600 kilometres.

138,2020-09-10 07:00:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020TAC0048-001695,Government Website,KidSport Week 2020: volunteer shares community passion in the North,"  Ana Peasgood is the social media volunteer with the Prince George KidSport BC chapter, one of more than 300 volunteers in 150 communities.KidSport Week is celebrated Sept. 7-14, 2020. Peasgood shared how a community youth hockey event in Terrace sparked an almost decade-long desire to help children access community sport.“As a first-generation Canadian, our family didn’t have money to put towards sport when I was a child. But as a parent, I realized how important it was for children to have that positive relationship with their peers, their community and to see how sport can help children build confidence,” Peasgood said. “I watched a KidSport-supported team play hockey at a community event and noticed many of the children having fun and engaging with their friends. I wanted to make sure more children in my community had that opportunity, as some of our kids’ friends weren’t in sport, so I started to make donations through work.”Last year was another record year for the KidSport BC program. It provided $2.1 million in grants, enabling 7,248 children to access quality sport programming. On average, grants are approximately $250 per child. In the North, this means 15 children in Chetwynd, 121 children in Prince George and 37 children in Terrace were supported by KidSport BC chapters to access a season of organized sport in their community.  There are 41 community chapters in British Columbia. This includes the provincial chapter, KidSport BC, which serves regions and communities without chapters. Peasgood has had the opportunity to contribute to a few chapters, noting, “When we moved to Chetwynd, I saw a need in the community for a KidSport chapter and became the founding chairperson. Being involved with the program gave me a way to help, but it also gave me a way to get to know my new community and make new friends. When we moved to Prince George two years ago, I looked for another opportunity with KidSport. It is really rewarding to see the smiling faces of children when they are playing sports!”The Province has provided $400,000 annually to Sport BC to fund the KidSport BC program. In May 2019, government announced a one-time, $2.5-million investment over three years to Sport BC to expand KidSport programs. The investment was aimed at increasing participation by children who are often under-represented in sport, including children from lower-income families, Indigenous children, children and youth with disabilities, girls and newcomers to Canada.On the impact KidSport can have for children, Peasgood said, “I really feel KidSport is about capacity building for our youth. In addition to playing games, kids are gaining confidence, becoming leaders, and families are able to get sports experience for their children without the stress and burden of paying registration fees if they can’t afford it.”In Canada, one in three families can’t afford to register their children in sport. Only 7% of Canadian children and youth are meeting Canada’s guidelines of 60 minutes of physical activity. Peasgood notes the need is not specific to one area or community.“Having seen KidSport BC in a few communities, I realize support for kids to play sport is not a city thing or a Terrace thing, but a need all over the province,” Peasgood said. “When we fundraise, people want to contribute to what everyone sees as a positive thing for kids, for families and to make our communities stronger and healthier. We have a lot of resiliency in the North and we all come together.”KidSport BC is a community-based program created by Sport BC in 1993. It expanded to a nationwide program that provides grants for children 18 and under to participate in a sport season of their choice.Learn More:KitSport BC: https://www.kidsportcanada.ca/british-columbia/    "

The program will provide a path for approximately 3,000 applicants who may not previously have had health-care experience to receive on-the-job training. New hires in the program will start in a health-care support worker position and receive paid training that leads to full qualification as a health-care assistant.“It’s anticipated that up to 7,000 health-care workers will be hired this fall and winter,” Premier Horgan said. “We’re looking to people who have lost their jobs due to COVID-19, particularly those who were employed in the hospitality industry. They understand service. They understand the importance of treating people as individuals and they know it’s essential to treat people with respect and dignity. Those critical core skills, with our specialized training, will provide them with a rewarding, well-paying career that will make a significant and positive impact on our health-care system and the seniors who rely on it.”It is a massive human resources undertaking that benefits the B.C. health-care system and economy.“Expanding the number of health-care assistants in our province will significantly strengthen the level of care in long-term care homes,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “The Health Career Access Program will help people get trained for some of the most important jobs in B.C. These jobs ensure seniors get the quality care they need and deserve – 7,000 new health-care workers will make a huge difference in the lives of our seniors.”To further protect vulnerable British Columbians, the Province is providing $374 million to bolster public health measures, including significantly building out the fall flu immunization campaign. As part of this, 45,000 Fluzone-High Dose immunizations will be made available to all long-term care and assisted living residents. Fluzone-High Dose is a higher dose vaccine designed specifically to protect people over 65 from influenza. An additional 450,000 influenza vaccine doses will be made available in the 2020-21 influenza season, for a total of approximately two million doses.“The COVID-19 pandemic makes it more important than ever to protect yourself and your family from influenza,” said Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer. “By getting immunized against influenza, you’re protecting yourself and those who are vulnerable to complications from the flu. Staying healthy also helps to reduce strain on our health-care system as we deal with COVID-19. Getting the flu shot is safe and effective, and this year more than ever, I ask everyone who can to get a flu shot.”The Government of B.C. is also dedicating $42.3 million to ease the pressures off B.C. hospitals and reduce the chance of COVID-19 transmission in the hospitals. Hospital at Home, an innovative program that has succeeded in Canada and around the world, allows patients who meet the criteria to be offered 24/7 care at home rather than being admitted to hospital. Through in-person and virtual visits, patients will receive safe, effective care from nurses and physicians experienced in hospital medicine and acute care. Hospital at Home will launch through the Victoria General Hospital, then through additional hospitals over the coming months.The Health Career Access program, enhanced fall immunization campaign and Hospital at Home are vital new additions to the B.C. pandemic response, but do not stand alone. A constant focus is to ensure that strength is added where necessary, and that it supports or enhances existing initiatives.“On April 20, we announced help to rural, remote and Indigenous communities so they have access to critical health care during COVID-19 and beyond,” Premier Horgan said. “On Aug. 12, we announced we were hiring approximately 600 additional health professionals to increase contact tracing capacity. To date, 86 have been hired, approximately 200 are in the interview and offer stage, and the remainder are in the screening phase. Work to increase testing continues, and this fall, lab capacity will allow for 20,000 tests per day. The Ministry of Health also continues to ensure the Province is equipped with personal protective equipment (PPE).”Through its experience with COVID-19, the Province has learned and adapted to ensure its strengths and resources are developed and positioned to protect and keep safe those who are most vulnerable to the virus.“All of these initiatives support our ongoing efforts to keep British Columbians healthy and stop the spread,” Premier Horgan said.Learn More:To view the presentation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/COVID-19_capacity_modelling.pdfTo read the complete COVID-19 health-sector plan for fall/winter 2020-21, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/COVID-19_fall-winter_preparation.pdfFor more information on the Health Career Access Program, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/careersinhealthFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/ Or follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19 Or call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.Four backgrounders follow.

This will mitigate the need for lineups that formed hours, and even days, before stores opened. The pre-order window will close on Sunday, Sept. 13.“Every year, hundreds of people line up for the chance to purchase these sought-after wines as part of our annual Bordeaux release event,” said Mike Procopio, executive director, retail liquor, BC Liquor Distribution Branch (LDB). “This year, we’ve made a number of changes to ensure we can safely manage the number of people in our stores and can maintain physical distancing throughout the event.”Products with bottle limits are available for pre-order online, replacing the order forms handed out to customers lining up on the morning of the release. Participating stores throughout the province will open at 7 a.m. (Pacific time) on Saturday, Sept. 26, to further avoid congestion.While the quality of this year’s buy is as high as ever, the volume of wine overall is much lower due to the weather conditions during the 2017 growing season.“Thanks to the long-standing relationships we have with Châteaux and négociants in Bordeaux, we were able to source small amounts of our most desirable wines,” said Barb Philip, master of wine and category manager for BCLS.For savvy sippers hoping to take part in the event, Philip recommends the Château Lilian Ladouys, St. Estèphe ($55), Château Ferran, Pessac-Léognan ($39) or the Chateau Floridène, Graves ($45). At the other end of the affordability spectrum, the Duclot Bordeaux Collection Case brings together 12 of the top Bordeaux chateaux (all 97 points or higher) in one offering for $18,000.BC Liquor Stores are operated by the LDB, which contributes over $1 billion annually to the Province of British Columbia.  Its contribution helps provide financial support for vital public services, including health care and education.A backgrounder follows.     "

This agreement allows Saskatchewan, and our partner provinces, to communicate admissions’ priorities so they are in step with each province’s labour-market needs.”“The Manitoba government is pleased to renew our commitment to training in veterinary medicine and continue our long-standing partnership that provides high-quality education and training opportunities to Manitobans and helps meet labour market demand across the province,” said Ralph Eichler, Manitoba Minister of Economic Development and Training. “This is an important investment in Manitoba’s agriculture sector that aligns with needs under the Manitoba Protein Advantage Strategy. We need good veterinarians in place to help us practice safe animal welfare and keep growing animal agriculture in Manitoba.”British Columbia Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training Melanie Mark said, “There is an increasing demand for veterinarians and veterinary research across Western Canada. This agreement helps us focus on equipping students from the western provinces with the expertise to return and practise in their home communities, where they are in demand.”University of Saskatchewan Interim Provost and Vice-president Academic Melissa Just said, “The WCVM is built on collaboration, and its people and programs strengthen the University of Saskatchewan’s impact in everything from agriculture and animal health to comparative medicine and public health. We’re excited to see what it will achieve with the renewed support of its provincial partners and our university.”The WCVM is the premier centre of veterinary education, research and expertise in Western Canada and a key member of Canada's veterinary, public health and food safety networks. The internationally-accredited facility includes a veterinary medical centre, a provincial diagnostic laboratory and large-scale research facilities.The college’s new interprovincial agreement is in place until 2025.Find video greetings from Manitoba, British Columbia and Saskatchewan and University of Saskatchewan representatives at this link (wcvm.usask.ca) .

After years of underfunding and delay, we moved quickly to complete seismic upgrades at Cook, Tait and Ferris elementary and Boyd secondary schools,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “From the start, our government has made school seismic safety a priority, and these upgrades are another great example of the progress we’re making to improve schools for students in Richmond and throughout our province.”The B.C. government has invested a total $39.78 million in seismic upgrade projects at William Cook Elementary, Hugh Boyd Secondary, W.D. Ferris Elementary and Robert J. Tait Elementary, creating 2,405 seismically safer seats.“The Richmond Board of Education has made it a priority to ensure that our students and staff are learning in safe schools,” said Ken Hamaguchi, chair, Richmond School Board. “We are extremely proud to have added over 2,400 seismically safe seats in our district as a result of recent upgrades to Cook Elementary, Ferris Elementary, Tait Elementary and Boyd Secondary. These buildings will serve our local communities for years to come.”At William Cook Elementary, along with the seismic upgrades, four new classrooms were added, replacing a section of the school. Government has invested $13 million toward this project, creating 555 seismically safer student seats. The Richmond School District contributed $1 million.At Hugh Boyd Secondary, seismic upgrades and a partial replacement have created 800 seismically safer seats for students. The cost of the project was $10.7 million.At W.D. Ferris Elementary, seismic upgrades have created 660 seismically safer seats for students in the one-storey building. The cost of the project was $8.49 million.At Robert J. Tait Elementary, seismic upgrades have created 390 seismically safer seats for students at a cost of $7.59 million.“Our students and staff deserve to know that they will be safe in Richmond schools,” said Scott Robinson, superintendent of schools, Richmond School District. “We are extremely pleased with the nearly $82 million that the provincial government has invested in seismic upgrades at eight Richmond schools over the last three years. The progress that has been made with these facilities brings us significantly closer to our goal of having all students and staff in seismically safe schools.”Investments in seismic safety for students are a priority for the Government of British Columbia. Between 2010 and 2017, one school was approved for seismic upgrades in Richmond. In the last three years, government has announced nearly $82 million for seismic upgrades at eight Richmond schools, bringing almost 3,700 seismically safer seats to students in the district.These investments make sure that Richmond students will be safer in the event of an earthquake, giving families the comfort of knowing their children are learning in a secure environment.Provincewide, government has contributed over $1 billion for seismic upgrades and replacements at 50 B.C. schools, creating nearly 29,000 safer student seats. To continue this momentum, Budget 2020 includes a record $2.8 billion for school capital investments.Learn More:For more information about B.C.’s Return to School Plan, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/education-training/k-12/covid-19-return-to-school    "

Responsible Minerals and Metals Virtual Summit by highlighting the role that innovation will play in the future of responsible mining.While speaking online to representatives from industry, Indigenous Nations, environmental organizations, the investment community and government, Ralston announced $2 million in funding for MineSense Technologies Ltd. through the Province’s Innovative Clean Energy (ICE) Fund.“MineSense’s work is a great example of the type of made-in-B.C. innovation that supports our goal of responsible raw-material extraction,” Ralston said. “The future of mining in this province will require greater collaboration between B.C.’s tech and mining sectors, so that cutting-edge technology like this can help advance responsible mining.”The ICE funding will help the Vancouver-based company promote and sell its scalable digital-sensing platform. The platform gives mine equipment operators a real-time estimate of the ore grade at the point of extraction and enables mines to optimize metal recovery. The predictive on-bucket technology is being demonstrated on wire-rope shovels at the Highland Valley Copper Mine.Ralston also spoke about the Mining Innovation Roadmap, one of the recommendations stemming from the Mining Jobs Task Force. The roadmap will be a forward-looking, co-ordinated plan to address challenges and capitalize on opportunities presented by the transformation of B.C.’s mining sector, which is being driven by digitization, automation and workforce transformation. It will be released in the coming weeks.The three-day summit, hosted by the Province, is another recommendation of the task force. It will focus on the opportunity B.C. has to play an important role in the global movement to responsible sourcing of raw materials and the transition to a low-carbon economy. It also addresses the importance of environmental, social and corporate governance in the future of mining.The summit will continue with sessions on Sept. 15 and Sept. 30. The discussions that take place are expected to help to create an action plan for a responsible minerals and metals market strategy in B.C.Quotes:Michael Goehring, president and CEO, Mining Association of B.C. —“B.C.’s mining sector is well positioned to be a responsible supplier of choice in global metals markets, given our low-carbon footprint, high environmental standards, community engagement practices and leadership in advancing economic reconciliation with Indigenous Nations.”Jeff More, president and CEO, MineSense Technologies Ltd. —“The ICE Fund has been instrumental to supporting our work to bring new, sustainable technology to the mining industry here in B.C. The culmination of this funding is our technology now fully operating at two mines, to both increase their profitability and reduce their environmental footprint.”Quick Facts: B.C.-based MineSense is a pioneer in digital mining solutions, providing real-time, sensor-based ore sorting for large-scale mines. MineSense received additional funding from partners, including Sustainable Development Technology Canada (SDTC).  This project is one of many funded jointly by ICE Fund and SDTC that is part of B.C. and Canada’s three-year, $40-million Joint Call Partnership. The partnership was launched in March 2017 to support the development of pre-commercial clean energy projects and technologies. The Mining Jobs Task Force was launched in 2018 to find ways to strengthen B.C.’s mining industry and the communities that benefit from mineral exploration and mining. The task force is built from a diverse membership, including First Nations, industry, an environmental non-governmental organization, labour, post-secondary/training, the financial sector and municipal government.

We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There are three new health-care facility outbreaks at Burnaby General Hospital and Rideau Retirement Centre in the Fraser Health region, and at Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility, which is a second outbreak. In total, 11 long-term care or assisted-living facilities and three acute-care facilities have active outbreaks.“There have been no new community outbreaks, although there continue to be community exposure events.“Alerts are posted on the BC Centre for Disease Control’s (BCCDC) website, as well as on health authorities’ websites, providing details on where the potential exposure occurred and what actions to take – whether you need to self-isolate or monitor for symptoms.“As we get back to work and back to school this fall, it is the time for all of us to cut back on our social interactions to reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19 for ourselves and everyone around us.“Keeping our household contacts and our controlled work and school groups safe means having few contacts with people we don’t know.“Whether it is a private party in someone’s home or going to a nightclub, the potential to transmit the virus is the same.“The location may be different, but the risks in these uncontrolled environments are similar – being indoors, in close face-to-face contact with a number of people for an extended period of time, and in many cases, with alcohol.“In recent weeks, public health teams have been heavily focused on responding to community clusters and exposure events in these higher-risk, uncontrolled locations that have been a major source of transmission since the start of our Phase 3 reopening.“Despite weeks of effort by public health teams, these venues are creating significant risk to everyone in B.C., and making it more challenging to protect those who are most vulnerable to serious illness.“We need to ensure our public health teams are able to take care of everyone in British Columbia in the weeks and months ahead. As a result, the provincial health officer’s order on bars, nightclubs and banquet halls has been amended. Effective today, all nightclubs and stand-alone banquet halls are ordered closed until further notice.“Liquor sales in all bars, pubs and restaurants must cease at 10 p.m. and they must close at 11 p.m., unless providing a full meal service, in which case they may stay open, but may not serve liquor until 11 a.m. the following day.“Music or other background sounds, such as from televisions in bars, lounges, pubs and restaurants, must be no louder than the volume of normal conversation.“Now is the time for all of us to go back to our smaller, safer social interactions, especially if our households are increasing our interactions in other ways.“This is the balance that we all need to find if we are going to weather the storm of the respiratory season ahead that will inevitably create added complexities for all of us. Let’s use this time to close the gaps that have emerged, recommit to keeping our wall strong and protect ourselves and those around us.”Quick Facts: Assisted living, long-term care homes and seniors’ rental buildings with ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks are as follows: Vancouver Coastal Health Holy Family long-term care facility (second outbreak) Point Grey Private Hospital long-term care facility  Fraser Health Bear Creek Villa independent-living facility Cherington Place long-term care facility Czorny Alzheimer Centre long-term care facility Derby Manor long-term care facility George Derby Centre long-term care facility KinVillage assisted-living facility MSA Manor long-term care facility (second outbreak) New Vista Care Home long-term care facility Normanna long-term care facility   Learn More:To find the provincial health officer’s orders, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topics/covid-19-novel-coronavirusFor the latest modelling information presented on Sept. 3, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/COVID19_Going_Forward_Sept_2020.pdfTo see a map of COVID-19 cases by local health area, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/dataIf you are experiencing symptoms, find a collection centre near you to get tested: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testingIf you have plans this weekend, follow Dr. Bonnie Henry’s Good Times Guide: https://goodtimes.gov.bc.ca/For mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca Or: www.anxietycanada.comFor a listing of the community exposure events, go to: BCCDC (flights, work sites, etc.): http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/public-exposures Fraser Health: fraserhealth.ca/covid19exposure Interior Health: https://news.interiorhealth.ca/news/public-exposures/ Island Health: https://www.islandhealth.ca/learn-about-health/covid-19/outbreaks-and-exposures Northern Health: https://www.northernhealth.ca/health-topics/outbreaks-and-exposures Vancouver Coastal: http://www.vch.ca/covid-19/public-exposuresFor the second monthly progress report on B.C.’s surgical renewal plan, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020_surgical-renewal-commitment-progress-report-June-July-2020.pdfFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/ Or follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19 Or call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit: Facebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews  YouTube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBC    "

In West Kelowna, it means improved access to same-day primary care for more than an estimated 41,000 people living in the region.”The West Kelowna UPCC is a collaboration led by Interior Health and includes the Westbank First Nation, the City of West Kelowna and the District of Peachland.It is anticipated that the health-care team will include general practitioners, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, social workers, physiotherapists and medical office assistants. Once fully staffed, the centre will provide care for more than 27,000 patient visits annually. Patients will be seen by the team of health-care providers and will be able to self-refer to the UPCC for care.The West Kelowna UPCC will deliver urgent and primary care services to people who need to see a health-care provider, but do not require a trip to the emergency department. Basic laboratory tests will also be available.Importantly, the centre will also work to connect patients without a family doctor to a physician or nurse practitioner for ongoing primary care – either at the centre or in the community. Attachment will be provided by collaboration with the Central Okanagan Division of Family Practice.The centre will also support attachment for patients over the next few years to a regular primary care provider, either at the centre or in the community.When the centre begins seeing patients this fall, its hours of operation will be from 11:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.This is the 19th UPCC that has been announced under the government’s primary care strategy, 17 of which are open. Of those, five centres are in the Interior Health region, including in Vernon, Kamloops, Kelowna, Castlegar and West Kelowna.Quotes:Dr. Doug Cochrane, board chair, Interior Health –“The new urgent and primary care centre will have a significant impact for patients and families by increasing access to local health services for area residents. The team-based approach to care means people living in West Kelowna and on Westbank First Nation land will have added support for their immediate and long-term health needs. This centre will also work with vulnerable populations, providing primary care services to people where they live.”Chief Christopher Derickson, Westbank First Nation –“The UPCC continues to remain an important fixture in supporting the various medical needs of our Members and residents. The new facility will support an enhanced provision of service to our community, which has been underserved to date, and will continue to support reconciliation within the region. During these challenging times, it will further provide a greater level of care to all British Columbians who face challenges in our society, and we are happy to see this step taken.” Dr. Kathleen Ross, president, Doctors of BC – “We look forward to the integration of the West Kelowna UPCC in hopes it will strengthen primary care in the community and ensure people there have access to the health-care services they need, while also supporting long-term relationships between patients and their family doctor.”Michael Sandler, executive director, Nurses and Nurse Practitioners of BC –“Nurses and Nurse Practitioners of BC are pleased to see that the knowledge, skills and expertise of the entire health-care team will be utilized to improve access to health care for all British Columbians through urgent and primary care clinics. We believe that this approach will be pivotal in ensuring B.C. families can access health-care services, and we are excited to see the opening of another urgent and primary care clinic in B.C.”Learn More:To learn more about the Province’s primary health-care strategy, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018PREM0034-001010To learn more about the Province’s strategy to increase the number of nurse practitioners, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018HLTH0034-000995To learn more about the Province’s strategy to recruit and retain more family medicine graduates, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018HLTH0052-001043A backgrounder follows.

B.C. welcomes this final extension and encourages additional options to help small businesses that have been impacted by the pandemic.“As the CECRA program will be extended through the month of September, the Province’s emergency order protecting eligible businesses from being evicted continues. The restriction will remain in place for the duration of the federal rent assistance program.“I encourage all commercial tenants and landlords to work together on this – for eligible landlords to apply for the assistance program when their tenants cannot make rent, and for small businesses to support their landlords to complete the application.“Rent relief and eviction protection for the hardest-hit businesses, along with some of the measures our government has already put in place, will help small businesses with recovery and support the reopening of B.C.’s economy.“In British Columbia, we provided approximately $700 million in property tax relief by reducing most commercial property tax bills by 25%, the only province to provide this level of relief. We also postponed late penalties for commercial property taxes, giving businesses and landlords more time to pay their reduced property tax bill without penalty.”Learn More: To apply for the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program, visit: https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/finance-and-investing/covid19-cecra-small-businessFor information on all provincial and federal supports available to B.C. businesses, visit: https://covid.smallbusinessbc.ca/hc/en-usFor a link to eviction regulations, and the commercial tenancy order, visit: https://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/mo/mo/2020_m179    "

Here2Talk is a 24/7, free service that is available to post-secondary students across the province no matter where they are – because access to mental health services shouldn’t depend on where you live or the size of your bank account.”Improving mental health in post-secondary institutions is an integral part of government’s actions outlined in A Pathway to Hope, B.C.’s roadmap for making the system of mental health and addictions care better for people no matter where they live in the province. Implementing A Pathway to Hope is a shared priority with the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts: Hundreds of students around B.C. provided feedback and ideas that were used to develop and tailor Here2Talk to deliver the kind of help students felt they needed.

And with space for 900 students, it will be able to grow with the region for years to come.”The existing school has been replaced with a fully accessible, modern building on the same site. It was built to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold standards. The interior will include collaborative learning spaces to support B.C.’s new curriculum.Students were able to remain in the existing school while the new school was being built.“We can’t wait to be able to welcome everyone in,” said Tim Bennett, chair, Prince George board of education. “So many things were thought of in the construction of this building – how it’s laid out, how it allows for authentic collaboration between classrooms. Of course, it’s energy efficient. Every room has its own heating and cooling system, every classroom has multi-level lighting perfect for learning. So many details were thought of in the building of this school that it is truly going to be a state-of-the-art building for students, staff and community.”Shas Ti means “grizzly trail” or “grizzly path” in the Dakelh dialect of the Lheidli T’enneh First Nation. In the spirit of reconciliation, the school’s dual name honours the extended history of the Lheidli T’enneh in the region and the more recent history of Kelly Road Secondary school.This investment is part of government’s work to build new and expanded schools in fast-growing communities throughout B.C.Quick Facts: Since September 2017, the Province has announced over $2.1 billion for school capital projects.

The building will be managed by VARS, which has identified affordable rental housing for seniors and families as a priority in the community following a needs assessment in 2016.“Valemount Affordable Rentals Society is extremely excited to see this project move forward,” said Riette Kenkel, president, VARS. “We would like to thank our funders, our community, our consultants and our volunteers for their ongoing efforts and determination in moving this much-needed project forward. We are focused on ensuring that the construction will be completed as quickly and as smoothly as possible and look forward to adding to Valemount’s affordable housing inventory.”Construction started in August 2020 and is expected to be complete by summer 2021.“For the community of Valemount, these units represent a significant addition that will enhance the lives and well-being of many seniors and families, enabling them to affordably live in quality homes,” said Johnny Strilaeff, president and CEO, Columbia Basin Trust. “We thank all the partners involved and especially recognize the efforts of the Valemount Affordable Rentals Society for helping to make the Columbia Basin a viable place to live, work and play.”Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts: The project’s total capital budget is approximately $4.27 million.

Thank you to all of the allies who make this important work possible. To students taking the courageous step forward to improve your literacy – congratulations, I’m very proud of you.” Sept. 8 is International Literacy day as founded by UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) in 1966. The first event was held in 1967. Celebrations take place around the world to remind the public of the importance of literacy as a matter of dignity and human rights.In 2020-21, $2.9 million will be provided to 69 organizations that will deliver 94 Community Adult Literacy Programs (CALP) in over 80 communities throughout the province. This funding includes a one-time top up of $500,000.These programs are provided free of charge and typically accessed through schools, Indigenous friendship centres and community centres in partnership with public post-secondary institutions. For many adult learners, literacy programs are an important first step in an educational journey to post-secondary studies.“Adult literacy programs change the course of people’s futures. We see this every single day. Through this funding, adult learners gain essential skills for improving their daily lives and they set the foundation for better outcomes for themselves, their families and their communities,” said Margaret Sutherland, executive director, Decoda Literacy Solutions, the only provincewide literacy organization in British Columbia to provide service and support to over 400 communities.A CALP typically includes one-on-one tutoring and small-group instruction and support for all levels of literacy from basic to high school completion. This year, as a result of COVID-19, the majority of programs have had to move online.The government’s support of community-based literacy programs is part of its commitment to connect people with the education and training they need to succeed.On Aug. 8, 2017, the Province made adult upgrading and English language learning programs in B.C. tuition-free.Quick Facts: In 2018-19, CALP provided services to more than 4,600 learners: 18.3% identified as Indigenous; 68.8% female and 31% male; 39.9% employed, 39% unemployed and 15.1% retired; and 46.4% had previously completed some post-secondary education or training.  More than 35% of working-age people do not have the literacy skills they need to achieve their goals, to function and thrive in the modern economy, and to develop their knowledge and potential. In addition to difficulties with reading and writing, 52% of adults in B.C. have difficulty in accomplishing some daily living tasks due to limited numeracy skills. Numeracy challenges can include difficulty calculating interest on a car loan, using information on a graph or calculating medicine dosage. The difference between adult literacy and Adult Basic Education programs is that community literacy programs are informal and non-credit. They are focused on literacy and numeracy with life skills and employment preparation programs delivered in the community, so students feel at home and more comfortable.

You are having a positive impact by helping British Columbians, especially youth, to build their literacy skills, so they have the tools they need to succeed.”Based in Victoria, Story Studio Writing Society started in 2011. Its facilitators bring together kids of all ages with authors and illustrators. Together, they produce around 1,500 youth-authored books annually, creating a memorable experience for each young writer. Story Studio volunteers, writers and illustrators have worked with almost 10,000 youth, taking a unique, fun and creative approach to improve their literacy skills and build self-confidence.  While working at the community level, Story Studio recognizes marginalized or lower-income families’ needs, as 80% of its programming is focused on supporting and engaging vulnerable youth. To maximize its accessibility and resources, it partners with a broad range of community organizations, including the Greater Victoria Public Library (GVPL) and Royal BC Museum. It has worked directly with Victoria, Saanich and Sooke school districts. Its facilitators lead workshops for teachers, parents and other adult learners, with the purpose of inspiring others to support youth writing and storytelling. Story Studio is a registered charity, supported primarily by individual donations and grants.Story Studio is currently running an innovative program with GVPL to mentor teen writers. The studio has more than 40 writers working in its online workshops, and their work will be collected and published in a collection in early September 2020. In August, with the help of last year’s COFLA award winner Morie Ford, the studio offered online workshops to a small group of immigrant mothers new to B.C. in the Family Literacy Outreach program in Vancouver. By the end of the program, each mother will create a short story that she can read to her young child.The Council of the Federation, which includes all 13 provincial and territorial premiers, created the literacy award in 2004. Presented in each province and territory, the award celebrates outstanding achievement, innovative practice and excellence in literacy. Story Studio will receive a certificate signed by Premier John Horgan, a Council of the Federation Literacy Award medallion and $500.“We're delighted to be recognized for the important work of our staff, volunteers and donors,” said Sarah Tarnopolsky, board chair, Story Studio. “Stories help us process the present and imagine the future. Given the challenges our communities face, it’s now more important than ever for youth to be given the skills and space to tell their stories. That’s what Story Studio is here to do.”The Province supports literacy in partnership with Decoda Literacy Solutions. Decoda provides resources, training and funds to support community-based literacy and learning initiatives in more than 400 communities throughout British Columbia.“We congratulate Story Studio Writing Society as the recipient of the 2020 Council of the Federation Literacy Award,” said Margaret Sutherland, executive director, Decoda Literacy Solutions. “Story Studio inspires, educates and empowers youth through storytelling. It is wonderful to see this fun and creative approach to improving literacy skills honoured.”Quick Fact: Since 2001, the B.C. government has invested more than $1.5 billion in literacy and literacy-related initiatives for British Columbians.

Our government will continue to stand up for your health, equality and security, especially during the pandemic.“We are following through on our promise to raise the minimum wage and make changes to the Workers Compensation Act to better support injured workers. We’ve taken the lead on establishing a national paid sick leave program so workers can stay home if they’re sick. And as we restart our economy, we need to make sure it works for everyone – not just the people at the top.“To all those who continue to work during this crisis: thank you and happy Labour Day!”For French, Punjabi and Chinese translations, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020PREM0049-001673#translation    "
158,2020-09-06 13:00:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/factsheets/bc-government-takes-action-to-make-mining-safer-for-workers,Government Website,B.C. government takes action to make mining safer for workers,"  I want to take the time to celebrate the people working in B.C.’s mining sector, for their continued hard work, especially this year, during the COVID-19 pandemic. I applaud their efforts to work every day in a safe and sustainable way, to help build an economy that works for people.Labour Day is an important annual reminder of the hard-fought battles for workers’ rights; led in many cases by the unions representing these workers. Overtime pay, parental and sick leave, job security and protection from discrimination and harassment, as well as safety standards, are the result of a shared vision amongst those willing to take up the fight, a belief that all working people deserve to be treated fairly.I am very proud of the recent actions of our government when it comes to strengthening the mining sector for people in B.C.Last month, we brought in changes to better protect workers, communities and the environment that support mining and mineral exploration. The changes we introduced as part of B.C.’s Mines Act also make permitting and regulation more efficient and effective. This allows our government to better support the mining sector as we work together on our economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.For too long, the Province didn’t have enough oversight when it came to mining practices. That’s why some of the changes we’ve made strengthen the Province’s ability to hold mines accountable with greater investigation authorities. We are making it clear what is considered an offence and lengthening the amount of time an offence can be considered for charges from three years to five years. The amendments also formalize the role of a new Audit Unit, with the job of ensuring B.C.’s mining regulations are effective and in line with global best practices.Our changes also create more room for the chief inspector of mines to focus on mine health, safety and enforcement by establishing a new chief permitting officer, whose sole responsibility will be mine permitting. Efficient permitting and meaningful oversight are at the core of what my ministry does. Having distinct roles with dedicated responsibilities for each function will create an attractive mining industry in our province that is well resourced to meet world-class safety standards.Mining is an important part of our economy and our government will keep working hard to support workers, communities and the environment.       "

This gives the Resort Municipality of Whistler more autonomy over future planning and land use, and will allow all parties to participate and have their interests’ reflected.“The framework agreement is a significant and meaningful step in continuing to build a government-to-government relationship with the Lil’wat Nation and Squamish Nation,” said Jack Crompton, mayor, Resort Municipality of Whistler. “The framework agreement aims to establish a co-operative relationship in the spirit of reconciliation for the purpose of addressing topics of mutual interest and to raise awareness and understanding. The Resort Municipality of Whistler looks forward to continuing to work with the Squamish Nation and Lil’wat Nation on building this relationship.”After many years of discussions, the parties established a foundation for future planning, land use and economic development that meets the needs and interests of those in the Whistler region. The framework agreement includes economic development opportunities for the Nations and a land exchange.Many B.C. regions that have a tourism-based economy, like Whistler, are pleased to welcome visitors with safety measures in place. Everyone travelling in B.C. is reminded to be respectful of the communities they visit by sticking to some simple travel guidelines: check travel advisories before leaving, stay home if sick, clean hands frequently, keep a safe physical distance from people and wear a mask when that is not possible.Quotes:Political Chief Dean Nelson, The Líl̓wat Nation - Ku̓kwpi7 Skalúlmecw – “The Líl̓wat Nation would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Resort Municipality of Whistler on their 45th anniversary. The Nation looks forward to being an active partner in the resort’s future through the recently completed umbrella and framework agreements which recognize the significant Indigenous history and presence on the land.” Syeta'xtn (Chris Lewis), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish) Nation Councillor and Spokesperson – “This anniversary and agreement represent a new chapter in the history of skwikw (also known as Whistler, ‘the place of the marmot’) and a shared commitment of reconciliation with the Squamish and Lil’wat Nations. It signals to the world that reconciliation has an essential economic component that fosters and realizes enhanced relationships between all levels of government, and that First Nations’  participation in economy and cultural initiatives, including economic development opportunities, is essential.”Quick Facts: On Sept. 6, 1975, the Resort Municipality of Whistler was incorporated. The signed framework includes development opportunities for the Squamish and Líl̓wat Nations, including a land exchange between the Nations and the Resort Municipality of Whistler, and potential collaborations on employee housing. As a result of the agreement, a land exchange will take place between the Kadenwood land (Resort Municipality of Whistler owned) and the Emerald land (Nation owned). As part of the agreement, the requirement of ministerial approval of Whistler’s official community plan has been removed from the municipality’s planning process, making it consistent with local governments throughout British Columbia. Whistler’s official community plan was approved June 16, 2020, by the Province, with the support of the Squamish and Líl̓wat Nations and adopted by council.

While each centre offers unique supports tailored to the local Indigenous community, individuals are able to access: legal advice and representation for criminal and child protection matters; advocacy and support in dealing with agencies such as the police and Ministry of Children and Family Development; referrals to relevant agencies and services such as counselling or employment support; information towards better transitions from jail and integration into the community; and restorative justice options to better support and address the needs of those impacted by a crime. “We are driven by the idea of justice through self-determination,” said Douglas White III (Kwulasultun), chair, BCFNJC. “Our model is to ensure the Indigenous justice centres reflect the priorities and unique needs of First Nations in each respective region. The Indigenous justice centres are a transformative pillar of the First Nations Justice Strategy that we expect will make a significant difference in the experiences of Indigenous peoples with the justice system.”The Province is currently working with BCFNJC to determine locations for the other centres throughout B.C, with the council planning to develop up to 15 centres over the coming years.“This partnership with the BC First Nations Justice Council is a strong example of the work we are doing in collaboration with Indigenous communities across B.C. to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,” said Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. “As we continue to work towards a more inclusive and just society, these Indigenous justice centres will play an important role in ensuring that Indigenous voices and perspectives are meaningfully reflected.”These centres are part of a broader First Nations Justice Strategy that was launched in March 2020. This strategy was created in consultation with First Nations communities throughout B.C and reflects their vision and priorities to transform B.C.’s justice system.Quotes:Brian Holmes, president, Nicola Valley Community Justice Services Society –“The Indigenous Justice Centre in Merritt represents two First Nations coming together – Syilx and Nlaka'pamux – to serve all Indigenous peoples in the Nicola Valley. We work with Elders from every community, and we will rely on their guidance to address priorities such as working closely with Corrections Services to support transitions to home communities.”Bill Pavich, executive director, Prince George Urban Aboriginal Justice Society –“Our partnership with the BCFNJC to open the Prince George Indigenous Justice Centre is the latest step to achieve our mandate, which is to decrease the number of Indigenous peoples involved in the judicial system.”April McLean-Collart, chair, Prince Rupert Aboriginal Community Services Society – “The Prince Rupert Indigenous Justice Centre meets a critical need in the region to provide access to justice and, specifically, legal advice for Indigenous peoples.”Learn More:For more information about the BC First Nations Justice Council, visit: www.bcfnjc.comTo read the BC First Nations Justice Strategy, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/First_Nations_Justice_Strategy_Feb_2020.pdf    "

I know living through the pandemic is a worry for all of us. But I know many people, especially students, are excited about heading back to school, to connect with teachers and friends.Health experts predict we will be living with COVID-19 for months to come. We must show young British Columbians that’s it’s ok to be concerned, but it’s also ok to keep learning and growing and stay connected to school and friends.Schools are going to look different this year, schedules are going to be different and classrooms are going to be different.What has not changed is our government’s commitment to the health and safety of students and staff. Our ministry and schools are taking science-based, public-health advice and planning to have as many children as possible back in classrooms this September.Schools are the best places for students. There is no substitute for in-class learning and, more than that, we know there are unintended negative consequences when children are not in school for extended periods of time.To support schools during this pandemic, we have provided a new, one-time provincial investment of $45.6 million in COVID-19 specific funding to ensure our schools are safe for students and staff. We have ordered 1.5 million reusable face masks – that’s two masks for every student and staff member. We have provided funds to school districts to buy more cleaning supplies, to hire more custodial staff and to enhance and expand handwashing stations.Plus, the federal government is supporting our efforts with an additional $242.4 million. This funding will support school districts to hire more teachers and support staff to help students whether they are learning remotely or in the classroom, to purchase more software licences and electronic course materials or textbooks, to help supply computers or tablets for the families who need them and to create additional Wi-Fi hubs in remote and Indigenous communities, or provide internet access for families.This funding will also allow schools to expand their health and safety measures, improve ventilation in buildings, purchase more personal protective equipment, install plexiglass barriers and hire even more custodial and support staff. Every dollar of the provincial and federal funding will benefit students in B.C.School districts are reporting the majority of students are heading back to the classroom. For those who are not, I’ve directed school districts to be flexible and work with families to provide remote options that keep children connected to their school community.The pandemic has upended our world. Many families have been making sacrifices to support their children with learning in the spring and throughout the summer, and I thank them.I also thank teachers and education assistants who have been getting their classes and lesson plans ready; principals, vice-principals and school administrators who have connected with families to make sure they know about learning groups and what to expect in the classroom; and school support staff who are doing everything needed to keep schools clean and safe.Our government is steadfast in its promise to work together with school communities, to respond quickly and appropriately throughout the pandemic and to focus on health and safety while delivering the highest quality education possible to students who deserve us to be at our best now and always.B.C. remains one of the safest places in the world because we are in this together. Let’s continue to look out for each other – working and learning safely in school this year.    "

The replacement of lighting along provincial highways and roadways with LED fixtures is part of its new and improved electrical maintenance standards, which include: replacing all non-LED lighting with the energy-saving LEDs; increased routine maintenance to address increased electrical inventory types; and streamlined processes for administering non-routine work and new installations. The ministry awards contracts to private companies to maintain electrical infrastructure along approximately 47,000 kilometres of provincial highways and roadways, providing an essential service to the people who live and work in the province. Each contractor is responsible for repairs and maintenance of overhead/streetlights, traffic and pedestrian signals, and tunnel and snowshed lighting, as well as electronic signs and web cameras.Raylec Power LP assumed responsibility for electrical maintenance under the new and improved standards on Vancouver Island as of Tuesday, Sept. 1, 2020. The electrical maintenance contract will be effective until Aug. 31, 2025, with an option for a five-year extension.All five regions will assume the new and improved electrical maintenance standards by 2022, through a staggered open-bidding process.The ministry works closely with all contractors and WorkSafeBC to ensure health and safety are maintained for all workers on site.B.C.'s provincial health officer has directed construction employers to take all necessary precautions to minimize the risks of COVID-19 transmission and illness to themselves and their employees. Anyone exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms, such as sore throat, fever, sneezing or coughing, will be directed to self-isolate at home for at least 10 days.Learn More:For more information on the ministry's electrical maintenance contracts, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation/transportation-infrastructure/contracting-to-transportation/highway-bridge-maintenance/electrical-maintenanceFor travel precautions due to COVID-19, visit: http://ow.ly/jBGu50yVMRO    "

CFN’s nine communities and at least 50 workers will develop action plans to clean up to 200 kilometres of priority areas in their territories.  “At least 3,500 kilometres of shoreline will be patrolled and inspected for debris. Shoreline cleanups not only remove existing debris from important habitat, they also prevent the subsequent formation of microplastics in the ocean,” said Chief Marilyn Slett, president, Coastal First Nations (CFN). “The CFN’s Regional Monitoring System, which ensures a standardized approach to data collection for monitoring coastal regions, will be used to track efforts and collect information on what is removed.”The CFN will work with local stewardship offices and coastal guardian watchmen, conducting patrols along the shoreline to identify areas to prioritize for debris removal.“This initiative demonstrates that reconciliation can be about taking action together to create a healthier environment and stronger communities,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. ""The shorelines of B.C.’s north and central coasts are remote and difficult to access. Debris cannot be allowed to continue to degrade habitats that are critical to both marine species and wildlife on the land, and to local food security.”The Clean Coast, Clean Waters Initiative Fund is helping establish meaningful partnerships and collaboration with Indigenous, rural and urban communities. The fund provides a broad range of jobs, from entry level clean-up crews, to community educators, to highly specialized technical positions, such as people trained in collecting oceanographic data.“This partnership builds on the leadership and stewardship of the Coastal First Nations and strengthens our relationships as we work together to clean up our shorelines, protect marine life and create jobs in local communities,” said Sheila Malcolmson, Parliamentary Secretary for Environment. “This funding reflects the calls to action on ocean plastics we heard from British Columbians.""A key focus of the initiative is targeted to marine and shoreline debris clean-up efforts in remote locations. The focus will be on those areas accessible from the Coastal First Nations communities: Bella Coola, Bella Bella, Rivers Inlet, Hartley Bay, Klemtu, Kitkatla, Metlakatla/Prince Rupert, Old Massett Village and Skidegate Village.This is the second partnership under the Clean Coast, Clean Waters Initiative Fund, set up in response to priorities identified during the consultation with coastal communities on marine debris. The Province earlier announced funding to small ship tour operators and the Wilderness Tourism Association for shoreline clean-up expeditions along the shores of the central coast. The funding is part of the B.C. government’s far-ranging Pandemic Response and Economic Recovery initiative supporting all sectors that have been hit hard by the COVID-19 crisis.Quick Facts: Globally, it has been estimated that one garbage truck of plastic waste enters the ocean every minute, totalling eight million tonnes every year. In 2019, the Great Canadian Shoreline Clean-up removed 163,505 kilograms of shoreline debris in Canada, a 47,076 kilogram increase from 2018. Just under half of the collected debris in 2019 was removed from B.C. shorelines (77,836 kilograms).

We’re working together with districts across the province to ensure every student can learn in a seismically safe school as soon as possible.”The Ministry of Education contributed $25.8 million to the Langley Secondary project, and the Langley School District added $426,000. The project included seismic upgrades and a partial replacement to the school, creating 800 safe seats for students in grades 9 to 12.“We are pleased to have the project completed,” said Megan Dykeman, chair, Langley School District Board of Education. “As a board, we continue to advocate for seismically safe schools. We know these upgrades will help facilitate a safe and inspiring learning environment for our students.”In addition to new safety and learning upgrades, Langley Secondary has a new look. Construction has also removed hazardous materials, upgraded fire-suppression systems and improved accessibility. Additionally, the partial replacement has linked previously separated sections into a unified whole.Langley families strongly support the continued use of the school. The school district led extensive community consultation on the seismic upgrades and partial replacement. Because it receives students from six elementary schools, Langley Secondary plays a central role in the community.“Parents want to be able to send their child to school and know the building is safe,” said Michael Hylands, president, Langley Secondary School’s Parent Advisory Committee. “Starting the school year in an enhanced learning space enables our students to focus on their work without worrying about the building they are in. I know our students and parent community are looking forward to continuing to work with the district and Province on improvements for our school.”Investments in student safety are part of the Province’s work to accelerate the Seismic Mitigation Program, ensuring every B.C. student can attend a seismically safe school as soon as possible.Quick Facts: Since September 2017, the Province has announced over $1 billion for seismic upgrades or replacements at 50 B.C. schools, creating almost 30,000 safe student seats, with many more to come. To continue this momentum, the Ministry of Education has another $925 million allocated for high-risk seismic projects in Budget 2020.

Several portables will be removed from nearby schools or converted to other uses as a result of the new facility. Construction for the school, originally scheduled to open in January 2021, was completed ahead of schedule. The school has capacity for 505 students in kindergarten to Grade 6. The facility will help to accommodate the growing population in Fort St. John, providing a better learning experience to even more students.  “Last week, I had the opportunity to do a walk-through of the school. My excitement grew as I envisioned students operating in the bright learning spaces,” said Helen Gilbert, chair of the Peace River North board of education. “The building will facilitate inquiry teaching and hands on learning. The opening of this school has created opportunity in other elementary schools for the creation of new learning spaces. I can hardly wait to visit once students and staff have brought the building to life. All our schools will reawaken on Sept. 10.”The two-storey facility includes a neighbourhood learning centre with child care, before- and after-school care and multi-purpose spaces for community use.“As the population of Fort St. John continues to grow, so does the need for more quality, licensed child care spaces,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “By investing in child care spaces on school grounds, we can help busy families with pickups and drop-offs and help young children develop a lifelong appreciation for learning.”In September 2018, the new Ma Murray Community school opened to accommodate 365 students. With the new Anne Roberts Young Elementary school also ready for students, the Peace River North School District has the K-6 school capacity needed to serve Fort St. John’s families.  These investments in new schools are part of government’s commitment to address the need for more student spaces in fast-growing communities, ensuring every B.C. student has better access to education, community services, recreation and culture.Quick Facts: In the last three years, government has announced over $2.1 billion for 101 school capital projects, creating nearly 29,000 seismically safe student seats and more than 13,000 new student seats at new and improved schools throughout B.C.

The services will be administered virtually or in the clinic, as needed, by a team of health-care providers, including nurse practitioners, registered nurses, social workers and mental-health clinicians.Over the next three years, approximately 6,800 people living in Surrey who have been without a primary care provider will have regular, reliable access to a nurse practitioner.The clinic began intake on Aug. 10. As of Aug. 31, 224 patients have been registered and will soon receive faster access to health-care supports. “Nurse practitioners are highly skilled professionals that can prescribe medications and order and interpret tests, helping us address the doctor shortage,” Dix said. “We are listening to people in B.C., and that is why we are creating clinics led by nurse practitioners to meet the daily health-care needs of a rapidly growing and aging population. Thank you to the dedication and collaborative work of the Association of Nurses and Nurse Practitioners of BC, Fraser Health, the Surrey-North Delta Division of Family Practice and our community partners to make the opening of this primary care clinic a reality.”The Axis Primary Care Clinic is the second nurse practitioner primary care clinic opened under the primary health care strategy and the first of its kind in the Lower Mainland. It is one of three facilities open in Surrey under the same strategy. The city’s first urgent and primary care centre opened in Whalley in November 2018 and the second centre opened in Newton in May 2020.Once the clinic is fully operational, the B.C. government will provide annual operating funding of approximately $2 million, as well as one-time startup costs of $754,400.The opening of the Axis Primary Care Clinic marks a significant supplement to health-care services in Surrey, bringing meaningful change into the lives of people in the region.  Learn More:To learn more about the Province’s primary health-care strategy, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018PREM0034-001010To learn more about the Province’s strategy to increase the number of nurse practitioners, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018HLTH0034-000995To learn more about the Province’s strategy to recruit and retain more family medicine graduates, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018HLTH0052-001043To access services at the new Axis Primary Care Clinic, residents of Surrey can complete a patient intake form by visiting: https://www.npclinics.ca/axis/Two backgrounders follow.

Currently, Highway 101 passes through both Gibsons and Sechelt where it travels through 11 signalized intersections.“A safe, efficient Highway 101 is essential for people who live, work and travel on the Sunshine Coast,” said Nicholas Simons, MLA for Powell River-Sunshine Coast. “There are many opinions about how a bypass or alternative route could improve highway travel, and I look forward to leading public consultation in the coming year as we explore this idea further.”The Joe Road/Orange Road intersection on Highway 101 is one of the busiest unsignalized intersections between Gibsons and Sechelt, providing a connection to Lower Road and many residential properties on either side of the highway. It is also one of the most collision-prone locations in the study area.To make this intersection safer for people, the ministry is starting engineering work on a project to install protected left-turn lanes eastbound and westbound, creating an easier and safer way for drivers to turn left. Also, adjustments to the overall geometry of the intersection will be made to further enhance safety. It is expected that construction will take place in summer 2021.The Highway 101 Gibsons to Sechelt Corridor Study explored options to improve the safety and operations of the corridor and was undertaken from March 2019 to August 2020.  Recommendations from the study include short-, medium- and long-term improvement options to improve safety and efficiency along the corridor.Learn More:The Highway 101 Gibsons to Sechelt Corridor Study is available online: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=057FD5AED014431C91F4BFDF18DCC188    "

Pending municipal approvals, construction is expected to begin in December 2021.“This is yet another contribution by the Province to help solve the housing challenges in the capital region,” said Lisa Helps, mayor, City of Victoria. “We look forward to moving this development through the municipal approvals process as quickly as possible as our way to support the provincial government in the great work they’re doing to provide supportive housing across our region. A special thank you goes to Minister Robinson, the team at BC Housing and the city staff who have worked with them to make these projects a reality.”As with all supportive housing, an experienced non-profit housing provider will be hired to manage the building. The housing will be comprised of self-contained studio homes. Residents will be provided with 24/7 on-site staff and support services, including meal programs, life and employment skills training, and health and wellness support services.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts: The B.C. government provided approximately $1.8 million through the Building BC: Supportive Housing Fund to purchase the property. There are approximately 480 new homes in development or already open for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness in the Capital Regional District (CRD).

We are delivering a new, modern hospital on a standalone site, a project that will increase necessary services, help retain health-care professionals and bring jobs to the region. The South Peace region, its patients and health-care workers deserve nothing less.”The new hospital will be approximately 19,400 square metres (209,000 square feet) and will have 70 beds, an increase of 24, all of which will be in single rooms with ensuite washrooms.A new emergency department will be double the size of the existing one, with treatment spaces increasing from 10 to 13. The existing emergency department has approximately 18,000 visits a year. The new emergency department will be able to accommodate approximately 25,000 visits a year.Space for a laboratory and diagnostic imaging will also be part of the new facility.New moms and families will be supported through a maternity unit including labour, delivery recovery and post-partum rooms and a nursery.Mental health service delivery will be brought up to modern standards with a new inpatient suite and an increase of beds from 15 to 18.There will also be a non-denominational spiritual room for use by people of all faiths and cultures.The new hospital will continue to provide a range of surgical services as well as chemotherapy, ambulatory care, radiology, clinical support and pharmacy services. The project cost is approximately $377.86 million and will be shared by the provincial government, through Northern Health, and the Peace River Regional Hospital District.Approximately 1,500 direct jobs and 900 indirect jobs will be created during construction.Future use of the current site will be determined after the new hospital is finished and in operation.With government approval of the business plan, the project will now proceed to procurement. Construction is expected to begin late 2021 and the new hospital is anticipated to be open to patients in fall 2025.Northern Health has identified the hospital for renewal since 2008. The Dawson Creek and District Hospital Master Program and Master Plan was completed in December 2013. Northern Health submitted a concept plan for a redeveloped hospital in September 2015, but it did not move forward. Northern Health provided an updated plan in March 2018, which was approved by government in May 2018.Quotes:Colleen Nyce, board chair, Northern Health – “The replacement of Dawson Creek and District Hospital is a capital priority for Northern Health. Thanks to the collaboration with the Province of B.C., the Peace River Regional Hospital District and the City of Dawson Creek, a new hospital will soon take shape. This new facility will increase space and improve workflow for staff and physicians – and better serve the health-care needs of people in the South Peace.”Brad Sperling, chair, Peace River Regional Hospital District – “As chair of the Peace River Regional Hospital District Board, I would like to thank the Province of B.C. for approving this much-needed facility for the people of northeast B.C. We appreciate the vision of Northern Health to see the need of providing an innovative, new hospital with extended services and capacity rather than rebuilding on the previous facility. I would lastly like to thank the Regional District board of directors for its unwavering commitment to improving the health care for the people in the Peace region.”Quick Facts: Business planning finalizes details, such as scope, budget and timelines. Opened in 1960, Dawson Creek and District Hospital has 46 beds and serves a region with a population of approximately 26,000. Services include emergency, surgical, maternity, mental health and substance use and cancer care. There are also a laboratory and diagnostics.     "

Feedback was received between Jan. 27 and May 17, 2020.The intentions paper was government’s response to concerns heard during ALR engagement sessions in fall 2019. Both the public and stakeholders stated more options for small additional residences were needed.The paper outlined policy options under consideration for small additional residences that continue to maintain government’s core objectives under the Agricultural Land Commission Act. These policy options preserve and encourage the use of ALR land for agriculture.To allow time for the development of new regulations, the grandfathering period for manufactured homes in the ALR is being extended to July 31, 2021. Landowners in the ALR will have until then to obtain the required permits and authorizations to place a manufactured additional residence for immediate family on their property, without having to apply to the Agricultural Land Commission.The ministry is working to develop regulatory changes that are consistent with the intentions paper. Learn More:What We Heard from Consultations with Local Governments and Public Feedback on Residential Flexibility: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/agriculture-seafood/agricultural-land-and-environment/agricultural-land-reserveMinistry of Agriculture Policy Intentions Paper: Residential Flexibility in the ALR: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/agriculture-and-seafood/agricultural-land-and-environment/agriculture-land-reserve/residential_flexibility_intentions_paper.pdfSupporting B.C.

From Tuesday, Sept. 1 to Dec. 20, 2020, hunters are required to submit the heads of mule deer and white-tailed deer harvested in specific wildlife management units (4-1, 4-2, 4-3, 4-4, 4-5, 4-6, 4-7) along the southern B.C. border in the Kootenay region for CWD testing. Drop-off locations may be found online: www.gov.bc.ca/chronicwastingdisease.caWhile this disease has not yet been detected in B.C., 64 animals (white-tailed deer, mule deer and moose) in the area around Libby, Mont. have been discovered with the disease since June 2019. This was the first time CWD had been detected west of the Rocky Mountains.  CWD is a progressive, fatal nervous system disease that affects members of the deer family (cervids). The disease is caused by an abnormal protein and can spread when a healthy animal comes into contact with an infected animal or an environment (soil, food or water) contaminated with CWD. The disease is not known to affect humans or animals other than cervid species.  The Province has been monitoring for the disease since 2002. The Peace and East Kootenay regions have been targeted as high-risk areas for disease entry due to the disease's presence in Alberta and Montana. B.C. will continue testing samples for the disease to ensure the Province’s CWD-free status and inform any additional response.  The provincial Wildlife Health Program is also calling on hunters in other parts of the province, especially the Peace region, to bring deer, moose and elk heads to drop-off locations for CWD testing.  Anyone encountering an animal exhibiting the symptoms of CWD (thin, drooling, poor co-ordination, stumbling) should report it to the provincial Wildlife Health Program at 250 751-3219 or the Report all Poachers and Polluters hotline at 1 877 952-7277.

The project will showcase the valuable contributions of the Punjabi community in B.C. to its economy, history and culture, and the community's resilience in the face of injustice and discrimination.“British Columbians need opportunities to learn more about the people that comprise our diverse and multicultural society,” said George Chow, MLA for Vancouver-Fraserview. “The Punjabi Canadian Legacy Project will provide great insight into a unique part of our province’s history, help build intercultural connections and foster respect and appreciation among people of all backgrounds.”The project will continue to be developed over the next few years to include: provincewide digitization of South Asian Canadian collections, including artifacts, photos, texts, materials, oral histories and other resources for the online South Asian Canadian Digital Archive; creation of a travelling exhibition on South Asian Canadian history; documentation and marking of sites that are of historic importance to South Asian Canadians and B.C. communities; development of Punjabi Canadian learning resources for social studies curriculum in B.C. schools; research and development of an online comprehensive B.C. Labour Movements Social Histories Research Project; and production of a public history book - South Asian Canadian Social History Project. “Education is key to fostering a greater respect and appreciation for one another across our multicultural society,” said Satwinder Kaur Bains, director of the South Asians Studies Institute at the University of the Fraser Valley. “A primary goal of the project is to improve the historical record of the significant contributions of Punjabi Canadians, with the goal to reduce racism while underscoring the value of B.C.’s diverse society.”The development of Haq and History: A Punjabi Canadian Legacy Project was led by the Punjabi Legacies Advisory Committee with South Asian Canadian community partners in Golden, Prince George, Vancouver Island, Kelowna, Vancouver, Surrey and Abbotsford. This project is consistent with the call for development of educational resources on the histories and contributions of racialized and Indigenous communities in B.C., heard during the government’s community consultations on racism and hate in the summer of 2019.Quick Facts: Established in 2015, the primary purpose of the Punjabi Canadian Legacy Advisory Committee is to support and develop ways to preserve, explore and share the contributions of South Asian Canadians. To date, projects completed under the committee include: the development of new educational materials for the Royal BC Museum’s Punjabi Pioneer Food History Project, consultations throughout the province with South Asian Canadian families and the creation of the South Asian Historic Places Project, an inventory of South Asian heritage sites with Heritage B.C. According to the latest census from Statistics Canada, 363,885 (8%) of British Columbians identified their ethnic origin as South Asian, with 38,725 (1%) specifying Punjabi.    From 2014-18, police-reported hate crime increased in B.C. and South Asian Canadians were consistently among the top five racialized communities reporting incidents.

Funding will be allocated to public school districts based primarily on student enrolment. B.C.’s Ministry of Education is initially allocating $101.1 million to school districts, $8.0 million to independent schools and reserving $12.1 million for emerging COVID-19 related issues between September and December 2020. The ministry is expected to receive up to an additional $121.2 million in January, which will be allocated out at that time.On Aug. 26, Fleming directed school districts and independent schools to contact all families in their school communities to confirm if they planned for their child to attend school classes in September or if they would need remote learning options. Over the past week, schools have reported that the majority of students are returning to full-time, in-class instruction. However, some families are looking for remote options and transition programs.The funding will support school districts to hire and train more teachers and support staff for remote learning; purchase additional software licences, electronic course materials and textbooks; purchase computers or tablets; and create Wi-Fi hubs and internet access in remote and Indigenous communities.School districts and independent schools will be able to spend the funding in the following areas, based on local needs:Learning resources and supports Implementation of online and remote learning options Hiring additional teachers and staff Training for staff On-call teachers costs and other on-call staff Mental health support for students and staff Health and safety Increasing staff and covering salary costs for additional hours needed to meet health and safety guidelines in schools Improving air systems in schools, such as heating, ventilation and air conditioning improvements, portable air scrubbers and increased utility costs Increasing hand hygiene, including additional handwashing and hand sanitizing stations, installing touchless faucets or additional supplies Installing plexiglass and other barriers, providing outdoor learning spaces, and adapting classrooms and school buses to minimize physical contact Purchasing additional cleaning supplies such as sprayers or fogger machines for frequent cleaning and disinfecting high-touch surfaces Purchasing additional masks, face shields or other PPE as needed Transportation Cover additional transportation costs to have fewer students on buses and/or to accommodate new school schedules and additional routes Supporting alternative transportation strategies, such as assisting with gas costs for parents who transport their children to school Before- and after-school child care Opening up more space and covering the cleaning costs for before- and after-school care so that groups can be smaller and to ensure students can remain within their learning groups Additional staff to support before- and after-school care during the pandemic These one-time provincial and federal COVID-19 funding investments build on the record levels of funding schools are already receiving, with $546 million of new money in B.C.’s Budget 2020 for K-12 education.Quick Facts: The federal government has committed to provide provinces and territories $2 billion in new federal funding to support the adaptation of the education sector to ensure a safe return to class in the fall.   B.C.’s Ministry of Education has developed a five-stage approach to operate schools, depending on risk of transmission and guidance from the provincial health officer. This helps school districts know what to expect if there is a significant change to school operations required as part of B.C.’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

By removing the extra 2%, renters living in a $1,320-per-month apartment, which is the cost of the average two-bedroom rental unit in B.C., will save up to $317 next year, and people living in an average two-bedroom apartment in Vancouver will save about $420.For manufactured-home park tenancies, the rate is 1.4%, plus a proportional amount for the change in local government levies and regulated utility fees.This system ensures property owners are able to make investments and repairs to maintain safe housing, while ensuring rent increases are moderate and predictable.B.C. landlords can increase rent only once per year and must provide tenants with three full months’ notice using the correct notice of rent increase form.To protect renters who have experienced income loss during COVID-19, the Province is continuing to maintain rent freezes until December 2020. Any tenant who received a Notice of Increase for 2020 that would have gone into effect after March 18, 2020, should continue to pay their current rent until Nov. 30, 2020.Since 2018, the Province has taken a variety of actions to make the residential tenancy system fairer and work better for everyone. This includes: changing the laws to provide stronger protection for renters facing eviction as a result of renovations or demolitions by increasing compensation for bad-faith evictions, strengthening requirements for eviction notifications, allowing more time to find alternative housing and giving renters the right of refusal to return to a unit following renovations; updating tenancy laws to close what is known as the fixed-term lease loophole, eliminating the geographic rent increase clause and better protecting people living in manufactured home parks; investing $6.8 million in new funding for the Residential Tenancy Branch to reduce wait times for tenancy disputes, hire new staff to reduce wait times and address backlog, and create a new compliance unit to take action against serious offenders; and improving the Rental Assistance Program and Shelter Aid For Elderly Renters to give families and seniors on fixed incomes a break from rising costs.

It will also help create jobs and growth as B.C. recovers from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.The Broadway Subway will provide fast and frequent SkyTrain service to B.C.’s second-largest jobs centre, health-care services, an emerging innovation and research hub, and growing residential communities.“As we restore the economy through BC’s Restart Plan, major infrastructure projects like the Broadway Subway line will be key to our recovery,” said Premier John Horgan. “When completed, the Broadway Subway will transform how people get around in Vancouver. It will mean faster travel to work and school, better access to local business and fewer cars on the road.”The contract with the Broadway Subway Project Corporation to design, construct and partially finance the Broadway Subway Project is valued at $1.728 billion. Construction will begin in fall 2020, with the line in service in 2025.“Public transit allows Canadians to get where they need to go in affordable and environmentally friendly ways,” said Joyce Murray, MP for Vancouver Quadra, on behalf of Catherine McKenna, federal Minister of Infrastructure and Communities. “It’s great to see another important step reached in building the Broadway Subway, which will introduce a convenient new green transportation option along one of the city’s busiest corridors. Canada’s infrastructure plan invests in thousands of projects, creates jobs across the country and builds stronger communities.”The Broadway Subway is a 5.7-kilometre extension of the Millennium Line from VCC-Clark Station to Broadway and Arbutus in Vancouver. Six new underground stations will connect communities and neighbourhoods to make it easier and more affordable to live, work, shop and access services along Broadway.“The Broadway corridor is the second-largest employment centre in B.C. with more than 85,000 jobs, but growing traffic congestion and transit overcrowding are impacting economic growth and the quality of life for our residents,” said Kennedy Stewart, mayor of Vancouver. “With construction starting soon, we are closer to making an amazing street even better. This project will better the lives of families and workers, and further connect an essential hub to the rest of the region.""Once opened, the commute from VCC-Clark to Arbutus Station will take 11 minutes, saving the average transit commuter almost 30 minutes a day and relieving traffic congestion along Broadway.“The Broadway Subway is being constructed along the busiest bus corridor in our region, which was also home to the most used bus route in Canada and the United States last year,” said Kevin Desmond, CEO, TransLink. “This important project will transform the region’s transportation network, reduce congestion and improve travel times for our customers.”Transportation Investment Corporation (TI Corp) is leading the delivery of the Broadway Subway Project on behalf of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. TI Corp will provide the controls, practices and other oversight that are essential for this complex project.The project will be delivered under the Province’s Community Benefits Agreement (CBA). Through the CBA, the project will increase training and apprenticeship opportunities and prioritize hiring locals, Indigenous peoples, women, people with disabilities and other traditionally under-represented groups, including youth, who want to build a career in the skilled trades. BC Infrastructure Benefits is responsible for implementing the CBA for the project and will be the employer for the majority of the skilled workforce on the project.The Broadway Subway project budget is $2.83 billion, funded and delivered by the Government of B.C., with contributions from the Government of Canada and the City of Vancouver. The Broadway Subway project is a key part of the rapid transit program in Metro Vancouver’s Mayors’ Council 10-Year Vision.

This new space is being designed to allow for the unique ways in which Indigenous laws have been and are being practised — incorporating ceremony and oral traditions — all within a culturally relevant space and expected to meet LEED Gold standards. This is a historic step toward reconciliation and will be a positive legacy for social, economic and environmental justice.”The new addition will be home to the world’s first joint degree in Indigenous legal orders and Canadian common law (JD/JID), which launched at UVic in 2018, and to the Indigenous Law Research Unit. The 2,440-square-metre (26,264-sq.-ft.) addition to the Anne and Murray Fraser (Law) Building is designed to reflect and honour the law school’s location and long-standing relationship with the Songhees, Esquimalt and WSÁNEĆ peoples on whose territory the university resides. The project will use Coast Salish designs, signage, public art and materials such as B.C. wood, cedar weaving and natural light.“Supporting the University of Victoria’s world-leading Indigenous law centre and programming is another example of how B.C. continues to advance reconciliation with Indigenous peoples in a meaningful way,” said Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. “Education is key to reconciliation. Through this knowledge, we must come to understand the past and can work together to support healing to make a real difference in the lives of Indigenous families and everyone in B.C.”New high-tech digital infrastructure will enable students to connect with their home communities and also enable sharing of legal traditions with one another. It will also enable UVic to host conferences, public workshops, research and partnerships for faculty, students and visitors. The new addition will include public lecture theatres, faculty and staff offices, classrooms, meeting space, an Elders’ room and spaces for gathering, ceremonies and sharing of histories and knowledge.“The National Centre for Indigenous Laws will be home to the first Indigenous law program in the world to combine the intensive study of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous law, and will help Canada build a new nation-to-nation relationship based on the recognition – and renaissance – of Indigenous legal traditions,” said Jamie Cassels, president and vice-chancellor, UVic. “We are grateful to the provincial and federal governments that helped establish this unique Indigenous law program at UVic and to the Law Foundation of BC for its generous donations today.”The $27.1-million project is being funded by the Province ($13 million), the federal government ($9.1 million) and the Law Foundation of BC ($5 million).In 2019, B.C. was the first province or territory to pass legislation to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. This new legislation provides a path forward on reconciliation – one that respects Indigenous peoples’ human rights and creates clarity and predictability for all people in British Columbia.Improving access to post-secondary education and reconciliation with Indigenous peoples are shared priorities between government, the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and are part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Learn More:The joint degree program in Canadian Common Law (JD) and Indigenous Legal Orders (JID) combines intensive study of Canadian Common Law with deep engagement with Indigenous laws: www.uvic.ca/law/about/indigenous/jid/index.phpFind out more about the Fraser Expansion at UVic: https://www.uvic.ca/campusplanning/current-projects/indigenous-law/Two backgrounders follow.

Canada's Infrastructure plan invests in thousands of projects, creates jobs across the country and builds stronger communities.”The new ferry will be ready for service in early 2023, and will more than double the capacity of the MV Balfour, which it will replace. The MV Balfour will be retired from service.“This is an exciting milestone for a project that will significantly benefit the entire region,” said Michelle Mungall, MLA for Nelson-Creston on behalf of Claire Trevena, B.C.’s Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “The new, cleaner ferry will move more people more efficiently, improving community connections and local economies.”The new ship will be able to accommodate up to 55 vehicles and, used in tandem with the larger MV Osprey 2000, will reduce sailing waits during the busy summer months. The vessel will be fully converted to electric propulsion by 2030, once shore power is installed and reliability of the technology advances for use on a daily basis.As part of CleanBC, the Province is working to electrify the inland ferry fleet by 2040. The new vessel will be configured as a hybrid diesel-electric with all the systems, equipment and components for electric propulsion. The new ferry will contribute to improved safety, reliability and efficiency of the Kootenay Lake Ferry service. Other related work planned includes upgrades to Balfour and Kootenay Bay terminals, and minor dredging has been completed in the West Arm.The Kootenay Lake Ferry Service Improvements project is funded in part by the Government of Canada through the New Building Canada Fund’s Provincial-Territorial Infrastructure Component-National and Regional Projects.Learn More:Kootenay Lake Ferry Service Improvements project: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation/transportation-infrastructure/projects/kootenay-lake-ferry-projectCleanBC: www.cleanbc.gov.bc.ca    "

It includes machine and hand clearing, as well as prescribed burns.“People are facing the risks connected to climate change and preparing their communities to respond. Reducing the risk of wildfires is one of the actions communities can take to safeguard public health and safety,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “This project and others like it create opportunity and provide jobs through economic recovery from COVID-19.”FESBC funding of nearly $1.3 million in 2019 has allowed the corporation to clear close to 240 hectares since the project began last fall.“The contractor is working with experienced crews from local First Nations communities, and with the slowing of the local forest economy, they also employed laid-off loggers,” said Joanne Doddridge, director of economic development and planning, District of 100 Mile House. “The public has been, overall, supportive. The development corporation is aware of the impact of implementing the treatments so close to residences. We are striving to minimize the impact on these neighbourhoods, while creating fuel breaks to enhance public safety and reduce wildfire risk.”Much of 2019 was spent doing mechanical harvesting and piling treatments, followed by manual work where crews prune trees, thin out small stems and pile debris. This summer, crews laid out areas for prescribed burns and prepared for mechanical clearing. Manual treatment options may be delayed due to COVID-19 related restrictions.Activities for this field season will take place north and south of Horse Lake. Work will also include the completion of activities in areas treated last fall east of 100 Mile and properties on the north side of Horse Lake Road and the Ranchette subdivision.It is hoped that material removed this year to create the fuel breaks can be used as biomass in the form of pulp or ground for pellets, minimizing the amount of material that needs to be burned. All the pulp fibre and a significant portion of the residual fibre removed last year was used.The project is expected to continue through March 2022.Quotes:Ray Raatz, operations manager, FESBC –“This project has been innovative in maximizing the use of mechanical treatments, which reduces overall costs and allows more area to be treated. The success of this project has been due to the collaborative efforts of all the parties involved to achieve a successful outcome.”Mitch Campsall, mayor of 100 Mile House –“Funding from FESBC has been critical in all phases of this project. Assessing, developing prescriptions and treating these fuel treatment blocks to enhance community safety would not be possible without the assistance of FESBC.”Quick Facts: The Forest Enhancement Society of BC, a Crown agency, was established in 2016 to advance environmental and resource stewardship of the province’s forests by: preventing and mitigating the impact of wildfires; improving damaged or low-value forests; improving habitat for wildlife; supporting the use of fibre from damaged and low-value forests; and treating forests to improve the management of greenhouse gases.  The federal and provincial governments have invested $235 million in the society, with about $233 million allocated as of Aug. 6, 2020, for wildfire risk reduction, reforestation, forest rehabilitation, wildlife habitat restoration and raising awareness of the FireSmart program. FESBC is funded in part by the federal government through the Low Carbon Economy Leadership Fund. Learn More:FESBC: https://www.fesbc.ca    "
185,2020-09-03 06:00:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020FLNR0055-001646,Government Website,Public urged to remain vigilant as fire season continues,"  With warm temperatures persisting in many regions of the province and the potential for new ignitions still high in some areas, the BC Wildfire Service urges British Columbians to stay alert and use fire safely over the Labour day weekend.Recent wildfires, such as the 2,122-hectare Christie Mountain blaze south of Penticton, have vividly demonstrated how quickly fire can spread. Although northern portions of B.C. are currently experiencing cooler conditions, fire prevention is a responsibility that everyone shares — no matter where people live.“I thank all British Columbians who are doing their part by staying alert for potential fire risks and taking open burning prohibitions seriously,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “I hope that everyone enjoys the Labour Day long weekend, while also recognizing that the wildfire season is not over yet.”Anyone planning to spend time outdoors this weekend is encouraged to use caution with any activity that could potentially spark a wildfire. Human-caused fires are completely preventable and can unnecessarily divert firefighting resources from naturally occurring wildfires or fires that are already burning.From April 1 through Sept. 2, 2020, the BC Wildfire Service responded to 586 wildfires throughout the province, 45% of which were human caused. Over 11,000 hectares have burned in B.C. since April 1.People are urged to take the following precautions to help prevent wildfire while outdoors this weekend and in the weeks ahead:Campfires: Campfires are currently allowed in all areas of the province that fall under the BC Wildfire Service’s jurisdiction. However, people should check with local governments and other authorities (e.g., BC Parks) to see if any burning restrictions or bylaws are in effect. Campfires must not be larger than 0.5 metres high or 0.5 metres wide. Never light a campfire or keep it burning in windy conditions. Weather can change quickly, and wind may carry embers to other combustible material. Maintain a fireguard around the campfire. This is a fuel-free area where all flammable materials (grass, leaves, kindling, etc.) have been removed right down to the soil. Never leave a campfire unattended. Have a shovel or at least eight litres of water available to properly extinguish a campfire. Make sure the ashes are cool to the touch before retiring for the night or leaving the area for any length of time. Additional precautions: Anyone riding an all-terrain vehicle on or within 300 metres of forested land or rangeland must have a spark arrestor installed on the vehicle. To help reduce wildfire risks, check the condition of the muffler, regularly clear build-ups of grass or other vegetation from hot spots, stay on dirt paths, and avoid tall grass and weeds. Smokers must dispose of cigarette butts and other smoking materials responsibly, ensuring they are completely extinguished. The government’s conservation officers conduct regular patrols throughout British Columbia, while natural resource officers from the Compliance and Enforcement Branch work closely with BC Wildfire Service staff to investigate the cause of wildfires and any improper fire use when an open burning prohibition is in effect.Anyone found in contravention of an open burning prohibition may be issued a violation ticket for $1,150, may be required to pay an administrative penalty of up to $10,000 or, if convicted in court, may be fined up to $100,000 and/or sentenced to one year in jail. If the contravention causes or contributes to a wildfire, the person responsible may be ordered to pay all firefighting and associated costs.To report a wildfire, unattended campfire or open burning violation, call 1 800 663-5555 toll-free or *5555 on a cellphone.

Upon review, the B.C. government has decided the carbon tax rate will remain at its current level of $40 per tCO2e until April 2021, when it will increase from $40 to $45 per tCO2e. The carbon tax will increase to $50 per tCO2e in April 2022.This change will give businesses and families more time to recover from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, while still meeting the required federal carbon-pricing backstop rate of $50 per tCO2e by 2022.The implementation of two other planned tax changes is also being delayed until April 2021. This includes the elimination of the PST exemption for carbonated beverages that contain sugar, natural sweeteners or artificial sweeteners, and the addition of new PST registration and collection requirements for e-commerce businesses located outside B.C.To further support businesses, the employer health tax (EHT) 2020 quarterly instalment dates are being extended as follows: Dec. 31, 2020 (original instalment date was June 15, 2020) Jan. 31, 2021 (original instalment date was Sept. 15, 2020) Feb. 28, 2021 (original instalment date was Dec. 15, 2020) These extensions will give businesses more access to cashflow during recovery and more time to determine their annual payroll and estimate the amount of EHT they will owe. The 2020 EHT filing and balance due date will remain March 31, 2021.As a reminder for businesses, effective March 23, 2020, as part of B.C.’s COVID-19 Action Plan, the filing and payment due dates for the following sales taxes were extended to Sept. 30, 2020, along with the 2019 EHT filing and balance due date: PST hotel tax, also known as municipal and regional district tax tobacco tax motor fuel tax carbon tax These administrative deferrals are not being extended further. Businesses were never able to spend taxes collected from customers such as PST, but delaying tax remittances removed an administrative burden from potentially short-staffed businesses during the beginning of the pandemic.Learn More:Tax information for businesses: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/taxes/tax-changes/budget-changesInformation about supports for business: www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/business/small-business/resources/covid-19-supportsLearn about economic recovery planning: www.gov.bc.ca/recoveryideas    "

We’re working together with districts across the province to ensure every student can learn in a seismically safe school as fast as possible.” The Government of B.C. is investing $44.8 million for seismic upgrades at Ucluelet Elementary and a partial replacement of Ucluelet Secondary. Both schools are located on the same site. Construction is being managed so students can remain on site while the work is completed. The upgrades will create over 450 seismically safe student seats in the community.“West Coast students and families have been waiting for quality learning environments for far too long,” said Scott Fraser, MLA for Mid Island-Pacific Rim. “After years of neglect, I’m proud our government is delivering on the seismically safe schools that our kids deserve.”The seismic upgrades and partial replacement at Ucluelet Elementary and Ucluelet Secondary have started, and the schools will be complete by spring 2022.“We are extremely pleased that the project is proceeding under these challenging times and are very excited to see the project practically transform itself from a set of architectural drawings to modern, safe facilities that will serve learners on the West Coast for years to come,” said Pam Craig, chair of the Alberni School District’s board of education.The project also adds a Neighbourhood Learning Centre that will be used for child care programming, bringing much needed child care spaces for Ucluelet families.“Providing quality, affordable and inclusive child care is foundational to building a strong, vibrant and sustainable community,” said Katrina Chen, Minister of State for Child Care. “We know providing child care on school grounds is not only convenient for parents, it also helps children have a smoother transition into the education system and puts them on the path to lifelong learning.”In addition to the seismic project at Ucluelet Elementary and Ucluelet Secondary, the government recently provided the Pacific Rim School District with over $800,000 for access ramps for E.J. Dunn Elementary school, over $400,000 for roof upgrades at Wood Elementary and $125,000 for playground equipment at Maquinna Elementary.Ucluelet Secondary school is home to students from Ucluelet and Tofino. Four out of five of the school’s blocks will be replaced, including classrooms, administration, the library and music room. These sections were built between 1947 and 1981. The gym and trades block, built in 1973, will be seismically upgraded. These changes will allow for the school to reflect First Nations values and modern classrooms that better suit B.C.’s new curriculum. Seismic upgrades at Ucluelet Elementary school will include the addition of an elevator to improve accessibility, as well as structural upgrades. The StrongStart BC program currently occupies one classroom at the elementary school, and it will remain following the seismic upgrade.These investments in student safety are part of government’s work to accelerate the Seismic Mitigation Program to ensure every B.C. student can attend a seismically safe school as soon as possible.Quick Facts: Since September 2017, the Province has announced over $1 billion for seismic upgrades or replacements at 50 B.C. schools, creating almost 30,000 safe student seats, with many more to come. To continue this momentum, the Ministry of Education has allocated a record $925 million for school seismic safety projects in its three-year capital plan.     "

The upgrades  include improvements to the building design and function, including mechanical and electrical systems, to significantly reduce energy use at the aquatic centre and increase building durability.“From the upgrades to the aquatic centre in Kamloops, to the impressive green-energy projects on two B.C. First Nations, we are seeing how smart investments will help communities to save energy and reduce harmful emissions, while building a strong resilient future for residents,” said Catherine McKenna, federal Minister of Infrastructure and Communities. “Canada’s infrastructure plan invests in thousands of projects, creates jobs across the country and builds stronger communities.”More than $1.14 million through the provincial CleanBC Communities Fund and $1.37 million through federal government’s Green Infrastructure Stream of the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program will support the project. The City of Kamloops will contribute more than $913,000 to the energy-efficiency upgrades.Another CleanBC Communities Fund project will receive investment in an energy self-sufficient affordable housing project at Kanaka Bar Indian Band, powered by solar and wind technology. The project will avoid the need for fossil fuel heating and support the development of 20 affordable housing units in Lower Kanaka. The idea is to demonstrate a replicable, sustainable, resilient development where the foundations of clean air, water, food, shelter and energy meet to address public concern around climate change.The provincial government will contribute $66,000, with the federal government providing more than $330,000. Kanaka Bar will contribute approximately $44,000 towards the project.“Investing in people in communities across the province is key to help build a cleaner, better future for everyone,” said George Heyman, B.C.’s Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “Through our CleanBC climate and economic plan, we’re working together with Indigenous communities and local governments to make life more affordable, support clean energy projects, and energy-efficient homes and buildings that are modern and comfortable.”In addition, Lower Nicola Indian Band will install solar photovoltaic panels on community and residential buildings, including the First Nation’s arena, firehall, health building, community centre, waterworks buildings and social housing rental buildings. The community solar gardens project will lower energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions, while creating a more resilient, sustainable future on the path to reconciliation. The project is supported by nearly $740,000 from the federal government and an additional $246,000 from Lower Nicola Indian Band.CleanBC is a pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. It was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s emission targets.Quotes: Patrick Michell, Chief, Kanaka Bar Indian Band – “Living sustainably and self-sufficiently has been the way of life for the T'eqt''aqtn'mux (or the crossing place people) since time immemorial. Colonization made us dependent on others for basic necessities and in late 1970s, we decided to do something about it. Sustainable energy use today is a cornerstone of Kanaka’s long-term holistic self-sufficiency strategy and The Crossing Place project is affordable housing powered by sustainable use of small-scale renewable energy sources. We are grateful to both Canada and British Columbia for their respective contributions towards this exciting and unique legacy project.”    Stuart Jackson, Chief (Kukpi), Lower Nicola Indian Band – “In 2016, the Lower Nicola Indian Band started on its path of sustainable and green energy with the installation of a solar garden on the roof of the Lower Nicola Indian Band School. We believe strongly in utilizing the gifts of Mother Earth in a way that reflects our commitment to stewardship of the land and benefits our people. The abundant sunshine we are blessed with will help our community in a clean and sustainable way. We are grateful to the federal and provincial governments for partnering with us through the CleanBC Communities Fund to help us advance our path.”Ken Christian, mayor of Kamloops  –“Environmental leadership is a strategic priority of this council, and that is reflected in the projects we undertake as a city. The revitalized Canada Games Aquatic Centre will not only support the health and wellness of our residents through recreation, but also through improved energy efficiency and reduced emissions. We are thankful to the CleanBC Communities Fund for this significant investment in our community.”Quick Facts: The CleanBC Communities Fund invests in public infrastructure owned by local governments, Indigenous communities, not-for-profits and projects in partnership with for-profit entities. Together, the federal and provincial government have committed more than $46 million in 11 projects across British Columbia as part of the first intake of the CleanBC Communities Fund.

In late June, government extended this period to 24 weeks, expiring on Aug. 30, to give employers more time to recover before recalling staff. Both extensions were designed to coincide with the availability of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit.In addition, the Ministry of Labour created a simplified online application process that allowed employers and workers to jointly apply to extend temporary layoffs beyond Aug. 30 quickly and easily.Between July 20 and Aug. 30, the Employment Standards Branch approved 502 variance applications covering 9,154 workers with an average approval time of three days or less. Jobs have been protected in 11 economic sectors, including tourism and hospitality, transportation, forestry, communication, entertainment and recreation.This process will continue to be in place as British Columbia moves forward during this pandemic, so employers who need to access it in the future still can.BC’s Restart Plan is supporting business to safely reopen and get people back to work.Learn more:For information on employment standards around temporary layoffs, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/employment-standards-advice/employment-standards/hours/variancesMore information about B.C.’s economic recovery planning can be found at: http://gov.bc.ca/recoveryideas    "

This model of care has been successful in other jurisdictions with positive results, including reduced wait times, better health outcomes and increased engagement at school.What makes ICY teams stand apart is their integrated, multi-disciplinary approach and focus on culturally safe practices. A young person in need will receive services and supports tailored to their unique situation, delivered by a team of experts. Team members may include school counsellors, youth substance use workers, child and youth mental health clinicians from the Ministry of Children and Family Development, Elders and Indigenous support workers, primary care clinicians and psychologists, as well as family and peer support workers. The team works in a continuous, interconnected way to deliver wraparound support for children, youth and their families.“Investing in the health and well-being of our students today will help them grow and succeed now, and for the rest of their lives,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “This expansion of mental health and substance use support teams will increase support for vulnerable youth, so they have the care they need and deserve to have to reach their full potential.”Teams are built to be flexible and inclusive to make sure anyone who is 18 or younger can access help as soon as they need it through a variety of ways, including self-referral, schools, primary care, community organizations and Foundry centres, First Nations and health authorities, along with the Ministry of Children and Family Development.“We have seen the many ways in which young people can create positive changes for all of us, but when they are struggling with mental health and substance use challenges, it is crucial that we help them,"" said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “We are here to provide a pathway to hope with culturally safe, tailored supports – in both larger centres and in rural areas like Okanagan-Similkameen and Coast Mountains – that help children and youth recover and succeed. These new ICY teams are part of our commitment to bringing better supports and services to families throughout the province.”Richmond, Coast Mountains and Okanagan-Similkameen join Maple Ridge-Pitt Meadows and the Comox Valley, bringing the total number of school districts with ICY teams to five since they were first introduced in July 2019. Funding for the teams is part of the Province’s $74-million investment over three years announced in Budget 2019 to support mental health initiatives for children and youth.

Nobody should have to face their worries alone, which is why we are investing in more mental health supports to help students, parents and educators navigate a safe return to school.”The Province is boosting funds immediately for school-based wellness programs and supports by $2 million, topping up the $8.8-million investment over three years that was announced last September. This means that for the 2020-21 school year, school districts and independent school authorities will receive a total of $3.75 million to promote mental wellness and provide additional supports for students, families and educators as they work together to get through this challenging time.“Now more than ever, we must actively support student mental health and wellness,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “This added investment will help us deliver immediate resources to schools, students and families so that our students can get the help they need to reach their full potential, now and into their bright futures.”School districts will determine how funds are used based on their individual needs to help students adjust to this year's challenges. Funds may be used to enhance staff training, student workshops, family information nights or to develop new resource materials for educators and families. Mental health programs will also be expanded this year to include staff well-being, in addition to a focus on trauma-informed practices that build capacity for good mental health now and for years to come.Surveys show that many people in British Columbia are experiencing an increase in mental health and substance use challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially those with pre-existing conditions. Government reminds British Columbians that help is available for people of all ages, and there is strength in seeking support.“It’s important for people to know that it’s okay to not be okay, especially during these extremely challenging times,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “With this funding, young people of all ages and their parents can get more support from our many programs and services that help keep students on the path to success.”As families, teachers and staff prepare for a school year that looks very different, help is available if worries begin to feel unmanageable. Free and low-cost counselling services are available online, by video and phone through programs such as BounceBack, Living Life to the Full, Here2Talk, Foundry’s virtual services and more, for anyone who needs someone to talk to.Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, the Province has invested $6 million to expand existing mental health programs and launch new services in response to the extraordinary situation.Improving mental health in schools is an integral part of government’s plan to build a comprehensive system of mental health and addictions care that British Columbians deserve, as outlined in A Pathway to Hope, B.C.'s roadmap for making mental health and addictions care better for people in British Columbia. Implementing A Pathway to Hope is a shared priority with the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Learn More:Free and low-cost mental health supports during COVID-19: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/managing-your-health/mental-health-substance-use/virtual-supports-covid-19  Here2Talk connects students with mental health support when they need it: https://here2talk.ca/homeFind a Child and Youth Mental Health walk-in intake clinic nearby: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/managing-your-health/mental-health-substance-use/child-teen-mental-health/mental-health-intake-clinicsErase services and resources for students, parents and teachers: www.erase.gov.bc.caA Pathway to Hope: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/BCMentalHealthRoadmap_2019.pdf     "

This is an important part of reducing climate pollution and meeting B.C.’s climate targets, as set out in CleanBC.Other funded projects include Ionomr Innovations to develop its ion-exchange membrane and polymer solutions. Ionomr Innovations’ clean technology can be used within the power devices of zero-emission vehicles and store energy for renewable power generation, such as batteries used in power plants or electrical grids.Clir Renewables received funding to develop an artificial intelligence wind farm optimization software, a software-as-a-service tool to help wind farm operators identify problems and increase the amount of power they produce.“Expanding innovation creates jobs, strengthens communities and better positions B.C. companies at the forefront of a growing global market in clean technology solutions,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “Our CleanBC climate and economic plan will continue to expand opportunities for clean energy production, transportation, natural resource extraction and other sectors.”Part of the government’s CleanBC plan, the ICE Fund supports the research, development and commercialization of clean energy technologies that will reduce B.C.’s emissions and create new economic opportunities for people.CleanBC is a pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. CleanBC was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s emission targets.Quotes:Raymond Lings, president and CEO, Powertech Labs Inc. –“B.C. has long been a pioneer in advancing hydrogen and clean energy technologies. We’re proud of the critical role that Powertech has played, and our achievements can be seen in today’s fuel cell vehicles and infrastructure around the world.”Bill Haberlin, CEO, Ionomr Innovations Inc. –“British Columbia has long been the epicentre of hydrogen fuel cell development and is now turning its technology leadership into an economic advantage. Ionomr is emerging as a global player in the sector, and we look forward to providing customers with advanced ion-exchange material solutions that offer crucial commercial benefits for clean power generation.”Gareth Brown, CEO, Clir Renewables Inc. –  “As a clean tech business in B.C., it is brilliant to see the provincial government make funding available for local businesses to develop solutions to fight climate change. The ICE funding has been critical in our success to optimizing wind farms globally and has enabled us to secure further outside investment into the company to create 50 well-paid jobs here in B.C.”Quick Facts: Since 2008, the ICE Fund has committed approximately $104 million to support pre-commercial clean energy technology projects, clean energy vehicles, research and development and energy efficiency programs. ICE funding is derived from a levy on the final sale of specified energy products – currently natural gas, fuel oil and propane distribution systems. ICE Fund partnerships have included First Nations, universities, municipalities and many emerging clean tech companies throughout British Columbia. Technology demonstrations have included bioenergy, solar, ocean tidal, geo-exchange, desalination, energy management, smart grid and waste-to-energy. Some projects received additional funding from partners including Sustainable Development Technology Canada (SDTC). Projects funded by SDTC are a part of B.C. and Canada’s three-year $40-million Joint Call Partnership launched in March 2017 to support the development of pre-commercial clean energy projects and technologies.

Since the washout, a detour route has been in place via Garner and Webster Lake roads.The ministry has finalized the detailed design for the new road, which will bypass the active slide areas along the section washed out in 2018. Work will include the construction of 5.6 kilometres of two-lane road on a new alignment on the east side of Narcosli Creek, including a new bridge crossing the creek.The ministry is following the advice and orders of the provincial health officer to keep British Columbians as safe as possible and help to stop the spread of COVID-19. As such, no in-person information sessions will take place. Instead, people can view the latest information on the West Fraser Road flood recovery project by visiting: https://www.gov.bc.ca/westfraserroadThe project is anticipated to be tendered this fall, with construction beginning in spring 2021.

The Kamloops School District is contributing $1.75 million to the project.“This design incorporates many of the healthy and inclusive spaces that our students and staff imagined,” said Rhonda Kershaw, newly acclaimed chair of the Kamloops-Thompson Board of Education. “It is exciting to see their concepts and ideas move closer to reality, and we are looking forward to the day our students and staff can learn, work and socialize in a modern and spacious Valleyview Secondary school.”The new addition is on track to open by September 2022. It will bring the school’s capacity from 675 to 1,200 students, and eliminate the need for the nine portables currently in use.This investment is part of government’s work to build new and expanded schools in fast-growing communities throughout B.C.Since September 2017, the Province has announced over $2.1 billion for school capital projects. This includes $749 million to add more than 13,000 new student seats in B.C. schools, eliminating the equivalent of about 520 portables.To continue this momentum, Budget 2020 includes a record $2.8 billion for new and improved schools for students throughout B.C.Learn More:For more information on the K-12 Education Restart Plan, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/education-training/k-12/covid-19-return-to-school    "

This ensures the ongoing development of programs and initiatives that help businesses in B.C. as they lead the way to improving employment opportunities for people with disabilities.In recognition of Disability Employment Month, Small Business BC is hosting AccessAbility Month in partnership with the Presidents Group, Office of Small and Medium Enterprises and Community Futures Entrepreneurs with Disabilities Program. Throughout September, 17 webinars will be offered covering topics such as business planning, financial research and market research. On Sept. 25, the Presidents Group will present a webinar focused on the funding and supports available to employers in the province. Each webinar will have American sign language (ASL) interpretation and live captioning.“Small Business BC exists to assist entrepreneurs overcome barriers to grow successful and sustainable businesses,” said Tom Conway, CEO, Small Business BC. “During AccessAbility Month in September, we celebrate business owners and employees with disabilities who meet those challenges head on.”The AccessAbility Month webinars can be accessed for free through the Community Futures Entrepreneurs with Disabilities Program. In addition, Presidents Group is also offering two free accessible webinars for business owners and hiring managers on workplace accommodations and the case for inclusive hiring.“As a small business owner myself, the value of an inclusive workplace is clear. Through our bakery, we’ve created a place of belonging and inclusivity where individuals with autism and other disabilities have contributed immensely to our business, to the benefit of our whole community,” said Lisa Beecroft, owner, Gabi and Jules Homemade Pies and Baked Goodness, and co-chair, Presidents Group. “Presidents Group helps businesses of all sizes across B.C. become more inclusive employers. We’re excited to be partnering with Small Business BC during Disability Employment Month to ensure accessibility within all their content during AccessAbility Month.”Through WorkBC, the Province provides a range of services and initiatives to support people with disabilities to develop new workplace skills and access work experience and employment opportunities. Last year, through Community and Employer Partnerships, more than $1.4 million was provided to over 250 clients with disabilities through projects that focused on improved employment outcomes for people with disabilities. With Assistive Technology Services contracts, WorkBC also provides assistive technology needed to overcome disability-related barriers in the workplace.Through employment planning, specialized assessments, placement services and many other supports, WorkBC ensures employment resources are available to people with disabilities and employers.Quick Facts: More than 926,100 British Columbians aged 15 to 64 years, almost 25% of the population, identify as having a disability. Almost 90% of consumers prefer companies that employ people with disabilities, according to a study cited in a 2012 Conference Board of Canada report. The provincial government offers services and programs that support job seekers and employees with disabilities and employers who want to build an inclusive workplace, including through WorkBC Employment Services, WorkBC Apprentices Services and WorkBC Assistive Technology Services.

198,2020-09-01 16:00:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020PSSG0049-001631,Government Website,State of emergency extended to continue B.C.’s COVID-19 response,"  The B.C. government has formally extended the provincial state of emergency, allowing Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, to continue to use extraordinary powers under the Emergency Program Act to support the Province's COVID-19 pandemic response.“It’s encouraging to see the vast majority of British Columbians following public health rules to stop the spread of COVID-19 and keep each other safe,” said Premier John Horgan. “However, there remains a small group of people ignoring Dr. Henry’s orders and threatening our hard work over the past several months to flatten the curve. This pandemic is not over, and whether it’s an end-of-summer gathering or hockey celebration, this is not the time to bend or break the rules. To those few who are not complying, there will be consequences.”On Friday, Aug. 21, police and other provincial enforcement officers were given the ability to issue $2,000 violation tickets for owners or organizers contravening the provincial health officer’s (PHO) order on gatherings and events. For individuals, $200 violation tickets can be issued to those not following the direction of police or enforcement staff at events, or who refuse to comply with requests to follow safe operating procedures of a restaurant, bar or other licensed establishment, or respond with abusive behaviour towards employees.  In the first week of these new enforcement measures (Aug. 21-28), 10 violation tickets were issued. This includes six $2,000 violation tickets for contraventions of the PHO’s order on gatherings and events, and four $200 violation tickets issued to individuals.“Since we announced the new enforcement measures, we’ve seen several examples of violation tickets being issued to people breaking the law,” said Farnworth. “It’s disappointing to see behaviour that shows a blatant disregard for the safety of citizens. It’s time to stop breaking the rules. It’s time to do better. It’s my hope that these enforcement measures will result in a change in behaviour and fewer violation tickets will be needed in the future.”  The state of emergency is extended through the end of the day on Sept. 15, 2020, to allow government to continue to take the necessary actions to keep British Columbians safe and manage immediate concerns, such as recent outbreaks in some areas of the province.Actions taken in the previous two weeks to support British Columbians include: introducing new measures to enforce COVID-19 public safety by giving police and other provincial enforcement officers the ability to issue violation tickets for people contravening the PHO order on gatherings and events; posting back-to-school plans for K-12 families for all 60 school districts, so parents and families can prepare to support their children for a safe return to classrooms. Each school district plan follows the same strict provincial health and safety measures co-developed with the PHO, the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) and the Ministry of Education; helping organizations and agencies in B.C.’s community social services sector to be better able to build capacity, support recruitment and retention, and improve occupational health and safety training programs for staff, thanks to $10 million in one-time funding from the Province. The funding supports training programs to organizations across the sector, including training and development for Indigenous agencies and Indigenous staff, foundational training and development opportunities, and occupational health and safety; supporting arts and culture venues deeply impacted by COVID-19 by creating a new, $2-million Arts Infrastructure Program to help improve spaces for artists and cultural activities; and supporting a safe and progressive return to sports by moving to Phase 3 of the Return to Sport Guidelines. The BCCDC has reviewed viaSport’s guidelines that contain recommendations for how to train, play and compete safely while following public health recommendations. On July 10, the COVID-19 Related Measures Act came into force. The legislation enables provisions created for citizens and businesses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to continue as needed should the provincial state of emergency end.The extension of the provincial state of emergency is based on recommendations from B.C.'s health and emergency management officials. Farnworth made the original declaration on March 18, 2020, the day after Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, declared a public health emergency.Quick Facts: Declarations of provincial states of emergency may be issued by the minister responsible under the Emergency Program Act. The provincial government can extend the period of a declaration made by the minister responsible for up to 14 days at a time. During the 2017 wildfire season, the province was in a provincial state of emergency for 10 weeks from July 7 to Sept. 15.

We are almost back to our regular timelines for surgeries, with more British Columbians getting the needed surgeries to resume their lives.”The monthly progress reports identify achievements in three key components of surgical renewal: focusing on patients; increasing surgeries; and increasing essential personnel. This second report, except where noted, covers June 26 to July 23, and compares it to the same period in 2019. By Aug. 23, 2020, an additional 22,645 calls were made to patients to see if they were ready to reschedule their surgery, bringing the number of patients called since May 7 to 85,345. Surgeries were delivered to 11,249 (or 66%) of the 17,154 patients who had their surgery postponed. The time it takes to perform surgeries is almost back to normal. Because of necessary COVID-19 precautions, surgeries are now taking about 2% longer than last year. During the initial COVID-19 response, surgeries were taking 26% longer to complete. 904 more surgeries were performed than were performed in the same time frame last year. A 6% increase in operating room hours was achieved compared to the same time frame last year. There were 25,500 scheduled and unscheduled surgeries completed, a 4% increase over the same time frame last year. 7,368 urgent surgeries were completed, a 4% increase over the same time frame last year. 2,300 non-urgent surgeries were completed for patients waiting longer than twice their target wait — more than double the number compared to the same time frame last year. Hip surgeries increased by 4%, knee surgeries by 4% and dental surgeries by 2%, compared to the same time frame last year. Seven additional anesthesiologists and general practitioner anesthesiologists (GPAs) were recruited, bringing the number of recruited since April 1, 2020, to 38 – 33 anesthesiologists and five GPAs. An additional 49 perioperative registered nurses, seven perioperative licensed practical nurses, 13 post-anesthetic recovery registered nurses and 24 medical device reprocessing technicians were hired. This brings the number of perioperative registered nurses to 160, the number of perioperative licensed practical nurses to 13, the number of post-anesthetic recovery registered nurses to 73 and the number of medical device reprocessing technicians recruited since April 1, 2020, to 59. Government is working with staff, unions, and the Health Employers Association of B.C. to determine how best to extend daily, and initiate Saturday and Sunday, operating room hours. These times have historically not been used for scheduled surgeries. “We recognize that B.C.’s Surgical Renewal Plan is a massive undertaking. Fulfilling our commitment to patients is an all-in effort, and we are working together with everyone in the health-care system to increase surgeries, add staff and operating room hours to get more patients the surgeries they need,” Dix said. “Right now, perhaps more than at any other time in our B.C. pandemic, we’re counting on each other to stop the spread of COVID-19. And the remarkable British Columbians involved in surgical renewal and getting patients the surgeries they need are counting on us to do our work, so they can continue to do theirs.”Learn More:To view Progress Report #2 on B.C.’s Surgical Renewal Commitment, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020_surgical-renewal-commitment-progress-report-June-July-2020.pdfTo view Progress Report #1, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020HLTH0228-001337To view A Commitment to Surgical Renewal in B.C., visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/conducting-healthresearch-evaluation/reports-publications    "

These homes are in addition to the almost 1,000 supportive homes that the Province has opened in Vancouver since 2017.“There’s only one way to tackle the ongoing homelessness crisis: building homes. And the fastest way to build homes is by investing in modular housing,” said Kennedy Stewart, mayor, City of Vancouver. “Today’s announcement of an additional 450 homes adds to the hundreds of homes we’ve already secured thanks to the incredible partnership between the City of Vancouver and the Province of B.C. This government not only gets it, but it is doubling down to provide our most vulnerable neighbours with the housing they deserve and the wraparound services they need to get back on their feet.”A public information session for the temporary units will be held online in October 2020. If approved, the new homes are estimated to be open by spring 2021, and will remain in place for approximately five years, with an option to renew the lease for an additional five years.“These much-needed temporary modular homes with wraparound services will have a big impact for vulnerable people living in Vancouver-Mount Pleasant,” said Melanie Mark, MLA for Vancouver-Mount Pleasant. “The former government made a calculated decision to ignore the escalating housing needs of the residents of East Vancouver. While it will take time to undo 16 years of neglect, today’s investment is a positive step for our community.”The locations of the 350 permanent supportive housing units will be announced in the coming months. As locations are announced, project partners will host information sessions to make sure neighbours and communities close to each of the sites are informed about the proposals and have an opportunity to ask questions and share their feedback.The new homes would provide wraparound support services such as meals, access to health care, life skills training and connection to employment opportunities, among others. Once open, each of the sites would be managed by an experienced non-profit housing operator who would be on site 24/7.To foster positive relationships between the buildings and their neighbours, community advisory committees would be set up and would meet regularly to address any potential issues or feedback from the community.Learn More:The Province and City of Vancouver are also partnering to launch B.C.’s first-ever “navigation” centre, a 60-bed facility to help people who are experiencing long-term homelessness and require supports: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020MAH0090-001460Public engagement updates and details about these projects will be available on BC Housing’s Let’s Talk Housing page: www.letstalkhousingbc.ca/vancouver-supportive-housingFor more information about the Vernon Drive temporary supportive housing project and updates on public engagement timing, visit: https://shapeyourcity.ca/1580-vernon-drTwo backgrounders follow.

207,2020-09-01 08:00:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020AG0055-001617,Government Website,Modernized arbitration legislation comes into force,"  British Columbia’s new Arbitration Act has come into force, modernizing the province’s domestic arbitration system and improving access to justice through out-of-court options. The legislation, passed during the spring session, replaces outdated arbitration law and reflects best practices based on a United Nations arbitration model that has been adopted by many other jurisdictions.Under the new legislation: there is a clear structure for the steps involved in arbitration; arbitrators are provided broad procedural powers; there are clear principles for the courts, such as staying litigation in favour of arbitration when parties agree to resolve disputes by arbitration; the traditional confidentiality of arbitration proceedings is now prescribed in the act; appeals will be simpler and faster; and parties can now agree to opt out of appeals altogether. “Today is a milestone in the history of B.C.’s arbitration system and marks an important step in alternative dispute resolution in our province,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “By updating our arbitration law, we are improving access to justice for British Columbians who want to resolve their disputes quickly, fairly and out of court.”When parties cannot agree on an arbitrator but agree to the arbitration process, the legislation designates the Vancouver International Arbitration Centre (VanIAC), formerly the BC International Commercial Arbitration Centre, as the appointing authority. This means that at the request of one of the parties VanIAC has the power to quickly appoint an arbitrator to keep the process moving quickly and economically. “This new legislation keeps British Columbia in the vanguard of jurisdictions supporting arbitration throughout the world,” said Leslie Maerov, governing director and chair, VanIAC. “VanIAC is increasing its prominence as an integral part of the justice system to achieve a just, speedy and economical determination of disputes.”The Arbitration Act, which covers domestic commercial disputes, is one of two arbitration statutes in British Columbia. The other is the International Commercial Arbitration Act, which applies if one of the parties is based in a jurisdiction outside Canada. “For almost 35 years, we have been a trusted alternative to the court system,” said Barry Penner, managing director, VanIAC. “To complement the new Arbitration Act, VanIAC has developed updated procedural rules to ensure greater clarity and efficiency, including an expedited process for claims under $250,000. We look forward to fulfilling our new legislative responsibilities in a fair and impartial manner.”Quick Facts: Arbitration is a way for parties to resolve disputes by agreeing to be bound by the decision of one or more independent and impartial arbitrators, usually chosen by the parties. An arbitrator receives submissions from both sides, conducts a fair hearing according to rules of law and renders an enforceable arbitral award. Arbitration allows parties to choose their decision-maker, avoid a potentially lengthy and costly court case, and resolve their dispute in private. Arbitration is different from mediation. Under mediation, the parties engage a neutral third party to help them reach an agreement. A mediator does not have the authority to make binding decisions. Learn More:VanIAC: www.vaniac.org    "

In the first reporting period from August 28 to 29, we had 86 new cases, from August 29 to 30, we had 107 new cases and in the last 24 hours, we have had a further 101 new cases.“This represents 294 new cases, including three epi-linked cases, since we reported on Friday, for a total of 5,790 cases in British Columbia.“There are 1,107 active cases of COVID-19 in the province, 2,723 people who are under active public health monitoring as a result of identified exposure to known cases, and 4,466 people who tested positive have recovered.“Currently, 28 individuals are hospitalized with COVID-19, 10 of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 1,900 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 3,042 in the Fraser Health region, 175 in the Island Health region, 440 in the Interior Health region, 154 in the Northern Health region and 79 cases of people who reside outside of Canada.“There have been four new COVID-19 related deaths, for a total of 208 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There has been one new health-care facility outbreak in the Fraser Health region at the Normanna Living long-term care facility in Burnaby. The outbreaks at Dania Home and Holy Family Hospital have been declared over. In total, eight long-term care or assisted-living facilities and two acute-care facilities have active outbreaks.“There have been no new community outbreaks, although there continue to be community exposure events. The Northern Health region has issued a community alert for the Prespatou region. Anyone who has attended events, services or gatherings in August are asked to monitor themselves for symptoms and contact health teams to get tested should any symptoms develop. The community exposure cluster in the Kelowna region has been declared over.“Alerts are posted on the BC Centre for Disease Control's (BCCDC) website, as well as on health authorities' websites, providing details on where the potential exposure occurred and what actions to take – whether you need to self-isolate or monitor for symptoms.“As we look to the fall, we are entering a new phase of B.C.’s COVID-19 response, and to be successful, we need to step back to allow us to safely move forward.“The increase in the number of new cases is a concern for all of us. We must to do our part and support public health teams to quickly manage new cases so we can contain the spread of the virus and ensure community spread remains low.“After many months of restrictions, we all felt the need to reconnect with our family and friends this summer, but now we must slow down on our social interactions and prepare for the respiratory season ahead.“We need everyone to pay attention and step back from the social interactions we have had this summer, so when the cooler weather and respiratory season arrives, we are ready for the challenge.“As we go back to our offices, workplaces and schools, we need to get back to the basics with our layers of protection and personal COVID-19 safety measures. This will allow us to protect our most vulnerable during the colder months.“This means all of us washing our hands regularly, keeping our groups small, giving others the space to stay safe in uncontrolled environments, especially when we are around people we don’t know, wearing masks when needed and always staying home when ill.“It can be difficult to tell the difference between a cold, allergies, influenza and COVID-19. As a result, the first step for everyone in B.C. needs to be to stay home if we are not 100% healthy.“The bar to stay home needs to be lower than we have ever had it before. Our superheroes are not the people who put aside illness and go to work, but the people who protect colleagues by staying away until they are healthy once again.“We ask employers, caregivers and parents to think ahead and prepare for the days when an employee or child is feeling unwell. Employers also need to ensure they are giving employees the flexibility to stay home without recrimination or financial harm.“We can prepare now for the challenges that may lie ahead with new thinking, new routines and proven safety precautions.“Our goals for B.C. are clear: prevent cases through our renewed personal safety measures, pay attention to how we are feeling so we can detect new cases and support our public health teams throughout the province to respond quickly to contain the spread of the virus.“Let’s start today to close the summer gaps.

I received her final report last week and have now had time to fully consider its findings.“Ms. Banister did a good job of addressing what is a serious and complex issue taking place against the backdrop of conditions created by the COVID-19 pandemic, the likes of which we have never seen before.“In a very short time, she received and reviewed submissions from representatives of hotels and trade unions, as well as employers and labour organizations. The report is thorough and informative, and I am grateful for her work. Ms. Banister’s analysis leaves no doubt that the current situation is serious and unprecedented for both workers and employers.“She outlines how thousands of workers have been out of work for the last six months and do not know when they will be able to return. These are difficult circumstances for all workers in hotels that rely on international and business travel, including the members of Unite Here Local 40, who have been publicly demonstrating their concerns in recent weeks. It is Unite Here’s campaign that has brought attention to the severity and urgency of this issue.“I have met with some of these workers and understand where they are coming from. It’s not easy to live with this kind of uncertainty as to the future of your job when you have a family to support and bills to pay. Our government understands, as outlined in Ms. Banister’s report, the devastating impact this pandemic has had on the hotel industry.“I remain committed to supporting hotel workers by getting them back to work or into alternative employment as soon as possible. I will be doing this through several ways.“I will be asking my colleague ministers to ensure that any government economic recovery package, particularly for the tourism and hotel industry, contains a pledge for employers to offer a right of first refusal to existing employees when work resumes.“I also will be advocating that access to jobs in the public sector is provided to workers impacted by tourism closures, in positions where their skills are transferrable.“As a government, we have taken considerable steps to support employers and workers impacted by COVID-19. We have made serious efforts to ensure resources are there for non-union workers, including in the hotel sector, by providing a simplified variance application process for employers who needed to extend temporary layoffs beyond the Aug. 30 deadline. This has given employers more time to recover before recalling staff.“I am committed to providing extra support through access to Section 54 of the Labour Relations Code, or other third-party assistance, to ensure quick solutions at existing bargaining tables where disputes are arising due to recall issues.“However, after careful consideration of all the facts and in light of the complex collective bargaining landscape outlined in the report, I have decided the best course of action is to refrain from interfering in the collective bargaining process.“I have always been clear that the best resolution for all parties is negotiated at the bargaining table.“Government will not be overriding existing collective agreements and the bargaining now under way in the hotel sector, including negotiations involving Unite Here Local 40 and other unions.“I am hopeful all parties involved can come to mutual resolution at the bargaining table, and I urge both sides to get together as soon as possible to work out a voluntary resolution to this important issue.”Banister’s report is available online: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/organizational-structure/ministries-organizations/ministries/labour/ministry-reportsFor translations, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020LBR0029-001616#translations    "

The investments we made in 2019-20, such as eliminating MSP premiums and investing in child care and housing, will make life more affordable and support people through COVID-19 as the Province develops a strong economic recovery plan.”Public Accounts 2019-20 confirm the Province’s commitment to put people first through $3.4 billion in increased investments in health, community supports, education and social services, and a historic $4.8 billion in capital spending for hospitals, schools and highways.Public Accounts 2019-20 show B.C. is in good financial standing with affordable debt levels at the end of the fiscal year and continues to lead the country as the only “AAA” accredited province. Provincial gross domestic product (GDP) for 2019 grew by 2.8%, above the national average of 1.7%.Learn More:To access Public Accounts online, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/finances/public-accountsThe technical PowerPoint presentation is available online:  https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/PPT_Technical_Public_Accounts_2019_20.pdfFor information about BC’s Restart Plan, visit: http://gov.bc.ca/restartbcTo learn more about the supports and services available for people, businesses and communities through the pandemic, visit: gov.bc.ca/covid19Two backgrounders follow.

Hiring local workers will be made a priority through the Community Benefits Agreement.“This major work to add lanes, a multi-use pathway, a bridge and a new interchange to Highway 1 through Salmon Arm will make the route safer and easier to navigate for local residents,” said Catherine McKenna, federal Minister of Infrastructure and Communities. “It will also improve traffic flow along one of British Columbia’s key trade and commuter corridors. Canada’s infrastructure plan invests in thousands of projects, creates jobs across the country and builds stronger communities.”Along with widening 2.2 kilometres of Highway 1 to four lanes with a concrete median barrier, work on this segment of the Salmon Arm West project will include: construction of a new Salmon River Bridge; construction of an interchange with frontage and side-road connections; construction of frontage roads to consolidate access to and from Highway 1; and a multi-use pathway for pedestrians, cyclists and people using other forms of active transportation. “Providing good-paying construction jobs to local workers will help us build out of the COVID-19 pandemic and provide a boost to the regional economy,” said Claire Trevena, B.C.’s Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “Large-scale infrastructure projects like this one are more important than ever, as the financial benefits are felt not just in the construction sector but the supporting sectors as well.”During construction, every effort will be made to minimize disruption and impacts to local traffic, and updates will be provided via DriveBC.“The City of Salmon Arm is pleased that the TCH Salmon Arm West Project tender has been awarded, and we look forward to the start of the next phase of the project,"" said Alan Harrison, mayor of Salmon Arm. “The planned four-laning and other improvements will provide a number of benefits to our community, including a new bridge over the Salmon River, a completed access road on the south side of the highway, wider shoulders and a separated path that will increase safety and mobility for pedestrians and cyclists, and enhanced access through the corridor. We appreciate the work that the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure has done to bring this to fruition.” Provincial construction sites have protocols and policies in place following the requirements of the provincial health officer to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. These measures include physical distancing and other protocols to ensure worker and public safety.Under the Community Benefits Agreement, the project will prioritize hiring local workers, Indigenous peoples, women, people with disabilities and other under-represented groups who are qualified to do the work in a safe, welcoming environment. Additionally, this project will provide opportunities for Red Seal apprentices to work on site and gain the experience they need to launch careers in the trades.Learn More:Highway 1 four-laning program: http://www.bchwy1.caJob opportunities for the Salmon Arm West four-laning project: https://bcib.ca/For the most up-to-date highway travel information, check @DriveBC on Twitter or visit: DriveBC.caFor guidance to construction sites operating during COVID-19, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/covid-19/covid-19-pho-guidance-construction-sites.pdfFor travel restrictions and precautions due to COVID-19, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation/driving-and-cycling/traveller-information/travel-affected-by-covid-19A backgrounder follows.

The cleanup also creates jobs and supports coastal communities as they recover from the COVID-19 economic downturn, impacting tourism.“The ocean environment sustains all life and needs our attention and action,” said Sheila Malcolmson, Parliamentary Secretary for Environment. “This funding will create jobs for local communities. It strengthens our partnerships with Indigenous Nations, tourism operators and local communities as we work together to clean up our shorelines, protect marine life and support our world-class coastal tourism economy.”The program responds to the strong public call to action on marine debris that Malcolmson heard when she toured coastal communities last summer.“This is the first time a cleanup of this scale has been launched on the Central Coast of British Columbia,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “It is a great example of how our future, both environmentally and economically, must be built on partnership and reconciliation.”This is the first in a series of CCCW initiatives that are creating jobs for tour operators, clean-up crews, community educators and specialized positions in areas such as oceanographic data collection.“B.C.’s coastal environment is one of our greatest assets, attracting visitors from all over the world and supporting tourism in British Columbia,” said Lisa Beare, Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture. “Funding for these projects not only protects the marine environment, but provides jobs for people affected by the significant decrease in tourism as a result of the pandemic.”The Small Ship Tour Operators Association (SSTOA) will conduct two marine debris removal expeditions, each up to 21 days, including nine vessels and more than 100 crew who will inspect and clean up to 1,000 kilometres, weather permitting, of remote shoreline around 100 small islands. The clean-up operations will be performed by various marine-based tourism operators, which may include but is not limited to member companies of the SSTOA.“When it became clear that we all would have to cancel a sold-out season, we asked ourselves how we could use our skills to protect the environment that sustains us,” said Kevin Smith, president, Maple Leaf Adventures, and member of SSTOA. “It’s really rewarding to work with our colleagues, First Nations communities, the Wilderness Tourism Association and the Province of B.C. on projects that help the ocean we love and support our industry during this unprecedented time.”The SSTOA will lead projects to remove marine debris from B.C.’s central coast. It will recycle the collected debris where possible, reducing the amount of material ending up in landfills.The funding is part of the B.C. government’s far-ranging Pandemic Response and Economic Recovery initiative supporting all sectors that have been hit hard by the COVID-19 crisis.Quick Facts: Globally, it has been estimated that one garbage truck of plastic waste enters the ocean every minute, totalling eight million tonnes every year. In 2019, the Great Canadian Shoreline Clean-up removed 163,505 kilograms of shoreline debris in Canada, an increase of 47,076 kilograms from 2018. Slightly less than half of the collected debris in Canada in 2019 was removed from B.C. shorelines (77,836 kilograms).

This will help make cycling, walking and other forms of active transportation safe, accessible and convenient for people, while lessening climate pollution caused by greenhouse gases.“Building well-connected, accessible and safe, active transportation routes will give British Columbians more opportunities to leave their cars at home,” said Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “Local governments play a significant role in network planning, and I’m pleased to offer this new grant to help communities incorporate active transportation into their road planning.”The Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM) will administer the grant. To qualify for funding, applicants should demonstrate how proposed projects will support and integrate active transportation as part of their community planning and land-use planning process. Local governments with a population up to 25,000 that meet the grant criteria are eligible for up to $10,000 toward their active transportation planning costs.“Building smart, connected communities where people can cycle and walk around their community is a priority for our government,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “Grant programs like this one will help local governments better plan, design and build the infrastructure their communities need to help promote a healthy lifestyle.”Applications will be open from Aug. 31, to Oct. 30, 2020.  “As communities look to expand active transportation options, detailed planning is crucial,” said Maja Tait, UBCM president and mayor of the District of Sooke. “Transportation changes invariably have a wide range of impacts, so we are glad to see this provincial investment that supports the effective integration of new options for active travel.”Providing support to ensure community planning addresses active transportation opportunities is an initiative of Move. Commute. Connect., B.C.'s Active Transportation Strategy. The strategy is part of CleanBC, a plan to help transform how people move around, while encouraging more active transportation in communities.CleanBC is a pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. CleanBC was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.'s emission targets.Learn More:  Learn more about the Active Transportation Planning Grant: https://www.ubcm.ca/EN/main/funding/lgps/active-transportation.htmlLearn more about B.C.'s strategy for more active transportation: https://cleanbc.gov.bc.ca/active    "

It is a day to remember loved ones who have been lost to this crisis and show our support for their families and friends as they continue to grieve. Each and every person who died was the light of someone’s life, and their absence leaves a profound void.“Now, more than ever, we need to come together with compassion and commitment to prevent further deaths. Since January, 909 lives have been lost to an illegal drug supply that is more toxic than it has ever been in British Columbia. The unintended consequences of COVID-19 measures have been particularly hard on people who use drugs. Many are facing isolation and loneliness, disconnection from usual in-person supports, financial strain and mental-health challenges – all contributing to unprecedented levels of stress and pain.“To commemorate International Overdose Awareness Day, purple lights will glow at BC Place in Vancouver in memory of those we have lost. Other parts of B.C. will recognize the day with lighted walkways and buildings, memorial gardens, virtual candlelight vigils, awareness campaigns, social media promotions and the annual Moms Stop the Harm purple ribbon campaign.  “Prior to COVID-19, the number of overdose deaths was coming down in B.C. for the first time since 2012. Our combined, evidence-based efforts were making a difference. More than 6,000 deaths were averted according to the BC Centre for Disease Control. That can and must happen again.“Today, I want to especially recognize those who have become trained to administer naloxone, those who have stepped in to help when they have seen someone in crisis and those who give their hearts and souls every single day to protect people from harms and overdose and to help them heal.“Family members, peer-support workers, harm-reduction workers, addiction and recovery workers, front-line community workers, ambulance paramedics, police and firefighters have carried the enormous weight of this crisis for more than five years. They have saved countless lives and walked alongside many people on their paths to healing and recovery. It is in their honour, and in tribute to the lives that have been lost, that we continue to work overtime to add supports and services to reduce overdoses, save lives and support more people on the pathway to healing that is right for them.“International Overdose Awareness Day is a day to remember that the overdose crisis touches each one of us. It is a day when we say loudly and clearly that addiction is not a moral failing. It is a health issue that should be treated like any other health issue – with consideration, caring and respect.”    "
215,2020-08-29 10:00:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020ENV0044-001606,Government Website,New web reporting tool illustrates health of B.C.’s rivers,"  In the middle of each month, Danny St. Hilaire puts on his safety vest and drives to a bridge near the Town of Oliver to collect another sample of water from the Okanagan River.Using a rope, he lowers a tray holding nine small bottles into the rushing water three metres below the bridge. The samples he collects will be sent to a lab to determine how healthy the river is by looking at the physical and chemical components, such as metals, nitrogen and phosphorus.“Every time we take another water sample, we essentially take a snapshot of the river in time,” said St. Hilaire, a water quality monitoring technician with the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “Knowing what’s out there, what the condition of the water is over a long period of time, helps to see changes and identify any trends that might be occurring.”With the help of First Nations communities and trained local watershed stewards, the Province and federal government jointly conduct water quality monitoring by regularly collecting samples from 42 stations located on 31 rivers throughout the province. The results have been available in technical reports, but a new user-friendly web reporting tool has been created to help people learn more about water quality and how it relates to the rivers near them.  Using an interactive map of the province, people can view 10-year water quality trends in certain rivers with data complied from the Canada-B.C. Water Quality Monitoring Program. The program has been in place since 1985. The data is also used to determine the current status of water quality, detect emerging issues that may threaten aquatic life and support the development of guidelines for water, fish and sediment.“Water quality is a pretty complicated topic,” said Ayisha Yeow, senior water quality monitoring scientist, Environment Canada and Climate Change in B.C. “The new website gives people a glimpse into how we look at the data and we explain what that means. I hope it gets people engaged and learning more about water quality so they can relate it to what they see when they’re enjoying the river.”According to Yeow, every river is different. They all have complicated systems that are sensitive to a variety of stressors, such as human development and climate change. The Chilcotin River monitoring site has seen some of the biggest changes – an increase in metal concentrations, even though there is not much development in the area. Scientists are investigating what exactly is driving that change, but an increase in sediments due to changes in streamflow may be a factor.“As British Columbians, we are very fortunate to have plentiful and pristine freshwater resources. However, I don’t think we should take that for granted,” said Lucie Thomson, unit head for ambient surface water quality monitoring, Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “We have over 30 years of information, which is very important for understanding current conditions, changes in our freshwater ecosystems and the potential sources of those changes. It helps form policy and is the basis for water stewardship.”The new Canada-B.C. surface water quality web reporting tool can be viewed online: https://gov.bc.ca/canada-bc/waterquality-monitoringQuick Facts: The Fraser River is the longest river in B.C., stretching 1,375 kilometres. About 50% of all arable land in B.C. falls within the Fraser River Basin. At 580 kilometres long, the Skeena River is the second-largest river in B.C and flows southwest from the northern Interior to the Chatham Sound south of Prince Rupert. The Kettle River, a tributary to the Columbia River, crosses the Canada-U.S. border three times, at Midway, Grand Forks and south of Christina Lake.

217,2020-08-28 10:00:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020HLTH0267-001604,Government Website,Joint statement on new WestJet policy,"  Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, British Columbia’s provincial health officer, have issued the following statement regarding a new WestJet policy to share passenger contact information:“One of the most effective ways public health officials can help slow COVID-19 transmission in our communities is contact tracing. That means contacting people who may have been exposed to a confirmed case, to provide them the supports they need to self-monitor and, if necessary, get tested and self-isolate.“Throughout this pandemic, our contact tracers have had challenges reaching people who were exposed to the virus while flying – because of the limited information available on traditional flight manifests.“While the federal government regulates the airline industry, WestJet representatives met with us earlier this month to hear from us directly on how they could help.“The decision they announced today – to collect names and contact information for each of their passengers at check-in and share it with public health if a COVID-19 case is identified on a flight – is something we discussed at that meeting and will help us immensely.“It’s a policy that will keep our communities, and all passengers travelling on WestJet, WestJet Encore, WestJet Link and Swoop, safer during this pandemic.“As we continue our restart in B.C., it becomes more important to be able to connect with people and ensure those who may have been exposed to a person identified as having COVID-19 are aware of their risk. In air travel, it is still a relatively low risk, but it is a risk that we would prefer to be able to notify people of in an efficient way.“We all look forward to travelling more and must always be committed to doing it safely. WestJet is joining the many local bars and restaurants, and other businesses in British Columbia, that keep their guests’ contact information, partnering with public health, so we can connect with anyone exposed to the virus and stop it from spreading further in our communities.”    "

The strategy comes as climate change and cumulative effects are increasingly putting pressure on wildlife populations and their habitats. It will link wildlife and habitat values to other stewardship initiatives and programs across government. This collaboration will prioritize wildlife conservation and help ensure shared objectives are achieved for wildlife and habitat.“For many of us, the simple existence of wildlife is important, a fundamental value,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “Our rich natural diversity is inextricably linked to our way of life. We need to ensure that wildlife and their habitats are resilient as we face challenges like climate change.”In 2018, government provided $1 million to support engagement to develop the strategy and $3 million in 2019 for continued engagement and early implementation of actions. In 2020, $10 million is provided to support the strategy’s ongoing implementation.Moving forward, the strategy will be the basis of government’s actions toward wildlife. It outlines a vision and principles that government will take, including 24 actions and five goals:  All British Columbians have a voice in wildlife stewardship. Data, information and knowledge drive better decisions. Stewardship actions achieve tangible benefits for wildlife and their habitats. Accountability and transparency build trust and confidence. Collaborative wildlife stewardship advances reconciliation with Indigenous governments.  The strategy was developed with collaboration and input from Indigenous peoples, rural communities, academic institutions and a wide range of resource industry, conservation, hunter, trapper, guide, recreation and tourism stakeholder organizations, and more than 1,400 members of the public. The strategy:  establishes structures to bring diverse perspectives together; harnesses collective knowledge and gathers new information to prioritize work and make wise decisions; commits resources to invest into on-the-ground projects; and increases transparency and accountability to ensure the right decisions are making a difference for wildlife and the habitat they need. A Minister’s Wildlife Advisory Council has been formed to oversee implementation of the strategy. The council will advise the minister on provincewide wildlife and habitat issues. It consists of people with demonstrated expertise on wildlife and habitat stewardship with a diversity of perspectives, such as First Nations, the public, local government, academia, natural resources and other industrial sectors, and conservation organizations.Learn More:For more information on the Together for Wildlife strategy, visit: https://engage.gov.bc.ca/wildlifeandhabitat/A backgrounder follows.

Licensed and registered not-for-profit and private service operators providing high-quality, evidence-informed, bed-based treatment and recovery services can apply for a grant to expand their service capacity.Applications will be accepted from Aug. 27 to Oct. 7, 2020. Decisions will be made in the fall. Funding will be awarded through the Canadian Mental Health Association, following an adjudication process that will include the B.C. government, health authorities, the Community Action Initiative and other partners.  Bed-based treatment and recovery programs are an important part of the substance-use continuum of care available to people in British Columbia. They provide safe, structured living environments where people can focus on their recovery journey.  These grants will help address gaps in the system and improve mental health and addictions services as the Province continues to build the comprehensive system of care that British Columbians deserve.  Improving treatment and recovery services is an integral part of A Pathway to Hope, B.C.’s roadmap for making mental health and addictions care better for people in British Columbia. Implementing A Pathway to Hope is a shared priority with the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.

The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.""Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 1,737 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 2,818 in the Fraser Health region, 173 in the Island Health region, 429 in the Interior Health region, 137 in the Northern Health region and 78 cases of people who reside outside of Canada.""There has been one new COVID-19 related death, for a total of 204 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks. In total, nine long-term care or assisted-living facilities and two acute-care facilities have active outbreaks.""There is one new community outbreak with seven confirmed cases at the Teck Fording River water treatment plant construction site in the Interior Health region. Public health teams are supporting and undertaking contact tracing.""Alerts are posted on the BC Centre for Disease Control's (BCCDC) website, as well as on health authorities’ websites, providing details on where the potential exposure occurred and what actions to take – whether you need to self-isolate or monitor for symptoms.“Today, we have provided the latest local health area map of COVID-19 cases. The map will be updated each month and available on the BCCDC website. What the map tells us is that virtually every part of our province has been touched by the virus – communities large and small.“Despite the spread of COVID-19, we must continue to find the balance of restarting our activities once again, while protecting our most vulnerable by doing our best to keep ourselves and those we care about safe.“We recognize that many parents are feeling anxious about the well-being of their children with the start of ‘new school’ in September. We understand the importance of keeping our children safe.“As parents take the time to review the back-to-school plans for their schools and districts, they can take confidence in knowing the plans were built from widespread input from B.C.’s education experts, combined with the latest public health research from around in the world.“Children in B.C. will join millions of others globally who are going back to in-class learning. We will be there to support our children as they learn and adapt to the new school experience in British Columbia.“Equally important, as children get back into the classroom, public health teams will be right there with them in every school throughout our province to ensure classrooms are as safe as possible for everyone.“B.C. is reporting its first cases of suspect Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children and Adolescents, or MIS-C. There have been eight such cases diagnosed by BC Children's Hospital specialist pediatricians between March and August.“To date, eight suspected cases have been reported at BC Children’s Hospital, although importantly, all have tested negative for COVID-19 and have had no known contact with reported cases. Since none of the cases were confirmed to be linked to a COVID-19 infection, we expect they are likely due to another cause. “Monitoring for MIS-C was set up a few months ago. The eight cases were reported recently because the case definition for MIS-C recently changed to include suspected cases. There have been no confirmed cases of MIS-C reported in B.C.""The identification of these suspect cases is evidence that the system can capture this condition if it occurs in B.C. children.“COVID-19 requires new ways of living our lives, as well as new precautions and routines for ourselves and our families, whether at home, at work, at school or when spending time with others.“What remains the same is our commitment to continuing to learn and adapt our approach, in addition to doing all we can to protect our communities, our seniors and Elders, and those we care for most.”Quick Facts:Assisted living, long-term care homes and seniors' rental buildings with ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks are as follows: Vancouver Coastal Health: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility   Fraser Health Bear Creek Villa independent living facility Czorny Alzheimer Centre long-term care facility Dania Home long-term care facility Derby Manor long-term care facility George Derby Centre long-term care facility Maple Ridge Seniors Village assisted living facility MSA Manor long-term care facility (second outbreak) New Vista Care Home long-term care facility  Learn More:To see a map of COVID-19 cases by local health area, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/dataIf you are experiencing symptoms, find a collection centre near you to get tested: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testingFind out more about the new enforcement of public health officer orders on events: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020PSSG0046-001568If you have plans this weekend, follow Dr. Bonnie Henry’s Good Times Guide: https://goodtimes.gov.bc.ca/For mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca Or: www.anxietycanada.comFor a listing of the community exposure events, go to: BCCDC (flights, work sites, etc.): http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/public-exposures Fraser Health: fraserhealth.ca/covid19exposure Interior Health: https://news.interiorhealth.ca/news/public-exposures/ Island Health: https://www.islandhealth.ca/learn-about-health/covid-19/outbreaks-and-exposures Northern Health: https://www.northernhealth.ca/health-topics/outbreaks-and-exposures Vancouver Coastal: http://www.vch.ca/covid-19/public-exposuresFor B.C.’s surgical renewal plan and the first report on its progress from July 21, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020HLTH0228-001337For more information about BC’s Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/restartbcFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/ Or follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19 Or call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit: Facebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews  YouTube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBC    "

Once a proposal is in place in early 2021, BC Housing will engage with the community to share more information about the project. In addition, BC Housing will set up a new community advisory committee that will oversee the supportive housing’s integration within the community. The committee will address any concerns raised by people in the neighbourhood.“We are grateful to the Province for this important investment in supportive housing in Victoria,” said Lisa Helps, mayor, City of Victoria. “We know from experience that these new, purpose-built buildings fit well into existing neighbourhoods and create safe, secure places for people to live in our city and in communities throughout the capital region.”An experienced non-profit housing partner will be selected to manage the proposed building once the proposal has been approved. Residents will be provided with 24/7 on-site staff and support services, including meal programs, life and employment skills training, and health and wellness support services.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts: The Province has invested approximately $3.2 million through the Supportive Housing Fund to purchase the sites. Including these proposed homes, there are more than 200 new supportive homes in development or already open in Victoria. More than 23,000 homes are completed or underway in communities throughout B.C., including over 3,400 homes in the Capital Regional District.

We received over 1,780 written submissions and 4,018 surveys in the consultations. This is an area we are passionate about improving and evidently, so are you.”Dix, and members of the steering committee, Norm Letnick, health critic for the official Opposition, and Sonia Furstenau, health critic and house leader of the third party, reviewed feedback from the public, health professionals, regulators, associations, Indigenous partners, unions and health authorities to revise and finalize the recommendations.The recommendations will be presented to the executive council for their consideration. If the members agree with the recommendations, legislation will be drafted and brought forward to the legislative assembly for consideration. If passed, amendments to the Health Professions Act will put into place the legislative framework required for their implementation.Six areas of focus are aimed to improve the overall effectiveness of the system, strengthen governance and oversight, and increase transparency for the public.The recommendation to reduce the number of regulatory colleges from 20 to six will improve efficiency and support the shift toward team-based care. A new oversight body will be created to oversee the colleges and report out publicly on their progress. A new complaints process is being recommended to ensure fairness of investigations and the oversight body will be taking over the role of discipline to ensure the penalties are consistent and fair across professions and colleges. These actions will serve the dual goals of increasing oversight and transparency.The recommendations will bring the province's regulatory system into the 21st century and ensure that it works for patients in B.C.“We’re working as a team on this issue, because we all think that appropriate and safe health-care is a priority for all British Columbians,” Letnick said. “We’re impressed with the level of feedback and have considered all recommendations carefully as we propose changes for better care.”Health regulation plays a vital role in B.C. by setting and enforcing the standards of professional behaviour, competence and ethics that underpin the day-to-day interactions patients and the public have with health professionals.""The committee felt that transparency and patient safety was one of the top concerns, and the public shares those feelings,” Furstenau said. “We are listening, and we are moving forward with our efforts to create safer, leaner and more-efficient health profession regulation.”In response to concerns regarding the College of Dental Surgeons of British Columbia, Dix took the rare and significant step in 2018 of launching a review into the administrative and operational practices of the college. Harry Cayton, former chief executive of the United Kingdom’s Professional Standards Authority, was tasked to conduct the review.Cayton was further asked to review the Health Professions Act and its regulations, make recommendations, and advise the steering committee in its work to renew and improve the health regulatory system in B.C.

All units will have a private washroom and mini kitchen. Shared amenities in each wing include a laundry room, commercial kitchen and a dining lounge area where residents can enjoy meals together. The building also has a medical room to provide on-site care for residents.The Lower Post First Nation Housing Society will manage the building and provide residents with support services, such as daily meals, wellness supports and referrals to health services. In addition, residents will have access to teachings from Elders and programming that focuses on physical, mental, emotional and spiritual well-being. At least two staff members will be on site 24/7.“Thank you, BC Housing, for this new affordable housing,” said Chief Harlan Schilling, Chief Councillor, Daylu Dena Council. “So many of us see the need for affordable housing that has been talked about for many years. BC Housing is living up to its mission of developing safe, permanently affordable housing for people in northern B.C. Thank you. It will help the community of Lower Post to meet our needs now and will be there for future generations.”This project is located further north than any project BC Housing has ever built and is the first development in climate zone 8. The remote community has a population of approximately 170 people. Access to services is difficult. Due to the shortage of appropriate housing, some members of the Daylu Dena Nation are living elsewhere in the region and are interested in returning to the community when adequate housing is available.The land on which the housing will be built is owned by The North West Company. It will be leased to BC Housing at $1 per year for 30 years and is renewable on the same terms at its expiry.“North West is pleased to have been given the opportunity to play a role in this important project,” said Mike Beaulieu, vice -president of Canadian store operations for The North West Company. “Shortage of affordable housing in Indigenous communities is a problem we see across Canada. We are excited to be able to contribute the land that will enable construction of 16 new homes and look forward to seeing the positive outcomes this project will have on the community.”Construction is anticipated to be complete in fall 2021.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between the B.C. government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts: The Province is providing more than $5.1 million through the Women’s Transitional Housing Fund and approximately $6 million through the Supportive Housing Fund to the project, as well as an annual operating subsidy of approximately $408,000. North Point Construction was selected by the Province to manufacture these homes, supporting jobs and boosting the local economy.

Victims of violence deserve compassionate and comprehensive care,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “This funding for organizations serving victims of crime will help ensure that staff have the needed skill and knowledge to deliver these services in their communities.”Quick Facts: More than 80% of provincially contracted social services are provided by non-profit agencies.

These plans are the outcome of many minds coming together in every school district to take the public health guidelines that have been developed and apply them to meet the specific needs of each school district.“This has not been an easy task. We commend the many people who have put the time and effort into ensuring the best approach possible for our students, teachers and staff.“School will be new for everyone this year – just as how we spend time with friends and how we operate our businesses has required a different way of doing things than we have ever done before.“With COVID-19 in our communities for many months to come, new routines will be needed that can sustain families for the entire school year.“As we look to the year ahead, we know that British Columbians will continue to demonstrate unparalleled resiliency and determination that will help see all of us through this pandemic.“Working together, we will learn and adapt our approach as we go, as we focus our efforts on prevention, detection and rapid response. This is what will keep us strong and help protect all of us.”Quick Facts: Assisted living, long-term care homes and seniors’ rental buildings with ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks are as follows: Vancouver Coastal Health: Arbutus Care Centre long-term care facility Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility  Fraser Health: Bear Creek Villa independent-living facility Czorny Alzheimer Centre long-term care facility Dania Home long-term care facility Derby Manor long-term care facility George Derby Centre long-term care facility Maple Ridge Seniors Village assisted-living facility MSA Manor long-term care facility (second outbreak) New Vista Care Home long-term care facility   Learn More:If you are experiencing symptoms, find a collection centre near you to get tested: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testingFind out more about the new enforcement of public health officer orders on events: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020PSSG0046-001568If you have plans this weekend, follow Dr. Bonnie Henry’s Good Times Guide: https://goodtimes.gov.bc.ca/For mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca Or: www.anxietycanada.comFor a listing of the community exposure events, go to: BCCDC (flights, work sites, etc.): http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/public-exposures Fraser Health: fraserhealth.ca/covid19exposure Interior Health: https://news.interiorhealth.ca/news/public-exposures/ Island Health: https://www.islandhealth.ca/learn-about-health/covid-19/outbreaks-and-exposures Northern Health: https://www.northernhealth.ca/health-topics/outbreaks-and-exposures Vancouver Coastal: http://www.vch.ca/covid-19/public-exposuresFor B.C.’s surgical renewal plan and the first report on its progress from July 21, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020HLTH0228-001337For more information about BC’s Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/restartbcFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/ Or follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19 Or call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit: Facebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews  YouTube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBC    "
226,2020-08-26 14:00:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020EDUC0057-001592,Government Website,Detailed plans support safe return to classroom,"  Back to school plans for K-12 families are now posted for all 60 school districts, so parents and families can prepare to support their children for a safe return to the classroom.Families should visit their school district website to view their local school’s plans.      “There is no better place than in-class learning. With these plans now in place, parents can feel confident about sending their children back to school and assured that strict health and safety measures are in place to protect students and staff,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “I know that some families will continue to have medical or health concerns, and my expectation is that school districts will be flexible and work with families to provide remote options that keep children connected to their school community.”  Fleming has directed school districts to contact all families in their school communities to share their safety plans and to confirm if they are planning for their child to attend school classes in September, or if they need alternative learning options. As part of the ministry’s July 29 guidelines for planning, many districts have already begun engaging with parents to determine their needs.The Ministry of Education has also given school districts the flexibility and certainty to find options that work for families. This includes the authority for all school boards to offer remote options to students within their districts, as well as the tools they need to increase their existing programs to meet demand.“Since the beginning of the pandemic, boards of education throughout B.C. have worked hard to make sure local community needs are met within the health and safety framework provided by the provincial health officer,” said Stephanie Higginson, president, British Columbia School Trustees Association. “Districts will continue to work with parents and families, as they have always done, to ensure children returning to school in September are able to do so safely.”Parents will find detailed back to school plans on their district website. In addition to health and safety measures, the plans include: how learning groups will be organized; when masks are required; daily schedules for classes, lunch and recess; daily health assessment requirements; pick-up and drop off times; protocols for common areas; hand washing directions; and orientation information. Each school district plan follows the same strict provincial health and safety measures co-developed with the provincial health officer, the BC Centre for Disease Control and the Ministry of Education. School districts are adapting their schedules and learning groups to fit within those measures based on student population and local consultation with education partners, parents and Indigenous rightsholders.Every day, school districts are prepared to welcome all students to elementary and middle schools. For secondary schools, timetables have been modified to adhere to the health and safety requirements and ensure that all students can attend most days, with much of their instruction occurring in-class. The majority of school districts (68%) are moving to a quarterly semester system in some or all of their secondary schools.While schools may look different in different communities, all school districts are also required to follow operational guidelines developed by a provincial steering committee made up of parents, teachers, support workers, Indigenous rightsholders, school leaders and trustees. School districts were also required to consult local First Nations on the development of their plans.Families will find out: how districts will support mental health and wellness; what they are doing to ensure vulnerable students and those who require additional support in school – including students with disabilities and diverse abilities, and children and youth in care – are prioritized for full-time, in-class learning and services without delays; how they are ensuring Indigenous rightsholders are engaged in meaningful consultation; and plans for Indigenous students living on-reserve and attending public school. “On behalf of parents, I thank the ministry, and specifically Minister Fleming, for stating his clear expectations that all school districts will provide online options for parents, while ensuring all children will have the opportunity to remain connected to their school community,” said Andrea Sinclair, president, BC Confederation of Parent Advisory Councils (BCCPAC). “This is the position BCCPAC has continuously been stating at the provincial tables since June. I thank Minister Fleming for his willingness to listen and to provide flexibility for families which is in the best interests of our children.”The health and safety measures that all school districts will follow include: masks will be required for staff, middle and secondary students in high-traffic areas, such as buses, and in common areas, such as hallways, or anytime outside of their learning group whenever physical distancing cannot be maintained (exceptions will be made for students who cannot wear masks for medical reasons); even when wearing a mask, staff and students will still be required to maintain physical distance from people outside of their learning group; increased cleaning of high-contact surfaces, such as doorknobs, keyboards, desks and chairs; increased hand hygiene with all students, staff and visitors being required to clean their hands before boarding school buses and entering school buildings, before and after eating, using the washroom and using playground equipment; school districts may also install transparent barriers for people who have more contact with others, such as front-desk staff, bus drivers or food services staff, where appropriate; and staff and students (or their parents/guardians) must also assess themselves daily for illness, including symptoms of COVID-19. If any student or staff member has even mild symptoms, arrangements will be made for that person to return home. Quick Facts: The Ministry of Education has developed a five-stage approach to operate schools, depending on risk of transmission and guidance from the provincial health officer. This helps school districts know what to expect if there is a significant change to school operations required as part of B.C.’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Operational plans for independent schools will be reviewed by the ministry by the end of this week. Those plans will be posted on school websites early next week. To support and ensure the health and safety of students and staff during this pandemic, a one-time investment of $45.6 million as part of B.C.’s COVID-19 Action Plan will support school districts and independent schools for the start of the school year. This funding will support the purchase of up to 1.5 million masks, enough for every public-school staff member and student to have at least two masks.  Canadian Shield, a manufacturer of personal protective equipment products in Ontario, recently announced it is donating an additional 54,500 face shields for K-12 schools in B.C., adding to the inventory of personal protective equipment that will be available for students and staff.

227,2020-08-26 11:30:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020MAH0097-001588,Government Website,New affordable rental housing coming to Port Alberni,"  Construction is set to start on nearly 50 new, affordable rental homes for families and seniors in Port Alberni, as a result of a partnership between the Province and the Alberni Low Energy Housing Society (ALEHS).“I am so excited to see this project moving forward as we continue to make investments in the affordable housing people in our community need,” said Scott Fraser, MLA for Mid Island-Pacific Rim. “The mix of subsidized and affordable rentals will benefit a wide range of people in our community, while the passive design will help ensure heating and utility costs also remain affordable for residents. Thank you to our partners, the Alberni Low Energy Housing Society, for their hard work and dedication on this project.”Located at 4450 Maitland St., the project will be a four-storey, 46-unit apartment building for families and seniors, ranging from those on income assistance to those with incomes up to $113,040. The development will provide one-, two- and three-bedroom homes. Monthly rents will be a mix of subsidized and affordable market rents.ALEHS will own and operate the building. The society is focused on developing low-energy housing and the building will aim to meet the energy efficiency requirements necessary to achieve a passive house certification. Passive house buildings consume up to 90% less heating and cooling energy than conventional buildings, dramatically reducing operating costs and aligning with long-term goals under the CleanBC Plan.“The board of the Alberni Low Energy Housing Society is extremely pleased to provide highly energy efficient and superior quality housing for people with financial challenges,” said Mike Ruttan, board chair, Alberni Low Energy Housing Society. “This project will be for the whole range of demographics within our city: seniors, youth, children and families. It’s one that we believe people will be proud to live in and call home. We aim to create a sense of community where everyone works to create a sense of belonging and co-operation. This project would not have been possible without the support of BC Housing and its belief in our vision.”Construction is expected to start in September and the homes are expected to open in fall 2021.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Learn More:A map showing the location of all announced provincially funded housing projects in B.C. is available online: https://www.bchousing.org/homes-for-BCFor more information on how BC Housing is supporting British Columbians during the COVID-19 outbreak, visit: https://www.bchousing.org/COVID-19To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/Two backgrounders follow.

Earlier this month, we passed Bill 23, which amended the Workers Compensation Act based on three expert reports. However, the legislation did not address a fourth report that reviewed several other areas of the workers’ compensation system.“Last year, retired labour lawyer Janet Patterson was contracted to undertake a focused review of the workers’ compensation system and to make recommendations on what an improved system should look like.“I would like to thank Ms. Patterson for her detailed review and thank the many injured workers and others who took time to share their experiences. Ms. Patterson consulted widely and heard from more than 2,000 people and organizations from around the province. The feedback was both extensive and thoughtful, and I am grateful to everyone who participated.“We are making this report public so the people who provided feedback know that their voices have been heard and reflected in the report and its findings. This is an extensive review to consider. There are over 100 recommendations, of which about 60 are for operational and process changes within WorkSafeBC. It contains substantial information and recommendations that will take some significant time to carefully review.“In Bill 23, we made modest yet meaningful improvements to the Workers Compensation Act that support worker safety and improve the effectiveness of the system, while also being financially prudent. At this time, we are focused on implementing these improvements, along with doing our part to keep people healthy and safe as we work together to address the impact of COVID-19 on both workers and employers across British Columbia.”Improving fairness and safety for workers and ensuring balance in workplaces are shared priorities between government, the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and are part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Learn More:Patterson’s report is available at: https://engage.gov.bc.ca/workerscompensationreview/    "

However, there continue to be community exposure events at other locations and on flights into and out of the province.""Alerts are posted on the BC Centre for Disease Control's (BCCDC) website, as well as on health authorities' websites, providing details on where the potential exposure occurred and what actions to take – whether you need to self-isolate or monitor for symptoms.“We know that COVID-19 is going to be with us for many months to come. As a result, unlike other viruses that have a vaccine, our focus is to keep new cases low and slow, and quickly contain new outbreaks as they occur.“Our recent daily cases are higher than many of us are comfortable with, so let’s continue to do our part every moment of every day and keep COVID-19 where it needs to be.“While we would all like to get to zero, we need to rather focus on prevention, detection and rapid response.“Living with COVID-19 in our communities also means being unrelenting in our commitment to support and care for each other; to reach out to our vulnerable neighbours, friends and family members.“Many people have lost fathers and mothers, sons and daughters directly to the illness. For others, as evidenced by the latest BC Coroner’s Service report on illicit drug deaths, an existing crisis has worsened as a result of the pandemic. Our thoughts and condolences also go out to the families and communities of the 175 people we lost to the toxic street drug supply in July.“We know where the risks are and who is most vulnerable, which means we can put the right precautions in place based on the location, risk of transmission and potential severity of illness.“We have adapted our personal activities and our businesses, because we now understand what we need to do to keep ourselves and those around us safe.“Let’s stay committed to doing our part, to care and protect our most vulnerable and show kindness and compassion to everyone.”Quick Facts:Assisted living, long-term care homes and seniors' rental buildings with ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks are as follows:Vancouver Coastal Health: Arbutus Care Centre long-term care facility Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility Fraser Health Czorny Alzheimer Centre long-term care facility Dania Home long-term care facility Derby Manor long-term care facility George Derby Centre long-term care facility Maple Ridge Seniors Village assisted living facility MSA Manor long-term care facility (second outbreak) New Vista Care Home long-term care facility Bear Creek Villa independent living facility Learn More:If you are experiencing symptoms, find a collection centre near you to get tested: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testingFor mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca Or: www.anxietycanada.comFor a listing of the community exposure events, go to:BCCDC (flights, work sites, etc.): http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/public-exposures Fraser Health: fraserhealth.ca/covid19exposure Interior Health: https://news.interiorhealth.ca/news/public-exposures/ Island Health: https://www.islandhealth.ca/learn-about-health/covid-19/outbreaks-and-exposures Northern Health: https://www.northernhealth.ca/health-topics/outbreaks-and-exposures Vancouver Coastal: http://www.vch.ca/covid-19/public-exposuresFor B.C.'s surgical renewal plan and the first report on its progress from July 21, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020HLTH0228-001337For more information about BC's Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/restartbcFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/ Or follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19 Or call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit: Facebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews YouTube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBC    "

A heart-wrenching 175 people lost their lives in July due to an illegal drug supply that is more toxic than it has ever been in B.C. These were treasured friends, neighbours, partners, parents and children. The vast majority were men between the ages of 19 and 49. Some were fathers. They were people from all walks of life who cared deeply about their families and the people they loved.“Prior to COVID-19, overdose deaths were coming down in B.C. for the first time since 2012. Several years of efforts to save lives were making a difference. Last year, analysis from the BC Centre for Disease Control estimated that nearly 6,000 deaths have been averted since April 2016, thanks to the life-saving supports that are in place here, including scaling up the distribution of naloxone, the establishment of more overdose preventions sites and improved access to medication-assisted treatment. But these efforts have strained against the challenges of COVID-19.“Social isolation, disconnection from community and in-person supports, financial pressures, growing mental health challenges, and a drug supply that is becoming more and more toxic, have all contributed to an increase in substance use and increased risk. B.C. is not alone. The impacts of a toxic drug supply are being felt across Canada. From March to July, suspected overdose deaths jumped 85% in Toronto over the same period in 2019. In Montreal, July had the highest number of deaths recorded in one month since 2014. In the Yukon, overdose deaths so far in 2020 are double that of all 2019. And in Alberta, there were 60 overdose deaths in March, compared to 39 in February of this year. So many valued lives have gone far, far too soon.“We have been working flat-out to reduce overdose deaths since we formed government. Since COVID-19 hit, we have escalated our response to counter the effects of the pandemic and to get more people on a path to treatment and recovery. Since March, we have introduced new guidance to give people access to a safe supply of prescription medications, doubled the number of youth treatment beds in the province, invested $10.5 million to increase the number of overdose prevention sites (including inhalation sites and supplies), provided more outreach teams, enabled registered nurses to help implement the safe supply guidance, invested $16 million in the creation of more bed-based treatment and recovery services, partnered with the federal government to support innovative harm reduction programs and supported or enhanced 16 substance-use integrated teams to make sure that people who connect with the health-care system stay connected.“We know there is more work to do, and we could not do it without the continued heroic efforts of the frontline workers, peer support workers and first responders who pour their hearts and souls into saving lives, day in and day out.“British Columbians showed the world what we could do when it came to COVID-19. We joined together, we took care of one another and we kept people safe. We must do the same for the overdose public health emergency in this province and we must do it now.”A backgrounder follows.    "
233,2020-08-25 09:35:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020PSSG0048-001580,Government Website,Toxic supply continues to contribute to loss of lives in B.C.,"  The BC Coroners Service has published updated reports on illicit drug toxicity deaths and fentanyl-detected drug deaths to the end of July 2020, with 175 illicit drug toxicity deaths reported in July.This is the third consecutive month with more than 170 suspected illicit drug deaths reported to the BC Coroners Service.“The number of people dying in B.C. due to an unsafe drug supply continues to surpass deaths due to homicides, motor vehicle incidents, suicides and COVID-19 combined,” said Lisa Lapointe, chief coroner. “This health emergency continues to take a tragic toll on people from all walks of life and in all communities of the province. Access to key harm reduction services in the midst of a dual health emergency has been a challenge, and the extreme concentration of the illicit fentanyl being trafficked is resulting in deaths within moments of use.“It is not uncommon for two or three people using together to die suddenly and with no opportunity to seek help. Given the high prevalence of fentanyl detected in all fatal overdoses, if you are using illicit substances – whether it be fentanyl, heroin, cocaine or methamphetamines – it is critical that you use only in the presence of someone willing and able to inject naloxone and call for emergency assistance.“As the risks for those purchasing from the illicit market are extreme, we continue to encourage clinicians to support those at risk of overdose by prescribing safe supply. We also continue to advocate for an accessible, evidence-based and accountable treatment and recovery system for anyone experiencing problematic substance use who is seeking this medical assistance.”The illicit drug toxicity death total for July 2020 (175) represents a 136% increase over the number of deaths seen in July 2019 (74). The BC Coroners Service has detected a sustained increase of illicit drug toxicity deaths since March, and the province has now recorded five consecutive months with over 100 illicit drug toxicity deaths.“What the latest numbers show us is that the overdose crisis has been made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic and the unprecedented tragedy of death and loss to families in our province continues,” said Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer. “The toxicity of drug supply is extreme, and I implore anyone who may be using drugs to not do it alone. For friends and family members who are concerned about loved ones, reach out and connect with them and let them know they are not alone.”Once again, post-mortem toxicology testing data published in this report suggest an increase in the number of cases with extreme fentanyl concentrations (exceeding 50 micrograms per litre) in April, May, June and July 2020 compared with previous months.“Access to a safer supply remains the number 1, most urgently needed intervention to stop overdoses and stop people from dying,” said Guy Felicella, peer clinical advisor with the Overdose Emergency Response Centre and BC Centre on Substance Use. “Let’s be clear. Nobody chooses to become addicted to drugs and nobody chooses to die of an overdose. We can give people a choice though: to choose between the toxic, poisoned street drug supply that is fuelling these deaths or pharmaceutical alternatives in the form of a safer supply. Making that choice a reality is a matter of life and death.”There have been 909 illicit drug deaths to date in 2020 in B.C., and the number of deaths in each health authority is at or near the highest monthly totals ever recorded. The number of non-fatal overdose incidents is also increasing, with a record high of more than 2,700 calls reported by BC Emergency Health Services (BCEHS) in July.“Paramedics are responding to and reviving overdose patients about 80 times a day, every single day in B.C.,” said Jon Deakin, paramedic practice leader with BCEHS. “It’s a lot. It’s the highest number of daily overdoses BCEHS has ever seen.”Learn More:Illicit drug overdose death report: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/birth-adoption-death-marriage-and-divorce/deaths/coroners-service/statistical/illicit-drug.pdfFentanyl-detected death report: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/birth-adoption-death-marriage-and-divorce/deaths/coroners-service/statistical/fentanyl-detected-overdose.pdfMode of Consumption report: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/birth-adoption-death-marriage-and-divorce/deaths/coroners-service/statistical/mode-of-consumption.pdfToward the Heart: http://www.towardtheheart.comStop Overdose BC: https://www.stopoverdose.gov.bc.caBC Centre on Substance Use:  http://www.bccsu.caRisk mitigation prescribing guidelines in the context of dual public health emergencies: https://www.bccsu.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Risk-Mitigation-in-the-Context-of-Dual-Public-Health-Emergencies-v1.5.pdfLifeguard app: http://www.phsa.ca/about/news-stories/news-releases/2020-news/new-lifeguard-app-launched-to-help-prevent-overdosesBC Centre for Disease Control overdose response indicators: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-professionals/data-reports/overdose-response-indicatorsA backgrounder follows.

In the first reporting period from Aug. 21 to 22, we had 109 new cases. Aug. 22 to 23, we had 81 new cases, and in the last 24 hours, we have had an additional 79 new cases.“This represents 269 new cases, including five epi-linked cases since we reported on Friday, for a total of 5,184 cases in British Columbia.“There are 913 active cases of COVID-19 in the province, 2,594 people who are under active public health monitoring as a result of identified exposure to known cases, and 4,068 people who tested positive have recovered.“Currently, 18 individuals are hospitalized with COVID-19, five of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 1,651 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 2,739 in the Fraser Health region, 166 in the Island Health region, 425 in the Interior Health region, 127 in the Northern Health region and 76 cases of people who reside outside of Canada.“There has been one new COVID-19 related death in the Fraser Health region, for a total of 203 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There has been one new health-care facility outbreak at MSA Manor in the Fraser Health region. In total, nine long-term care or assisted-living facilities and one acute-care facility have active outbreaks.“There are no new community outbreaks. The outbreak at Fraser Valley Packers Inc. has been declared over. There also continues to be community exposure events at other locations and on flights into and out of the province.“Alerts are posted on the BC Centre for Disease Control's (BCCDC) website, as well as on health authorities’ websites, providing details on where the potential exposure occurred and what actions to take – whether you need to self-isolate, or monitor for symptoms.“As we live with COVID-19 in our communities, our goals are clear: to prevent cases through our personal safety measures, detect new cases as quickly as possible and respond just as quickly to contain the spread of the virus.“Public health teams continue to closely watch our key indicators to ensure we are staying where we need to be. This includes monitoring the level of community spread, as well as the percentage of positive tests. In both cases, right now we are staying within the range of where we need to be.“We still have low transmission and we want to keep it that way as our summer continues and we look to the fall. It is about finding the balance – protecting vulnerable people and keeping our activities going.“Our COVID-19 response in B.C. is about all of us doing our part and taking the right precautions based on our circumstances. It is about protecting those around us and protecting ourselves.“While there are a few that have disregarded public health measures, new enforcement rules are in place to shore up the gaps that have emerged.“This is how we will get through this storm together – supporting each other, adjusting our approach as we learn more about the virus and tailoring our activities to the circumstances before us.“Let’s stay strong and continue to use the basic steps to live safely while COVID-19 is still a part of our lives.

People in North Vancouver will benefit from the changes, which will help traffic to flow better and help vehicles safely merge. The work will reconfigure the eastbound Dollarton Highway and Main Street on-ramps to share the third lane of the Ironworkers Memorial Bridge using adaptive signalling. Adaptive signal-control technology adjusts the timing of red, yellow and green lights to accommodate changing traffic patterns to ease traffic congestion and provide a safer merge. This will improve traffic flow and reduce travel time for people heading eastbound. The signalling system will also help reduce fuel consumption and lessen greenhouse gas emissions caused by idling cars. The project will include a new bus queue jump lane that will make it easier for buses to enter the highway from the Phibbs exchange. Various active-transportation improvements are also being made that will make it easier and safer for pedestrians and cyclists to enter and exit the North Shore, Ironworkers and local transit stations.Construction on this segment of the Lower Lynn Improvement Project is expected to begin in the coming weeks with completion expected for fall 2021.Once the full Lower Lynn Improvement Project is complete, Highway 1 travel during peak times is expected to be reduced by at least nine minutes in the eastbound direction and four minutes in the westbound direction between the top of the cut to mid-span Ironworkers Memorial Bridge.  The new roadwork will create safer merge lanes and reduce the risk of accidents in the area.Making investments to improve active transportation is part of the B.C. government’s Active Transportation Strategy, Move. Commute. Connect. The strategy supports the government’s commitment to ensure that new bridges and interchanges are designed to make walking, cycling and transit safe and convenient. The strategy is part of CleanBC, a plan to help transform how people move around, while encouraging more active transportation in communities. CleanBC is a pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. CleanBC was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s emission targets.Funding for all four phases of the Lower Lynn Improvement Project is being provided by the Province of B.C. ($76.7 million), Government of Canada ($55 million), the District of North Vancouver ($57 million) and third parties ($9.2 million), for a total investment of $198 million.Provincial construction sites have protocols and policies in place, following the requirements of the provincial health officer, to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. These measures include physical distancing and other protocols to ensure worker and public safety.Learn More:Lower Lynn Improvement Project: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation/transportation-infrastructure/projects/highway-1-lower-lynn-improvementsFor guidance to construction sites operating during COVID-19, visit: http://ow.ly/P7WS50z8hNTFor the most up-to-date highway travel information, go to @DriveBC on Twitter Or visit: https://www.drivebc.ca/CleanBC: https://cleanbc.gov.bc.ca/    "

The complex care transition centre will serve as a stepping-stone between acute hospital care, community care and home, providing services under a new, unique model of care designed to support patients and families with the transition.This “campus” of care will be fully integrated, patient and family-centred, and provide trauma-informed care in a culturally safe environment. The centre will support children in improving the quality of their lives, and those of their family, through education and building local care capacity for those moving back home from an acute care setting, but may not be ready for a full return, as well as helping to avoid crisis situations requiring admission to an acute care facility.Patients up to 19 years of age and their families will be able to access health-care services ranging from assessment, examination and treatment to education, training and research. Care will be provided by an interdisciplinary team of doctors, nurse practitioners, nurses and allied health professionals. The centre will also provide training for parents and caregivers to help with care delivery at home, as well as supports for siblings. In addition, the virtual campus and provincewide community-based care network will extend the reach of the centre to every area of B.C. and will also include training and support for caregivers and clinicians.“Nearly 8,000 children with complex medical and physical needs have accessed BC Children’s Hospital services in the past two years, and that population is only expected to grow,” said Benoit Morin, president and CEO, Provincial Health Services Authority. “We are dedicated to helping children and families across the province lead the fullest and healthiest possible lives and we would like to thank Minister Dix and the Government of B.C. for supporting us as we look forward to building stronger families and more inclusive communities through a new children’s complex care transition centre.”Kennedy Stewart, mayor of Vancouver, said: “East Vancouver has a long legacy of providing children’s health-care services and this site has always been a point of pride for the community. I am pleased to see this legacy carried forward with a new children’s complex care transition centre. The city looks forward to working closely with PHSA and the Ministry of Health to help keep children’s health care services in East Vancouver.”The new facility will be located at the current site of the Sunny Hill Health Centre for Children, which is on schedule to relocate to the main campus of the BC Children’s and Women’s Hospitals at the end of August 2020. Sunny Hill’s relocation is part of the third and final phase of the BC Children’s and BC Women’s Redevelopment Project, which also included construction of a new clinical support building and the Teck Acute Care Centre.There will be close links between the services provided on the site and those provided on the main BC Children’s Hospital campus on Oak Street. The new services will not replicate the acute services provided at BC Children’s Hospital.A backgrounder follows.    "

Sport moves into Phase 3,"  Athletes throughout British Columbia will be able to engage in more organized sport activities and some competitive play as the Province moves to Phase 3 of the Return to Sport Guidelines.“I know athletes and their families have been missing the joy of competition these past few months,” said Lisa Beare, Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture. “viaSport has done a great job working with health officials and our amateur sport organizations to ensure we can safely and gradually return to game play. I encourage everyone – players, parents, coaches and volunteers – to continue to work together to make sure we can play and compete safely.”The BC Centre for Disease Control has reviewed viaSport’s Return to Sport Guidelines for Phase 3. The guidelines contain recommendations for how different types of sports now can progressively add activities back again while continuing to adhere to current public health recommendations. This new guidance addresses contact activities, cohorts, competitions, high-performance training environments and travel.“Sport is an important part of mental and physical health for children, youth, families and our communities,” said Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer. “These guidelines will enable the social and emotional benefits of sport, while ensuring the sports activities remain as safe as possible.”Under Phase 3 of the Return to Sport Guidelines, amateur sport activities may be able to engage in: additional training opportunities; modified games and matches; and league play and competitions within sport cohorts. “Team play and friendly competition are at the heart of amateur sport,” said Charlene Krepiakevich, chief executive officer, viaSport. “Now, as we enter Phase 3, we will start to see more sport activities in communities around the province. While these guidelines offer key parameters for the increase in sport activity, each sport will advance at a different pace depending on community capacity and readiness. I want to thank all of the staff, organizers and volunteers who continue to ensure amateur sport in B.C. is safe and fun for everyone. As we move forward, the health and safety of all participants are our number 1 priority.”In June 2020, viaSport released its Return to Sport Guidelines to support the amateur sport sector through the careful and gradual restarting of sports in B.C. communities. With Phase 3, each provincial sport organization can use the overarching guidelines to develop or revise its sport-specific plans. To date, 60 organizations have completed their return to play plans.Quick Facts: There are 72 funded sport organizations throughout B.C. and 4,100 local sport organizations with over 800,000 youth and adult participants. Sport and physical activity play an important role in the physical, psychological and emotional well-being of people in B.C. viaSport British Columbia is a not-for-profit organization. Created with the support of the provincial government in 2011, viaSport leads the province's sport sector to build a stronger, more effective system that brings more families to the field of play, more fans into the stands, more athletes to the podium and more sports events to the province.

Three of their adult children, Alfred, George and Ethel, remained in England. Benjamin, Alfred and Cyril each filed on a quarter section of the farm property. In 1934, Dorothy married William Evans and they had two children, William (Bill) and Mona. The family owned cows and grew some grain crops. William passed away in 1947 and Dorothy continued to farm with her son Bill.In the meantime, John and Lenore Albright acquired a quarter section of land for their farm in July 1920 after moving from Whitman, Wash. They brought with them their son Russell, and daughters Gladys and Mabel. Lenore died in 1928, followed by her husband John in 1958. Russell started farming in the early 1930’s. He hired a housekeeper, Minnie Cornish, a divorced mother of four and the two married. They had three more children together, including a daughter, Marion.In the 1970’s, Russell and Minnie moved to town and their original quarter section was sold. However, by this time, Bill Evans and Marion Albright married and began farming on the property, alongside Dorothy. Bill and Marion had four sons: William, Wade, Desmond and Glyn. All were raised on the farm in Doe River. In 1999, Bill and Marion’s son, Glyn, and his wife Stephanie came back to the farm, eventually buying seven more quarter sections of land, including the original quarter section of John and Lenore Albright.“These two families I descend from have been closely intertwined since settling here in 1920,” said Glyn Evans. “As all pioneers did, they relied on each other as neighbors. Minnie, my maternal grandmother, acted as midwife for the birth of my father. My mom and dad grew up just a half mile from each other. The farm still acts as an anchor to the family. My maternal uncles and cousins often visit, as do the cousins on the paternal side and my brothers and their children are on the farm daily.”Today, Evans Farms is a cow-calf operation on more than 850 hectares (2,100 acres). The family grows some grain crops, mostly for feed. Glyn and Stephanie have four daughters, and the sixth generation, Glyn and Stephanie’s two granddaughters and their grandson, have attended their first spring brandings at the family farm.

The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 1,569 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 2,572 in the Fraser Health region, 160 in the Island Health region, 417 in the Interior Health region, 122 in the Northern Health region and 75 cases of people who reside outside of Canada.“There have been two new COVID-19 related deaths in the Fraser Health region, for a total of 202 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks. In total, eight long-term care or assisted-living facilities and one acute-care facility have active outbreaks.“There are no new community outbreaks. However, community exposure events continue.“Alerts are posted on the BC Centre for Disease Control’s (BCCDC) website, as well as on health authorities’ websites, providing details on where potential exposure occurred and what actions to take – whether you need to self-isolate or monitor for symptoms.“COVID-19 is going to be with us for the foreseeable future. What that means for British Columbians is that we are all learning to live our lives with the virus in our communities.“Public health teams know what they need to do and so do you. We know that with appropriate protective measures, we can reduce the risk of COVID-19 and live our lives.“COVID-19 prevention looks different in different places. In public, around people we do not know, we focus on giving people more space. In workplaces and classrooms where we interact with people we know, keeping our groups smaller, staying home when sick and reducing very close face-to-face contact is the goal.“The public health response is about reducing virus spread by establishing appropriate safety plans in businesses, schools and other settings, detecting and isolating new cases as quickly as possible and containing the spread when clusters occur.“Today, Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, announced new enforcement measures focused on those locations and activities that are known to be at highest risk and the sustained sources for transmission. These measures help to shore up a gap that has emerged.“However, it is important to remember that the people who choose to disregard public health orders are the exception. Rather, we are heartened that the vast majority of people in B.C. are doing their part to protect themselves and each other.“This weekend, take a few minutes to remind yourself of the steps we all take each day and every day. Together, we have the knowledge, we have the skills and the expertise. Let’s continue to protect our most vulnerable, our elders, our communities and ourselves.”Quick Facts: Assisted living, long-term care homes and seniors’ rental buildings with ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks are as follows: Vancouver Coastal Health: Arbutus Care Centre long-term care facility Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility  Fraser Health Czorny Alzheimer Centre long-term care facility Dania Home long-term care facility Derby Manor long-term care facility George Derby Centre long-term care facility Maple Ridge Seniors Village assisted living facility New Vista Care Home long-term care facility   Learn More:If you are experiencing symptoms, find a collection centre near you to get tested: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testing Find out more about the new enforcement of public health officer orders on events: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020PSSG0046-001568If you have plans this weekend, follow Dr. Bonnie Henry's Good Times Guide: https://goodtimes.gov.bc.ca/For mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca Or: www.anxietycanada.comFor a listing of the community exposure events, go to: BCCDC (flights, work sites, etc.): http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/public-exposures Fraser Health: fraserhealth.ca/covid19exposure Interior Health: https://news.interiorhealth.ca/news/public-exposures/ Island Health: https://www.islandhealth.ca/learn-about-health/covid-19/outbreaks-and-exposures Northern Health: https://www.northernhealth.ca/health-topics/outbreaks-and-exposures Vancouver Coastal: http://www.vch.ca/covid-19/public-exposuresFor B.C.’s surgical renewal plan and the first report on its progress from July 21, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020HLTH0228-001337For more information about BC’s Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/restartbcFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/ Or follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19 Or call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit: Facebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews  YouTube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBC    "
241,2020-08-21 14:00:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020HLTH0257-001569,Government Website,B.C. expands biosimilars program,"  British Columbia continues to lead the way in Canada, expanding its biosimilars program and using savings to introduce new improvements in patient care.Biosimilars are highly similar versions of bioengineered drugs, known as biologics.As of Aug. 20, 2020, about 1,600 patients on the drug rituximab, also known as Rituxan, will have six months to transition to one of three biosimilars, namely Truxima, Riximyo or Ruxience.Rituximab is eligible for PharmaCare coverage as a limited benefit for the treatment of conditions including severely active rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, and relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.Coverage decisions are informed by evidence from international jurisdictions that have more than 10 years' experience with these innovative drugs.“We take great care here in British Columbia to examine the evidence thoroughly,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “We have seen great successes with our Biosimilars Initiative, with thousands of patients transitioning to safe and equally effective biosimilar drugs.”Biosimilars cost anywhere from 25% to 50% less than biologics, yet Canada is significantly behind other jurisdictions at approximately 8% use rate; other nations have upwards of 50% to 95%.“This work is allowing us to put another $30.7 million over the next three years, in addition to the $96.6 million from earlier phases of the Biosimilars Initiative back into B.C.’s health-care system. It also adds new drugs to our formulary, meaning more people get affordable access to the medications they need,” Dix said. “The savings have allowed expanded coverage of treatments for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults, and treatments that mitigate the risk of heart attack or stroke.”Health Canada confirms that patients and health-care providers can have confidence that biosimilars are effective and safe for each of their authorized indications, and that no clinical differences are expected following a change from a biosimilar to its reference biologic drug. Other federal organizations also support the use of biosimilars.Bioengineered drugs, known as biologics, are collectively the single biggest expense for public drug plans, and their costs continue to climb. For example, in 2018, B.C. spent $84.2 million on Remicade.The initial biosimilars program announcement in May 2019 highlighted that about 20,700 British Columbians living with either ankylosing spondylitis, diabetes, plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis would have six months to work with their health-care team to transition their prescription from the originator biologics (Enbrel, Remicade, and Lantus) to the biosimilar equivalent by Nov. 25, 2019. In Phase 2, about 2,000 patients taking Remicade for Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis had six months, from September 2019 to March 2020, to switch to the biosimilar version of infliximab.As of April 2020, many patients had met with their prescriber and switched from a biologic drug to biosimilar versions. For those PharmaCare-covered patients taking Enbrel, 85% had switched to Brenzys or Erelzi; 84% of patients switched from Remicade to Inflectra or Renflexis for non-gastrointestinal (GI) indications, and 78% for GI indications; and 71% of patients moved from Lantus to Basaglar.Exceptions may be granted for patients whose physicians determine they are medically unable to transition to a biosimilar. Exceptional coverage requests are reviewed by PharmaCare’s Special Authority Branch on a case-by-case basis in consultation with physician-led advisory committees, as needed.This announcement continues to work toward improving access to prescription drugs for British Columbians. A list of drugs recently added to the PharmaCare formulary can be found in the backgrounder.In January 2019, B.C. made a $105-million investment, over three years, to reduce and/or eliminate deductibles and co-payments for lower-income British Columbians. B.C. also held a leading role in the national Generics 2.0 agreement to lower costs of the most commonly prescribed drugs and actively participates in the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance to negotiate for lower drug costs for all Canadians. British Columbia will continue to work to make sure everyone can afford and receive the medication they need. Learn More:Patients or health-care providers with questions about transitioning to a biosimilar can access support by emailing: Biosimilars.Initiative@gov.bc.ca Or calling 1 844 915-5005 from Monday to Friday, from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (Pacific time).For more information about biosimilars: www2.gov.bc.ca/biosimilarsFour backgrounders follow.

This includes liquor, cannabis and gaming inspectors, community safety unit inspectors and conservation officers.“As a regional federation of local governments, we welcome these new measures, and we look forward to collaborating with the Province to ensure a co-ordinated and thoughtful response to COVID-19,” said Linda Buchanan, vice-chair, Metro Vancouver board of directors. “Metro Vancouver will continue its critical role as a convener on ideas and strategies for preventing the spread of COVID-19 in our region and supporting the Province in keeping COVID-19 at bay.""The enforcement focus will be on $2,000 fines to owners, operators and organizers for contraventions of the provincial health officer’s order on gatherings and events. This includes hosting a private party or public event in excess of 50 people, failing to provide appropriate hand sanitation and washroom facilities, failing to provide sufficient space in the venue for physical distancing, failing to obtain a list of names and contacts at  large event or having more than five guests gathered in a vacation accommodation.When required, police and other provincial enforcement officers will also be able to actively enforce the order and ticket a series of other infractions, including: $200 violation tickets for individuals who actively encourage others to attend gatherings or events that do not comply with established requirements, or refuse to leave or disperse when directed to do so by enforcement officers; and, $200 violation tickets for individuals who refuse to comply with requests to follow the PHO order or safe operating procedures of a restaurant, bar or other licensed establishment, or respond with abusive behaviour towards employees. Violation tickets expand the Province’s enforcement toolkit to support the COVID-19 response. Police and other provincial enforcement officers will independently exercise discretion to issue tickets for Emergency Program Act order violations under the Offence Act’s Violation Ticket Administration and Fines Regulation.If violation tickets do not act as a deterrent, or in cases of particularly egregious contraventions or for repeat offenders, police can recommend charges in relation to the offence. On conviction, judicial penalties of up to $10,000 may be levied.“ABLE BC is pleased to see the Province step up compliance and enforcement during this recent surge in COVID-19 cases, and we’re happy to assist where we can,” said Jeff Guignard, executive director of the Alliance of Beverage Licensees. “Our primary concern continues to be the health and safety of both patrons and workers in British Columbia.”Working in partnership with local governments and other agencies, a comprehensive and integrated compliance and enforcement regime is being built to manage the recent surge in COVID-19 cases. These violation tickets build on existing tools, such as the ability to suspend or revoke the business or liquor licenses of problematic operators.Quick Facts: The specifics around orders of the PHO, including the numbers allowable at gatherings, will continue to be set at the direction of the PHO. To report concerns around order violations from event organizers, venues or individuals, contact your local government’s bylaw office. Local bylaw officers can help followup on concerns and engage the Unified Command Centre, police departments, health officers and WorkSafeBC as necessary. If unable to reach a local bylaw office, contact your local police department’s non-emergency line. An additional measure in this Emergency Program Act order is the requirement for compliance and enforcement agencies (i.e., police departments, local authorities) to report on these activities when requested.

Proposed improvements would contribute to a more reliable connection between Victoria and Duncan, while increasing safety for drivers and people visiting Goldstream park.Proposed improvements include: widening and minor realignment along 1.7 kilometres of road to accommodate the installation of median barriers, wider paved shoulders, roadside barrier and improvements to the Finlayson Arm Road intersection; and elements to improve active transportation options and the safety and experience for Goldstream park visitors, such as enhancing and protecting an existing trail overlooking the river parallel to the highway, improved parking and trail network connections, a pedestrian bridge over the Goldstream River and a safe pedestrian highway crossing structure. The project will take place within existing highway right-of-way. No park boundary adjustments are being proposed to Goldstream Provincial Park. The highway will remain one lane in each direction.Due to COVID-19, engagement will take place online between Aug. 20 and Sept. 20, 2020. People can learn more about the proposed improvements and submit questions and feedback via an online questionnaire found on the project website here: www.gov.bc.ca/malahatsafetyimprovementsPublic input received during the engagement period will be considered, while advancing and finalizing the design.The Goldstream Median Barrier Widening project is part of the larger ongoing Malahat Improvement Project. Over 60% of the Malahat corridor is now median divided. Only Goldstream park and a four-kilometre section near the summit between Split Rock View Point and Bamberton remain undivided.In the summer months, the ministry’s traffic data shows that more than 29,000 people drive Highway 1 through the Goldstream park area every day. Daily traffic has increased by nearly 4,000 cars a day over the past 10 years.    "

I’m grateful that soon, 750 students will have a seismically safe learning environment.”Abbotsford Traditional Secondary school will be seismically safe by September 2022. The project is based off input and consultation from parents of the school’s students and the school community. “We are pleased to be able to proceed with the seismic and related improvements to Abbotsford Traditional Secondary,” said Stan Petersen, chair, Abbotsford Board of Education. “I know the students, parents and staff have been waiting for all approvals to be finalized. We look forward to seeing work commence and final completion in the fall of 2022 for an upgraded school and an enhanced learning environment for our students.”In addition to the seismic project at Abbotsford Traditional Secondary, the Province recently announced $24.7 million in funding for a new elementary school in Abbotsford’s Eagle Mountain neighbourhood, which is expected to be ready for students in September 2022. This project will add 460 seats to the district.Built in 1959, Abbotsford Traditional Secondary underwent seven expansions between 1962 and 1997. A further addition included a new 14-classroom block, offices, a gymnasium and multipurpose room, as well as home economics and art rooms. The school serves middle and secondary (grades 6 to 12) students.These investments in student safety are part of government’s work to accelerate the Seismic Mitigation Program to ensure every B.C. student can attend a seismically safe school as soon as possible.Since September 2017, the Province has announced over $1 billion for seismic upgrades or replacements at 48 B.C. schools, creating nearly 27,000 safe seats, with many more to come.To continue this momentum, Budget 2020 includes $975 million for B.C.’s Seismic Mitigation Program.

An eastbound tractor-trailer carrying crude oil lost control, crashed and caught fire on the bridge, resulting in multi-day closures and spill response.The project will repair the remaining damage to ensure the long-term integrity of the structure. The bridge typically carries more than 2,800 vehicles a day in the summer.The $3.6-million project will include replacement of the fire-damaged girders and timber sheathing and improvements to the bridge itself. Work will include removing steel railings and installing concrete parapets (barriers), widening the deck edges and enhancing the drainage.The bridge, built in 1972, is approximately nine kilometres east of Dawson Creek. Highway 49 is the primary overload route from Alberta into the province, making the bridge a key piece of transportation infrastructure for commercial and industrial traffic.In addition to repairs and improvements, the ministry will complete scheduled maintenance to minimize traffic delays.While work is ongoing, traffic will be reduced to single-lane, alternating traffic 24/7, with periodic night closures. Drivers are reminded to check DriveBC.ca for the most up-to-date information before travel, and to obey construction zone speed limits and the direction of traffic control personnel. The project is anticipated to be complete by the end of 2020.The ministry is working closely with the contractor, DCL Construction Services Ltd., and WorkSafeBC to ensure health and safety are maintained for all workers on site.The B.C. provincial health officer has directed construction employers to take all necessary precautions to minimize the risks of COVID-19 transmission and illness to themselves and their employees.

These improvements will make the daily commute to work or school faster and safer for the 120,000 people travelling to and from the North Shore daily, especially during peak times.“The day-to-day life of North Shore residents, as well as the growth and prosperity of businesses, depends on more adequate transportation infrastructure,” said Jonathan Wilkinson, federal Minister of the Environment and Climate Change, and MP for North Vancouver, on behalf of Marc Garneau, federal Minister of Transport. “The completion of the first step of the Lower Lynn improvement project is an important milestone in our ongoing work to reduce transportation delays and enhance safety in our community.”The original Highway 1 - Lower Lynn Interchanges were designed and built more than 50 years ago. Their capacity and function are outdated. The Lower Lynn Improvement Project is providing important upgrades for many roadway components.“Traffic on the North Shore leaves thousands of commuters frustrated daily,” said Bowinn Ma, MLA for North Vancouver-Lonsdale, on behalf of Claire Trevena, B.C.’s Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “Drivers will experience improved traffic flow and better connections with the completion of this phase of the Lower Lynn Improvement project, which will be a welcome relief for those who drive.”Once the full Lower Lynn Improvement Project is complete, Highway 1 travel during peak times is expected to be reduced by at least nine minutes in the eastbound direction and four minutes in the westbound direction between the top of the cut to mid-span Ironworkers Memorial Bridge. The new roadwork will create safer merge lanes and reduce the risk of crashes in the area by one-third.“We recognize that commuters on the North Shore are frustrated with congestion that significantly increases travel times. With Phase 1 of the project now complete, we’re pleased to share that those travelling throughout the North Shore will experience improved connections and traffic flow,” said Mike Little, mayor, District of North Vancouver. “These enhancements and upgrades will reduce commute times, while also improving safety for all travellers, including vehicle drivers, pedestrians and cyclists.”The project will also improve safety for cyclists and pedestrians. New bike paths, sidewalks, trails and multi-use pathways are being built. This supports the B.C. government’s commitment to ensuring that new bridges and interchanges are designed to make walking, cycling and transit safe and convenient for everyone, as outlined in Move.

We continue to step up the capacity, in each health region and in our labs, to match our public health activities.“Testing allows us to trace and contain the spread. The tests tell us who is positive for the virus, as well as how far the virus may have spread among close contacts when an outbreak or community cluster occurs.“We know as the number of new cases increases, demand for testing also goes up. That is why each health region has been working to add further assessment and testing capacity. New assessmemt and testing centres and extended hours of service have been added in the Vancouver Coastal Health and Fraser Health regions to address increases in demand. Today, we have the ability to complete approximately 6,000 tests every day.“Right now, anyone with symptoms can be tested, but it is important to remember the test is recommended only if you have symptoms.“If you do develop symptoms, no matter how mild, your first step is to distance yourself from others and contact 811 or your health-care provider to arrange for an assessment.“If public health has advised you to self-isolate because you have been exposed to COVID-19, please follow their advice. Even if you have no symptoms, a negative test does not mean you can shorten the period of self-isolation.“While those who are younger are less likely to face severe illness, it is easy to inadvertently pass the virus on to someone who may be only a few years older, but much more vulnerable.“As a result, the best thing we can do is to protect ourselves and those we care about most by assessing the risks before we spend time with others and always using our layers of protection.“COVID-19 has meant doing things we have never done before.

In 2019-20, BC Cancer – Vancouver conducted 1,151 scans on people who travelled from the Interior Health Authority area. Once fully operational, the new PET/CT scanner is expected to provide more than 2,000 scans per year.“PET/CT imaging is a very sensitive and specific scanning method to detect cancer. More and more, PET scanning is quickly becoming an important and critical tool to diagnose, stage and assess treatment response for a number of different cancers,” said Dr. Kim Chi, vice-president and chief medical officer, BC Cancer. “This enables us, as oncologists, to best design and personalize a treatment plan for our patients. Thus, timely access to PET scanning is required to enable high-quality cancer care.”A PET/CT scanner is a critical component of enhanced cancer care. It delivers precise images of abnormal or cancerous cells. These images can help physicians diagnose cancer at an early stage or evaluate the effectiveness of treatments by determining if a patient’s cancer tumours have shrunk, spread or returned.The total project cost is $10.5 million, with more than $5.3 million provided by the BC Cancer Foundation with support from over 2,100 donors, and approximately $5.2 million provided by the Ministry of Health through the Provincial Health Services Authority.Quotes:Sarah Roth, chief executive officer, BC Cancer Foundation– “Today marks a significant milestone for families facing cancer in B.C.’s Interior communities. Thanks to our generous BC Cancer Foundation donors and investment from our government, BC Cancer has brought world-class diagnostics closer to home.”Benoit Morin, president and chief executive officer, Provincial Health Services Authority – “Provincial Health Services Authority is committed to providing British Columbians with the best in health care, no matter where they are in the province. The opening of this new PET/CT scanner in Kelowna will make a profound difference for cancer patients and their families. I’d like to thank the dedicated staff at BC Cancer, along with the provincial government and the BC Cancer Foundation donors, for making this a reality.”Susan Brown, president and chief executive officer, Interior Health – “The new PET/CT scanner in Kelowna will be a game changer for patients in our region. It will support better care and shorter waits for people right here in the Interior by providing faster diagnostics, closer to home.”Jeremy King, cancer survivor – “Having to travel for my PET/CT scan meant that I had to deal with the logistical challenges of organizing child care and transportation, which for me meant driving the Coquihalla Highway, which can be dangerous especially in the winter. I’m grateful for my friends and family who provided a lot of support at that time. I’m thankful now that people who need a PET/CT scan won’t have to deal with these added worries and can focus on their health.”Quick Fact:  A PET/CT scan evaluates a body’s organs and tissues at a molecular level and can identify abnormalities in cells.

We want to focus on continuing to create a good quality of life for citizens in the Fraser Valley, and we are asking what solutions will contribute to this in a positive way.”Nearly 60% of B.C.’s population lives in Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley – nearly three million British Columbians. Decisions on transportation and development in this region have consequences for every part of the province in terms of economic recovery, trade network resilience and housing opportunities. The purpose of the study is to look for opportunities to help reduce future traffic congestion, such as worker mobility, shorter commutes and managing traffic demand.Improvements to transportation infrastructure are a critical piece of economic recovery – ensuring people have more opportunities for well-paying jobs, shorter commutes and more time to spend with their families.The ministry also continues to support local, regional and inter-regional transit, and will continue to work with TransLink on its Transport 2050 plan, as well as BC Transit, local governments and their communities to investigate ways to more efficiently move people within and through the region. Quotes:Bob D’Eith, MLA for Maple Ridge-Mission - “When we build new infrastructure, we want to build intelligently and with people at the forefront of these decisions. I am excited about this work and how it will help to promote liveable communities for British Columbians. We are focused on building strong transportation networks that will serve our communities, whether people are driving their vehicles, taking the bus or riding their bikes.”Henry Braun, mayor, City of Abbotsford -“One of the most significant challenges facing the City of Abbotsford and for the Fraser Valley region continues to be transportation. We know that effective and efficient transportation systems generate employment and economic development, as well as job creation for local communities. This study will provide useful information as the growth of our economy relies on a safe, reliable and efficient multi-modal transportation network; especially as communities look to expand markets for our key local sectors, such as manufactured goods, agri-foods and aerospace.”Learn More:More information about the Fraser Valley Transportation Study is available here: www.gov.bc.ca/transportation/fraservalleystudy    "

The effort is small, but the benefits are immense.“We need to continue to protect those who are most vulnerable – our seniors and Elders, and those with underlying health conditions – by thinking about who we are being exposed to, and who we may be exposing, when spending time with others.“Seeing friends may seem safe, but if you are in close contact with an elderly family member, your visit may inadvertently put them at risk.“Let’s use our layers of protection, giving ourselves and those around us the space to stay safe no matter what we are doing or where we may be. This is how we protect our communities and stay strong.”Quick Facts: Assisted living, long-term care homes and seniors’ rental buildings with ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks are as follows: Vancouver Coastal Health: Arbutus Care Centre long-term care facility Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility Richmond Lions Manor long-term care facility  Fraser Health Czorny Alzheimer Centre long-term care facility Dania Home long-term care facility Derby Manor long-term care facility George Derby Centre long-term care facility Maple Ridge Seniors Village assisted living facility New Vista Care Home long-term care facility   Learn More:For mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca Or: www.anxietycanada.comFor a listing of the community exposure events, go to: BCCDC (flights, work sites, etc.): http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/public-exposures Fraser Health: fraserhealth.ca/covid19exposure Interior Health: https://news.interiorhealth.ca/news/public-exposures/ Island Health: https://www.islandhealth.ca/learn-about-health/covid-19/outbreaks-and-exposures Northern Health: https://www.northernhealth.ca/health-topics/outbreaks-and-exposures Vancouver Coastal: http://www.vch.ca/covid-19/public-exposuresFor B.C.’s surgical renewal plan and the first report on its progress from July 21, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020HLTH0228-001337For more information about BC’s Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/restartbcFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/ Or follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19 Or call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit: Facebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews  YouTube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBC    "

We’re committed to getting our province back on track and will be announcing enforcement action against those who continue to put others at risk.”The state of emergency is extended through the end of the day on Sept. 1, 2020, to allow government to continue to take the necessary actions to keep British Columbians safe and manage immediate concerns, such as recent outbreaks in some areas of the province.“We put these orders in place for a reason, and they are not optional,” Farnworth said. “Public health orders must be followed to ensure public safety, and I will be bringing in new measures later this week to address the actions of those who demonstrate their indifference to the health and safety of others.”   Actions taken in the previous two weeks to support British Columbians include: appointing Sandra Banister, QC, to conduct a review of layoff and recall rights of unionized workers in B.C.’s hotel sector as a result of COVID-19; working with the federal government to ensure that BC Ferries is eligible for the transit funding envelope of the Safe Restart Agreement; ensuring schools are ready to welcome students into classrooms by putting an orientation week in place to allow extra time to orient students and staff on the new health and safety measures in place; updated operational guidelines on wearing masks in schools to help ensure a consistent provincewide approach to keep schools safe for all students, teachers and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic; announcing plans to hire approximately 500 additional health professionals to increase contact tracing around B.C., announcing more people in B.C. will have access to life-saving overdose prevention, treatment and supports, part of $10.5 million to accelerate the response to an increasingly toxic illicit drug supply due to COVID-19; giving renters until July 2021 to pay arrears per a new repayment framework for renters with outstanding rent from April to August 2020, posted to Residential Tenancy Branch website; and extending emergency support for vulnerable people during COVID-19 through the temporary COVID-19 Crisis Supplement. The supplement will be extended for four months and will continue to be provided to low-income seniors receiving the B.C. Senior’s Supplement and income assistance and disability recipients residing in special care facilities. On July 10, the COVID-19 Related Measures Act came into force. The legislation enables provisions created for citizens and businesses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to continue as needed, should the provincial state of emergency end.The extension of the provincial state of emergency is based on recommendations from B.C.'s health and emergency management officials. Farnworth made the original declaration on March 18, 2020, the day after Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, declared a public health emergency.Quick Facts: Declarations of provincial states of emergency may be issued by the minister responsible under the Emergency Program Act. The provincial government can extend the period of a declaration made by the minister responsible for further periods of up to 14 days at a time.

261,2020-08-18 08:00:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/factsheets/improvements-to-workers-compensation-act-long-overdue,Government Website,Improvements to Workers Compensation Act long overdue,"  This summer, our government has taken action to provide the most significant improvements to the Workers Compensation Act (WCA) in more than two decades. The current pandemic has highlighted the need for modernization, for stronger occupational health and safety protections and a more balanced workers’ compensation system. The bill we passed this summer drew on several expert reports that had feedback from employers, workers, as well as experts in workers’ compensation systems.Imagine for a moment you are worker who has been exposed to traumatic events on the job and you develop a post-traumatic stress disorder but are told that your WorkSafeBC claim has been denied because more than one year has passed since the onset of PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) symptoms. The changes we’ve made to the WCA will recognize the complexity of mental health claims and make the system fairer for workers with the courage to come forward with their injuries that aren’t always visible to others.Imagine you are a family member seeking a sense of closure after losing a loved one to a workplace fatality. This bill strengthens the ability of WorkSafeBC to investigate workplace safety infractions by including powers of search and seizure of evidence through the WCA. It also permits the court to accept victim impact statements, giving a voice to injured workers and family members during the sentencing portion of a workplace safety prosecution.Or, imagine you are a nurse, a grocery clerk or a police officer working with the public every day and you contract COVID-19 at work. You would want – and deserve – some assurance that you would be able to quickly access workers’ compensation benefits when you need them. These changes will allow those who contract COVID-19 at work to quickly access benefits.These are examples of the measured, thoughtful improvements we’ve made that strike a balance between improving protections for workers and showing sensitivity to the challenges faced by businesses as we seek to recover from the sweeping effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.I understand the financial pressures employers are facing right now. That’s why we chose modest improvements to better support injured workers and their families, and enhance WorkSafeBC’s ability to investigate workplace incidents, while keeping premiums low.For too many years, all MLAs of all political stripes have heard from injured workers and their families that the system lacks fairness and doesn’t focus on the needs of injured workers. For most of the last two decades in B.C., government policy focused on the rights of employers, at the expense of the workers who are the foundation of our economy. I was disappointed to hear employers and opposition MLAs speak against these modest changes that will improve fairness for injured workers.I believe it’s important for a responsible government to strike a balance between the rights of workers and the needs of employers while always protecting the health and safety of workers. I am committed to making workplaces in B.C. the safest in the country and with these changes, we are taking important steps to do just that.    "

In the first reporting period from Aug. 14 to 15, we had 100 new cases; Aug. 15 to 16, we had 88 new cases, and in the last 24 hours, we have had a further 48 new cases.“This represents 236 new cases, including 10 epi-linked case since we reported on Friday, for a total of 4,594 cases in British Columbia.""There are 743 active cases of COVID-19 in the province, and 3,653 people who tested positive have recovered.""Currently, four individuals are hospitalized with COVID-19, three of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation. As well, 2,286 people are under active public health monitoring as a result of identified exposure to known cases.""Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 1,419 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 2,425 in the Fraser Health region, 154 in the Island Health region, 405 in the Interior Health region, 117 in the Northern Health region and 74 cases of people who reside outside of Canada.""There have been two new COVID-19 related deaths in the Fraser Health region, for a total of 198 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.""There have been two new health-care facility outbreaks at Czorny Alzheimer Centre in the Fraser Health region and at the Arbutus Care Centre in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. The outbreak at the Joseph and Rosalie Segal Family Health Centre has been declared over. In total, nine long-term care or assisted-living facilities and one acute-care facility have active outbreaks.""There are no new community outbreaks. However, Northern Health has issued a community exposure alert for anyone who may have attended the ""It is Time Canada"" event in Deadwood, Alta., from July 30 to Aug. 2. Individuals who attended must self-monitor for symptoms of COVID-19, and self-isolate and seek testing if they begin to exhibit symptoms.""Alerts are posted on the BC Centre for Disease Control's (BCCDC) website, as well as on health authorities' websites, providing details on where the potential exposure occurred and what actions to take – whether you need to immediately self-isolate or monitor for symptoms.“We know that COVID-19 is a virus that has the ability to spread with very mild symptoms. This is particularly the case for young adults.“We also know that the virus can cause severe illness, no matter your age.“Many people may not even realize they have COVID-19 and inadvertently spread it to others; to friends, colleagues, family members or vulnerable people in the community.“If you are informed by public health teams that you are a close contact, it is essential you stay home for the full 14-day self-isolation period.“Additionally, with the number of people in B.C. with COVID-19 today, we are at a time that we all need to be particularly alert to how we are feeling. You may feel well enough to see friends or go into work. However, if you are feeling ever so slightly unwell, stay home from work and gatherings.“Our COVID-19 champions are the people who choose to stay home and stay away from others when feeling even the slightest bit sick. Making the choice to stay home is choosing to keep yourself and those around you safe.“Let’s make sure the gift we give the people we care about and the souvenir we bring back from our summer holidays is not COVID-19.

The guidelines also cover the key components of delivering K-12 education during the pandemic, including curriculum, report cards, supports for students with disabilities/diverse abilities, and finance and operations. Even when wearing a mask, staff and students will still be required to maintain physical distance from people outside of their learning group. Efforts will be put in place to ensure there is not crowding, gathering or congregating of people from different learning groups in a school setting, even if non-medical masks are being worn. Schools will also ensure non-medical masks are available for staff if someone should become ill while at school.In order to support staff and students to meet this expectation, the ministry is providing additional funding to school districts that will support the purchase of up to 1.5 million masks, enough for every public-school staff member and student to have at least two masks.Canadian Shield, a manufacturer of personal protective equipment products in Ontario, Canada, recently announced it is donating an additional 54,500 face shields for K-12 schools in B.C., adding to the inventory of personal protective equipment that will be available for students and staff.Other health and safety guidelines include: increased cleaning of high-contact surfaces like doorknobs, keyboards, desks and chairs; increased hand hygiene with all students, staff and visitors being required to clean their hands before boarding school buses and entering school buildings, before and after eating, using the washroom and using playground equipment; and school districts may also install transparent barriers for people who have more contact with others, such as front-desk staff, bus drivers or food services staff, where appropriate. Another key health and safety measure is the establishment of learning groups. A learning group includes students and staff who remain together throughout the school quarter, semester or year, which could be made up of a single class of students or multiple classes of students. Learning groups will sometimes join for activities like physical education or music, or they may be secondary students taking the same courses. More information on learning groups, including examples can be found online: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/education-training/k-12/covid-19-return-to-schoolThe Province is providing an additional $45.6 million to school districts for enhanced cleaning, handwashing stations, reusable masks and other safety measures.The following expectations are also part of the guidelines for school boards and independent authorities as they finalize their back-to-school plans:Mental health Regular monitoring and assessment will review how changes to the delivery of education impact mental and emotional well-being of students and staff.    Child care School districts are to work with on-site before- and after-school child care providers to support learning groups staying together where possible. Inclusive education Students who require more support in school must have full-time, in-class instruction available without any delays.  Students who need to stay at home because they are immunocompromised should have an at-home learning plan and be provided with an educational program by their school district. Education assistants should continue to support students and teachers, including if classes move to remote learning or online. Children and youth in care should have priority access to technology, child care, in-class instruction and additional supports. Blended learning In some schools, it may not be possible to have people stay in their learning group or physically distance on a full-time basis. For these schools, districts are looking at a variety of options to maximize in-class learning for their students and, in some cases, they may need to offer a hybrid approach for their students with a blend of remote, online and self-directed learning. In these situations, schools should prioritize learning that can be effectively done remotely such as key literacy, numeracy and core competencies. Vulnerable students and those who require additional support in school should be prioritized for full-time, in-class learning. Assessments Ensure activities, assignments and assessments are accessible to all students and families, as appropriate for any in-class, remote or blended (hybrid) learning. School districts must meet the requirements of British Columbia’s Student Reporting Policy, which allows significant flexibility for schools and school districts regarding the content and format of report cards. Grad program In situations where in-class instruction is being supplemented with self-directed or remote learning, the focus should remain on ensuring students are making progress toward completing the graduation requirements. This may include further consideration of the flexible options available to students to satisfy graduation requirements, so students who are unable to participate fully in self-directed or remote learning are not disadvantaged. Indigenous students and families Boards must ensure Indigenous rightsholders are engaged in meaningful consultation and school boards will need to work directly with First Nations to develop plans for any Indigenous students living on-reserve and attending public school. Boards must also work with Métis Nation for plans for Métis students attending public/independent schools. Boards are to identify Indigenous students whose educational outcomes may have been negatively impacted during in-class suspension, with support planned and prioritized. Food and meal plans for students in need Services and supports to continue – including if in-class learning is suspended because of an increased risk of transmission or outbreak. These guidelines were created in collaboration with all education partners, including teachers, parents, support staff, school leaders, trustees and Indigenous rightsholders.School districts will communicate further details throughout the summer regarding schedules, learning groups and plans to parents, students and school staff, and will be posted online by the district by Aug. 26, 2020.Learn More:For more info on back-to-school plans, learning groups and health and safety guidelines visit: http://gov.bc.ca/covid19returntoschool    "

Arts and cultural organizations, including Indigenous groups, will be eligible for up to $75,000 to improve arts and culture spaces or $40,000 to buy special equipment to support art programming.  “Arts and culture groups operate vital spaces in our communities and they need support to upgrade their facilities,” said Susan Jackson, chair, BC Arts Council. “I am delighted that arts and cultural groups from around the province, including those from equity-seeking, regional and Indigenous communities, will have the opportunity to enhance their existing spaces – whether that’s building new spaces for sharing traditional knowledge, expanding exhibition areas or acquiring equipment to share work digitally.”This investment in the new program will help the arts and culture sector enhance existing spaces. It will also support economic activity and social vitality in communities throughout British Columbia. The Arts Infrastructure Program is part of the BC Arts Council’s record-level funding.  Applications will be open from Monday, Aug. 17 to Oct. 19, 2020.Quotes:Bob D’Eith, MLA for Maple Ridge-Mission –“One thing I heard in my conversations with the creative sector this spring was how important arts and culture spaces are to the health and vitality of communities.

In addition to making it easier for firefighters to defend the community against future wildfires, these projects will improve the long-term health and resiliency of forests and enhance habitat for mule deer and other wildlife. Other important factors, such as recreational use, riparian areas and cultural values, were considered when planning these projects.Wildfire risk reduction activities on Fox Mountain will take place in the forested area behind homes on Pheasant Drive and Gannet Road. In South Lakeside, work will take place east of Kinglet Road and Fetters Drive and south of Bluff View Drive.During this project the Billy Goat, Russet Bluff and Southsyde trails will be closed on days when contractors are working nearby. Signage and road blocks will be placed on the trails during these times. The project areas will not encroach on private land. Signage and road blocks will be placed on the trails during these times.About 1,200 hectares of land in and around Williams Lake are slated for treatment over the next two years. Work will take place in areas where urban development and forests meets, with priority given to areas close to residences or critical infrastructure, or where steep slopes, weather patterns or fuel hazards could impact fire behaviour.Many of these locations were identified as treatment priorities in the Williams Lake and Area Community Wildfire Protection Plan, which was developed by multiple agencies, communities and First Nations. Preliminary field work and planning for these projects began in 2019.Treatments will begin in additional areas of the community throughout 2020 and 2021.    "

The BCICEI also targets energy efficiency projects and energy storage. Among its target communities, it specifically seeks to assist remote communities wherever possible in reducing dependency on fossil fuels.Funding to communities through the BCICEI will be used for feasibility and site selection, environmental review and permitting, and project design and engineering. This allows First Nations’ clean energy and energy efficiency projects to proceed to the next step of implementation and construction when additional funding is secured.In total, 13 communities throughout the province are receiving almost $2.8 million from the BCICEI.Through programs like the BCICEI and Remote Community Clean Energy Strategy, the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources is supporting communities to develop expertise and experience in energy efficiency and clean energy generation.CleanBC is a pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. CleanBC was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s emission targets.Quotes:Scott Fraser, B.C.'s Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation –“Many Indigenous communities throughout B.C. are leading the way in developing clean energy alternatives, especially when it comes to reducing reliance on diesel generators in remote areas. Together, we are working toward a low-carbon future for all of British Columbia. Funding through the BCICEI and other programs like the First Nations Clean Energy Business Fund will help us reach that goal, while supporting First Nations to continue building strong, healthy and resilient communities.”Walter Schneider, chief executive officer, New Relationship Trust (NRT) –“The NRT is proud to have a role in an important initiative for First Nations in B.C. In the era of reconciliation, it is a collaborative effort to achieve economic growth and advance First Nations clean energy needs while contributing toward the energy transition that will have positive legacy impacts for generations to come. The unique Indigenous-led BCICEI model will hopefully inspire further partnerships between governments, industry and First Nations.”Mélanie Joly, federal Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages, and Minister responsible for Western Economic Diversification Canada –“The British Columbia Indigenous Clean Energy Initiative is an incredible project that will help advance reconciliation, fight the climate crisis and create jobs and opportunities for Indigenous peoples. Green technologies are vital to the future of our communities, our economy and our planet, and I’m excited to see the difference this initiative will make for First Nations across B.C.”Marc Miller, federal Minister of Indigenous Services –“The Government of Canada is supporting Indigenous-led clean energy projects through the BC Indigenous Clean Energy Initiative. Not only do these projects contribute to creating economic opportunities in First Nations communities, but they are helping to fight climate change and move Canada towards a cleaner and greener future.”Quick Facts: The BCICEI has invested more than $3.5 million to fund 31 projects, including 10 in remote, off-grid or diesel-dependent communities. These investments have leveraged more than $37.2 million — including $11.7 million in Indigenous equity — to finance hydro, solar, geothermal, bioenergy and innovative demand side management projects throughout British Columbia. Launched in 2016 and renewed in 2019, the BCICEI is a partnership between Western Economic Diversification Canada, the Province of British Columbia and the New Relationship Trust. Through Indigenous Services Canada’s Strategic Partnership Initiative, the Government of Canada has invested $4.5 million in renewed funding over three years towards the BCICEI, in addition to the original $4.2 million investment.

I want to congratulate the Darby family on their award and for being such an important part of B.C. agriculture.”In 1916, the farm was purchased by Sidney J. Darby and his brother, Melville B. Darby. Sidney was married to Elizabeth Darby, who came to the Alberni Valley as a young girl and was an Alberni Valley pioneer. Sidney passed away in 1960, and the farm title passed on to his two sons, Jim and Ted Darby. Elizabeth continued to live on the farm until her death in 1981.In 1976, Ted was killed in a farm accident, but Jim continued to farm with his wife, Phyllis. They raised their children on the family farm. In 2013, their daughter Heather moved back to the farm with her children. Jim passed away in 2016 and Phyllis in 2017. Heather and her sister Doreen now manage the family farm together.Four generations of the Darby Family have lived and worked on the farm. Over the decades, Darby Farm has produced dairy, produce, hay, beef and eggs. Today, the farm produces hay, eggs, beef and garlic.“My children and I have the honour and privilege of living on our century-old farm because of the love, labour and sacrifice put forth by my grandparents, uncle and parents,” Heather said. “One hundred years of family and farm history made possible because they were able to live and work together, combining skills and resources to ensure that the farm remained productive and available to future generations. My sister and I are very grateful and proud to accept this award in honour of them.”Century Farm Awards honour agricultural organizations that have been active for a century or longer, as well as pioneers whose farms and ranches have been in families for 100 years or more. Each Century Farm Award celebrates the rich heritage of farming and ranching families and organizations in B.C.Learn More:For more information about B.C.’s Century Farm program, visit: http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/agriculture-seafood/programs/century-farm-awards    "

We remain focused on making life better for everyone in British Columbia. Since the pandemic hit, that has meant an emphasis on keeping people safe and protecting their livelihoods.”B.C.'s legislature led the country in demonstrating how to have a safe and productive session, passing 20 pieces of legislation while maintaining social distancing. These included important measures to respond to the pandemic, provide services and supports for people, and make life more affordable.This summer, legislation was passed to overhaul ICBC with an enhanced care model that will save drivers 20% — an average of $400 per year — by eliminating legal costs from the system, while giving better benefits to those injured in car accidents. The landmark reforms will give British Columbians peace of mind that if they are injured in a crash, they will be looked after instead of being fought for years in court.“Before COVID-19, our government was making real progress to make life more affordable for people,” Premier Horgan said. “But we know there’s much more to do. With so many British Columbians worried about their livelihoods, it’s more important than ever that we continue to bring down the cost of everyday expenses — like insurance bills.”For the first time in 20 years, the Province brought forward legislative changes to the Workers Compensation Act. The changes will provide better support to injured workers and their families and enhance WorkSafeBC’s ability to investigate workplace incidents, while keeping premiums low.To ensure more effective permitting, as well as better protection of workers, the environment and the public, the legislature also updated the Mines Act. The update strengthens government’s ability to hold mines accountable without sacrificing a strong investment climate.“The pandemic has reinforced that health and safety for workers must remain a top priority as we build our economic recovery,” Premier Horgan said. “Throughout this crisis, workers in grocery stores and daycares, on trucks and farms, put themselves at risk to provide us essential services. They reminded us that when we talk about the economy, we are talking about people — people who are owed the best possible protection at work.”As part of the CleanBC plan, the Province put in place new rules for 100% electric-vehicle sales by 2040 to reduce air pollution and fight climate change. CleanBC is a pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. CleanBC was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s emission targets.Outside of the legislature, the Province continued to invest in building critical infrastructure and improving the services British Columbians rely on. To help parents and families, the Province has announced hundreds of new child care spaces are coming to communities throughout British Columbia. A new urgent and primary care center opened in Maple Ridge this summer and another has been announced for Esquimalt. People living in Surrey and surrounding communities will soon have improved access to care with the addition of a regional cancer centre at the second Surrey hospital. An expanded plan for an emergency department and intensive care unit at Richmond Hospital will bring more services and better care for people.“Our recovery must mean more than returning to what we had before the pandemic struck,” Premier Horgan said. “I know we can build a B.C that’s even better than before — one with strong public services, good-paying clean jobs and where we work in partnership with Indigenous peoples. I’m pleased that the last few weeks have begun to lay the groundwork for a recovery that works for everyone.”    "

This includes two cases that are epidemiologically linked.“There are 629 active cases of COVID-19 in the province and 3,533 people who tested positive have recovered.“Currently, 12 individuals are hospitalized with COVID-19, four of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation. As well, 2,026 people are under active public health monitoring as a result of identified exposure to known cases.“Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 1,354 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 2,276 in the Fraser Health region, 150 in the Island Health region, 399 in the Interior Health region, 107 in the Northern Health region and 72 cases of people who reside outside of Canada.“There have been no new COVID-19 related deaths, for a total of 196 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There has been one new health-care facility outbreak in the Fraser Health region at Queen’s Park Care Centre. In total, seven long-term care or assisted-living facilities and two acute-care facilities have active outbreaks.“There are no new community outbreaks. However, there continue to be community exposure events around the province and on flights into and out of British Columbia.“Alerts are posted on the BC Centre for Disease Control’s (BCCDC) website, as well as on health authorities’ websites, providing details on where the potential exposure occurred and what actions to take – whether you need to immediately self-isolate, or monitor for symptoms.“This weekend, we urge everyone to stay strong and hold the line.“We have it within our ability to make the changes we need to bend our pandemic curve back down and continue in our B.C. restart, but it takes the combined efforts of everyone, not just a few.“Keeping a safe distance from people you don’t know or who are not in your close group of family and friends is an important way to protect yourself from COVID-19 transmission. And always stay home and stay away from others if you have symptoms of COVID-19, however mild.“Throughout the pandemic, regional health authorities have worked with municipalities, WorkSafe BC, and law enforcement to support and educate British Columbians about COVID-19 safety – in some cases establishing joint teams to visit shops, businesses, beaches and other public spaces to ensure we all follow public health guidance and direction.“In the Vancouver Coastal Health region, ongoing surveillance and enforcement operations have resulted in the closure of several bars, restaurants and nightclubs following transmission events: some by public health order and others voluntarily.”“This weekend, let’s all do our part to bend the curve back down and use our influence to bring our family and friends on board if they have strayed.“Remember that each new interaction outside your bubble holds a risk that you then bring back to your family and friends. In these circumstances, we must stand together, by staying apart.”Quick Facts: Assisted living, long-term care homes and seniors' rental buildings with ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks are as follows: Vancouver Coastal Health: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility Richmond Lions Manor long-term care facility  Fraser Health Dania Home long-term care facility Maple Ridge Seniors Village assisted-living facility Derby Manor long-term care facility George Derby Centre long-term care facility New Vista Care Home long-term care facility   Learn More:For the latest modelling information, presented on Aug. 13, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/modelling-projectionsFor mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca Or: www.anxietycanada.comIf you have plans this weekend, follow Dr. Bonnie Henry’s Good Times Guide: https://goodtimes.gov.bc.ca/For a listing of the community exposure events, go to:BCCDC (flights, work sites, etc.): http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/public-exposures Fraser Health: fraserhealth.ca/covid19exposure Interior Health: https://news.interiorhealth.ca/news/public-exposures/ Island Health: https://www.islandhealth.ca/learn-about-health/covid-19/outbreaks-and-exposures Northern Health:  https://www.northernhealth.ca/health-topics/outbreaks-and-exposures Vancouver Coastal: http://www.vch.ca/covid-19/public-exposuresFor B.C.’s surgical renewal plan and the first report on its progress from July 21, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020HLTH0228-001337For more information about BC’s Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/restartbcFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/ Or follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19 Or call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit: Facebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews  YouTube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBC    "

ALS is a fatal neurodegenerative disease where patients typically become unable to move, speak, swallow and breathe as the condition progresses. In one clinical trial, edaravone has helped slow the worsening of this disease in a select ALS patient subpopulation.Edaravone has been under pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance (pCPA) negotiation since September 2019. The negotiations between the manufacturer, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, and the pCPA meet B.C.’s cost-related mandate.“The offer from Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation meets British Columbia’s criteria, which is great news for patients suffering from this deadly disease,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “B.C. will continue to support ALS patients through its expansion of coverage of life-changing drugs and research funding to improve the lives of British Columbians.”It is expected that between 66 to 183 patients will benefit from the coverage in the first year. The list price of edaravone is around $120,000 per patient, per year.To further support patients living with ALS throughout the province, the ALS Society of British Columbia has raised $1 million and the B.C. government has provided $1 million to match that effort.“The work of the ALS Society of BC helps provide care to patients, supports clinical trials and research,” Dix said. “This organization has done extraordinary things to enable patients to participate in their care, prolong survival, and improve well-being, and we are happy to support them in that great work.”The combined $2 million will be used over the next five years to develop an ALS centre of excellence in Vancouver that will not only serve patients in the Vancouver area, but also provincewide through mobile clinics.This investment will: advance patient care for ALS in British Columbia; further improve patient outcomes; and help attract dedicated physicians and neurologists that are critically needed over the coming years. Addressing the costs of prescription drugs is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Learn More: For more information on drug coverage in B.C., visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/health-drug-coverage/pharmacare-for-bc-residents/what-we-cover/drug-coverageA backgrounder follows.

With funding of over $380,000, BC Hot House is working to develop a feasible method to cultivate greenhouse strawberries commercially in B.C. for people to enjoy year-round. The company is working with experts from Europe who have had success in growing soft fruit in protected environments.Ecoation Innovative Solutions in North Vancouver is receiving $500,000 to develop and test an automated pesticide-free crop treatment system that will immediately address pests in greenhouse vegetables, using a crop monitoring robot the company invented. The technology involves use of biological control agents and UV-based disinfection. The location-based intelligence is gathered and provided to growers through a web application that was developed by Ecoation. The technology’s treatment system pilot in vegetable greenhouses will be the first time it is used in Canada.Vancouver-based Forest Foods Ltd. is supporting several Indigenous communities in B.C. that are engaged in the production of wild forest mushrooms and plant-based foods. The company is receiving nearly $15,000 to develop two facility design plans to help with packaging and processing. The first design is for a mobile facility that will focus on cleaning and packaging forest mushrooms and plant-based forest foods. The second is for a fixed facility that will incorporate processing capacities for the commercialization of a variety of products. Both designs will be presented to the Indigenous communities with the intent of developing the facilities to support the expansion of their business operations and deliver Indigenous-branded forest mushrooms and plant-based foods to market, both domestically and internationally.Projects under the Canada-British Columbia Agri-Innovation Program have received more than $7.3 million in funding from the Canadian Agricultural Partnership. The partnership is a five-year federal-provincial-territorial agreement that includes $2 billion in cost-shared strategic initiatives delivered by the provinces and territories, and $1 billion for federal programs and services through March 2023.Quotes:Marie-Claude Bibeau, federal Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food –“B.C. companies are really stepping up to the plate with innovative technologies and solutions to the various challenges faced by our agricultural sector. They are finding ways to grow more of the top quality food we love, more sustainably and more efficiently. With the close co-operation of my counterpart, Minister Popham, we will always get behind these forward-looking projects that will help achieve a bright future for the agriculture sector in British Columbia.”Lana Popham, B.C.'s Minister of Agriculture –“Bringing innovation into the agriculture industry is taking the sector to new levels and creating more opportunities in communities around the province. Technology can transform and improve the way farmers and processors do their daily work, while keeping their products the way consumers enjoy them. This is just one of the many ways B.C. companies are evolving to stay competitive.”Saber Miresmailli, founder and CEO, Ecoation Innovative Solutions –“The Canada-BC Agri-Innovation Program provides unique opportunities to Canadian agriculture companies to showcase Canadian-made solutions to the world and establish Canada/B.C. as a global leader and knowledge epicentre on all topics related to the future of food. This program allows companies like Ecoation to directly engage industry partners and demonstrate solutions that meet the need of the farming industry. Demonstrating technology under real-world conditions is critical for market adoption and scaling in domestic and international markets. The program de-risks new technology adoption and provides a unique opportunity for collaboration between farms and technology providers.”Learn More:For information about additional projects that have received funding, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/21433For more information about the Canada-BC Agri-Innovation Program, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/agriculture-seafood/programs/canada-bc-agri-innovationFor more information on how to apply to the Canada-BC Agri-Innovation Program, visit: www.iafbc.ca/funding-opportunities/innovation/For more information on the Canadian Agricultural Partnership, visit: www.agr.gc.ca/eng/about-us/key-departmental-initiatives/canadian-agricultural-partnership/?id=1461767369849A backgrounder follows.

We are engaged in important dialogue on matters of Wet’suwet’en rights and title that have remained unresolved since the Delgamuukw-Gisday-wa decision more than 20 years ago. This is complex and important work and it will take time. Doing this work in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic created additional challenges, but we are having important conversations that continue to move us forward.“At this point, we are still engaged in negotiations on the agreement initially targeted for completion in mid-August, and we continue to work in good faith in an agreed-upon accelerated process. We will take the time necessary to get this right and to do it in a good way.“Our aim is to reach a negotiators’ understanding by mid-October 2020 on an affirmation agreement for Wet’suwet’en rights and title that will also set the stage for further implementation negotiations. The draft agreement will then require approval and ratification by Wet’suwet’en clan members and the provincial and federal governments, which we will seek to conclude before the end of the year. During this time, internal engagement within Wet’suwet’en will continue, as will external community engagement with other interested parties on the negotiations and draft agreement.“The internal work toward reunification within Wet’suwet’en Nation is a very important element of the MOU and that work is ongoing. Wet’suwet’en Hereditary leadership remains committed to ongoing engagement with clan members and elected councils to further strengthen families, communities and build a strong and united Nation.“Today, we are also launching a jointly developed external community engagement process that will help ensure our success in implementing Wet’suwet’en rights and title. As a first step, today we will send out invitations to potential participants from local governments, industry, business and recreation groups to join a regional engagement group, and to suggest participants for a core advisory council. As our work progresses, we will also be consulting with neighbouring Nations.“We are pleased that the Lake Kathlyn School property transfer was completed last month to create a Wet’suwet’en seat of government for the entire Yintah.

It will also provide increased care and recovery benefits for people. It will increase from the current limit of $300,000 to a maximum of at least $7.5 million, providing the care people need for as long as they need it, should they be injured in a crash.This is what experts from the medical, brain injury, spinal cord injury, physiotherapy, mental health, occupational therapy and insurance industries are saying about Enhanced Care coverage, which starts in May 2021:Dr. Kathleen Ross, president, Doctors of B.C. –“We look forward to working with our patients under these changes, which are designed to provide a streamlined process, allowing patients easier access to expanded benefits and care, and helping them to recuperate faster after a motor vehicle crash. These changes make it so doctors can focus on their patient’s care and recovery, rather than on more administrative work.”Justina Loh, executive director, Disability Alliance B.C. –“Being at the table through the consultation work has given us the opportunity to provide feedback and help shape this new insurance model, which will deliver more recovery benefits and overall support for those who need it the most, people seriously injured in crashes.” Chuck Byrne, executive director and COO, Insurance Brokers Association of B.C. –“B.C.’s insurance brokers welcome the significant savings of about $400 on average that customers will see with Enhanced Care coverage, a much-needed reduction in auto-insurance premiums in the province. Those savings, coupled with the increased care benefits that people will receive, make Enhanced Care coverage a tremendous upgrade to auto insurance in B.C.”Jane Dyson, chair, Injury Recovery Design Panel (for Enhanced Care coverage) –“With significantly increased benefits and supports, Enhanced Care coverage means people who have been injured in motor vehicle accidents won’t have to worry that they’ll exhaust their benefits, as they do under the current system. It will also help ensure that the focus is on the needs of injured people. The panel I am leading is comprised of advocacy group leaders and a range of health care professionals. Together, we are advising ICBC on how best to ensure that Enhanced Care is accessible for people who have been catastrophically injured and their support networks, so they get all the coverage to which they are entitled.”Christine Bradstock, CEO of the Physiotherapy Association of B.C. –“Injuries sustained in a motor-vehicle crash can take time to work through – for some, a lifetime. To have Enhanced Care coverage, which provides physiotherapy for injured people, is good news for those who are injured, as their care will be available for as long as they need, helping them live their best quality of life possible.”Tanya Fawkes-Kirby, managing director, Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists B.C. – “Occupational therapists play an essential role in helping people recover after a motor-vehicle accident. We look forward to a new model of care that ensures critical rehabilitation supports are available and accessible throughout the recovery journey.”Benjamin Graham, president and CEO, Manitoba Public Insurance –“In Manitoba, we’ve demonstrated how this type of no-fault insurance model offers strong benefits at premiums drivers can afford. At a time when many drivers across Canada are seeing their insurance bills increase, we’re planning to reduce our already low rates by an average of more than 10%, our largest reduction in three decades.”Andrew Cartmell, president and CEO, Saskatchewan Government Insurance –“Saskatchewan drivers benefit from a well-managed Auto Fund that offers stable, affordable insurance rates and delivers comprehensive injury benefits to customers who need them.”Learn More:ICBC’s Enhanced Care coverage: http://icbc.com/2021Government’s intended changes at ICBC: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/download/000BAC79D98D4E14AAFCBBD582883BAD    "

That’s why our government asked our independent energy watchdog to do an investigation into gas prices,” said Bruce Ralston, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources. “The British Columbia Utilities Commission’s (BCUC) inquiry found a lack of competition and significant markups in the B.C. market, including a 13 cent per-litre premium being charged to drivers that industry was unable to explain. This results in British Columbians paying an extra $490 million per year.”The new regulations target the wholesale market. Companies that import, purchase, store and distribute gasoline and diesel products intended for sale at retail stations will need to make regular reports starting for the month of October to the BCUC. This includes detailed information on fuel imports, storage capacity, bulk sales and wholesale prices.“With the new rules we are bringing in today, oil and gas companies in the wholesale market will have to start making regular, mandatory reports to BCUC. We know that from the BCUC’s investigation into gas prices that four companies control around 90% of the wholesale market in southern B.C.,” Ralston said. “By pulling back the curtain, the action we are taking today will help ensure industry is held publicly accountable for unexplained markups and prices increases.”In March 2020, the BCUC was named as the independent administrator of the FPTA and given the power to collect and publish data on fuel pricing in order to promote competition in the market. The BCUC has launched a website to provide the public with information about the factors that influence fuel gas prices: https://www.gaspricesbc.ca/Further regulations are also being developed for the other parts of the fuel supply chain, including the retail market.Learn More:For more information on the FPTA, visit: https://www.gaspricesbc.ca/    "

Renters in arrears from rent due during the specified period of March 18 to Aug. 17 will have until at least July 2021 to pay back any rent they owe, with the first repayments not starting until October at the earliest.The rental framework will protect renters by ensuring they cannot be evicted for a missed or late rent payment from March 18 to Aug. 17, unless a renter defaults on their repayment plan.The terms of the repayment plan must include: amount of outstanding rent; start date of the repayment plan; amount of each instalment; and dates for each instalment. The repayment instalments must begin at least 30 days after the date the plan is given by the landlord to the renter. It also must give renters until July 2021 for the final repayments to be made, unless the landlord and renter agree to a longer period. Similarly, while it will be paid in equal instalments, renters and landlords have the option of agreeing to smaller amounts being paid each month in the beginning of the repayment process.Each monthly instalment must be paid on the same date the rent is due. For example, if a repayment plan is delivered to the renter on Aug. 29 and rent is due on the first of each month, the first instalment is due Oct. 1, 2020.To further support renters at this time, the Province is continuing to temporarily prohibit landlords from charging rent increases until December 2020. A renter who has been issued a notice of rent increase for an earlier date should not pay the increase and continue to pay their current amount until then. The Temporary Rental Supplement also remains available to people until Aug. 31, 2020. To date, the supplement has assisted more than 86,000 households with paying their rent during the pandemic.Renters who are still experiencing a loss of income may also be eligible for either the Rental Assistance Program (RAP) or the Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters (SAFER) programs, which provide ongoing rental subsidies for low- and moderate-income families and seniors.

This new road will redirect the current accesses to Highway 97 to the new intersection, providing area residents and businesses easier and safer access to the highway.“This new intersection along Highway 97 will increase driver safety for commuters and tourists, while also improving traffic flow for commercial vehicles along one of British Columbia’s key trade and commuter corridors,” said Catherine McKenna, federal Minister of Infrastructure and Communities. “Canada’s infrastructure plan invests in thousands of projects, creates jobs across the country and builds stronger communities.”The current intersection is a stop-sign controlled T-intersection. This contributes to congestion coming off Swanson Lumber Road and causes significant traffic delays, which will increase as traffic volumes rise. The project is estimated to be complete in fall 2021.“Highway 97 is a crucial corridor for our province’s natural resource industries, and this project provides an important safety improvement for the people who rely on it,” said Claire Trevena, B.C.’s Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “We’ve also heard from people that traffic is increasing, making it harder to move through the area. Projects such as this new intersection are investments in our communities, helping to create good jobs for people.”The $11.1-million project was funded through $6.4 million from the Province and $4.7 million from the Government of Canada.Highway 97 is the longest continuously numbered route in British Columbia, running 2,081 kilometres from the Canada-United States border (near Osoyoos) in the south to the British Columbia-Yukon border (north of Watson Lake) in the north.The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure is working closely with the contactor, IDL Project Inc. of Prince George, and WorkSafeBC to ensure health and safety are maintained for all workers on site.Provincial construction sites have protocols and policies in place following the requirements of the provincial health officer to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. These measures include physical distancing and other protocols to ensure worker and public safety.Once the project begins, drivers can expect delays of up to 20 minutes and occasional single-lane, alternating traffic. The ministry appreciates people’s patience during this project. Drivers are reminded to obey construction zone speed limits and the direction of traffic control personnel.Quotes:Lori Ackerman, mayor, City of Fort St. John –“The safety of our residents is paramount. Council looked at a transportation plan for the city that would ensure safe movement of our residents and businesses. We appreciate the investment being made at this intersection that will allow for safer entrance onto and egress off the highway.”Dave Earle, president and CEO, British Columbia Trucking Association (BCTA) –“The BCTA welcomes the intersection improvements announced under a joint federal-provincial funding agreement.

The redesigned process replaces paper-based applications, allows all documents to be sent by email and reduces the burden on employers and employees by providing the templates and tools needed to apply.In order to receive a variance, an employer must survey employees eligible for an extension to their temporary layoff and the business must ensure it has more than 50% support before applying.Employers are encouraged to apply as soon as possible. An application deadline is set for Aug. 25 for employees and employers to jointly apply for an extension, to ensure that all applications will be processed by the Aug. 30 expiry date.The temporary layoff variance process is intended to maintain ongoing relationships between businesses and their employees. This can ensure faster startups when a business is ready to resume operations.Under B.C.’s Employment Standards Act, temporary layoffs related to COVID-19 can last up to 24 weeks, or until Aug. 30, before the layoff becomes permanent.BC’s Restart Plan is supporting businesses to safely reopen and get people back to work.Learn More:View a demonstration of the process to apply for a temporary layoff variance presented to the British Columbia Chamber of Commerce by the Ministry of Labour: https://youtu.be/SrRv8XykBAMVisit the updated website for temporary layoff variance applications: www.gov.bc.ca/covidlayoffsFor information on employment standards around temporary layoffs, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/employment-standards-advice/employment-standards/hours/variances    "

It is located at the Hon Hsing Athletic Club, 27 East Pender St., and is open Friday until Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The exhibit will run through 2021.“People told us they wanted the Chinese Canadian Museum to showcase Chinese Canadian history, past and present, in the places where it happened,” said Lisa Beare, Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture. “This exhibit embodies that vision by telling the stories of the people who helped build British Columbia and offers a way for British Columbians to add their stories.”The temporary exhibit explores the history of Chinese immigration and communities through individual narratives and opportunities to promote story sharing. It features interactive story panels, videos and audio to provide snapshots from Chinese Canadians’ lives. Visitors can learn how Chinese migrants and their descendants have found ways to earn a living, challenge systemic racism, connect with others, survive and thrive through hope and resilience.“We’re excited to open this temporary exhibit and welcome everyone to visit it in Chinatown,” said Grace Wong, chair, Chinese Canadian Museum. “The exhibit offers a taste of how the Chinese Canadian Museum will share the historical contributions of Chinese Canadians and their continued role in the fabric of British Columbia and Canada. I’d like to thank all the partners for bringing this exhibit to life.”As part of the exhibition, visitors can add their personal story to the collection. People can share their experiences as Chinese Canadians, their interactions with Chinese Canadians in their community or their experiences as migrants living in a new place. Visitors can choose to share their stories on camera, through in-person interviews, in writing or by placing a marker on a map.These stories will become part of the Chinese Canadian Museum’s collection. As the exhibition travels throughout the province, it will continue to gather stories from each location throughout the province.A Seat at the Table is a project from the Chinese Canadian Museum Society of BC, in collaboration with the Museum of Vancouver and the University of British Columbia. The temporary exhibit is made possible through the B.C. government’s $1-million grant to the City of Vancouver to support further planning for the Chinese Canadian Museum.A memorandum of understanding was signed between the Province and the City of Vancouver to establish the museum and to pursue United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization World Heritage Site Designation for Vancouver Chinatown.In October 2020, the Museum of Vancouver will launch a larger related exhibit at its own location.Quotes:George Chow, Minister of State for Trade –“Now more than ever, we need to come together and share the stories of the Chinese Canadian community that helped shape this province. This is a great opportunity to learn more about the essential contributions of the Chinese Canadian community, past and present. I encourage everyone to come and visit this free interactive exhibition in Vancouver Chinatown.”Melanie Mark, MLA for Vancouver-Mount Pleasant –“Congratulations to the Chinese Canadian Museum Society for launching its first exhibit. This is such an exciting step and a great addition to Vancouver Chinatown. I look forward to taking my family to visit this important exhibit this summer.”Kennedy Stewart, mayor, City of Vancouver –“There is so much history and culture here in Vancouver. This is a great, affordable opportunity for people to learn more about the lives and experiences of the Chinese Canadians who shaped our city. I hope people come on down and check it out and enjoy Vancouver Chinatown.” Viviane Gosselin, curator, Museum of Vancouver –“The knowledge sharing that has taken place between individuals, community groups, academics and museum professionals for the production of A Seat at the Table project is exceptional and will resonate with diverse audiences who will be able to see themselves in the stories.”Quick Facts: To protect people’s health during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese Canadian Museum Society of BC has put in place the following safety measures at the exhibit: maximum attendance of 14 people at a time; hand sanitizer will be provided; staff will be required to wear masks and it will be recommended that patrons wear masks; and additional signage within the museum has been added to remind visitors to keep a two-metre distance from each other.

Especially in these challenging times, young people shouldn’t have to wait for care. There’s much more to do, and we’re going to keep building a full continuum of mental health and addictions care for everyone in B.C.”As a result of this investment, young people aged 12 to 24 and their families will benefit from 123 new beds for youth substance-use treatment and withdrawal-management beds, helping fill a long-standing gap in youth treatment services. The $36-million investment through 2022-23 will be focused on areas of greatest need. Locations are being determined in consultation with regional health authorities.“You can’t take an opportunity that you aren’t given,” said Brody Van Velze. “Since the age of 14, I have struggled with substance abuse. During my addiction my life was filled with broken relationships, no respect for others or myself, and poor decisions. I have been clean for over four years now, and I owe my thanks to the Last Door treatment centre. Because I was given the opportunity to have a placement, I have found a new path in my life that grants me happiness and healthy relationships with others and myself. I am thankful for the programs I was able to experience and learn from during my time there. I am thrilled to hear that there will be more funding going towards beds for our treatment centres, as more youth will now have the opportunity that I was given four years ago.”The first round of new beds is expected to be in place by the end of the fiscal year, with more to follow as health authorities find locations, plan clinical supports and complete implementation. The Province recently opened Traverse, a new 20-bed youth treatment centre in Chilliwack. There are now 124 withdrawal management and treatment and recovery beds for youth in the province.These new youth beds are part of the full continuum of care government is building for young people and will be connected to culturally safe, youth-specific services in the community. That includes new services to improve the youth substance-use system, such as the expansion of Foundry youth centres, investments in mental health promotion and prevention in schools, and establishing integrated child and youth teams in school districts.Expanding mental health and substance-use services for young people is an integral part of A Pathway to Hope, B.C.’s roadmap for making mental health and addictions care better for people in British Columbia, which was developed in partnership with First Nations and other Indigenous partners. Implementing A Pathway to Hope is a shared priority with the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Dr. Kathleen Ross, president, Doctors of B.C. –“Today’s announcement impacts a population that has been uniquely affected by both COVID-19 and substance-use issues: our province’s youth. Access to treatment beds is a very important part of a larger system of care for our youth. The near doubling of treatment beds will help youth who have taken many courageous steps to seek help and cannot afford to face long waitlists or closed doors. This is a positive step supporting the recovery of youth with substance-use issues, and it is a part of a larger effort. Doctors of BC continues to work with the B.C. government to inform and implement the Pathway to Hope roadmap for mental health and substance-use care in B.C.”Colin Tessier, executive director, Threshold Housing Society –“This investment in new youth-focused treatment beds will help to change the life trajectory of many at-risk youth in British Columbia. This is an area of desperate need in our province and will help to fill a gap in the continuum of care that will lead to better outcomes for young people, their families and our communities. When a young person is ready to pursue treatment options, it can be a fleeting and fragile window of time whereby quick action and immediate access to services makes all the difference. These new beds will help to reduce long waitlists for treatment and allow many more youth to quickly reduce harm and vulnerability while beginning to access healing in their lives.”J.D., current Threshold Society youth –“Having access to youth-specific treatment and early recovery support would have been super beneficial. I feel that it would have made it easier for me having that extra layer of support while being in safe housing. Also, having that assurance that a relapse doesn’t mean that I'm facing homelessness again, but instead would receive additional support also would have helped. I also think that having a safe space where I felt comfortable to learn new coping skills would've helped so much. I found it so hard to find programming and treatment options that I felt comfortable doing. It was a huge struggle for me.”Quick Facts: With this new investment, the Province has implemented 143 new youth beds since 2017, for a total of 247 youth beds throughout the province: 123 new youth beds 104 existing youth beds 20 youth beds in Chilliwack (the first youth beds in the Fraser Health region)  Learn More:A Pathway to Hope: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/british-columbians-our-governments/initiatives-plans-strategies/mental-health-and-addictions-strategy/bcmentalhealthroadmap_2019web-5.pdfNew 20-bed treatment centre in Chilliwack: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020MMHA0041-001473    "

It is two years into a three-and-a-half-year project funding the diversion of 170,000 cubic metres of fibre from distant cutblocks to manufacture into lumber and wood chips.“This FESBC project supports the use of fibre that would otherwise go to waste, while creating jobs for local communities, including Indigenous communities,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “It’s great to see this funding already making a difference by reducing wildfire risk and carbon emissions, while building up local economies.”The FESBC grant is funding 22 in-forest fibre-recovery jobs over the project. Meanwhile, the Seaton mill employs another 22 people, including approximately 15 from local Indigenous communities.About half the recovered fibre is manufactured into cants – large squared-off logs that can be processed into smaller lumber products – and exported to China. The rest is chipped, sold to Pinnacle Renewable Energy in Smithers and processed into pellets.“This funding improves our ability to have consistent access to wood and become part of the supply chain, as we use half the log for product and chip and ship the rest to be processed into pellets,” said Andy Thompson, manager, Seaton Forest Products. “While most larger mills require more wood and green wood, we are able to take the logs others cannot utilize and would have normally been either left in the bush and/or burnt.”Including the FESBC-funded fibre recovery, Seaton is able to secure a total of 80,000 cubic metres of wood waste a year. Using the wood waste means it won’t be burnt to release carbon or left on site where it can be a wildfire risk.“FESBC is excited to provide funding to enable operations like Seaton Forest Products to utilize fibre outside their current economic radius that would traditionally have been burned at the cutblock,” said Gord Pratt, operations manager, FESBC. “FESBC is pleased to assist the Province in meeting its goals of increasing fibre utilization and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by funding projects like this one with Seaton. Projects like this also often create much-needed local employment opportunities.”This project is funded in part by the Government of Canada.Quote:Kirsteen Laing, administrator, Seaton Forest Products –“There are very few employment opportunities in this area, so to provide up to 22 jobs is pretty significant. If we have a good wood supply, it supports one shift year-round. If the markets are down, then we can have some down time. It’s beneficial for us to use what we can and send the rest to the pellet plant. Here, we’re able to put more people to work and support the economy with an annual supply of 80,000 cubic metres.”Quick Facts: The Forest Enhancement Society of BC, a Crown agency, was established in 2016 to advance environmental and resource stewardship of the province’s forests by: preventing and mitigating the impact of wildfires; improving damaged or low-value forests; improving habitat for wildlife; supporting the use of fibre from damaged and low-value forests; and treating forests to improve the management of greenhouse gases.  The B.C. government has invested $235 million in the society, with about $233 million allocated as of Jan. 30, 2020, for wildfire risk reduction, reforestation, forest rehabilitation, wildlife habitat restoration and raising awareness of the FireSmart program.

The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 1,273 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 2,203 in the Fraser Health region, 150 in the Island Health region, 394 in the Interior Health region, 104 in the Northern Health region and 72 cases of people who reside outside of Canada.“There has been one new COVID-19 related death, for a total of 196 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks in the region. In total, seven long-term care or assisted-living facilities and one acute-care facility have active outbreaks.“There are no new community outbreaks. However, there continue to be community exposure events everywhere in the province and on flights into and out of British Columbia.“Alerts are posted on the BC Centre for Disease Control’s website, as well as on health authorities’ websites, providing details on where the potential exposure occurred and what actions to take – whether you need to immediately self-isolate or monitor for symptoms.“The pandemic is an unprecedented challenge for our province. And today we are reporting the third highest number of new cases we have seen in a day since the pandemic began. The majority of these cases are young people in the Lower Mainland and their exposures have been at events in the community. The cases we are seeing today reflect exposures from a week to 10 days ago. A significant number of cases are also linked to travel from out of province.“We need to refocus on measures to flatten the curve of infection and protect British Columbians as we help our province recover. One of the most effective ways to keep people safe is through contact tracing, which starts with each person who has tested positive for COVID-19 understanding who their contacts may be to provide appropriate follow up and stop further transmission.“To support the public health teams who are doing this important work, the Province is hiring approximately 500 new health professionals to bolster our contact tracing capacity across British Columbia.“We are watching the cases climb, which is concerning. We need everyone to recommit to using the skills we’ve learned. Keep gatherings small, have a designated ‘contact keeper,’ limit time with others, maintain physical distance and always stay home if you’re feeling unwell.“We must all keep working together to protect people’s health, homes and livelihoods, and to get our province back on track.

Health authorities’ public health teams typically have staff who do contact tracing of communicable diseases as part of their regular work. However, given the scale of the response needed for COVID-19, additional supports are necessary.“As we have seen in recent weeks, strong contact tracing is absolutely crucial when dealing with community outbreaks as we slowly and safely increase our contacts,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “Our health-care workers have gone beyond the call of duty during the pandemic, and we are putting out this call to these dedicated professionals to bolster our contact tracing capacity and prepare us for a potential surge of COVID-19 in the fall.”Some of these positions will also help to support public health services, such as providing education in communities, and possibly immunizing for influenza and other diseases. Reducing the number of people with the flu helps alleviate the burden on provincial laboratory testing infrastructure and protects acute-care capacity in B.C.’s hospitals as respiratory illness season approaches this fall.“When there is a community outbreak, time is of the essence,” said Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer. “These new contact tracers will work with existing public health teams to help track down all those who may have been exposed and support people to self-isolate when necessary. This role becomes even more crucial to contain the spread as we continue to open up our schools, economy and social activities, and as we prepare for the upcoming cold and flu season this fall.”These positions will be temporary and will be recruited by the Provincial Health Services Authority and the regional health authorities. This will allow health authorities to increase their local pool of available public health professionals, while also providing a team of people that are available to be deployed throughout the province as needed. The Ministry of Health is working with Health Match BC and the health authorities to manage the recruitment process.It is anticipated that candidates will begin work in September 2020 and will be employed until the end of March 2021, with opportunity for extension if needed.Those interested in applying can email: communitycare@healthmatchbc.org    "

It is located next to the Tulsequah River in northern British Columbia, within the territory of the TRTFN.“The environmental issues at the Tulsequah Chief Mine site have gone on for too long,” said Bruce Ralston, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources. “But after working in partnership with the Taku River Tlingit First Nation and the government of Alaska, I am pleased to see we now have a plan in place and can get to work on reclaiming the site.”For more than a year, the Province and the TRTFN have been working together to support the development of a conceptual closure and reclamation plan for the Tulsequah Chief Mine. This funding will allow for a number of critical activities to take place this summer.Some of the first steps include replacing and repairing bridges, upgrading the access road, establishing an erosion protection berm and repairing the existing airstrip. This work is required to prepare the site in order to address environmental, health and safety issues and undertake the long-term remediation.“One of the benefits of the work on the reclamation plan is safeguarding the salmon, and the joint effort with the Province has been key to reaching this stage of a plan,” said John Ward, spokesperson for the TRTFN. “An integral part of the approach of the Taku River Tlingit First Nation is a responsible approach to industrial development. Future mining in the Taku River Tlingit First Nation territory is supported if it’s a responsible and sustainable approach that’s brought to the development.”The Province and TRTFN will work together to contract a light detection and ranging sensor survey. The survey will get topographic information that is detailed enough to support further design work. It will also initiate a multi-year aquatics monitoring program and assess the potential short-term use of the interim water treatment plant. Data provided by these efforts will be crucial to filling information gaps and determining next steps at the site, including remedial timelines.“Taking action now is critical in order to begin to address the impacts of the former Tulsequah Chief Mine,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “Over the past year, we have been working closely with the Taku River Tlingit First Nation and the government of Alaska to identify the right actions to properly remediate and close the site. This work will also create jobs, build capacity in the community and strengthen partnerships to manage the health of our shared waterways.”The closure and reclamation plan outlines a phased approach that involves a series of steps designed to reduce the ongoing contamination. It is designed to be flexible, so changes can be made once more information is gathered from the site.The site remains in receivership under a court-appointed receiver. The Government of B.C. remains active in the receivership process that is currently taking place in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.The Province is committed to ongoing collaboration with the TRTFN and engagement with the State of Alaska in these efforts, while also fostering a well-regulated, sustainable and word-class mining industry that provides opportunities for all British Columbians.  Learn More:The Tulsequah Chief Mine Closure and Reclamation Plan is available on the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources’ website: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/environment/air-land-water/site-permitting-and-compliance/tulsequah/remediation_plan_tulsequah_chief_mine_site_for_distribution.pdfMore information about Tulsequah Chief Mine is available here: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/air-land-water/site-permitting-compliance/tulsequah-mine    "

This will also allow time for educators and staff to adjust to their new routines, finalize plans for learning groups, review health and safety protocols, and confirm lesson plans that align with the new normal in schools.Students will be welcomed back to class for orientation by Sept. 10 and will use their orientation time to get familiar with classrooms that will look different than they did before the pandemic. Students will be assigned to their class, find out who is in their learning group, practise their new routines and familiarize themselves with how to safely move from the class to outdoor and common areas of the school.On Aug. 10, School districts were provided with readiness checklists to ensure they are updating their health and safety plans and considering, communicating and consulting with their unions, Indigenous rightsholders, staff and families in their local communities. They will also need to ensure their plans address equity and inclusion of children who require additional support in school.Health and safety of teachers, staff and students is leading the work being done by the K-12 education restart steering committee and working groups with membership from all education partners and health experts. These groups are also working to create detailed operational guidelines, which will be available by Aug. 17 to support school districts with their restart plans, including guidance on: implementing the updated health and safety protocols; ensuring kids who require extra support are prioritized and have the services they need; supporting the mental health and wellness of students who may be experiencing additional challenges because of the pandemic; ensuring fewer contacts and a safe workplace for those who interact with more than one learning group – such as specialists, teachers on call, educational assistants, cafeteria staff or bus drivers; supporting hybrid instruction with a blend of in-person learning and remote learning for dense urban secondary schools with large student populations; minimizing physical contact within learning groups; and ensuring before- and after-school child care on school grounds allows kids to stay within their learning groups as much as possible. “By working collaboratively with leaders in our education system, we are making sure students and staff are safe, ready and welcome when they return to school in September,” Fleming said.To help guide the transition back to school in the safest way possible, Fleming has also been meeting regularly with the presidents of the BC Teachers' Federation, CUPE, B.C. Confederation of Parent Advisory Councils, the B.C. School Trustees Association, the First Nations Education Steering Committee, Métis Nation BC, the B.C.

People who are at risk from exposure to known cases are supported to self-isolate, reducing further community exposure. That is working. The number of people we see self-isolating from the past few days reflects the work that public-health teams are doing tracing people around the province to prevent the spread and stop outbreaks.“Remember, we can all help public health teams in contact tracing by using the skills we have learned: Keep gatherings small, have a designated ‘contact keeper,’ limit time with others, maintain physical distance, and always stay home if you’re feeling unwell.“What we do each day protects us, our families and friends and our communities.

Resurfacing crews will work north to 260 Road, east to 259 Road, then north again, ending at Milligan Creek Road. The resurfacing method will be hot-in-place recycling.Hot-in-place-recycling is a common resurfacing method. The top layer of asphalt is heated, reprocessed and then deposited to replace the original layer, done by a specialized motorized vehicle. This resurfacing method is quick and cost effective. Once the surface is compacted and cooled, the roadway is ready for use.This project is part of the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure’s work to maintain and improve the side-road network in the North Peace. The work includes resurfacing, additional gravelling, brushing, ditching and base repairs. Rose Prairie Road is an important side road in the North Peace, serving rural communities and industry north of Fort St. John.  The ministry is working closely with the contactor, ARC Asphalt Recycling Inc., and WorkSafeBC to ensure health and safety are maintained for all workers on site.Provincial construction sites have protocols and policies in place following the requirements of the provincial health officer to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. These measures include physical distancing and other protocols to ensure worker and public safety.Once the project begins, drivers can expect delays of up to 20 minutes and occasional single-lane alternating traffic during the day.

The Ministry of Finance's Consumer Taxation Audit Branch also regularly inspects retail outlets to ensure retailers are not selling contraband products.Surrey, Vancouver and Kelowna top the list for amounts of tobacco seized during operations: Surrey: approximately 3.6 million cigarettes Vancouver: approximately 1.6 million cigarettes Kelowna: approximately 82,000 cigarettes The Province strictly regulates the sale, purchase, possession and transportation of tobacco. Contraband tobacco includes products that are not properly stamped or marked, or legal products that are purchased and sold illegally.  Contraband tobacco can get into the hands of people under the age of 19 and can contribute to increased criminal activities, such as organized crime and drug and gun trafficking. A loss of tax revenue due to illegal tobacco means reduced funding for government programs.Individuals can anonymously report the illegal sale and distribution of contraband tobacco: by phone: toll-free at 1 877 977-0858  or online: to the Ministry of Finance: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/taxes/report-tax-tip or to Crime Stoppers: http://www.bccrimestoppers.com/  Learn More:To read more about illegal tobacco, visit: http://www.gov.bc.ca/tobaccotax    "

It will also feature upgraded effluent treatment equipment, reduced power consumption and community engagement in protecting wild salmon. It will be owned and operated by the Juan de Fuca Salmon Restoration Society, in partnership with the Sooke Salmon Enhancement Society.“We are proud to be working together with our federal and local partners to help restore B.C.’s wild salmon,” said Premier John Horgan. “The hatchery funding announced today is a key step to helping protect and repopulate wild salmon stocks, while balancing the need for environmental sustainability with the needs of Indigenous communities and local businesses.”The main project components include: equipment to support the marking of hatchery fry, so they can be identified in later life stages and provide valuable scientific information to support the management and restoration of Pacific salmon; creation of an effective aeration system customized for community-run hatcheries. The systems ensure the oxygen and nitrogen levels in the hatchery water are optimal for the holding of broodstock (mature animals used in aquaculture for breeding purposes), harvesting of eggs and growth of salmon fry, but are designed at a smaller, cost-effective, efficient scale than commercially developed and sold systems; an effluent treatment system that ensures only clean water leaves the hatchery; and cross-cultural learning opportunities for volunteer stewards, as well as Indigenous and academic partners.   The project will provide strategies, methodology and cost-effective procedures for other hatcheries to follow in meeting expanded requirements, as more and more British Columbians become involved in supporting wild salmon.“The British Columbia Salmon Restoration and Innovation Fund (BCSRIF) supports projects that are restoring and rebuilding salmon habitats, which are crucial for the communities and the industries that rely on them,” said Bernadette Jordan, federal Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard. “The Juan de Fuca Salmon Restoration Society’s work to upgrade the Sooke River Jack Brooks Hatchery facility will provide invaluable guidance to support similar upgrades at other hatcheries and make the community-based enhancement facilities more efficient.”BCSRIF is one part of the B.C. government’s response to the Wild Salmon Advisory Council’s recommendations to develop made-in-B.C. solutions to support wild salmon. An update on the Province’s response includes information on additional efforts to date that support wild salmon, such as the implementation of the Indigenous Monitoring and Inspection Program in the Broughton Archipelago and changes to the Riparian Areas Protection Regulation.Quotes:Lana Popham, B.C.’s Minister of Agriculture –“When people see salmon fry in the hatchery and fish swimming in the river, it helps them connect to the importance and value these remarkable fish bring to our province and oceans. Improving the equipment and infrastructure in the Sooke River Jack Brooks Hatchery recognizes the iconic role wild salmon have in our ecosystems and communities, and the hard work and time that so many British Columbians are volunteering to help their populations recover. I’m proud of our government’s investment in this project.”Elida Peers, secretary-treasurer, Juan de Fuca Salmon Restoration Society –“This facility will stand as a testament demonstrating the environmental legacy that can be produced when government funding assistance and our myriad of dedicated volunteers join forces to work together for Pacific salmon and our ecosystem.” Learn More:Juan de Fuca Salmon Restoration Society: http://salmonforsooke.ca/Sooke River Jack Brooks Hatchery and the Sooke Salmon Enhancement Society: http://www.sookesalmonenhancement.com/BCSRIF: http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fisheries-peches/initiatives/fish-fund-bc-fonds-peche-cb/index-eng.htmlBCSRIF will be accepting new applications for funding until Sept. 15, 2020.

The project will provide four people with immediate employment and the skill enhancement and work experience they need to become trail-crew professionals. Through the project, participants will also increase their opportunities for sustainable future employment with transferable skills in forestry and fire-suppression occupations.“Being able to provide important and meaningful skill enhancement to people who need it, while also improving public spaces, is a win for everyone involved,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “I look forward to seeing the results of their work.”Funding for this project is provided through WorkBC’s Community and Employer Partnerships (CEP) program. CEP aims to increase employment opportunities for unemployed British Columbians through partnerships, research and job-creation projects.“The northern mountain bike and multi-use trail corridor attracts outdoor enthusiasts from all over, and these people inject money into these small communities. They’re staying in hotels, eating at restaurants and visiting local shops,” said Thomas Schoen, CEO, First Journey Trails. “I’m thrilled that we are in position now where we can train more local trail builders in their communities. We need these local workers so we can maintain these trails in the future and continue to provide much-needed tourism revenue to the North.”The program intake began July 27, 2020. Training will run from mid-August through until Dec. 18.Quick Facts: More than $19 million was invested in CEP projects throughout B.C. in 2019-20.

The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 1,167 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 2,069 in the Fraser Health region, 147 in the Island Health region, 389 in the Interior Health region, 93 in the Northern Health region and 69 cases of people who reside outside of Canada.“There have been no new COVID-19 related deaths, for a total of 195 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There has been one new health-care facility outbreak at Derby Manor in the Fraser Health region. In total, five long-term care or assisted-living facilities and one acute-care facility have active outbreaks.“There are no new community outbreaks. However, there continue to be community exposure events throughout the province and on flights into and out of British Columbia.“Alerts are posted on the BC Centre for Disease Control’s website, as well as on health authorities’ websites, providing details on where the potential exposure occurred and what actions you need to take – whether you need to immediately self-isolate, or monitor for symptoms.“As we see new COVID-19 hot spots emerge and the new cases creep up in every health authority, we have to keep our firewall strong. Like a wildfire, COVID-19 has the potential to rapidly burn out of control and we need to put out these flare-ups.“Today, more than 1,500 people throughout our province are self-isolating, unable to leave their home unless it is to get medical care, because they have COVID-19 or have had a high-risk exposure to the virus. This is a concern and something we can change.“We can make a difference and we know what we need to do, because we have done so already. We are calling on everyone to make COVID-19 safety our way of life – this weekend and every weekend.“In step with our increased interactions comes the need to ensure we are taking the steps to protect ourselves and those around us. We have adapted our activities, put layers of protection in place and safely restarted our province.“Now is not the time to relax and let down our guard. Let’s keep our bubbles small, use our layers of protection and give people the space to stay safe.“We have been leaders in how to protect our communities and how to restart our economy. Let’s continue to be the place that leads with kindness and compassion, that works together and keeps COVID-19 low and slow.“This weekend, let’s continue to hold the line and remember that we can keep our curve flat.

The community is celebrating this achievement – one that provides for a future of security and self-determination for our members.” The Province purchased the ranch, along with its Crown land range tenure, cattle, hay and equipment, for $8 million. It is leasing the ranch to Xatśūll First Nation until a treaty is reached, at which point ownership will transfer to the Nation. The purchase agreement also includes provision for a grant towards the operating costs for the ranch’s first year.The purchase includes 1,574 hectares (3,890 acres) of deeded land, 113 hectares (280 acres) of additional pasture, more than 500 head of cattle, extensive outbuildings and two residences. The working ranch has 486 hectares (1,200 acres) of hay production and plenty of irrigation.“These lands create a new economic opportunity for Xatśūll First Nation. Recognizing the importance of this property to the Nation makes this achievement even more meaningful,” said Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. “Working together and reaching milestones together opens up the path to treaty and long-term reconciliation, and that benefits the Nation and surrounding communities.”The acquisition was made as part of the NStQ treaty negotiation process and helps to address ranching tenures impacted by proposed treaty settlement lands. Including the ranch lands as part of treaty has been a long-standing aspiration for NStQ community members, who see the acquisition as an important part of the reconciliation process. This prompted efforts to acquire the property, increasing the size of the treaty land package and securing several water licences, two grazing licences and a grazing lease for members of Soda Creek – Deep Creek (Xatśūll – Cmet’em).Quotes:Helen Henderson, Kukpi7 (Chief), Tsq'escen' (Canim Lake), and chair​ of Northern Secwepemc te Qelmucw – “Our connection to the land is a feeling that runs deeply through Secwepemc people. For generations, this connection has been denied to NStQ members. This step forward begins the process of restoring the confidence of NStQ citizens in the federal and provincial governments’ commitment to reconciliation. I celebrate with Xatśūll – Cmet’em in the long-awaited return of their land. I look forward to a future that includes more timely measures to return land to the people of the Northern Secwepemc te Qelmucw.”  John Massier, vice-chair, Cariboo Regional District, and board of directors’ treaty representative – “Congratulations on behalf of the Cariboo Regional District Board. We are pleased to see the continued co-operation by the Province, the Government of Canada and the NStQ treaty team. This purchase is a positive step forward in the treaty negotiations and is an important part of the sustainability and economic growth of Xatśūll – Cmet’em. Building resilient and flourishing communities throughout the Cariboo makes us all stronger together.”Kevin Boon, general manager, BC Cattlemen’s Association – “One of the principles that B.C. cattlemen have encouraged in the development of the treaty process is that the Crown consider purchasing ranches as part of the settlement where there is a willing buyer and willing seller. We are pleased to see this moving ahead, and look forward to the Soda Creek Band becoming more active members in the ranching industry in B.C.”Roger and Alison Patenaude, ranchers and former owners of the property – “We are pleased to announce the sale of our ranch and assets to the Soda Creek Indian Band and wish them the best in their new adventure in the beef industry.”Quick Facts: The ranch lands purchased by the Province were formerly known as the Carpenter Mountain Ranch. The name was not a part of the sale and is still held by the previous owners. A new name will be chosen by the Xatśūll First Nation. Xatśūll First Nation has over 400 members and is the northern most part of the NStQ, which has more than 2,600 members living in the Cariboo region of British Columbia. Along with the Xatśūll First Nation, the NStQ is comprised of three other Secwepemc communities: Tsq’escen’ (Canim Lake) T’exelc (Williams Lake) Stswecem’c - Xgat’tem (Dog Creek - Canoe Creek)  The NStQ are in the fifth stage of treaty negotiations with the Province and the Government of Canada.

We’re doing this by providing the funding that projects like this actually need to be affordable for people,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “These homes will help support healthy neighbourhoods by providing a range of accessible, affordable housing for a diverse group of people with mixed incomes and will benefit the community for years to come.”Located at 445 5th Ave., the four-storey, wood-frame building will provide 60 affordable homes for individuals, families, seniors and people with disabilities, including people living with mental-health challenges. The project will offer accessible studios, one-bedroom and two-bedroom homes with support services. Monthly rents will range from approximately $710 for a studio, $805 for a one-bedroom and $920 for a two-bedroom unit. This is $300 a month less than they would have been without the additional provincial investment.“The City of Kamloops is excited to see construction starting on this project, which will support residents with a variety of needs,” said Dieter Dudy, deputy mayor, City of Kamloops. “The city and our partners have been working hard to increase the supply of affordable housing in our community and it’s great to be seeing the results of those efforts.”The affordable units will be managed by JHSTR, a local non-profit with experience managing affordable rental housing and success working with people living with mental-health issues.“The John Howard Society has been operating housing safely and successfully with a well-experienced housing team,” said Lindsay Lord, CEO, JHSTR. “The agency staff and board of directors are pleased to be working alongside both the Province and the city, continuing to build upon the community of Kamloops’ affordable-housing continuum.”This project is part of an memorandum of understanding commitment between the City of Kamloops and BC Housing to build more than 100 units of affordable housing for people with low to moderate incomes.Residents are expected to move into the building in early 2022.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts: The Province is investing approximately $10 million towards this project. This includes $5 million from the Deepening Affordability fund in June 2020, so that the rents would be affordable for people in Kamloops. The City of Kamloops provided the land for the project, valued at approximately $1.2 million and $145,000 in municipal waivers.

The Langley Hospice Society is providing $2.28 million through community support and donations. The Province, working through the BC Centre for Palliative Care, is providing $900,000 and the Township of Langley is providing $219,000 as a grant/waiver of municipal charges. Fraser Health will continue to provide operational funding at the new residence.“The new Langley hospice will provide people a comfortable home with compassionate and accessible end-of-life care and services,” said Selina Robison, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “For people in Langley, this means people will receive the very best care during their final days, and their families will receive the emotional support and services they need close to home.”When the facility is completed in summer 2021, the new residence will replace the 10 hospice beds currently on the Langley Memorial Hospital campus, allowing those 10 beds to be repurposed for long-term care. Dedicated and specially trained staff from Fraser Health will provide clinical care and services for patients. Emotional and practical support for patients and families will also be provided by Fraser Health staff, alongside Langley Hospice staff and volunteers.The new hospice space is designed to provide individuals, families and caregivers with the means to access palliative and end-of-life care in a comfortable environment. The hospice will include specialized care spaces and private rooms with outdoor access for each resident.Families of residents will be able to access comfortable and quiet spaces in the hospice to support their specific needs, with areas such as a dedicated sanctuary, family kitchen, laundry and washroom.

The first segment will be a 13-kilometre stretch between Wesach Creek Bridge and Big Cedar Creek Bridge. The second will cover 16 kilometres from the Lava Lake Information Kiosk to the Nass Triangle.Highway 113 provides paved access to the settlements of the Nisga'a Nation, starting at Highway 16 west of Terrace, running 168 kilometres until ending at Gingolx.This project also includes first-time paving of 700 metres of Hubert Street in Gingolx, currently a gravel road, which is in partnership with the Gingolx Village Government.This project represents a combined government investment of nearly $5 million: $4.8 million from the B.C. government and $180,000 from the Gingolx Village Government.The ministry is working closely with the contactor, Peters Bros Construction Ltd., the Gingolx Village Government, and WorkSafeBC to ensure health and safety are maintained for all workers on site.Provincial construction sites have protocols and policies in place following the requirements of the provincial health officer to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. These measures include physical distancing and other protocols to ensure worker and public safety.Once the project begins, drivers can expect minor delays and, at times, single lane, alternating traffic. The ministry appreciates people’s patience during this resurfacing work. Drivers are reminded to obey construction zone speed limits and the direction of traffic control personnel.Updates on delays and closures are available online: DriveBC.ca or @DriveBC on Twitter.Learn More:For active highway and infrastructure projects in northern B.C., visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/17700For travel precautions due to COVID-19, visit: http://ow.ly/jBGu50yVMROFor more information on resurfacing methods: https://www.tranbc.ca/2012/08/01/smooth-move-3-common-ways-to-resurface-b-c-highways/    "

The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 1,143 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 2,045 in the Fraser Health region, 146 in the Island Health region, 385 in the Interior Health region, 93 in the Northern Health region and 69 cases of people who reside outside of Canada.“There have been no new COVID-19 related deaths, for a total of 195 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There have been two new health-care facility outbreaks in the Vancouver Coastal Health region at the Richmond Lions Manor and the Joseph and Rosalie Segal Family Health Centre. In total, four long-term care or assisted-living facilities and one acute-care facility have active outbreaks.“There are no new community outbreaks. However, there has been community exposure at Lions Bay Beach Park on July 26, 27, 29, 30 and 31. Anyone who was at the park on these days is asked to limit their contact with others, monitor themselves for symptoms and contact 811 should symptoms develop.“Alerts are posted on the BC Centre for Disease Control website, as well as on health authorities’ websites, providing details on where the potential exposure occurred and what actions you need to take – whether you need to immediately self-isolate or monitor for symptoms.“The challenges we have all faced as a result of COVID-19 can be daunting and a cause of fear and anxiety for many. We have changed how we work, how we shop and soon, how our kids will return to in-class learning.“We know the virus will be in our communities for many months to come, so we have adapted our activities, put layers of protection in place and safely restarted our province.“This is evidenced by the thousands of businesses that have developed COVID-19 safety plans, reopened and carefully increased the interactions among employees and customers. We have seen this in health-care facilities and services, in restaurants, child care and in our schools in June.“British Columbians have shown that they know the precautions to take to keep themselves, their children and families safe.“When faced with setbacks, we regroup, come together, learn and adapt our approach. We keep moving forward with the full resources and support of public health teams throughout this province.“When new cases emerge, no matter where they may be, public health teams immediately mobilize to identify the source of transmission, notify contacts and contain the spread.“It can be tempting to shut our doors and turn our backs on each other, but rather this is the time to show kindness and compassion, to be there for each other during these challenging days.“If someone you know is self-isolating or from a community where there are a number of cases, this is the time to offer support and help them get the services and care they may need.“Let’s continue to play safe and stay safe this summer, supporting each other with compassion and understanding.

We’re working hard to keep people safe during the pandemic, while also meeting the day-to-day health care needs of growing communities, like Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows,” said Premier John Horgan. “It’s all part of how we’re making progress on better, faster health care for people.”The opening of this new and expanded Ridge Meadows UPCC at Haney Place Mall will provide care for approximately 25,000 patients each year who will be seen by a team of health-care providers including general practitioners, nurse practitioners, registered nurses, social workers, clinical counsellors and office staff. The UPCC is operated by Fraser Health, with the support of the Ridge Meadows Division of Family Practice and the Katzie First Nation. “The Ridge Meadows UPCC reflects how our government’s primary care strategy is leveraging community collaboration to strengthen and expand primary care services across our province,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “The centre is a permanent fixture in this community and will help address gaps in everyday health care and support a long-term relationship between patients and their health-care provider — bringing health care in this region closer to home.”The Ridge Meadows UPCC will serve two purposes. The first purpose will be to provide more care for people with non-life-threatening conditions who need to see a health-care provider within 12 to 24 hours, but do not require an emergency department.The second purpose will be to help attach patients to a regular primary care provider. The Ridge Meadows UPCC is part of the Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows primary care networks (PCN) and is working with the Ridge Meadows Division of Family Practice to connect patients in Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows to physicians and nurse practitioners in their community.Once the new location opens, patients will be able to see a primary care provider from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekdays and weekends.There are 17 urgent and primary care centres that have been announced under the government’s primary care strategy. Of those, five centres are in the Fraser Health region, including North Surrey, Surrey Newton, Burnaby Edmonds, Abbotsford and at the new permanent location in Maple Ridge.Quotes:Bob D’Eith, MLA for Maple Ridge-Mission –“We are working hard to restart the economy with the Province, and this new UPCC will make a big difference in the lives of people in Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows by adding not only convenient health care services, but also health care and construction jobs. We anticipate local stores, coffee shops, restaurants and other businesses in the Haney Place Mall will see an increase in sales as more people visit the UPCC.”Lisa Beare, MLA for Maple Ridge-Pitt Meadows –“I know how hard it can be for many people in Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows to find a family doctor and I am proud that our government is working to bring meaningful change in the lives of people in Maple Ridge and the surrounding communities.”Chief Grace George, Katzie First Nation – “The Katzie First Nation primary care health program is excited to continue working with community partners to offer a holistic approach that incorporates physical, mental, emotional and spiritual elements of healing and growth for people supported at the new urgent and primary care centre. We look forward to supporting even more people as the UPCC and the PCNs continue to grow.”Dr. Victoria Lee, president and CEO, Fraser Health –“By working with our partners, we are able to co-ordinate health services to support patients and their families to manage existing health conditions, avoid unnecessary hospital visits and remain healthy and independent as long as possible. Community services like the Ridge Meadows Urgent and Primary Care Centre and PCN have been integral to our COVID-19 response in ensuring ongoing primary care, assessment and testing is available to all those who need it.”Dr. Kathleen Ross, president, Doctors of BC – “We look forward to the integration of the Ridge Meadows UPCC in hopes it will strengthen primary care in the community and ensure people there have access to the health-care services they need while also supporting long-term relationships between patients and their family doctor.”Jacqollyne Keath, board chair, Nurses and Nurse Practitioners of BC –“Nurses and Nurse Practitioners of B.C. are pleased to see that the knowledge, skills and expertise of the entire health-care team will be utilized to improve access to health care for all British Columbians through urgent and primary care clinics. We believe that this approach will be pivotal in ensuring B.C. families can access health-care services, and we are excited to see the opening of another urgent and primary care clinic in B.C.""Dr. Melodie Prem-Smith, primary care network physician lead, board chair, Ridge Meadows Division of Family Practice – “We are motivated in this new partnership with Fraser Health, Katzie First Nation and division members to work in an innovative way together by bringing new allied health-care providers, such as social workers, counsellors, cultural advisors and dieticians, into our family practice to work, and have easy access for our patients — working as an integrated team together.

The playbook will help employers prepare for workforce-related impacts and opportunities resulting from the pandemic and will help people who have lost their job to find re-employment, redeployment, retraining and sustainable employment opportunities.“This is an unprecedented time for everyone, including employers,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “It’s important that we provide tools and guidance to employers to connect with people who want to work, build flexible and efficient work environments, and meet the challenges that COVID-19 has created. I expect this playbook to be a model that other communities can follow to help get people back to work.""With this project, more Surrey employers will have the capacity to manage and respond to workforce challenges and address other COVID-19 related issues. Surrey educators, service providers and post-secondary institutions and the Surrey Board of Trade, employers and industry groups will be enabled to work together in a more co-ordinated and collaborative approach on workforce priorities in a rapid-response structure to help with economic recovery. ""The Surrey Board of Trade is honoured and pleased to have received this funding from the B.C. government to deliver on a real roadmap to economic recovery for Surrey employers through this pandemic,” said Anita Huberman, CEO, Surrey Board of Trade. “Employers need help to develop capacity to be agile while responding to ever-changing workforce and economic conditions. The Surrey Board of Trade is pleased to continue its support to the business community in Surrey.”The project started July 27, 2020, and will conclude July 23, 2021.

It will also provide four new viewing platforms with benches. The work will minimize impacts to wetland plant communities, avoid mature forest and minimize habitat loss for wildlife and species at risk.“The Delta Nature Reserve Boardwalk is an important feature in Delta. It provides access to beautiful forested areas and allows the public to experience the unique plant life created by the bog,” said George V. Harvie, mayor of Delta. “Our intent has always been to work with the Province to rebuild the boardwalk. We understand how important the boardwalk is to Delta residents.”Boardwalk decommissioning and re-construction is anticipated to start in the fall. Other sections of the boardwalk will remain open while the realignment work is underway.The realignment of the boardwalk will make space for a new vehicle ramp connection between Highway 91 and the Nordel Way Interchange that is part of the Highway 91/17 Upgrade Project. The project includes a combination of safety and capacity enhancements to Highway 91, Highway 17 and the Highway 91 connector, including: improvements to Highway 91 at Nordel Interchange; upgrades to the Highway 91 connector at Nordel Way intersection; a new interchange at Highway 17 and Highway 91 connector (Sunbury); and a new interchange at River Road connecting to Highway 17. Once completed, the series of roadworks will increase highway efficiency and provide an easier commute for residents and commercial vehicles. Better acceleration and merge lanes along with additional interchanges will enhance safety for all drivers. The expected completion date for the project is 2023.This project is part of the $260-million Highway 91/17 and Deltaport Way Upgrade Project package being delivered by the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure. Funding partners for this project include the Government of Canada through the National Infrastructure component of the New Building Canada Fund, the Province of British Columbia and the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority.

This represents a net increase of 3.5 Mt CO2e (6%) from 2007 levels, the baseline year for B.C.’s legislated emissions reduction targets, and a net increase of 2.6 Mt CO2e from 2017.The data from 2018 do not include actions from CleanBC, the Province’s climate action and clean economy plan, which was announced in December 2018. Implementation began in 2019.Two changes from the federal government led to revisions of previous years’ emissions numbers and increased the gap between B.C.’s 2007 baseline year and 2018 numbers. First, the federal government changed how marine transport emissions are calculated. The new methodology means that B.C.’s 2007 baseline year was revised downward by 1.4 Mt CO2e from the previous emissions inventory.In addition, gross emissions numbers, not including offsets, for 2017 were revised upward by 1.3 Mt CO2e, due to new estimates for fuel use in oil and gas extraction, heavy-duty vehicles, commercial and institutional buildings and light-duty gasoline-powered trucks.Taken together, these two technical changes made by the federal government for previous years’ emissions were equivalent to 2.7 Mt CO2e – or more than 75% of the gap between the new 2007 emissions baseline and 2018.Total gross emissions in 2018 also increased by 2.2 Mt CO2e from the previous year due to increases from sectors including heavy-duty diesel vehicles, oil and gas extraction, off-road industrial transport, and light-duty gasoline-powered trucks.The Province has put new requirements into law that government must present detailed annual reports to the legislature tracking progress made toward CleanBC targets. These emission numbers will form the basis of that report.CleanBC is a pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. CleanBC was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s emission targets.Learn More:To learn more about progress made through CleanBC, read the 2019 Climate Change Accountability Report: www.cleanbc.gov.bc/accountabilityreportTo view the full 1990-2018 provincial inventory of greenhouse gas emissions, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/climate-change/data/provincial-inventory    "

The centre will also be a hub of excellence for clinical and academic activities in order to attract top professionals.“The second Surrey hospital is not just a community hospital, it's a state-of-the art, 21st-century centre for health care, which has now expanded to include cancer treatment services,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “Though the rapidly growing city of Surrey is young, it also has an increasing population of seniors. This means the demand for cancer care will also increase, and our government is taking immediate action to improve health care for people living in this region for years to come.”This will be B.C.’s seventh regional cancer centre, with existing centres in Surrey Memorial Hospital, as well as Abbotsford, Vancouver, Kelowna, Prince George and Victoria.“Cancer is a very complex disease requiring specialized infrastructure and equipment. While B.C. has some of the best outcomes in Canada, we must continue to build provincial capacity to ensure we are meeting the needs of our population,” said Benoit Morin, president and chief executive officer, Provincial Health Services Authority. “I would like to express my thanks to Premier Horgan, Minister Dix and our partners at Fraser Health for supporting us as we look forward to building a stronger cancer care system across the province.”Surrey’s new hospital will be built in Cloverdale beside the Kwantlen Polytechnic University campus at 5500 180 St.“BC Cancer-Surrey opened 25 years ago and we have been an important part of the community for decades,” said Dr. Kim Nguyen Chi, vice-president and chief medical officer, BC Cancer. ""We all know someone who has been touched by cancer. Our talented and dedicated staff don’t just provide cancer care; they provide support during a very difficult and stressful time for most people. Our second centre in Surrey shows a commitment to providing person-centred care and supporting people where they are in the community.”The business-plan phase, confirming project scope and budget for the facility, has been underway since December 2019 and is expected to be finalized by late 2020. The project will then proceed to procurement, followed by construction.“A cancer diagnosis can be daunting and we want to provide patients with a seamless care journey so they can focus on getting well,” said Dr. Victoria Lee, Fraser Health president and chief executive officer. “We’re excited to partner with BC Cancer on a fourth cancer centre for our growing region, as having cancer care and other health-care services in one location means patients will have easier access to a spectrum of timely care when they need it most.”Quick Facts: One in two British Columbians will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime, with many of the new cases occurring among people in the Fraser Health region. By 2027, it is anticipated that one in three new cancer diagnoses in the province are projected to be in the Fraser Health area, 50% greater than the number of new cases expected for Vancouver Coastal Health in the same time frame. BC Cancer provides comprehensive, person-centred care that integrates patients and families, supportive care services, digital health technologies, cutting-edge research and individualized treatments.

Our government has been working to turn that around and these new treatment beds at Traverse are an excellent addition to our growing continuum of vital culturally-safe services to help young people become healthy again.”Traverse provides team-based residential care tailored to each youth, including comprehensive assessment, treatment and rehabilitation for up to six months. Individualized growth plans for each patient will help them address their addiction, while supporting them to develop skills to maintain wellness.Patients are supported by a team made up of clinical counsellors, addiction workers, nurses, a recreation lead and others. Using a team-based treatment approach to care, the centre focuses on four areas: counselling and network-building to work through relationship concerns and help youth establish a support network among their peers, and to reinforce that they are not alone in their recovery from substance use; indoor and outdoor recreational activities to connect patients to nature, promote physical activity and build confidence mastering a new skill; a safe space to explore cultural and spiritual beliefs that may support youth in recovery; and skills training, such as continuing education courses and cooking and volunteer programs to support young people in preparing for the future when they are on the road to recovery. Located at 45456 Yale Rd., Chilliwack, the site was designed with feedback from youth who have struggled with substance use and their parents. Culturally safe programming for Traverse was developed through consultation with local Indigenous leaders, youth and communities in order to best incorporate cultural experiences and learnings. Traverse’s Elder and Indigenous partners are involved in day-to-day programming through group and one-on-one meetings, weekly cultural groups and arranging for other Indigenous Elders to visit.Pacific Community Resources Society (PCRS), an organization with 35 years of experience providing quality, accredited social services in B.C., has been contracted by the Fraser Health Authority to operate Traverse. PCRS will work closely with the health authority’s mental health and substance-use team to support the unique needs of each patient.The government has provided $3.7 million to Fraser Health to support a combination of youth treatment beds and outpatient treatment services which will be used to support this new specialized treatment centre. BC Housing has invested $5 million to buy the property and build the site. Fraser Health Authority will provide ongoing operational funding for the site.The youth treatment facility is part of Fraser Health’s multi-faceted strategy to address the overdose emergency in the region, which also includes prevention, early intervention, harm reduction and treatment. Improved wellness for youth is an integral part of A Pathway to Hope, B.C.’s roadmap for making mental health and addictions care better for people in British Columbia. Implementing A Pathway to Hope is a shared priority with the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Dr. Victoria Lee, president and CEO, Fraser Health –“The majority of youth in B.C. live in the Fraser Health region, which is why the opening of Traverse is an important addition to the continuum of services we can provide youth who are struggling with substance use. Traverse is the first treatment facility of its kind in Fraser Health to allow youth with substance-use challenges to fully immerse themselves in an environment that helps them address why they consume substances, and enables them to build a community of support while learning practical skills to aid them in their recovery. Thank you to the B.C. government, BC Housing, Pacific Community Resources Society and Fraser Health staff and medical staff who have worked hard to bring this much-needed service to youth and their families in our region.”Brody Van Velze, 21, who has lived experience with substance use since age 14 and has been sober for over four years –“Traverse is the exact type of place that youth struggling with substance abuse need to support their recovery. When the team was building Traverse, I was able to talk to them about what was important to me in my recovery and how I think these factors could help others. Daily meetings and getting outside for activities and building a sense of unity and connection with others helps make recovery more fun.

The first phase of this project began in early 2017, when a $3.4-million grant from FESBC allowed the company to reduce wildfire risks and rehabilitate forests impacted by mountain pine beetles west of the Anaham community.  The $1-million grant that FESBC provided in 2019 funds the second part of the project. Beginning in September 2019, it focuses on recovering and using at least 200,000 cubic metres of waste wood fibre that accumulated during the first phase of the project.“This project demonstrates how factoring in greater waste-fibre utilization in projects like this generates multiple benefits,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “First Nations leadership has reduced wildfire risks and rehabilitated forests, and now the company is ensuring that the residual fibre is also put to good use.”Waste wood is normally burned on site to help reduce wildfire risks. However, the grant provided by FESBC allows Central Chilcotin Rehabilitation Ltd. to divert the residual fibre for other purposes and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by not burning the material in slash piles. It is expected that the grant will support the full-time equivalent employment of about nine loggers, truckers and other forestry workers.Recovered pulp-grade logs are being hauled to Cariboo Pulp in Quesnel. The remaining material is being ground up by Tsi Del Del Ltd. and shipped to either Pinnacle Renewable Energy’s pellet plant or sent to Atlantic Power to generate electricity, both located in Williams Lake.“This funding allows us to maximize our ability to deliver a by-product that is typically left on site, increase the overall recovery of fibre and create long-term carbon benefits by harnessing new values from traditional logging sites outside of the saw log fibre supply,” said Percy Guichon, director, Central Chilcotin Rehabilitation Ltd.The two First Nations that operate the company hold multiple forest licences. They aim to increase their use of waste wood, bringing an additional 20% to 50% of leftover wood fibre to market. Without the FESBC grant, it would be uneconomical to recover the waste wood fibre.“Central Chilcotin Rehabilitation Ltd. has been working on several FESBC-funded projects to reduce wildfire risks, by removing vegetation in specified areas to establish large fuel breaks that can slow the growth of a wildfire,” said Dave Conly, operations manager, FESBC. “That work creates a large amount of uneconomic wood, but that residual fibre can be utilized for pulp and wood pellets, or to generate power.”  The recovery effort has resulted in 200,000 cubic metres of residual fibre (about 3,300 truckloads) being used since the project started in September 2019, generating between $7 million and $8.5 million in sales for a product that would otherwise be burned.“This project is allowing First Nation-owned businesses to expand capacity and expertise as the forest industry transitions from a harvest economy to a forest-management economy,” said Hugh Flinton, forestry manager, Central Chilcotin Rehabilitation Ltd.   The Government of Canada and the Province are jointly investing $290 million over five years in B.C.’s forests to take action on climate change. The FESBC’s $1-million grant to the Central Chilcotin Rehabilitation Ltd. project is supported by the Low Carbon Economy Leadership Fund and the Forest Carbon Initiative.Learn More:Forest Enhancement Society of BC: https://www.fesbc.ca    "

This includes 17 family physicians, one new nurse practitioner and 44 additional health-care professionals ranging from registered nurses, to allied health-care professionals, social workers, Indigenous health co-ordinators and clinical pharmacists.“As part of our government’s primary care strategy, we’re making life better for everyone in B.C. with team-based health care through primary care networks to provide a seamless patient-centred experience that is responsive to the unique needs of each community,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “The North Shore primary care networks will address long-standing gaps in everyday health care for people living in the communities making up the North Shore region so that patients can get the care they need, when they need it, closer to home.”The North Shore primary care networks will see community partners work together to ensure tens of thousands of people have access to comprehensive, co-ordinated and team-based primary care services for all of their day-to-day health-care needs in  the districts of North and West Vancouver, the Tsleil Waututh Nation, the City of North Vancouver and the Squamish Nation, as well as the municipalities of Bowen Island and Lions Bay. Each network will provide a full range of accessible, everyday health services that will better support patients and providers. These three networks will be the Primary Care Network West, the Primary Care Network Central and the Primary Care Network East.The North Shore networks were developed to better meet the specific needs of the community. The networks will strengthen services identified as high priority. These include: better access to chronic disease and chronic pain management; improved access to mild to moderate mental health and substance use services; better co-ordinated services for families and seniors who are frail and people with complex health issues; more access to comprehensive services for people living in poverty; and culturally safe care for Indigenous people. The networks will work to attach the approximately 28,000 people who do not have a consistent primary care provider in the region, while also providing team-based and culturally safe care to residents of the North Shore.  An Aboriginal Services Collaborative, representing all Indigenous Nations and service providers, has been established to advise on the implementation of primary care. Local Elders will be supported to provide traditional wellness and peer support, as champions in their communities. For Indigenous peoples, this will mean more co-ordinated and culturally safe primary care support.“North Shore residents will be able to benefit from a more integrated approach to the health-care experience, enabling them to access a full range of health-care services from birth to end of life,” said Bowinn Ma, MLA for North Vancouver-Lonsdale. “Patient referrals will be more streamlined from one care provider to another, and family physicians, nurse practitioners and other primary health-care providers will be better supported.”The North Shore primary care networks are a result of a partnership between the Ministry of Health, Vancouver Coastal Health, North Shore Division of Family Practice and the Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh Nations.The Ministry of Health will provide approximately $11 million annually to the North Shore primary care networks once they are fully established.The Vancouver Coastal region now has six primary care networks, including three in Richmond.

Over time, it will link the community to health-care providers for their ongoing health needs and serve as a community gathering place.“As our economy begins to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s important that we build the crucial infrastructure communities need to be stronger and more secure than they were before,” said Premier Horgan. “I’m proud to help celebrate this investment in building the T’Sou-ke Nation a much-needed community and health centre that will reflect their culture and help preserve their language.”The T’Sou-ke Nation Health and Community Centre is one of 22 projects on Vancouver Island receiving joint federal and provincial funding under the Community, Culture, and Recreation Infrastructure Stream (CCRIS) of the federal Investing in Canada Plan. Under the first round of this program, eight projects are being supported in Indigenous communities. “Our government is creating opportunities for people from Indigenous communities in British Columbia to improve their quality of life,” said Selina Robison, B.C.’s Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “That includes having public spaces that support health and well-being in communities throughout the province. The project being announced today will strengthen the T’Sou-ke Nation by bringing their people together, celebrating their culture and enriching their lives for generations to come.”Catherine McKenna, federal Minister of Infrastructure and Communities, said: “The Government of Canada is proud to support the T'Sou-ke Nation Community Complex and Health Centre. This centre will play a key role in empowering all members of the community to improve their well-being, learn, build relationships and share their cultural experiences. Canada's infrastructure plan invests in thousands of projects, creates jobs across the country and builds stronger communities.”Construction includes a community complex, a health-care centre and offices for administrative services. There will also be community hall for gatherings, a full kitchen, an outdoor patio, washrooms and an elevator.“T’Sou-ke is following the footsteps of our ancestors always striving for a safe and healthy community while enhancing our territory. This is consistent with our Coast Salish teaching,” said Gordon Planes, Chief of T’Sou-ke Nation. “The work we do today is for our children and our children not born yet, and we know we need to all do this together as Naut’sa Mawt (together as one).”   Construction is expected to begin in spring 2022 and be complete in spring 2024.Learn More: Canada’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan: https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/economic-response-plan.htmlInvesting in Canada Plan Project Map: http://www.infrastructure.gc.ca/mapFederal infrastructure investments in British Columbia: https://www.infrastructure.gc.ca/investments-2002-investissements/bc-eng.htmlBC’s Restart Plan: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/emergency-preparedness-response-recovery/covid-19-provincial-support/bc-restart-planGovernment of British Columbia’s Infrastructure program: www.gov.bc.ca/Investing-in-Canada-Infrastructure-Program      "

An application deadline is set for Aug. 25, 2020, for workers and employers to jointly apply for an extension, to ensure that all applications will be processed by the Aug. 30 expiry date.“As one of the first employers to use the new online tool, I very much appreciated having the support of staff to guide me through the process,” said Stan Walt of Chances Kelowna. “The variance application has been easy to use and easy to understand. I feel well supported as we plan our path to economic recovery.”The new two-step online application simplifies and streamlines the process for employers and workers to jointly apply for an extension by allowing documents and signatures to be submitted electronically.First, employers must reach out to their workforce to ensure they have more than 50% support from workers before applying. Workers will receive information about the variance, including their rights under the Employment Standards Act, and will be able to voice their support using the online tool. Once worker support is documented, employers can complete the online form and submit directly to the Employment Standards Branch.Under B.C.’s Employment Standards Act, temporary layoffs related to COVID-19 can last up to 24 weeks, or until Aug. 30, 2020, before the layoff becomes permanent. Government encourages employers to submit their variance applications now to avoid permanent staff layoffs and compensation for length of service to eligible workers upon the expiry of the COVID-19 emergency layoff period Aug. 30.BC’s Restart Plan is supporting business to safely reopen and get people back to work.

Conservation Officer Service (COS).“These new positions give young people an opportunity to gain valuable skills and experience in the natural environment protection sector and reflect our commitment to an inclusive and diverse workforce,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “Creating job opportunities now and providing building blocks for future careers are our priorities as we build back a better and more secure future for young British Columbians, whose jobs have been hardest hit by COVID-19. We all benefit from enhancements to BC Parks and stewardship of our natural environment.”The $1.8-million Youth Employment Program (YEP) offers employment opportunities for young people through the fall and winter months. With direct mentoring from experienced park rangers and conservation officers, the successful candidates will develop skills and experiences that can help them succeed if they pursue a career in the field. The program will focus on diversity and inclusion, aiming to hire Indigenous youth and other young people from under-represented groups who may face employment barriers.The duties will range from public outreach and education, facility and trail maintenance, to invasive species removal and supporting conservation and recreation projects. Some applicants will also have opportunities to undertake project work in Smithers and with the Provincial Services Branch in Victoria, which will contribute to research, communications, program development and policy work.“More boots on the ground will help ensure nature is safeguarded and that British Columbians can continue to enjoy outdoor places that are becoming increasingly popular destinations to visit,” said Bruce Passmore, executive director, Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society – British Columbia. “We applaud this new initiative to hire young people into conservation jobs as part of B.C.’s economic recovery.”BC Parks will have 25 new YEP positions and the COS will have 18. COS will initially use an existing list of candidates, with a second phase of hiring later in August, if necessary. BC Parks positions will be available on the B.C. government employment opportunities page by mid-August 2020. This will allow people considering their options for returning to school the chance to spend up to four months gaining practical skills they can use towards a possible career in the field of environmental stewardship.Learn More:For information on Youth Employment Program positions in BC Parks, visit: http://bcparks.ca/yep/For information on the Conservation Officer Service, visit: https://www.facebook.com/ConservationOfficerServiceFor more information on B.C.’s response to COVID-19, visit https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/emergency-preparedness-response-recovery/covid-19-provincial-support    "

From Aug. 1 to Aug. 2, we had 29 new cases. From Aug. 2 to Aug. 3, we had 46 new cases and in the last 24 hours, we had 28 new cases.“This represents 146 new cases, including four epi-linked cases since we reported on Friday, for a total of 3,787 cases in British Columbia.“There are 319 active cases of COVID-19 in the province and 3,273 people who tested positive have recovered.“Currently, eight individuals are hospitalized with COVID-19, four of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 1,119 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,989 in the Fraser Health region, 146 in the Island Health region, 377 in the Interior Health region, 91 in the Northern Health region and 65 cases of people who reside outside of Canada.“Gratefully, we report that there have been no new deaths. We continue to offer our condolences to the families and friends of the 195 people who have passed away from COVID-19 and to everyone who has lost loved ones during this pandemic.“There has been one new health-care facility outbreak in the Fraser Health region at Maple Ridge Seniors Village long-term care facility. The outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital has been declared over. In total, three long-term care or assisted-living facilities have active outbreaks.“There are no new community outbreaks. However, there continues to be community exposure events throughout the province and on flights into and out of British Columbia.“The source of transmission in B.C. is varied. Many continue to be related to private gatherings or small parties from travel within B.C. and Canada, as well as from exposure in workplaces. In all of these cases, the common factors are close contact, crowds and mixing for an extended period of time, both indoors and outside.“It is always a concern when COVID-19 spreads unchecked and the source of the transmission is unknown. Coming together for summer weekend activities is when many people can be inadvertently exposed to the virus.“The immediate days following a long weekend are when people can also unknowingly spread the virus to others. That is why the next two weeks will be important for all us.“Coming out of the B.C. Day long weekend, we all need to pay attention to how we are feeling and contact 811 should any symptoms develop.“We also all need to pay attention to where the exposure events have been so if need be, we can immediately limit our time with others and take precautions to protect our families, friends and colleagues.“The alerts are posted on the BC Centre for Disease Control’s website and health authority websites. They provide details on where the potential exposure occurred and what actions you need to take – whether you need to immediately self-isolate or simply monitor for symptoms.“When there has been an exposure related to a workplace, many businesses are also notifying their customers and temporarily closing for additional cleaning. We encourage businesses to keep doing this.“When public health teams or businesses issue an alert, it shows us that our monitoring and response is working because we have identified the source of transmission and who may have been exposed.“COVID-19 is going to be in our community for some time to come. And while it remains in B.C., we need to keep it low and slow.“When we spend time with friends, visit another community on our summer holidays or take a flight to see our family, the actions we take make a difference to our COVID-19 curve.“We all know what we need to do to keep each other safe and healthy. Our good times guide is a helpful playbook for how to continue to have fun safely this summer.“Let’s make sure each day this summer we all play safe and stay safe, and continue to take the necessary precautions to protect our province from COVID-19.”Quick Facts: Assisted living, long-term care homes and seniors' rental buildings with ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks are as follows: Vancouver Coastal Health: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility  Fraser Health Dania Home long-term care facility Maple Ridge Seniors Village long-term facility   Learn More:Follow Dr. Bonnie Henry’s Good Times Guide: https://goodtimes.gov.bc.ca/For a listing of the community exposure events, visit: BC Centre for Disease Control (flights, worksites, etc.): http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/public-exposures Fraser Health: fraserhealth.ca/covid19exposure Interior Health: https://news.interiorhealth.ca/news/public-exposures/ Island Health: https://www.islandhealth.ca/learn-about-health/covid-19/outbreaks-and-exposures Northern Health: https://www.northernhealth.ca/health-topics/outbreaks-and-exposures Vancouver Coastal: http://www.vch.ca/covid-19/public-exposuresFor the amended order on mass gatherings, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topics/covid-19-novel-coronavirusFor B.C.’s surgical renewal plan and the first report on its progress from July 21, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020HLTH0228-001337For the latest modelling information presented on July 20, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/modelling-projectionsFor more information about BC’s Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/restartbcFor mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca Or: www.anxietycanada.comFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/ Or follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19 Or call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit: Facebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews  YouTube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBCFor a traditional Chinese translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.08.04_New_ExistingCasesCOVID-19_Chinese(Traditional).pdfFor a French translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.08.04_New_ExistingCasesCOVID-19_French.pdf    "

This is not the time to let our guard down.”  The state of emergency is extended through the end of the day on Aug. 18, 2020, to allow government to continue to take the necessary actions to keep British Columbians safe and manage immediate concerns, such as recent outbreaks in some areas of the province.“We still need to be able to access the necessary tools to support communities as they combat COVID-19 and its impacts,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “We will continue to extend this provincial state of emergency as long as necessary so we can ensure we are able to respond quickly and effectively to this pandemic.”   Actions taken in the previous two weeks to support British Columbians include: earmarking up to $1 billion of additional spending targeted to address COVID-19 impacts and restart plans of local governments and public transit services; introducing a free day-pass program at BC Parks to help reopen busy areas while managing overcrowding;  providing $1.5 million to help sports organizations with fixed costs during the COVID-19 pandemic; appointing six new provincial court judges, including the reappointment of three retired senior provincial court judges who have agreed to return to service, to help reduce backlogs in the provincial court system due to COVID-19; releasing B.C.’s Education Restart Plan for September, including $45.6 million for enhanced safety measures and additional resources to enable most K-12 students to return to school on Sept. 8, 2020, with full-time in-class learning; enacting an emergency order for BC Ferries to provide priority medical-assured loading on the first available vessel for any individual, their vehicle and an escort; temporarily authorizing liquor manufacturers to deliver products directly to individual consumers from their registered off-site storage facilities, in addition to their on-site stores; and restricting non-resident travel to Haida Gwaii, while maintaining essential goods and services, in response to a community outbreak of COVID-19. On July 10, the COVID-19 Related Measures Act came into force. The legislation enables provisions created for citizens and businesses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to continue as needed should the provincial state of emergency end.The extension of the provincial state of emergency is based on recommendations from B.C.'s health and emergency management officials. Farnworth made the original declaration on March 18, 2020, the day after Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, declared a public health emergency.Quick Facts: Declarations of provincial states of emergency may be issued by the minister responsible under the Emergency Program Act. The provincial government can extend the period of a declaration made by the minister responsible for further periods of time for up to 14 days at a time.

Canada's Infrastructure Plan invests in thousands of projects, creates jobs across the country and builds stronger communities.”The new truck parking facility is being built on provincial land on the north side of Highway 17, below and just east of the Port Mann Bridge. When completed, the facility will have room for about 100 trucks. It will include washrooms, fencing, lighting and other security measures.“This facility will help alleviate the shortage of commercial vehicle staging and parking in the Lower Mainland,” said Claire Trevena, B.C.’s Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “The North Surrey Truck Parking Facility will support the commercial transport industry by providing operators with a safe, convenient location to stop, take a break and turn off their engines.”A $4.97-million contract for the first phase of work has been awarded to Jacob Bros. Construction. This includes construction of a signalized intersection along Highway 17 to provide safe access to the new facility, as well as site excavation and preparation work.“The addition of safe, convenient commercial truck parking on the Lower Mainland is something our association fully supports,” said Dave Earle, president and CEO, BC Trucking Association. “It’s often difficult to find suitable parking for large transport trucks. Facilities like this make the job a bit easier for our members, knowing there’s appropriate parking available when it’s time to take a break.”Work on the first phase will get underway in the coming weeks. The actual parking facility and amenities will be built in Phase 2 of the project, which will be tendered in 2021.Provincial construction sites have protocols and policies in place following the requirements of the provincial health officer to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. These include reducing in-person meetings or gatherings, holding meetings outdoors and ensuring physical distancing of workers throughout the workday. These measures, along with other work protocols, such as daily cleaning and sanitizing of common areas and surfaces, will help ensure worker and public safety.Construction of the new intersection that will provide access to the truck parking facility may result in some delays for drivers on Highway 17. Obey the construction zone speed limit and check DriveBC for any delays.The North Surrey Truck Parking Facility is a $30-million project. The Government of Canada is contributing $13 million, with the remaining $17 million funded by the Province. The federal contribution is part of the larger $108.9-million Trans-Canada Highway 1 high-occupancy vehicle lane extension project under the New Building Canada Fund’s Provincial-Territorial Infrastructure Component-National and Regional Projects.Learn More:For guidance to construction sites operating during COVID-19, visit: http://ow.ly/P7WS50z8hNTFor travel restrictions and precautions due to COVID-19, visit: http://ow.ly/jBGu50yVMROFor the most up-to-date highway travel information, visit @DriveBC on Twitter or: www.DriveBC.caFor a Punjabi translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/8-4-20_truck_parking_Punjabi.pdfFor a French translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/8-4-20_truck_parking_French.pdf     "

The new regulation will allow for payments to be made on a website, app or by telephone, limiting customer time in stores and permitting physically distanced pickup.In-store pickup is still required to allow employees to check identification. Retailers must also include an age-verification tool in their online sales systems. Government is considering proposals from private retailers for delivery of online cannabis. Any potential relaxation of the existing delivery prohibition for private retailers would need to maintain strict standards preventing youth access to cannabis.“This change responds to a request from private retailers as they continue to follow the mandates of the provincial health officer,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “It supports public health and safety by reducing the amount of time customers need to spend in stores and allows them to remain physically distanced from employees and each other.”An additional change will permit CRS licensees with multiple stores to accept prepaid purchase cards (gift cards) at any of that licensee’s locations or through its online system. Previous regulations restricted the use of such cards to the store at which the card was purchased.The new changes will improve the competitiveness of legal operators in drawing business from illegal online cannabis stores by offering increased convenience for consumers.“We’ve heard from legal cannabis retailers that they want more tools to help increase competitiveness with the illegal market by allowing online sales,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “By offering online sales for cannabis products, we can support the growth of a vibrant, legal cannabis industry, while also keeping public safety as our top priority.”Learn More:For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/ Or follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For the provincial health officer’s orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/Covid-19 Or call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.

The illicit drug supply is more toxic than ever before. That’s why we are accelerating our response to connect more people to life-saving prevention and treatment services and supports as we work to build a full continuum of care that works for all British Columbians. Together, we can stem this terrible tide.”  The funding will further scale up overdose prevention services, expand access to safe prescription alternatives to separate people from toxic street drugs and add new outreach teams to help prevent overdose deaths, save lives and connect more people to treatment and recovery throughout the province.To reduce the number of people using alone, funding will be used to open 17 new supervised consumption services and 12 new inhalation services in communities hit the hardest by the overdose crisis.The funding will be used to expand access to safe prescription alternatives for people at high risk of overdoses. Nurses in various communities will be added to conduct initial patient assessments. This will allow prescribers, pharmacists and care teams to help more people get the medications they need to stabilize and stay safe during this challenging time.Forty-two new full-time registered nurses, psychiatric nurses, social workers and peer support workers will be added to 14 new and existing interdisciplinary outreach teams throughout the province. Working in groups of three, these workers will help connect people with substance-use challenges, including those who use drugs alone, to treatment, recovery and services that best suit their needs. In addition, these teams will be vital in bringing services to people who may be unable to access services as a result of COVID-19.Team members will use a culturally safe, trauma-informed approach to care to engage individuals at-risk and those who have experienced stigma and discrimination while accessing health care.“These measures are a huge step in the right direction towards supporting people who use drugs, including the many clients that we serve,” said Katrina Jensen, executive director, AVI Health and Community Services. “This will make a significant difference in enhancing overdose prevention services and increasing access to safe supply, which in turn will help support more people during this challenging time.”Expanding overdose prevention services and connecting people to treatment and supports is an integral part of A Pathway to Hope, B.C.’s roadmap for making mental health and addictions care better for people in British Columbia.Implementing A Pathway to Hope is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Learn More: A Pathway to Hope: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/british-columbians-our-governments/initiatives-plans-strategies/mental-health-and-addictions-strategy/bcmentalhealthroadmap_2019web-5.pdfRisk Mitigation Guidance: www.bccsu.ca/covid-19    "

Their efforts are part of a partnership with Emergency Management BC and the Ministry of Health to keep people safe and to protect public health, homes and livelihoods.“Being in self isolation can be difficult for many, especially those who have been away from B.C. for a long period of time or for temporary foreign workers who have left their friends and families behind to fill much-needed roles in B.C.,” said Anne Kang, Minister of Citizens’ Services. “I’m proud the people at Service BC who have been working hard to ensure people’s health and safety and for providing returning travellers and temporary foreign workers with a measure of comfort and kindness while they complete their 14-day isolation period. They are truly providing service with heart.”Since isolation plans became mandatory for international arrivals to B.C., Service BC employees have made more than 8,500 phone calls to temporary foreign workers, providing information and making referrals for any needed supports. There have also been over 51,000 calls as of July 23, 2020, confirming that self-isolation plans are being followed.Many people contacted have welcomed the human connection with Service BC employees, saying that being able to talk with someone has helped them feel safe and comfortable, and the service calls have reinforced that someone cares.On average, more than 20 people have been dedicated to the returning traveller and self-isolation program at Service BC, resulting in 1,800 to 2,500 calls being made per day to those in self isolation.“Service BC provides people with access to provincial services every day, and these call-backs are a great new addition to the many other supports that are offered,” Kang said. “Service BC also helps people find services ranging from the affordable child care benefit and business registration to residential tenancy, student aid and more.”British Columbia was the first Canadian province to require returning travellers to self isolate. The Province took action to protect residents swiftly because of quick solutions to handle workflow and manage quarantine plans. Over the course of a weekend, teams worked with several technology and design firms to implement a system that is easy to use and understand, protects privacy and allows provincial staff to provide high-level, individualized service for people arriving in B.C. from abroad.While these self-isolation plans were pioneered in B.C., similar measures have been implemented federally and nationwide. B.C. ended provincially led border checkpoints on June 20 after transitioning them to the federal government, but Service BC continues carrying out its new role, with employees showing compassion and providing support for returning travellers and temporary foreign workers in self isolation.Learn More:For information on BC’s Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/RestartBCFor information on non-medical issues, such as travel recommendations and how to manage social isolation, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID-19For information on Canada’s travel restrictions, visit: https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/coronavirus-covid19/travel-restrictions-exemptions.htmlFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://covid-19.bccdc.ca/Or follow the BC Centre for Disease Control on Twitter: @CDCofBCFor the provincial health officer’s orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, call (toll-free) 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week, or visit: www.gov.bc.ca/Covid19    "

Day, a day to celebrate the remarkable place we call home.“British Columbia is envied around the world for its unmatched natural beauty and resources. But what really makes this province special is its people. We are the home of talented, hardworking and generous people who take care of each other and the natural environment. We are the home of diverse, multicultural communities that are built on the shared values of inclusion and respect. And we are the home of Indigenous peoples – the first peoples – on whose unceded territories we are privileged to live.“B.C. has been through a lot over the last few months. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged and changed our province. People are still dealing with job loss and financial stress. Others are grieving the loss of a loved one. But through our collective efforts and sacrifices, we flattened the infection curve and are now planning our recovery. Our diversity and unity are what make our province strong, resilient and able to rise to the great challenges of our time.“As we celebrate B.C. today, we recommit to protecting what makes our province so special – our people.“When COVID-19 arrived in B.C., our government took critical steps to protect people’s health, homes and incomes. Now, as we turn our attention to B.C.’s recovery, we will continue to put people at the centre of our decisions.

And that work continues, as many LGBTQ2S+ people around the world still fight for basic rights that many people take for granted: equal marriage, access to adoption, legal protections for gender expression and gender identity.“This time last year, Vancouver was getting ready to welcome over 650,000 people on its streets marching in support of the annual Pride parade. This year, Vancouver Pride Week has looked a bit different due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I know that losing the opportunity to come together in person in recognition, celebration and solidarity has been incredibly difficult.“Many people continue to be targeted with harassment and discrimination because of their gender or sexuality. Our government has taken some first steps to making our province more inclusive for LGBTQ and two-spirit people, including teaching sexual orientation and gender identity inclusive education, re-establishing the human rights commission and implementing a gender-X option for provincial identification.“As we mark the Vancouver Pride parade virtually this year, I hope everyone takes this opportunity to learn more about LGTBQ2S+ history, celebrate how far we’ve come and recognize how far we have to go.“Pride cannot be cancelled.“Together, we will build a province where everyone can live without fear of violence or discrimination, where everyone can take pride in who they are.”    "

My heart was full after a day at the Ardill Ranch and I look forward to a day when I can visit again. I wish everyone at Ardill Ranch, and the members of the Ardill family the best and congratulations on 100 years of farming in B.C.”Jack Ardill was born in Ireland and immigrated to Canada in 1909 at the age of 19. While serving in the First World War, Jack met his future wife, Betty, while in Holland as a prisoner of war.The newlyweds, Jack and Betty, returned to Canada in 1919 and settled in Hudson’s Hope. They moved to Edmonton where their first son, John, was born in February 1920. In the spring of that year, Jack scouted for land in Peace River country and found what he had dreamed of.On May 6, 1920, Jack and Betty filed a Homestead and Soldiers Grant for the ranch location in the Peace River District and brought with them the essentials for homesteading: a team of horses, a cow and calf, some chickens, a plow, a mowing machine and rake, some furniture, a tent and a year’s grubstake (materials and provisions).The ranch boundaries grew as the years went by and more parcels of land were accumulated. The cattle population also grew as more land was put under cultivation. During those busy days, Jack and Betty’s family also grew, welcoming their daughter Betty, and sons Richard (Dick) and Tom.After 100 years, the ranch is still family-run and is almost entirely self-sufficient for gardening and food – both for home and for livestock. Dick, along with his wife Irene, took over for Jack as ranch manager in the early 1960s, but retired approximately 10 years ago. John also lived and worked at the ranch with his wife Beth until his death in 1996. Renee, Dick’s oldest daughter, has taken over the ranch manager role and lives and works at the ranch, along with other family members Karen McKean (granddaughter-in-law), Don Ardill (grandson) and Sorrel Schroeder (great grandson).When Dick was asked how he felt about celebrating 100 years of ranching, he laughed and said, “Well, it doesn’t make me feel any younger. It is quite an accomplishment to be celebrating 100 years and to have kept it in the family. I’m thankful the family wants to ranch, and although it may not be an easy life, it’s a good life.”Today, the area is home to about 400 head of commercial Hereford cattle, who spend their summers on the range and winters in the valley. Approximately 60% of the total feed supply is put up in the form of grain and hay silage, while the rest is put up as round bales.Horses remain an important part of life on the ranch. Some of the first quarter horses in the area were brought to the ranch from the Edmonton area. Horses are still the main access to summer range, used for salt packing, range patrol, cattle work, rodeoing and pleasure riding.“I’m proud to be a fourth-generation rancher,” Schroeder said.The ranch is a successful cow-calf operation, where hard work and fun go hand in hand. Ardill’s Ranch is proud to be part of the community and takes part in community events, such as high-school work-experience programs, forage tours, annual Hudson’s Hope preschool tours, rodeo and rodeo sponsorships, hockey sponsorships and Hudson’s Hope Fall Fair.Century Farm Awards honour agricultural organizations that have been active for a century or longer, as well as pioneers whose farms and ranches have been in families for 100 years or more. Each Century Farm Award celebrates the rich heritage of farming and ranching families and organizations in B.C.Learn More:For more information about B.C.’s Century Farm program, visit: http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/agriculture-seafood/programs/century-farm-awards    "

It has also begun the process to re-baseline the project to determine the cost and time required to complete the remaining work.“The previous government chose to start Site C in 2010 and made clear they wanted to push it past the point of no return. And they did.“We knew there were significant cost pressures and risks with Site C when we formed government. COVID-19 has dramatically added to these challenges.“We take this very seriously. Today, I am announcing the appointment of Peter Milburn as a special advisor to work with BC Hydro and the Project Assurance Board.“As a former deputy minister of finance and secretary to Treasury Board, I fully expect Mr. Milburn will play an important role in reviewing the project and will provide the government with independent advice.”    "

Once opened, the centre will provide extended hours of care with primary care providers supporting both attachment and access to services.“This is great news for the community and the capital region as-a-whole,” said Mitzi Dean, MLA for Esquimalt-Metchosin. “Not only will this urgent and primary care centre bring much-needed services to people in Esquimalt, but it will also help residents to be connected to a consistent primary care provider closer to home.”Island Health is proceeding with an urgent and primary care centre to respond to increasing primary care needs resulting from the recent departure of family physician practices from the community. Island Health, the Esquimalt Township and South Island Division of Family Practice continue to work on additional longer-term primary care strategies for the community.The urgent and primary care centre in Esquimalt will recruit general practitioners, nurse practitioners, nurses and allied health clinicians to improve access to same-day care and provide ongoing primary care through booked appointments.This is the 18th urgent and primary care centre to be announced under the government’s primary care strategy, fourth in the Island Health region.The first centre is located in Langford and has surpassed 42,000 patient visits since opening in November 2018. The second centre in Nanaimo has served more than 30,500 patient visits since opening in September 2019. The third is in James Bay, Victoria, and has served over 2,350 patient visits since opening in April 2020. To further improve access to primary health-care services in the Island Health region, the Province has also established its first nurse practitioner primary care clinic in Nanaimo.Quick Facts: Primary care is the day-to-day health care given by a health-care provider. Urgent primary care is the care that people need within 12 to 24 hours, for conditions such as sprains, urinary problems, ear infections, minor cuts or burns. Urgent and primary care centres are part of a comprehensive strategy to transform B.C.’s health system by bringing together and co-ordinating with health-care providers, services and programs to make it easier for people to access care, receive followup and connect to other services they may need.

An integral part of our work together includes the Province’s commitment to supporting carbon-credit sales and the world-class work of our stewardship offices and guardian watchmen.”The MOU builds on a Reconciliation Protocol, signed in 2009 to protect the Great Bear Rainforest and develop a sustainable economy. The new agreement outlines a long-term vision for B.C.’s mid- and northern coastal areas, guided by a shared belief in reconciliation, fiscal self-reliance and a collective responsibility to manage the natural environment in the face of climate change. This MOU provides a framework for continuing to protect the environment and increased economic development opportunities for Coastal First Nations communities.“This MOU builds on the positive and constructive relationship between the Province and Coastal First Nations and our commitment to advancing reconciliation together,” said Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. “It shows how we can work together to protect the environment while building an economy that works for everyone.”Under the MOU, the Province and Coastal First Nations agree to pursue a conservation-based regional economy through a diverse set of initiatives to promote financial self-reliance. Initiatives include climate change and conservation, land and marine stewardship, including long-term marine use plans for B.C.’s north Pacific coast, economic development, connectivity and high-speed digital access.The Province has also signed a new five-year agreement to purchase carbon offsets from the Great Bear Rainforest carbon-offset projects. These projects, which collectively cover an area greater than six million hectares, protect existing carbon stocks through ecosystem-based forestry management. Revenues from offset sales to the Province will directly contribute to economic self-sufficiency in the local communities.The MOU is intended as a practical guide for incremental steps B.C. and Coastal First Nations can take together. Support for individual projects, such as shellfish aquaculture development, forestry management and high-speed digital connectivity, will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis.Quotes: Chief Arnold Clifton, Gitga’at First Nation – “We look forward to creating more economic development opportunities in forestry, shellfish aquaculture, carbon credits, clean energy and connectivity. A healthy coastal economy isn’t just good for our communities, it is also good for surrounding communities and the province as a whole.”Trevor Russ, vice-president, Council of the Haida Nation – “We are at a watershed moment in protecting our waters and our lands. Our people have spent thousands of years protecting our territories. The MOU supports the work of stewardship offices and guardian watchmen. Our guardians are successful at protecting our lands and our waters simply because they are closer to the ground and respond quickly to changes or threats. Investing our own resources, through the sale of carbon credits, means that we are doing the work to keep our territories safe.”George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy –“We’re working to advance reconciliation together with Coastal First Nations by supporting strong climate action that protects natural ecosystems, biodiversity and old-growth forests while increasing economic opportunities for Indigenous peoples and supporting our CleanBC plan. This agreement builds on our shared commitment with Coastal First Nations to protect the iconic Great Bear Rainforest for future generations.” Jennifer Rice, MLA for North Coast –“The Coastal First Nations and the provincial government have successfully worked together for the betterment of everyone who lives on B.C.’s central and north coast and Haida Gwaii for many years. This MOU strengthens this partnership and creates a long-term pathway toward reconciliation.”Quick Facts: Coastal First Nations member nations are Wuikinuxv, Heiltsuk, Kitasoo/Xaixais, Nuxalk, Gitga’at, Gitxaala, Metlakatla, Old Massett, Skidegate and Council of the Haida Nation. Their collective territories span the central and north coast of B.C. On Dec. 10, 2009, B.C. and Coastal First Nations members entered into the 2009 Reconciliation Protocol, one of the first such agreements in Canada, which focused on collaborative approaches to land and resource management and implementing economic initiatives.

Shared amenities include an office, laundry room, commercial kitchen and a dining lounge area where residents can enjoy meals together. The Aboriginal Coalition to End Homelessness Society (ACEH) will operate the building and will have staff on site 24/7 to support residents.  This project is the first supportive housing of its kind in British Columbia. It provides culturally appropriate supports for Indigenous women, as well as access to teachings from Elders, traditional foods, cultural crafts and land-based healing, including programming that focuses on physical, mental, emotional and spiritual well-being. In addition, an Elder and an “Aunty” will be onsite two days per week to provide additional one-on-one support.“Everyone at every level has done their part to make this a reality – Spaken House is beautiful,” said Fran Hunt-Jinnouchi, executive director, ACEH. “The Aboriginal Coalition team will work diligently to ensure the environment is safe, builds on a sense of family and community and incorporates pathways to healing and recovery into the programming. Most importantly, we will celebrate the gifts the women bring to our Family Circle and support them in their journey through culture, crafts, healing ceremonies, family reunification, a meal program including traditional foods, empowerment workshops, Elder support and much more.""Additional unique features to Spaken House include a therapeutic garden with plants and natural medicines, which will serve as a resource for healing and well-being.“As we prepare to enter into Spaken House, my heart feels full to have witnessed this become a reality for the women moving in soon,” said Gloria Roze, Elder, ACEH. “Our people have been needing this for a long time and I hope it leads to more amazing housing successes. I have seen land-based healing work for our people in positive and profound ways. Culturally supportive housing is a pathway for the spirit and internal growth. You feel the love when you step into Spaken.”Atira Women’s Resource Society, an experienced non-profit housing provider, helped provide supports and training to ACEH staff in creating this unique program.“Atira has had the absolute privilege to work with the ACEH, its dedicated executive director and amazing team, as they embark on this critically important, culturally relevant, supportive housing program for First Nations, Métis and Inuit women,” said Janice Abbott, CEO, Atira. “We are grateful for the small part we have played in making this happen and look forward to working together into the future, strengthening our relationship in support of both the ACEH and the women it serves.”Residents will begin moving into their new homes in mid-August 2020.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts: The Province provided $3.8 million to the project through the Rapid Response to Homelessness program and will provide annual operating funding of approximately $997,000.

Once completed, the centre barrier will divide the highway along these segments, improving safety and preventing head-on collisions and other crossover accidents.Two separate tenders will be issued. The first is for the installation of median and roadside barriers on sections of eight kilometres of Highway 97 between West Bench Hill Road and Sun-Oka Beach Provincial Park. The roadside barrier will connect with the existing roadside barrier. Work on this project is anticipated to start in early fall.The second tender is for the installation of continuous median barriers on a 5.9-kilometre section of Highway 97A between Smith Drive in Armstrong and Pleasant Valley Road in Vernon. Work on this project is anticipated to begin late this year.Drivers can expect minor delays during these projects, as the installation work will occur outside the peak traffic hours of 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. The ministry appreciates people’s patience during the work. Drivers are reminded to obey construction zone speed limits and the direction of traffic personnel.

This temporary change will help manufacturers reduce this inventory by allowing them to sell to individual consumers.The measure is one of the emergency recommendations put forward to government by a group of industry representatives, the Business and Technical Advisory Panel, in order to mitigate some of the challenges B.C. manufacturers have had in getting their product to B.C. consumers as a result of the pandemic.People will still be required to complete transactions through a licensee’s on-site store online or by telephone. They will not be able to physically purchase product at off-site storage locations, as per current policy. This temporary measure will expire on Oct. 31, 2020, and no extension will be considered.Learn More:View the Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch policy directive here: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/business/liquor-regulation-licensing/liquor-law-policy/liquor-policy-directives    "

The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 1,076 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,865 in the Fraser Health region, 143 in the Island Health region, 360 in the Interior Health region, 86 in the Northern Health region and 61 cases of people who reside outside of Canada.“There have been no new COVID-19 related deaths, for a total of 194 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks. There is one long-term care facility and one acute-care facility with active outbreaks.“There are no new community outbreaks, with no new cases on Haida Gwaii and 59 cases connected to Fraser Valley Packers Inc. Public health teams continue to support these active outbreaks.“A reminder that the consumption of fruit from a location where people are confirmed to have COVID-19 is safe. However, people are reminded to always wash fruits and vegetables before consumption.“There continues to be additional community exposure events throughout the province. A full listing of community exposure events related to flights and others within each health authority is available through the BC Centre for Disease Control, as well as on health authority websites.“In recent weeks, B.C. has faced an increase in new cases and new outbreaks of COVID-19. Much of this surge can be connected to Canada Day activities in the Kelowna area.“What we have seen is that when our groups are too big and we see too many people outside of our household bubble, the potential for the virus to spread increases.“We voiced our concern and British Columbians have listened. We thank you for resetting and rejoining our efforts to push our COVID-19 curve down and keep it low and slow in B.C.“Until we have an effective vaccine, we all need to find the balance of reducing our risks and increasing our social connections. It is not difficult to do, but requires all of our effort, all of the time. This is how we play safe and stay safe.“The fewer new cases and exposure events, the more opportunities we all have to enjoy the summer and have fun. More businesses are open and more activities are available to all of us.“It is easy to socialize safely and that’s what we all need to do this B.C. Day weekend. To do this, let’s keep our groups small and keep a safe distance from others, no matter where we may be.“The actions you take make a difference, so let’s make this holiday a different holiday than what we saw in early July.

The Province will deploy staff to support communities on the mainland and on Haida Gwaii to implement the travel restriction.There are currently 20 cases associated with the outbreak on Haida Gwaii. According to Northern Health, all cases are believed to be related to residents who have travelled off-island, or who had contact with a resident who has travelled off-island.Testing for the islands has been prioritized and results are being received within 36 hours. Community contact tracing is ongoing and supports are in place on the islands for those who have tested positive, including special accommodations for self-isolation if needed.“COVID-19 has been challenging for everyone in our province. I am thankful the leadership of communities across Haida Gwaii has worked together to take these actions collaboratively,” said Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer. “This order will help the Province ensure resources are in place to protect public health and safety as Haida Gwaii works to contain this outbreak. These measures are part of a swift, effective and co-ordinated public health response that includes prioritized testing, thorough contact tracing, and prioritized travel to and from the community.”Travel to Haida Gwaii will continue to be permitted, subject to the approval of the collective Haida Gwaii communities, for the delivery of essential goods and supplies, medical appointments, urgent or emergency family matters, and for the provision of essential services as defined by the unified command structure comprised of the Council of the Haida Nation, village councils and local governments.On March 18, 2020, Farnworth declared a provincial state of emergency, the day after the provincial health officer declared a public health emergency.

We’re answering the call to action with this research position,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “This is one more step we’re taking to help keep British Columbians safe.”Provincial funding of $5 million for the endowment will pay for the position, hosted by TRU at its Kamloops campus. The campus is near Emergency Management BC (EMBC) and BC Wildfire Service operational centres and is supported by high-speed fibre optic connections and key transportation routes.In part, the chair’s research will support wildfire data modelling in the heart of wildfire country. It will also help explore the relationship between climate change and its effect on wildfire risk.“Applied research is a critical tool to help build our capacity to understand and address the challenges of ecological threats in B.C.,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “This new research chair adds to the world-class research done at B.C.’s post-secondary institutions and will create new collaborations, including with local First Nations to integrate traditional ecological knowledge. Their intimate and longstanding relationship to the land has given them unique, local knowledge about managing wildfires.”The first appointment to the research chair at TRU is anticipated later this year.“This new position will bring together experts to advance the use of technology in emergency management,” said Michelle Mungall, Minister of Jobs, Economic Development and Competitiveness. “Our province needs innovative solutions to help minimize the threats that wildfires pose to our people and economy.”In 2017, wildfires and floods cost the province $1.6 billion, prompting an independent review by former MLA George Abbott and Maureen Chapman, hereditary Chief of the Sq'ewá:lxw (Skawahlook) First Nation in 2018.Quotes:Brett Fairbairn, president, Thompson Rivers University –""This effort shows that by working with various partners, universities can help address the complex issues facing local communities. I would like to thank our research partners – the University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC) and the University of British Columbia Okanagan (UBCO) ­– and the mayors of Prince George, Kelowna and Kamloops who were integral in putting this forward. Continued collaboration with these partners and others, including First Nations, BC Wildfire Service and EMBC, will ensure B.C. has the latest and best information to prevent and respond to wildfires.”Ken Christian, mayor of Kamloops –“Kamloops is the ideal location for this research position. Not only do we have a natural vulnerability to forest fires, and in particular urban interference fires, we also have had a great deal of experience dealing with evacuations and recovery. This is good news for Kamloops and for British Columbia.”Colin Basran, mayor of Kelowna –“The devastating floods and wildfires that we’ve experienced in recent years illustrate that climate change impacts us all. This research will benefit the entire province. This chair has been established through a unique collaboration between the three municipalities and three universities and I’d like to thank the provincial government for seeing the value in this multi-stakeholder initiative.”Lyn Hall, mayor of Prince George –“The 2017 and 2018 wildfires brought the realities of our current ecological climate home to Prince George.

The new ZEV regulation sets phased-in annual targets and other compliance requirements, ensuring automakers increase the number and type of EVs that they sell in B.C. to meet consumer demand.EV sales in B.C. made up 9% of light-duty vehicle sales in 2019, as well as in the first half of 2020 – the highest sales rate in Canada. Budget 2020 invested an additional $20 million in point-of-purchase rebates to make EVs more affordable, helping British Columbians choose cleaner transportation options and save on fuel costs.“Growing numbers of British Columbians are switching to electric vehicles and benefiting from an improved driving experience, zero air pollution and much lower fuel and maintenance costs,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “We’re supporting this transition by making electric vehicles and charging more affordable and available around the province. These changes will help us to build a cleaner, better future where all new vehicles are zero emission.”The ZEV regulation was informed by engagement and consultation with stakeholders, including the auto industry, local governments and environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs). Following comments received during consultation, a technical review of the ZEV regulation will be held at regular intervals to review market trends, receive input from stakeholders and allow for any necessary adjustments.A ZEV advisory council will be established to provide input into the ministry’s EV programming and policies including the ZEV regulation. The advisory council will be comprised of industry, ENGOs, local governments, First Nations, infrastructure providers and academics.CleanBC is a pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. CleanBC was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s emission targets.Quotes:Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head –“The B.C. ZEV mandate is an exciting development in British Columbia’s shift toward the low-carbon economy. The ZEV sales requirement was a key part of the CleanBC plan that I worked in collaboration with government to build, and I’m pleased that this important milestone has been achieved.”Adam Olsen, third-party interim leader and MLA for Saanich-North and the Islands –“Electrifying our transportation network is critical to building a sustainable future. We are proud B.C. is leading the way with an ambitious and legislated 100% zero-emission vehicle target. However, the key to our success going forward will be ensuring equitable access to both electric vehicles and charging infrastructure across society – work we are keen to continue advancing.”Merran Smith, executive director, Clean Energy Canada –“Electric vehicle sales are growing rapidly and it’s vital that supply keeps up with demand. It’s simple. If you want an electric car in this province, you should be able to drive one home from the lot, same as any car. This new zero-emission vehicle regulation ensures we’ll have more of the electric vehicles British Columbians want, saving them thousands of dollars on fuel and maintenance costs while also cutting pollution.”Daniel Breton, president and CEO, Electric Mobility Canada –“While setting up EV adoption targets is important, regulating EV sales to reach a 100% target by 2040 shows how serious the B.C. government is about climate change and EV adoption. The new ZEV regulation is an important step in the right direction.”Quick Facts: With the passage of the legislation, B.C. joined a growing number of jurisdictions with EV standards, including Quebec, California and nine other U.S. states, and became the first jurisdiction in the world to legislate a 100% EV target. Zero-emission vehicles include battery electric, plug-in hybrid electric and hydrogen fuel-cell electric vehicles. CleanBC’s Go Electric program offers point-of-purchase rebates of up to $3,000 for the purchase or lease of a new battery electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle or hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle for vehicles less than $55,000.

BC Ferries will also continue to give priority to vehicles carrying essential goods and supplies, and will need to consult the Province before changing or varying minimum ferry service levels.”To access priority loading for medical treatment, passengers must provide a doctor’s letter indicating the individual requires medical-assured loading for treatment at check-in, as well as a completed Travel Assistance Program (TAP) form. The doctor’s letter does not require a specific date or time, or number of occasions the person travelling requires medical-assured loading to receive medical treatment, but may specify a period of time of up to one year from the date of the letter within which the individual requires medical-assured loading.The provincial government is also rescinding some emergency measures enacted in March 2020 under the Local Authorities and Essential Goods and Supplies (COVID-19) Order, including priority access for passengers sailing to their primary residence.“We introduced these measures, with the public interest in mind, at the beginning of the pandemic when ferry routes were significantly reduced. We wanted to ensure people could get home and to help ensure essential services for remote communities were maintained,” said Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “We expect BC Ferries to put the public interest first. Now that ferry service levels have increased with more British Columbians travelling within the province, we expect BC Ferries to continue to monitor demand and ensure adequate capacity is in place.”In addition to the measure related to ferry routes, the province is also rescinding or partially rescinding two further provisions under Ministerial Order 84, the Local Authorities and Essential Goods and Supplies (COVID-19) Order: a provision that requires local authorities to implement an emergency plan, as this requirement has been fully implemented; and rescinding a provision that set aside declarations of local states of emergency made on or before March 26, 2020. Local authorities will still be required to seek approval from the Province before making a new declaration of a state of local emergency or using any extraordinary powers in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, local authorities have no restrictions on their ability to enact states of local emergency or use of extraordinary powers as they relate to other issues such as floods and fires. On March 18, 2020, Farnworth declared a provincial state of emergency, the day after Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, declared a public health emergency.

Shared amenities include a laundry room, commercial kitchen and a dining lounge area where residents can enjoy meals together. The building also has a medical room to provide on-site care for residents.“These 51 new homes for people who have struggled to find stable housing will be life changing for the residents selected to live here,” said Colin Basran, mayor, City of Kelowna. “The housing-first approach to end homelessness is part of the larger solution for social and economic needs in Kelowna and we look forward to other BC Housing developments in our community in the future.”The John Howard Society of Okanagan and Kootenay (JHSOK) will manage Stephen Village. It will provide residents with support services, including meal programs, life and employment skills training, health and wellness support services and opportunities for volunteer work. At least two staff members will be on site 24/7.“Safe and secure homes like these provide a real opportunity for people to rebuild their lives. We look forward to being part of the community at 2025 Agassiz Rd.,” said Hailee Rogers, director, JHSOK Housing First division. “We're committed to being a good neighbour and building safe communities both inside and outside of our homes. Stephen Village and John Howard Society Okanagan and Kootenay are committed to provided stable housing and access to supports such as education, employment opportunities and health-and-wellness services.”BC Housing and JHSOK worked together to identify people experiencing homelessness in the local area to move them into these homes. Residents will begin moving into the new building on Aug. 17, 2020.“I was working and successful in life, but once I was diagnosed with cancer my whole world turned upside down,” said T.W., a new Stephen Village resident. “I ended up on the streets living at a shelter.

The centre, which will be operated by Coast Mountain Children’s Society based in Terrace, is expected to open in September 2021 and will offer 12 new infant/toddler spaces, 20 spaces for children aged three years to kindergarten, 10 pre-school spaces and 60 school-age spaces. The centre will use the Indigenous Early Learning Framework, which sets out principles to help ensure that Indigenous children experience high-quality, culturally rooted early learning and child care programming.“We’re thankful for the opportunity to continue to build on our ongoing successful relationship with the Coast Mountain School District, as well as the Ministry of Children and Family Development,” said Sonia Hundal, executive director, Coast Mountain Children’s Society. “This opportunity will not only increase the number of spaces at our centre, but it will serve to improve the centre’s ability for accessible and inclusive spaces, with a focus on play areas, both indoor and outdoor. We are very excited to be leading the Northwest in increasing quality child care spaces for our community.”The mechanical and overall design improvements of ET Kenney Primary school will ensure a healthy and safe environment is provided to children, while taking part in the before- and after-school programs and daily child care. The indoor play spaces will ensure children have many healthy activities with adequate space to be safe, no matter what time of year or challenges the outside weather brings.  “The board of education eagerly anticipates the creation of new affordable child care spaces in Terrace and welcomes the opportunity to partner with the community to offer affordable spaces for families,” said Janet Meyer, superintendent of Schools, Coast Mountains School District 82. “The board of education recognizes the need for additional child care spaces and extends its appreciation to the Ministry of Children and Family Development for approval of this joint application between Coast Mountain Children’s Society and Coast Mountains School District 82. Working jointly with the community to address issues such as child care is a priority for the school district.”Recent changes made by government to the School Act will make it even easier for school boards to create and operate before- and after-school care. The changes will also require school boards to prioritize space that is not being used for K-12 students for child care and encourage school boards to adopt an inclusive child care policy.“For too long, families throughout B.C. have struggled to find quality, affordable child care close to home,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “We’re making it easier for child care to be delivered on school properties, because children benefit when they spend more time in spaces that are already designed for enrichment and play, and families save time and money with one central drop-off location in their neighbourhoods.”July 2020 marks the second anniversary of the launch of the New Spaces Fund, which has approved an average of 700 new spaces for funding each month. So far, nearly 16,800 new spaces have been funded throughout the province, helping parents return to work, go back to school or pursue other opportunities. These new spaces are part of the fastest creation of child care spaces in B.C.’s history. An additional 4,100 spaces, funded through the 2017 Budget Update and the Early Learning and Child Care agreement with the Government of Canada, means that more than 20,900 new licensed spaces have been funded since July 2017.“Providing quality, affordable and inclusive child care goes hand in hand with a strong, vibrant economy,” said Katrina Chen, Minister of State for Child Care. “By funding nearly 16,800 new licensed spaces throughout the province, our government is helping more parents return to work, go back to school or pursue other opportunities knowing that when they drop their kids off in the morning, they’ll get the nurturing support they need to grow and thrive.”Investing in child care and early childhood education is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts: This investment means 102 new licensed child care spaces have been funded in Terrace since July 2018. As the Province moves toward its “new normal” under COVID-19, child care capital builds may see unexpected delays. Once operational, child care providers will be required to follow guidelines provided by the Ministry of Health and BC Centre for Disease Control to keep staff and the families they serve safe and to limit the risk of transmission.

The curriculum will incorporate Dane-zaa language, culture and history and teachings about Mother Earth, traditional territory, living with the land, medicines and legends. Children will learn about their history from Elders and build resiliency through traditional stories, songs, crafts, practices and games in Beaver language.“Doig River is excited to receive funds for our new child care facility that will house our Aboriginal Head Start Program and Youth After School Care programs,” said Chief Trevor Makadahay, Doig River First Nation. “Early learning and educational supports are critical to the long-term success of our community’s membership.

This is a special time when families and friends come together to share a meal, give to those in need and reflect on the lessons of sacrifice — as demonstrated by Abraham's commitment to God.“Never have those reflections been more important than they are now. While our collective efforts have made B.C. a world leader in handling the COVID-19 pandemic, they have come with significant sacrifice. This Eid al-Adha, many are facing the stress of financial hardship or being separated from loved ones. Millions of Muslims who would have been making their pilgrimage to Mecca for the Hajj have had to stay closer to home. This year, local celebrations and prayer services will have fewer faces than before.“Muslim communities throughout B.C. have had to find new ways to worship, as they did their part to help fight the spread of the virus. In Vancouver, the city’s oldest mosque, Al Masjid Al Jamia, broadcast the call to prayer during Ramadan over loudspeakers for first time in its history. Victoria’s Masjid Al-Iman hosted lectures online for the community. Others offered virtual prayers and online services to connect people to their faith. These examples of sacrifice and resilience have inspired us all.“As Muslims prepare for the Qurbani, and to share in its bounty with family and those less fortunate, I extend my warm wishes to everyone celebrating. May Eid al-Adha’s sprit of togetherness, generosity and compassion bring good health and happiness — today, and as we move forward.

364,2020-07-30 06:00:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020FLNR0041-001423,Government Website,Help keep B.C. Day long weekend safe for everyone,"  The BC Wildfire Service urges British Columbians to be safe in the woods and reminds everyone that the return of warm weather means an increasing risk of wildfires.Although the start of this year’s wildfire season was quieter than normal, August is typically the most active month of B.C.’s wildfire season. This is why it is important for British Columbians and visitors to remain vigilant and ensure that they are using fire safely.Human-caused fires are completely preventable and unnecessarily divert crucial firefighting resources from naturally occurring wildfires. From April 1 through July 29, 2020, the BC Wildfire Service responded to 239 wildfires throughout the province, approximately 85% of which were attributed to human activity.“We know people want to get out into the great outdoors, but it’s important that everyone stay vigilant about fire safety,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “Fighting wildfires can be challenging at the best of times, but managing them in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic requires BC Wildfire Service staff to operate with even greater care. I urge everyone to support our crews by using fire responsibly and making sure that their activities don’t spark a wildfire this holiday weekend.”Campfires are currently allowed in all areas of the province that fall under the BC Wildfire Service’s jurisdiction. However, people are urged to use caution and keep an ample supply of water nearby to fully extinguish their campfires.Larger Category 2 and Category 3 open fires are prohibited in some regions of the province. Up-to-date information about current open burning prohibitions is available on the BC Wildfire Service website: www.gov.bc.ca/wildfirebansLocal governments and other jurisdictions (e.g., BC Parks) may have their own burning restrictions or bylaws in place. People should also check with those authorities before lighting any fire.Campfire safety and fire precautions: Campfires must not be larger than 0.5 metres high or 0.5 metres wide. Never light a campfire or keep it burning in windy conditions. Weather can change quickly, and wind may carry embers to other combustible material. Maintain a fireguard around the campfire. This is a fuel-free area where all flammable materials (grass, leaves, kindling, etc.) have been removed right down to the soil. Never leave a campfire unattended. Have a shovel or at least eight litres of water available to properly extinguish your campfire. Make sure the ashes are cool to the touch before retiring for the night or leaving the area for any length of time. Other precautions: Anyone riding an all-terrain vehicle or dirt bike on Crown land must have a spark arrestor installed on the vehicle. To help reduce wildfire risks, check the condition of the muffler, regularly clear buildups of grass or other vegetation from hot spots, stay on dirt paths and avoid riding in tall grass and weeds. Smokers must dispose of cigarette butts and other smoking materials responsibly and ensure those materials are completely extinguished. The government’s conservation officers conduct regular patrols throughout British Columbia, while natural resource officers from the Compliance and Enforcement Branch work closely with BC Wildfire Service staff to investigate the cause of wildfires and any improper fire use when an open burning prohibition is in effect.Anyone found in contravention of an open-burning prohibition may be issued a violation ticket for $1,150, required to pay an administrative penalty of up to $10,000 or, if convicted in court, fined up to $100,000 and/or sentenced to one year in jail. If the contravention causes or contributes to a wildfire, the person responsible may be ordered to pay all firefighting and associated costs.To report a wildfire, unattended campfire or open burning violation, call 1 800 663-5555 toll-free or *5555 on a cellphone.

Without this action, a number of properties would have been in jeopardy of losing farm status for the 2021 tax year, significantly increasing the property tax burden on those farmers and farm families.“We know that robust and healthy farm operations will play an important role as we restart our economy,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “Our government is committed to helping farmers maintain their farm classification for 2021 to ensure they can produce the food people in B.C. rely on.”In order to be classified as a farm in British Columbia, properties must meet certain criteria, including generating a minimum amount of gross income from a qualifying agriculture use based on the size of the parcel of land. This minimum income requirement must be met every two years and there must be some income generated every year. BC Assessment sends out self-reporting income questionnaires and conducts intermittent inspections to determine whether a property should maintain its farm status for the upcoming tax year.This approach aligns with the Province’s COVID-19 Action Plan to support businesses through the pandemic, as well as government’s commitment to encourage agricultural production.Quick Facts: New applications for farm class and retired farmer designations will be processed as usual by BC Assessment. Any property subject to a legal change, including a change in ownership or subdivision, and any property with a change in use or where a lease is expiring, will be required to complete a self-reporting questionnaire and will not automatically be granted farm status for 2021.

Local governments are developing plans for these byelections and assent votes in consultation with public health officials and the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing. The ministry is working directly with local governments to ensure each community will have the election guidance, advice and options it needs to make its own decisions about how to safely proceed with election processes.At the height of the pandemic, Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, deferred pending byelections and assent votes. This was done at the request of local governments and public health officials. At the time, Victoria, Rossland and Lytton were planning to hold byelections and Kamloops was planning an assent vote. Several other local governments with vacancies have since delayed their pending byelections.Local governments with pending byelections and assent votes are being supported by ministry staff as they make election plans. They are encouraged to continue working with ministry staff to confirm plans and timelines to arrange safe, fair and accessible elections.Quick Facts: B.C. is in Phase 3 of the safe restart plan. The operations of local governments, businesses and other organizations must comply with public health and safety guidance from the provincial health officer and WorkSafeBC. There are 14 B.C. communities needing to hold byelections or assent votes to fill vacancies on their councils and boards. The ministry, in consultation with its partners, has drafted guidelines for those local governments considering holding byelections and assent votes in their communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Local governments can use the information provided, in conjunction with the Local Government Act and their election procedure bylaw, to establish clear processes and procedures for these events that support the recommended provincial health officer health and safety measures, including physical distancing and those set out by WorkSafeBC.

Planting of the buffer of 225,000 trees will begin next year.The community forest is held in equal partnership between Lake Babine Nation and the Village of Granisle, which has a population of about 350 and could not afford to take the project on alone.The FESBC funding was approved in 2018 to assist BLCF with its long-term wildfire mitigation, including community consultation and long-term site plans that integrate wildlife values. It is part of the larger project, to which BLCF is contributing $1.7 million.As part of the project, conifers were logged last year. Fuel management is planned this year (the piling and burning of surface fuels) and planting will take place next year.“The Village of Granisle and Lake Babine Nation have both been incredibly supportive,” said Peter Tweedie, general manager, BLCF, and owner of Tyhee Forestry Consultants, which conducted the work on behalf of BLCF. “In our public-input meetings, they were diligent in providing information. We’ve had almost unanimous buy-in from attendees who have felt anxious about the existing wildfire risk – especially since the 2017 and 2018 wildfire seasons.”A review by the BLCF and the BC Wildfire Service indicated that replacing the dense conifer stand around the community with deciduous trees would be a low-maintenance, long-term solution to creating a wildfire buffer around the community.“Our community is extremely grateful for the time and direction by our community forest board of directors in addressing the wildfire mitigation surrounding our town,” said Linda McGuire, mayor, Village of Granisle. “Daily, we have been observing the progress of this project and have every confidence it will be completed in the coming months and the board will have achieved their goal on a successful endeavour.’’The project is also enhancing skills training opportunities and providing employment to residents of both Lake Babine Nation and the Village of Granisle. FESBC funding is creating about four jobs.Quotes:Gord Pratt, operations manager, FESBC –“FESBC is excited to assist the BLCF meet multiple objectives. This includes reducing the wildfire risk to the Village of Granisle and improving the forest by taking an innovative approach to diversifying the species in the community forest, allowing them to market hardwood fibre in the future.”Gordon Alec, Chief of Babine Lake First Nation –“Having worked in the forest industry for 43 years, I know managing and sustaining the forest and economy is vitally important. I fully support the Babine Lake Community Forest. I am quite confident that this venture will go a very long way in benefiting all of the communities involved. Let’s keep these positive initiatives going. Thank you all.’’Quick Facts: FESBC, a Crown agency, was established in 2016 to advance environmental and resource stewardship of the province’s forests by: preventing and mitigating the impact of wildfires; improving damaged or low-value forests; improving habitat for wildlife; supporting the use of fibre from damaged and low-value forests; and treating forests to improve the management of greenhouse gases.  The B.C. government has invested $235 million in the society, with about $233 million allocated as of July 29, 2020, for wildfire risk reduction, reforestation, forest rehabilitation, wildlife habitat restoration and raising awareness of the FireSmart program.

This will reduce the number of people each student or staff member will come into contact with, reducing the risk of transmission and ensuring quicker contact tracing by health authorities.All boards of education and independent school authorities will continue to be required to implement a suite of health and safety measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission, following the recently updated guidelines from the BC Centre for Disease Control.""We know how important it is for children to be back in school – to both support their emotional and mental health and their ability to socialize and to learn,” said Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer. “Being back in school is also crucial to support many parents in being able to work, but we must do it safely. We ask for families and workplaces to continue to be flexible as we come into the fall. We’ve put a lot of thoughtful work and consideration into reopening schools this fall and in making sure we’re supporting children in ways that keep them, the people who teach them and our communities safe.”To support and ensure the health and safety of students and staff during this pandemic, a one-time investment of $45.6 million as part of the BC COVID-19 Action Plan will support school districts and independent schools for the start of the school year. This investment will ensure the increased cleaning of high-contact surfaces, increased number of hand-hygiene stations and the availability of masks upon request, among other safety measures.Staff and students (or their parents/guardians) must also assess themselves daily for symptoms of COVID-19. If any student or staff member has even mild symptoms, arrangements will be made for that person to return home.The ministry is developing operational guidelines that will further assist school districts and independent schools with their planning for September. An education steering committee including teachers, parents, Indigenous rightsholders, support staff, principals and vice-principals, school trustees and the public health sector has also been established to identify best practices and find solutions to potential issues.“B.C. will continue to keep a strong focus on science-based decisions as we learn to adjust the delivery of education during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Stephanie Higginson, president of the B.C. School Trustees Association. “Boards of education across the province will utilize updated health and safety measures, created on the advice of the provincial health officer, to ensure that students can continue to receive the social, emotional and academic supports provided by their community school during this critical time in education.”Families will hear from their school district or independent school throughout the summer with updated health and safety guidelines for elementary, middle and secondary schools, as well as learning groups, schedules, enrolment and registration information with the final details being submitted to the ministry and posted online by the districts on Aug. 26, 2020.  “The safety of students and staff is paramount and government will continue to make science-based decisions, following the expert advice of Dr. Henry and her public health team,” Fleming said.Quotes:Andrea Sinclair, president, BC Confederation of Parent Advisory Councils (BCCPAC) –“BCCPAC thanks our dedicated board members who have worked on the different restart committees to ensure equity, inclusion, health and safety, and educational programming remain at the forefront in the planning for a return to school in September. Parents should feel assured that as things progress and evolve over the coming weeks, the Ministry of Education will be working directly with BCCPAC and our education partners to ensure student safety remains a top priority.”Paul Faoro, president, CUPE BC –“We are pleased to see the provincial government recognize the critical work our members do to keep schools clean, safe and inclusive. The additional investment of resources will help ensure the necessary level of custodians to ensure that schools are properly cleaned and that students and staff are safe in our schools. The June reopening of schools showed that under the guidance of provincial health officer Bonnie Henry, we can safely welcome students and staff back to schools in September.

Sea to Sky Soils produces compost and soil amendments for local farmers and residents in the Squamish-Lillooet Regional District (SLRD), increasing local food security and reducing the need to import compost from other sources.  “Our community is growing, and the residents in our region are very keen to support environmental sustainability and to be able to access local compost and soil,” said Tony Rainbow, board chair, SLRD. “The demand is outstripping what Sea to Sky Soils can both take in and produce, so this expansion is a very welcome project. The SLRD is pleased to be able to partner with Sea to Sky Soils in this program for the benefit of our region.”The Sea to Sky project builds on the 12 organics infrastructure projects announced to date. This will lead to a reduction of nearly 300,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030, comparable to removing 100,000 cars from the roads for a year. Organic waste represents 40% of material sent to municipal landfills in B.C. and generates 7.5% of the province’s greenhouse gas emissions.“I am pleased to see the Sea to Sky Soils composting facility working to reduce emissions, divert waste from landfills, and produce clean and useful compost right here in our community,” said Patrick Weiler, MP for West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast-Sea to Sky Country, on behalf of Jonathan Wilkinson, federal Minister of Environment and Climate Change. “The Government of Canada continues to work closely with the provinces and territories to support good projects, such as this one, that help us in the transition to a low-carbon economy. By working together, we can ensure a greener, more prosperous future for our children and grandchildren.”In 2018, the Province launched the Organics Infrastructure Program, in partnership with federal and local governments, to reduce greenhouse gases and ensure B.C. communities are clean and healthy places to live. The $30-million program combines up to $10 million in federal funding from the Low Carbon Economy Leadership Fund, $10 million from the Province and $10 million in matching funds from local government applicants and their partners.The program is helping communities throughout B.C. expand their infrastructure and divert organic waste away from landfills. It is also helping the Province meet its CleanBC commitment to help communities achieve 95% organic waste diversion for agricultural, industrial and municipal waste.CleanBC is the province's pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. It was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.'s emission targets.Quick Facts: The total project value is $1,311,800 and includes a provincial contribution of up to $437,266 (33.33%), a federal contribution of up to $327,950 (25%) and a regional district contribution of $546,584 (41.67%). The project is estimated to result in a reduction of over 47,000 tonnes of CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent – a standard unit for measuring carbon footprints from different greenhouse gases) by 2030. This is the same as removing nearly 17,000 cars from the road for one year. The project is also expected to provide employment opportunities for local First Nations. The Government of Canada’s Low Carbon Economy Fund is part of Canada’s climate action plan, and helps put Canada on a path to exceed the Paris Agreement target for 2030.

Land Matching Program (BCLMP).Delivered by Young Agrarians, the BCLMP connects new, young and established farmers with landholders seeking to lease their properties to ensure their land stays in production or starts producing food. Since the pilot launch, the program has helped more than 70 farmers, with 1,883.8 hectares (4,655.0 acres) brought into or maintained in agricultural production and a total of 81 land matches. Businesses can be matched to more than one property and have been made on acreages of all sizes – from less than an acre to large plots of farmland.“I’m so excited that we’re helping B.C. farmers find affordable and accessible farmland to put into production so we can have more fresh, local food in our communities,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “Whether they are new farmers, or established farmers who need more land, each farmer has their own unique criteria when looking for farmland. The services delivered by Young Agrarians are so valuable in bringing people together and making these matches that meet everyone’s needs.”Stefan Butler and Lindsay Cornwell operate Nutrient Dense Farms, a market garden business in Squamish. After years of farming on multiple sites, they knew they needed one larger property in order to grow a business where they could put down roots. They found their new home base on a 9.7-hectare (24-acre) parcel of land in Squamish owned by Wolfgang and Renate Alkier, and were able to sign a 26-year lease.On Vancouver Island, landholders Valorie Masuda and Alan Moore wanted to make their four-hectare (10-acre) property outside Duncan available for local food production. Megan Henwood and Callum Bottrell are young farmers with a vision of creating a mixed farm, producing vegetables, duck eggs and grains to supply their food truck operation. The BCLMP connected the two pairs and helped develop a lease agreement.Land matchers provide personalized support services to new farmers and landholders to help them better understand regulations, evaluate opportunities, access resources and find a land match partner.The BCLMP is part of Grow BC, a mandate commitment of the Ministry of Agriculture that supports young farmers and food producers seeking a career in agriculture and addresses major challenges for new farmers, such as gaining access to land. The program is also part of the Province’s larger New Entrant Strategy, a framework for increasing the number of new and young farmers working in B.C.’s agriculture sector.Quotes:Darcy Smith, program manager, BCLMP – “Land access is essential to growing the next generation of farmers in British Columbia. Whether someone is starting their first farm business or expanding, the BCLMP provides the support farmers need to find suitable land and develop mutually beneficial agreements with farmland owners. We hear from the farmers and farmland owners we work with how much it helps to have a land matcher to guide them through the process. It’s going to take everyone to build a healthy future food system and Young Agrarians is thrilled to be a part of that journey.”Sara Dent, executive director, Young Agrarians –  “Land matching programs are relatively new in Canada and support new farmers to find affordable land to start their businesses. We are very excited to be able to grow this type of program in British Columbia. We have made many matches to date. The larger impacts are the hundreds of landholders and new farmers reached annually who are now in a better position to provide or access land in the coming years.”Stuart Oke, youth president, National Farmers Union – “The B.C. Land Matching Program is playing a critical role in helping to address one of the most significant barriers facing new farmers today – access to land. As a worsening climate and rising land prices create further obstacles for farmers, it’s programs like this one that will help to address serious gaps in our food system and provide a clear path for young farmers, as well as help to ensure our food system into the future. It would be wonderful to see other provinces follow the example that British Columbia has set in supporting the next generation of farmers.”Quick Facts: 90% of the matches arranged through the program are in regions with high real estate prices, including Metro Vancouver, the Fraser Valley, Vancouver Island and the Okanagan. The total number of matches (81) made in B.C.: Metro Vancouver/Fraser Valley: 26 Vancouver Island: 24 Okanagan: 21 Columbia Basin: 6 Central and northern B.C.: 4  The new businesses are farming a range of agricultural products, including mixed vegetables, sheep, goats, cattle, grain, hay, flowers, berries, eggs, tree fruits, buffalo dairy, honey, medicinal herbs and mushrooms.

It also offers outpatient services including a mood disorder clinic, expanded clinics for adolescent psychiatry, reproductive psychiatry and psychiatric urgent referral, as well as group therapy and neuropsychology clinics. Fraser Health is taking a phased approach to opening the new centre, which began with the opening to outpatients on July 13, 2020.To support people living with substance-use challenges, the centre will provide expanded addiction services through a new addictions medicine and substance-use clinic.“Today marks a very important step in and an equally important milestone in bolstering services for people across our region who are living with mental health and substance-use concerns,” said Dr. Victoria Lee, president and CEO, Fraser Health. “Our Mental Health and Substance Use Wellness Centre will expand our capacity in-hospital, but will also ensure much-needed outpatient services are available to people who need them now and in the years to come.”The Mental Health and Substance Use Wellness Centre will also be home to a new electroconvulsive therapy clinic that will provide people with access to neurostimulation, a treatment that uses electrical signals to provide relief to patients affected by neurologic and psychiatric disorders, as well as chronic pain. The centre will be the new regional site for this service.In addition, the centre is the first in the Fraser Health region to offer a specialized unit for seniors dealing with acute depression, anxiety or psychosis. The centre was built using a patient-centred design that had input from patients, families, psychiatrists and clinicians.“Our donors can look with pride at the realization of a grand vision that dates back to the 1990s when the foundation purchased the land on which this important new centre was built,” said Jeff Norris, president and CEO, Royal Columbian Hospital Foundation. “In recent years, hundreds of donors have generously come forward to contribute to the project, led by BMO Financial Group's $1 million gift towards mental health.”The new centre is an inviting, spacious and therapeutic sanctuary where patients can feel safe, respected and supported in their recovery. The centre features plenty of windows and natural light. To further support a diverse and culturally safe environment, First Nations artwork will help create a calming and welcoming environment for patients while they recover.Inpatient units at the centre include spaces for patients to be social, spaces to spend time alone, a lounge for visiting with family, friends and other patients, a secure outdoor patio and an exercise room. All of the patient rooms are private spaces with ensuite bathrooms.“Since I was a teenager I have struggled with severe depression and disordered eating. Having access to these services then likely would have helped prevent me from struggling with addiction later on in my life,” said Savanna Mak, a young woman with lived experience. “I was lucky enough to find a mood disorder clinic in my early 20s, which finally got me the help I needed.

The large number of people who attend traffic court and the number of cases that are heard required larger sites to permit social distancing requirements to be met. With the assistance of the Court Services Branch and B.C. Sheriff Services, traffic court hearings are now proceeding at staggered times at alternative locations, including the University of Victoria, the University of the Fraser Valley, Kwantlen Polytechnic University and some secondary schools throughout the province. In other locations, such as Kelowna and Fort St. John, these hearings are occurring on evenings and weekends when there are fewer people in the courthouses. “The public health measures that have restricted access to physical courtrooms during the past few months have created a tremendous challenge for the judiciary, the legal profession and court services staff,” Eby said. “Using non-traditional locations for hearings, exploring ways for remote hearings and diversion out of court, and making technology more available – including basic technology like conference-style phones and high-speed internet – are all helping us support our judges to do the job they are constitutionally required to do.”B.C.’s courts are now using enhanced cleaning, new courtroom layouts, physical distancing protocols and verbal health screening prior to entry.“I am grateful to the judiciary, our Court Services Branch, the B.C. Sheriff Services, registry staff and the cleaning teams for their vital roles in protecting the safety of court users and ensuring the smooth running of court operations during this unusual time,” Eby said. “In addition to their regular security and escort duties, they have risen to the unique challenges of this pandemic and are key to keeping our courts open and operating as efficiently as possible.”Learn More:For more information on B.C.’s courts: https://www.bccourts.ca/    "

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to many of them facing financial challenges due to the absence of registration fees, event revenues and sponsorships. The Province is providing $1.5 million to help local sport organizations with fixed costs during the pandemic.“We want people of all ages, backgrounds and levels of ability to be able to gain the physical and mental benefits sport offers,” said Lisa Beare, Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture. “People in the sport community have felt the effects of COVID-19 profoundly. This funding will help local organizations pay their bills and keep our communities active.”Without support for local organizations that allows them to stay established in their communities, people would have reduced access to sport. This access could take up to two years to rebuild. Rural and remote communities, as well as underrepresented populations – such as Indigenous peoples, girls and women, low-income individuals, persons with disabilities and newcomers – are disproportionately affected by a reduction in physical activity opportunities as a result of COVID-19.“Many amateur sport clubs in British Columbia are volunteer based and rely on membership fees, events, tournaments and competitions to fund sport activities in their communities,” said Charlene Krepiakevich, CEO, viaSport. “COVID-19 has especially impacted their ability to do that. This funding will help local clubs at the most financial risk to maintain operations until, and as, their communities and facilities can slowly reopen.”Canadian Heritage is also investing $3.4 million in sports organizations in British Columbia. The funding is part of the $72-million COVID-19 Emergency Support Fund for Cultural, Heritage and Sport Organizations and will benefit B.C.’s provincial, disability and multi-sport organizations. Funding will be distributed through viaSport to ensure support is provided across the sport sector.“This funding is great news for sports clubs in communities all over B.C.,” said Marty Hall, president and coach, Carnarvon Baseball. “Sport is good for everyone’s health and wellness and is a source of fun for so many children.”Quick Facts:  As of July 27, 2020, 54 sport-specific plans to rebound from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic had been completed by provincial sport organizations. 50 of those are summer and fall sports. Organizations are ready to welcome participants back to activities safely, meaning more than 500,000 British Columbians are able to return to sport.  Local sports organizations include baseball and soccer teams, gymnastics and swimming. As of April 2020, the Province, through viaSport, provided $10.5 million in accelerated funding to provincial, disability and multi-sport organizations. The Province has extended legal protection to amateur sport organizations, many of which are run by volunteers, so they cannot be held liable for damages caused by exposure to COVID-19.

We have doubled the pace of seismic project approvals compared to the last government.”Since September 2017, the Province has announced over $325 million for seismic upgrades or replacements at 12 Vancouver schools, creating nearly 7,000 safer student seats in the district.The following six seismic projects are now under construction at Vancouver schools: General Wolfe Elementary – seismic upgrade (expected completion fall 2021) Sir Matthew Begbie Elementary – seismic replacement (expected completion winter 2021-22) Bayview Elementary – seismic replacement (expected completion winter 2021-22) Lord Byng Secondary – seismic upgrade (expected completion fall 2021) Lord Selkirk Elementary – seismic upgrade (expected completion spring 2021) Chief Maquinna Elementary – seismic upgrade (expected completion fall 2021) These investments to improve learning environments for Vancouver students are part of government’s plan to ensure every student is learning in a seismically safe school.When the seismic projects at these schools are complete, thousands of youth will learn in improved facilities that will keep students, teachers and staff safe, while providing a better learning experience.“The progress on these projects brings us closer to our goal of having all students in seismically safe schools as soon as possible,” said Janet Fraser, chair, Vancouver School Board. “We are also glad these buildings will serve the school and local communities in years to come.”In addition to bringing safer learning spaces to students, the Province is also taking the opportunity to work with the Vancouver School Board and the City of Vancouver to invest in new early learning spaces on school grounds. Through investments from the Childcare BC plan, there are 3,134 new child care spaces coming to Vancouver schools.“As the mother of a six year old, I know how hard it can be to find child care. That’s why I was so proud when our government introduced legislative changes that make it easier for school boards to create and operate child care spaces,” said Katrina Chen, Minister of State for Child Care. “Having child care on school grounds helps busy families with pickups and drop-offs and can help young children develop a lifelong appreciation for learning.” Quotes:George Heyman, MLA for Vancouver-Fairview –“People in our community are so excited to see construction underway to ensure General Wolfe Elementary is a safe place to learn, play and grow. This school has been a true hub for the neighbourhood, and this project will ensure the school can continue to benefit our community for decades to come.”Shane Simpson, MLA for Vancouver-Hastings –“Sir Matthew Begbie and Chief Maquinna elementary schools have been staples of community life in East Vancouver for generations. And while we’ll miss the original Begbie building, it’s time to give students and families the modern learning facility they deserve. I look forward to the day when we’ll see smiling faces walking through the doors of seismically safe schools.”David Eby, MLA for Vancouver-Point Grey –“A safer place to learn will mean a better place to learn for students at an upgraded Lord Byng Secondary school and a brand-new Bayview Elementary school. These are projects that people in our community have been waiting for, and will ensure everyone who makes use of these schools will be protected if an earthquake were to hit – a comfort that we all deserve.”Melanie Mark, MLA for Vancouver-Mount Pleasant –“This long-overdue upgrade will give parents the comfort of knowing their children will be protected at their local school in the event of an earthquake. Lord Selkirk's building upgrade will give students and their families the peace of mind needed for students to safely learn, play and grow.”Quick Facts: The Province is committed to providing safe, positive learning spaces to B.C. students, no matter where they live. In the last three years, the Province has invested over $2 billion for school capital projects throughout the Province, including $1 billion for seismic upgrades at 47 B.C. schools, creating nearly 26,000 safe student seats.

E-bikes are a much cheaper alternative to cars and are a safe way to travel. We look forward to seeing more people using e-bikes for getting around.”People who trade in a vehicle to scrap now have access to a rebate of $1,050 toward the purchase of any type of new e-bike — an increase of $200 from the previous year. The rebate is delivered through the Scrap-It transportation options program. The ministries of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources, and Transportation and Infrastructure are providing $1,000 toward the rebate, with participating retailers providing the remaining $50.In addition, the Province is introducing a one-year pilot project that enables a rebate of up to $1,700 for business owners toward the purchase of a cargo e-bike. This will provide eligible businesses with up to one-third of the purchase price. Businesses may purchase up to five cargo e-bikes through this program.Cargo e-bikes are particularly efficient in delivering materials and goods around the community in a way that reduces operating costs for businesses. They also help reduce large van and truck traffic, and emissions from the movement of goods in community centres.“Through CleanBC, we are helping British Columbians to make the switch to cleaner transportation options,” said Bruce Ralston, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources. “With access to increased rebates, e-bikes are now more affordable than ever in B.C., which will reduce climate pollution and put us on the road to a clean energy future.”The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure is contributing $750,000 toward the two e-bike rebates over two years. The Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources has contributed $750,000 toward the Scrap-It program and $2.5 million toward the Specialty-Use Vehicle Incentive Program.Exploring more ways to support increased e-bike usage for people and businesses are commitments the ministry introduced in Move. Commute. Connect., B.C.’s Active Transportation Strategy. The strategy is part of CleanBC, a plan to help transform how people move around while also encouraging more active transportation in communities.“People in British Columbia are leading the way in switching to clean transportation options. This CleanBC rebate program increases access to more active ways to get around,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “As more people get interested in active transportation, e-bikes are more popular than ever because they are easier for many people concerned about long commutes and hilly areas. Getting people out of vehicles and onto e-bikes reduces emissions, takes old and inefficient vehicles off the road and continues the shift to healthy, more climate-friendly transportation options for residents and businesses across our province.”CleanBC is a pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. CleanBC was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus and independent MLA Andrew Weaver, and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s emission targets.Quick Fact: The additional rebates through the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure are available until summer 2021.

The project will offer studio, one-bedroom, two-bedroom and three-bedroom homes. The project will include ground floor commercial space, which will be leased by the Vancouver Island School of Art.“Everyone deserves a good home,” said Lisa Helps, mayor, City of Victoria. “We’re grateful for the Province’s creativity in partnering with the private sector to help us reach our goal of creating more affordable rental homes in Victoria. I’m excited to see the vibrancy this project will add to the neighbourhood by bringing much-needed rental housing for individuals and families and supporting a beloved community arts school to also have a new home.”The project is being built in partnership with Aryze Developments through BC Housing’s HousingHub program. The HousingHub was created in 2018 and works with community, government, non-profit and private-sector partners to help create new affordable rental housing and homeownership options for middle-income British Columbians.“This project is the embodiment of our belief that every neighbourhood should have diverse housing types and tenures for all incomes and demographics,” said Luke Mari, principal, Aryze Developments. “A densified, compact, walkable lifestyle is critical to solving our climate and housing crises, all while creating more liveable and healthier communities.”Construction is expected to be complete in spring 2021.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts: The Province, through the HousingHub, is providing interim construction financing of up to $17.2 million for this project in Victoria. Rents for the homes will be: studio: approximately $1,000 to $1,215 per month one bedroom: approximately $1,375 to $1,440 per month two bedrooms: approximately $2,000 to $2,145 per month three bedrooms: approximately $1,125 to $2,500 per month  Including these 64 homes, the Province is working in partnership to build more than 3,400 new affordable homes for people with a range of incomes in the Capital Regional District.

The body of an older Caucasian female was later recovered. Post-mortem investigations determined that the woman, believed to be between the ages of 55 and 70, had drowned.Other physical details are as follows: Caucasian female: 170 cm (5'6"") in height; blue eyes with recently dyed blond hair; and two notable scars on the abdomen, including a 12.7cm (5"") vertical scar (mid-abdomen) and a 5cm (2"") lateral scar on the right side of the abdomen (her appendix had been previously removed); upper row of teeth replaced by dentures and lower row of teeth missing; and severe curving of the spine, consistent with scoliosis. At the time of her death, she was wearing maroon pants (size 16, Sears brand), a long-sleeved black button-up blouse over a white turtleneck, a green wool vest with brown buttons, a grey wool winter hip-length coat and white dress gloves. The woman wore black zippered rubber boots.

These new housing units are great news for students and will help take some pressure off the local rental market.”Premier Horgan was joined by Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training; and Gayle Gorrill, vice-president of finance and operations, UVic, on behalf of Jamie Cassels, president, UVic; in a groundbreaking on campus where the two new student housing facilities and a dining hall will be located.“Today, we are celebrating an important milestone for students at UVic and fulfilling our government’s commitment to build 5,000 new student housing units across the province,” Mark said. “After years of neglect and calculated inaction on this file by the previous government, I am proud to say that this new state-of-the-art sustainable student housing project is ahead of schedule and soon nearly 800 students will have an affordable place to call home.”Amenities will include: 783 beds, including 621 new beds and 162 replacement beds; a 600-seat dining hall, commercial kitchen, small grocery and new coffee shop to replace Cadboro Commons and provide more food offerings with healthy options; and a wide range of meeting rooms, informal gathering places, classrooms and a designated Indigenous student lounge. A rejuvenated outdoor area will connect the new housing and dining hall to the centre of campus. Other amenities include student group and study spaces, communal social spaces, laundry facilities and secure indoor bicycle storage.A temporary 500-seat modular dining facility will be operational from September 2020 to July 2022 for students while the new dining hall is under construction. The new hall is expected to open in 2022.“With 75% of our students arriving from outside Greater Victoria, it has long been a strategic priority for UVic to provide more on-campus housing,” Gorrill said. “Living on campus contributes to the educational experience and success of our students, and we are grateful this project will provide a welcoming home away from home.”Construction of these new facilities meets LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Gold and Passive House standards – the most rigorous global building standards for sustainability and energy efficiency – supporting government’s CleanBC initiative.This is the first major capital project at UVic since a new Campus Plan was completed in January 2016.CleanBC is a shared priority between government, the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and supports a commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s targets.Quotes:Rob Fleming, Minister of Education –“Not only is this project creating important affordable housing for UVic students, it’s also easing rental pressure on the housing market in our region. I’m excited to get these units built and for the community to benefit from our government’s action on this long-standing issue.”Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head –“I'm thrilled to see these long overdue student housing projects take shape at UVic. Given that these new buildings will meet both Passive House and LEED Gold standards, UVic and the Province are showing their commitment to innovative low-carbon solutions. I look forward to these new buildings being models for other educational construction projects in the years ahead.”Alyssa Husband, fifth-year student, faculty of education, UVic –“Living on campus is the perfect place to become involved in campus culture, find a community of like-minded students only steps from your door and ease the transition into university life. Looking back on my first year, there were so many new experiences and opportunities I hadn’t even imagined. I’m so glad I made the decision to live in residence and be a part of the UVic community right off the bat. With more housing options right on campus, I know future students will have a great experience at UVic.”Quick Facts: UVic has approximately 22,000 students with 75% attending from outside the Greater Victoria area. The Emily Carr, Margaret Newton and Cadboro Commons buildings are being deconstructed to accommodate the new student housing and dining hall. The Province is providing $128 million towards the total cost of $232.4 million – $98 million from the Student Housing Initiative for the beds and a separate loan of $25 million toward half the cost of the dining hall. The remaining $5.2 million will be provided as a capital grant. Post-secondary institutions are expected to self-finance about 25% of costs with loans repaid through rental income. This project’s completion date was shortened by one year to fall 2023 as a result of establishing a temporary dining hall, allowing for decommissioning and construction to begin more quickly.

Extracurricular instruction in activities like piano, violin and martial arts will be provided at the centre through community partnerships.“We value the importance of early-years development and foresee the need to have a program that helps to not only educate parents and guardians, but to be part of the difference we are making as early childhood educators in such a critical time,” said Cherry Chen, CEO, Harrow House Academy. “We believe that the provincial funding will be a helpful resource in building a safe and meaningful space where the children will receive the best possible care through our child-centred programming.”In addition, the Steveston Society of Children’s Centres is receiving funding for Alderwood House School London to create 10 new spaces for children aged three years to kindergarten, starting in September 2020. Alderwood House is a universal prototype site that is outdoor-based, with educators and children spending four to nine hours outside each day. The centre will utilize various community partnerships in their programming, like the Richmond Community Garden, Steveston Library, Britannia Heritage Shipyard and the London Farm Heritage Society.“Alderwood House School is excited to be able to expand our program to include a 20-student, parent-participation preschool program,” said Pamela Wallberg, curriculum co-ordinator. “This program will continue to offer our social-emotional, rights-based programming in a nature-based environment, while also providing an early learning environment for children together with their parents. Creating a sense of community and finding authentic ways for parents to participate within early learning programs is an essential step toward providing family-first child care programs.”July 2020 marks the second anniversary of the launch of the New Spaces Fund, which has approved an average of 700 new spaces for funding each month. So far, nearly 16,800 new spaces have been funded throughout the province, helping parents return to work, go back to school or pursue other opportunities. “As a former early childhood educator, I know that quality child care makes a huge difference to families, allowing parents to go back to work or school and benefiting local economies in every part of B.C.,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “I’m proud of the progress our government has made in a short time. By funding over 16,000 child care spaces across the province, our Childcare BC plan is saving parents time and money and helping children along the path to lifelong learning.” These new spaces are part of the fastest creation of child care spaces in B.C.’s history. An additional 4,100 spaces, funded through the 2017 Budget Update and the Early Learning and Child Care agreement with the Government of Canada, means that more than 20,900 new licensed spaces have been funded since July 2017.Investing in child care and early childhood education is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts: This investment means 728 new licensed child care spaces have been funded in Richmond since July 2018.

Public safety was the top priority in making this decision.The KV-061 trestle is located about seven kilometres north of Tulameen and is part of The Great Trail (formerly known as the Trans-Canada Trail). Inspections completed by an independent engineering firm identified structural issues with the trestle (bridge), including broken and decaying support structures. It is not safe for anyone to use the bridge in its deteriorated state, including off-road vehicle operators, hikers and cyclists.Signs will be posted to direct hikers and cyclists to an eight-kilometre detour that will allow them to bypass the closed trestle and enjoy the rest of the route. Since the detour runs alongside a road, all-terrain vehicles will have to access the trail from the community of Tulameen, or off Coalmont Road near Frembd Lake.Ministry engineering staff are evaluating all available options to replace the trestle with a new bridge, but it is unlikely that a replacement would be completed before next year. The ministry assessed options for making a temporary repair to the trestle and determined that it was not feasible.Recreation Sites and Trails BC staff have notified recreational user groups and the Regional District of Okanagan-Similkameen about the closure and will be posting signs to help trail users stay safe.Learn More:Recreation Sites and Trails BC: http://www.sitesandtrailsbc.ca/    "

Of the 13 people who have tested positive, one person has recovered and 12 are active cases. At this time cases are all local residents. While the initial source of transmission is still being investigated, the cases are all epidemiologically linked. Some are related residents who had recently travelled off island, and others are from exposure to known cases.“There also continues to be additional community exposure events throughout the province, including at Fossello’s clothing store in Kelowna. A full listing of community exposure events for each health authority is available through the BC Centre for Disease Control, as well as on health authority websites.“Public health teams are requesting the assistance of anyone who may have been exposed through community exposure to monitor themselves closely for symptoms, minimize time spent with others and get tested promptly if any symptoms arise.“As we all enjoy our summer, we can reduce the potential for COVID-19 to spread by taking the time to assess the risks before spending time with others.“Can you keep a safe distance from others? Are you giving people the space to stay safe? Are you spending a short time together? Are you outside? Are the people you are with in your bubble? These are the questions we all need to ask ourselves.“If you can’t say yes to these questions, then say no to the activity and choose to do something else instead.“In the coming days, a new provincial health officer order will be in place to limit the number of people who can stay at and visit short-term rental accommodations and boat rentals. Whether at home or renting, keeping our groups small will keep all of us safe.“Similar to the case in restaurants, the number of people will be determined by the size of the space to ensure safe social interactions for everyone.“This weekend, be mindful of where you are going and who you are seeing, assess your own risks and take steps to protect yourself and those you care for most.

Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act, which requires government to take all measures necessary to ensure the laws of B.C. are consistent with the standards set out in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, will form a key component of the anti-racism strategy moving forward.“It is our hope that the work we are beginning now will have a lasting impact for generations to come.”    "

I know how much time and effort goes into the planning process,” said Lisa Beare, Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture. “Although the Games did not take place, we are proud to ensure that the work to prepare is not lost and the sport, arts and community organizations in Maple Ridge can benefit from the legacy funding.”Alison Noble, president and CEO, BC Games Society, said, “We are very pleased that Maple Ridge will benefit from a BC Games legacy. This funding will allow for a lasting positive impact in the community and is an acknowledgement of the tremendous work that the volunteers had put into the planning of what would have been a very successful BC Summer Games.”The Province and BC Games Society are also announcing the unveiling of the Karina LeBlanc Game Changer Award. The award will recognize a local athlete or young volunteer living in the Games’ host community who has demonstrated commitment to breaking down barriers and providing people with opportunities to participate in sport. The first award will be presented in the fall.LeBlanc is a retired Olympic bronze medallist and professional athlete. She had a prestigious career in soccer that spanned almost 18 years at the international level, participated in five FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) World Cups and two Olympic Games.“I’m honoured to have this award created in my name and to see more people recognizing and working hard to remove barriers in sport,” LeBlanc said. “For me, sport has been a game changer in my life to be the woman I am today, and I want sport to be that opportunity for others. When we make sport more accessible to people from all walks of life, everyone wins.”Bob D’Eith, MLA for Maple Ridge-Mission, said, “The BC Summer Games are a landmark event in our province and I know the volunteers, athletes and others in Maple Ridge were looking forward to hosting the games this summer. This legacy funding invests not only in local infrastructure but in the people and families who call this community home and will provide benefits for years to come.”The BC Games brings valuable competitive opportunities for British Columbia’s best young athletes, develops coaches and officials, helps volunteers gain valuable skills, attracts local tourism and provides direct economic benefits to the host community.   Quick Facts: The Province invests close to $50 million in sport annually, including $2 million to the BC Games Society to support the BC Summer Games and BC Winter Games, and to prepare for Team BC participation at the Canada Games.

406,2020-07-24 10:30:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020EDUC0051-001372,Government Website,New community roundtable to tackle racism in B.C. schools,"  A new Community Roundtable on Anti-Racism in education has been created to support the development of an anti-racism action plan and to strengthen the K–12 curriculum, ensuring the culture, beliefs and ancestry of all students and staff are accepted, celebrated and understood.“There is no place for racism, discrimination or intolerance in British Columbia – in our schools or anywhere else,” said Premier John Horgan. “We are bringing important voices to the table to help us bolster culture-based learning in the education system and build a better and more inclusive future for B.C.”Rob Fleming, Minister of Education, has brought together community leaders from a wide range of groups to better understand the impact of racism on B.C. students and provide input into strengthening and developing new policies and programs that promote anti-racism. The roundtable held its first meeting on Friday, July 24, 2020, and will continue to meet as the action plan is developed.“Now is the time to listen, learn, engage and act,” Fleming said. “We are committed to working with community and education partners to build a meaningful and lasting anti-racism action plan to ensure schools are safe and welcoming places where diversity is celebrated.”This is the first in a series of conversations to guide the ministry and B.C. education partners in understanding barriers faced by Indigenous students and students of colour. Fleming has asked the First Nations Leadership Council, the First Nations Education Steering Committee and Métis Nation BC to help set up a distinct Indigenous table and co-develop its approach. A new student advisory group will also be formed in the fall to hear directly from students on their experiences.“Through this roundtable, we are hopeful for a more inclusive tomorrow by supporting students, families and educators today,” said Anne Kang, Minister of Citizens’ Services and responsible for Multiculturalism. “By listening and learning from the experiences of others we can all work together to build an environment that is understanding and respectful of our differences.”The Community Roundtable on Anti-Racism in education builds on a series of community dialogues led by Ravi Kahlon, former parliamentary secretary for sport and multiculturalism, last summer. The feedback from these meetings informed the development of Resilience BC, a provincewide anti-racism network announced in November 2019. The network connects communities with the information, supports and training they need to respond to and prevent future incidents of racism and hate at a local and regional level. Resilience BC is being established in 40 communities.Quotes:Silvia Mangue Alene, president, BC Black History Awareness Society –“We are pleased to be working with the Ministry of Education to address racism in our schools. We’ve been advocating for this for many years now, and this roundtable is an important first step towards bringing the experiences and history of Black Canadians into our classrooms. We believe strongly that education about people and other people’s culture really reduces racism and prejudice.”Tyrone McNeil, president, First Nations Education Steering Committee –“Recent events demonstrate the imperative for concrete measures to address racism in our society and the responsibility of the Province to act. By including a mandatory course on First Peoples as part of B.C.’s K-12 graduation requirements, we can ensure that every student graduates with an understanding of First Peoples’ perspectives, cultures, and histories. This is a widely supported measure that will contribute to significant change in the province.”Stephanie Higginson, president, BC School Trustees Association (BCSTA) –“These conversations are necessary and long overdue. Developing an anti-racism action plan for B.C. is an important step in ensuring all students feel safe and welcome in our schools.  I am pleased that Minister Fleming is moving forward with this important initiative and that the ministry is committed to listening and learning from all voices in our province. Most importantly, BCSTA looks forward to working shoulder to shoulder with education stakeholders and rights holders to move from conversations to action.”Teri Mooring, president, BC Teachers’ Federation –“Confronting racism in our schools and society is important work. All students will benefit from an enhanced focus on antiracism in the K–12 curriculum. We are very happy to contribute to this important initiative.”Paul Faoro, president, CUPE BC –“I want to thank Premier Horgan and ministers Fleming and Kang for showing provincial leadership on this incredibly important issue. I also want to thank MLA Kahlon for his work leading last year’s community dialogues on racism. There is no place for racism in our society, full stop, yet racism still exists. We must fight it wherever we find it, but we must also redouble our efforts to ensure that all education partners work harder than ever to ensure schools are inclusive, welcoming places for all students and staff.”Quick Facts: All of B.C.’s 60 school districts and independent schools have codes of conduct or policies in place that align with the BC Human Rights Code to ensure schools remain free of discrimination against a person based on race, colour, ancestry, place of origin, religion, marital status, family status, physical or mental disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or age of that person or class of persons. The provincial ERASE (expect respect and a safe education) strategy is a comprehensive prevention and intervention strategy designed to foster school connectedness, address bullying, prevent violence and provide support to school districts during critical incidents. ERASE’s online reporting tool has recently expanded to include a category for reporting incidents of racism and discrimination. Indigenous knowledge and perspectives are woven into B.C.’s new curriculum. Several new Indigenous-focused courses are offered as part of the new B.C. Graduation Program, including Contemporary Indigenous Studies 12, B.C. First Peoples 12, and expanded course options for English First Peoples 10 through 12.  In 2019, government provided $3.1 million for Indigenous teacher training programs to ensure B.C. has more teachers trained to bring Indigenous perspectives into classrooms.

Dan’s Legacy expects to work with 350 at-risk youth in 2020.“Youth at risk who are struggling with mental health and addictions challenges should not have to knock on one door after another to find the help they need,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “Our government is working hard to build a full continuum of care for all British Columbians, which includes vital counselling services. I’m so pleased that this funding will help connect youth to a therapist when they are ready, so they can continue on their pathway to healing and hope.”Funding will be used to improve access to the foundation’s trauma-informed and culturally sensitive counselling services. The services are holistic and combine cognitive behaviour therapy, dialectical behaviour therapy and mindfulness. They also include life-skills workshops on self-regulation, such as diet, exercise and positive thinking. “We’re working hard to ensure that youth who struggle with mental health and addictions have access to safe and inclusive counselling services, including those through Dan’s Legacy,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “We want young people to know it is okay to not be okay, and that when they’re ready, there are supports available to help them get back on their feet and build the future they want and deserve.”Expanding counselling services is an integral part of A Pathway to Hope, B.C.’s roadmap for making mental health and addictions care better for people in British Columbia. Implementing A Pathway to Hope is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:            Barbara Coates, executive director, Dan’s Legacy Foundation — “Dan’s Legacy is deeply grateful for the continued financial assistance of the Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions. Minister Darcy has been unwavering in her support, knowing that funds directed to harm prevention programs like ours have a significant and measurable impact. We routinely see a 50% success rate in helping youth to stabilize after only four months of counselling intervention, reducing the likelihood of life-long mental health issues, justice involvement, entrenched addiction, overdose and suicide.”Amy Woodward, youth, Dan’s Legacy Foundation — “Dan's Legacy is the best place ever. You can get mental health counselling, drug counselling – they even have training to help you get a job. It is the best thing you can ever have. I give it five stars. Everyone should find a way to get help through Dan's Legacy.”Learn More:A Pathway to Hope: https://bit.ly/33HyFHyDan’s Legacy Foundation: https://danslegacy.com/    "

Canada's Infrastructure plan invests in thousands of projects, creates jobs across the country and builds stronger communities.”To ease congestion, especially during peak periods, 3.6 kilometres of Highway 7 have been widened from two to four lanes, and median barrier has been added between Silverdale Avenue and Nelson Street. The upgrades bring relief to approximately 20,000 drivers who travel this section of Highway 7 daily. The upgrade includes a turnaround at Silverdale Avenue to accommodate eastbound drivers needing to head back west.“By widening Highway 7 to four lanes in this area, we're removing one of the last bottlenecks on the western approach to Mission,” said Bob D’Eith, MLA for Maple Ridge-Mission, on behalf of Claire Trevena, B.C.’s Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “With less congestion and a safer highway, we're making life better for people who live and work on the north side of the Fraser River between Maple Ridge and Mission.”This project is part of $70 million in safety and capacity improvements for Highway 7 through Pitt Meadows, Maple Ridge and Mission, cost shared between the provincial and federal governments. The Government of Canada is contributing up to $22.45 million and the Province is supplying the remaining $47.55 million.Learn More:Drone video of the project is available online: https://youtu.be/PBX_vpqalH8Information on the project is available online: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation/transportation-infrastructure/projects/highway7-nelson-silverdale    "

In total, one long-term care facility and two acute-care facilities have active outbreaks.“There are several community exposure events and one active community outbreak. Public health teams are actively contact tracing and requesting the assistance of anyone who may have been exposed to monitor themselves closely and follow public health guidance.“COVID-19 can be a stealthy virus, silently moving around our province with far-reaching impacts and serious consequences.“Outside or inside, visiting a friend or out for dinner, being around crowds of people, especially those you do not know, puts you at risk.“Rather, keep your groups small and spend time only with those you know. Use the layers of protection to keep yourself and those you care for safe.“Use the restaurant requirement of no more than six people as your guidance for your other social activities.“If you are faced with a large crowd, choose another spot to spend time with your friends.“You can protect your household bubble, your family and close friends by being mindful of those around you and giving each other the space to stay safe.“Everyone deserves a fun and safe summer, yet over 1,000 people in every health authority throughout our province are now self-isolating – many because they are connected to the Kelowna community exposure. They have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and are at high risk.  “These British Columbians have had to close their businesses or miss work, isolate from their family and friends, and not leave their home unless it is to get medical care.“As this community exposure has shown us, the actions of a few can affect many.“Yet we can take confidence in knowing that here in British Columbia, we know what we need to do to turn this around and bend our curve back down.“Be the voice of compassion.

Once the supportive housing project is complete and the bridge housing residents have moved in, BC Housing will consult with the community about redeveloping the Rose Bowl site into an affordable housing project.“We have been working closely with BC Housing for a number of years to establish a fully managed facility like this, with services that will be key for people wanting to commit to stable housing and get the assistance that will make such a huge difference in their lives,” said Andy Adams, mayor, Campbell River. “The city’s close partnership with BC Housing has already helped provide a range of much-needed housing options for people in our community. We recognize this benefits our entire community and are extremely grateful to BC Housing and the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing for their ongoing commitment as we work together to support vulnerable people.” The Vancouver Island Mental Health Society will operate both the bridge housing and the supportive housing building when it’s completed. Society staff will be onsite 24/7 and will provide guests with outreach services, such as daily living skills training and meal preparation, as well as referral to health services.“We are pleased to work with the Province and BC Housing to operate the supportive housing project in Campbell River,” said Taryn O’Flanagan, executive director, Vancouver Island Mental Health Society. “As an organization, we have seen a significant need for long-term supportive housing in this community and we feel fortunate that the Province has recognized and supported this project.”Approximately half of the people experiencing homelessness in Campbell River identify as Indigenous.

The City of Campbell River is providing $855,000 in equity contributions and waivers to the project. BC Housing is entering into a long-term lease agreement with the City of Campbell River for the project site. In addition to this project, the Province is working in partnership to deliver close to 120 new affordable homes for people in Campbell River: 41 homes at the recently purchased Heritage Inn for people who were displaced by the fire at the Pacific West complex; 27 homes for people with low to moderate incomes, including those with brain injuries and their families, at the recently opened Linda’s Place project; and 49 homes for women and children leaving violence.

It will also help improve cyclists’ safety by making drivers more aware of their actions.  “With cycling and other modes of active transportation becoming more popular, it’s important to have the right policies in place for people to safely commute and get around in our province,” said Spencer Chandra Herbert, MLA for Vancouver-West End. “Dooring can kill or severely injure a person. Making the offence of dooring equivalent to distracted driving and excessive speeding offences in terms of the fine is another necessary step to help keep our most vulnerable road users safe.”Bowinn Ma, MLA for North Vancouver-Lonsdale, whose community suffered a death in 2019 as a result of dooring, said, “It is enormously dangerous to carelessly open a door into the pathway of a person moving on a bike. This increased fine sends a strong signal of the level of accountability that is expected of people who are operating a vehicle, even when the engine is off.”Working towards Vision Zero, a strategy to eliminate all traffic fatalities and severe injuries, while increasing safe, healthy and equitable mobility for everyone, is a goal set out in Move. Commute. Connect. – B.C.’s strategy for cleaner, more active transportation.  Education and enforcement, along with the construction of high-quality active transportation infrastructure, will increase road user safety and comfort.“Increasing the amount of the fine for dooring is a positive step forward in reforming our outdated Motor Vehicle Act,” said Navdeep Chhina, acting executive director, HUB Cycling. “We must continue to make our roads safer by building safer infrastructure and increasing fines for motorist negligence risking injury or death of vulnerable road uses, as well as for aggressive driving, harassment of people cycling and walking, and for theft or tampering with bicycles.”This change in the dooring fine complements the objectives of government’s CleanBC plan, as it helps to provide encouragement of safe active transportation for all ages and abilities. CleanBC is a pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. CleanBC was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s emission targets.Quick Facts: B.C. has the highest percentage of active transportation trips for commuting to work out of all the provinces. In 2019, 10% of people who commuted to work in the province used active transportation. 33% of school-age children primarily used active transportation, and 8% of all college and university students commuted using active modes of transportation. B.C.’s Active Transportation Strategy seeks to double the percentage of trips taken by active transportation by 2030.

Our commitment helps ensure that agriculture learning is accessible to all youth throughout B.C.”Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 4-H BC is adapting its Food for Thought conference into a series of six one-day agriculture awareness programs for 4-H members who are age 14 to 15 years. The organization is offering virtual farm tours and agriculture presentations for small groups this summer in Abbotsford, Rock Creek, Kamloops, Williams Lake, Vanderhoof and Saanich.“Throughout the province of B.C., the support from the Ministry of Agriculture has enabled youth to experience the benefits of the 4-H program, broadening their knowledge of the agriculture industry,” said Aleda Welch, manager, 4-H British Columbia. “This support assists 4-H BC provincial council to offer a strong 4-H program that continues to contribute significantly to the future competitiveness of the agriculture industry by educating and nurturing future leaders for our communities.”Over the next year, the B.C. government is committing $153,000 to 4-H BC, including: annual financial commitment to 4-H BC: $87,000 youth farm safety and outreach program to support underrepresented groups: $63,000 a Buy BC 4-H BC Instagram contest that encourages 4-H members to celebrate B.C. products on social media: $3,000 During the pandemic, Ministry of Agriculture youth development staff have continued to work with 4-H club leadership, members and volunteers by providing guidance in organizational management, agriculture and community leadership education.

The grant will allow TCF to ship the ground waste wood to Skeena Bioenergy’s new pellet plant in Terrace, where it will be used to manufacture wood pellets.“One of the Forest Enhancement Society of BC’s goals is to support increased use of fibre from damaged or low-value forests,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “This project is a great example of how waste wood fibre can be redirected to support the production of high-quality wood pellets.”The TCF has been thinning second-growth tree stands over the past few years within its tenure area, with white wood waste (hemlock and balsam) being brought to a processing area to be delimbed and cut to log length. About 15,000 cubic metres of hemlock and balsam were piled up to allow the wood to dry for two years. This curing period reduces the moisture content of the wood and decreases its weight, allowing more of it to be transported per truckload and lowering drying costs at the pellet plant.TCF had stockpiled the wood waste for two years instead of burning it, hoping to find another way to utilize the fibre. The grant from the Forest Enhancement Society of BC, which is supported by the B.C. government and the federal government, will help meet that objective.Pellet plants often mix white wood with ""hog fuel"", which is an unrefined mix of coarse chips of bark and wood fibre, to produce higher-quality pellets.“Without this funding, we would be burning this fibre since it is otherwise uneconomical to transport it,” said Kim Haworth, general manager, TCF. “Now we can grind and store the white wood on site and supply the fibre to the pellet plant on an as-needed basis. We would rather see the fibre used, generate some revenue and provide economic, social and environmental benefits to our community.”TCF is a company owned by the City of Terrace. It is managed by an appointed board that directs the general operation of the forest tenure. Its primary mandate is to create employment opportunities in the Terrace area, while financially supporting recreation and community groups that provide recreational activities within the Terrace Community Forest and the community.“We are pleased to fund the Terrace Community Forest project,” said Gord Pratt, RPF, operations manager for the Forest Enhancement Society of BC. “In the long run, it will help improve future forest practices to increase fibre utilization and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the burning of residual fibre.”Quick Facts: The Forest Enhancement Society of BC, a Crown agency, was established in 2016 to advance environmental and resource stewardship of the province’s forests by: preventing and mitigating the impact of wildfires; improving damaged or low-value forests; improving habitat for wildlife; supporting the use of fibre from damaged and low-value forests; and treating forests to improve the management of greenhouse gases.  The B.C. government has invested $235 million in the Forest Enhancement Society of BC, with about $233 million allocated as of July 23, 2020, for wildfire risk reduction, reforestation, forest rehabilitation, wildlife habitat restoration and raising awareness of the FireSmart program.

The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 1,049 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,742 in the Fraser Health region, 141 in the Island Health region, 304 in the Interior Health region, 69 in the Northern Health region and 57 cases of people who reside outside of Canada.“There have been no new COVID-19 related deaths, for a total of 189 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks. In total, one long-term care facility and two acute-care facilities have active outbreaks.“There are several community exposure events and one active community outbreak. Public health teams are actively contact tracing and requesting the assistance of anyone who may have been exposed to monitor themselves closely and follow public health guidance.“The B.C. COVID-19 curve is trending upward. We need to bend it back down to where it belongs.“We have proven that we know how to do this, and now each of us needs to make that happen.“Contact tracing three or four people is much faster and easier than trying to reach 20 or 30 people. With each additional person, transmission is greater and more people are at risk, which means more people need to self-isolate and limit contact with others.“As a direct result of the recent community exposures, there are close to a thousand British Columbians who are self-isolating at home, unable to work or even leave their home to enjoy the summer sunshine.“You can protect your friends and loved ones by protecting their household bubble. To do this, keep your groups small, only spend time with those you know and use your layers of protection.“Let’s stop the spread of COVID-19 with our safe physical distancing, washing our hands, cleaning more often, following one-way pathways, using plexi-barriers and wearing a mask when keeping distance is difficult.“When travelling, be considerate of the communities you are visiting and use your travel manners at all times. This includes always, without exception, delaying your trip if you are feeling unwell.“Recognizing the risks within bars and nightclubs and the recent links to exposure in these locations, the provincial health officer’s order is being amended. All patrons must now be seated at a designated seat. There is no liquor self-service or dancing, and measures need to be in place to reduce lineups and gathering outside. Changes in the requirements of events have also been made to further reduce the potential for transmission.“We can all have a fun and safe summer in spite of COVID-19. Let’s focus our efforts, be mindful of those around us and give each other the space to stay safe.“We are not going back to things we had to do before, but we do need to go back to safe social interactions, fewer faces and all working together to flatten our curve once again.”Quick Facts: Assisted living, long-term care homes and seniors' rental buildings with ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks are as follows: Vancouver Coastal Health: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility   Learn More:For B.C.’s surgical renewal plan and the first report on its progress from July 21, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020HLTH0026-000830For the latest modelling information presented on July 20, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/modelling-projectionsFor more information about BC’s Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/restartbcFor mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca Or: www.anxietycanada.comFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/ Or follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19 Or call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit: Facebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews  YouTube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBC    "

July marks the second anniversary of the launch of the fund, under which an average of 700 new spaces have been approved for funding each month.Chen and Sheila Malcolmson, MLA for Nanaimo, celebrated the latest achievement with the board of education of School District 68 (Nanaimo-Ladysmith). The district received the majority of the region’s 536 newly approved spaces to proceed with 10 projects that will create licensed child care spaces on school grounds.“I’m happy to welcome more new child care projects to Nanaimo so that families have more options for care,” Malcolmson said. “Our government is making it easier to offer child care on school grounds, which is more convenient for parents and helps provide kids with a smoother transition to kindergarten.”Recent changes made by the government to the School Act will make it even easier for school boards to create and operate before- and after-school care. The changes will also require school boards to prioritize space that is not being used for K-12 students for child care and encourage school boards to adopt an inclusive child care policy.“For too long, families throughout B.C. have struggled to find quality, affordable child care close to home,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “We’re making it easier for child care to be delivered on school properties, because children benefit when they spend more time in spaces that are already designed for enrichment and play, and families save time and money with one central drop-off location in their neighbourhoods.”In addition to the projects on school grounds, Nanaimo will receive Childcare BC New Spaces funding to support two non-profit projects – one through the Discover Montessori Society and one through the Nanaimo Innovation Academy Foundation.“These new spaces are part of the fastest province-wide creation of child care spaces in B.C.’s history,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “They demonstrate our ongoing commitments to making life more affordable for B.C. families and to building a strong, resilient economy that benefits everyone.”An additional 4,110 spaces, funded through the 2017 Budget Update and the Early Learning and Child Care agreement with the Government of Canada, takes the total to nearly 20,900 spaces since July 2017.Investing in child care and early childhood education is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Sonia Furstenau, MLA for Cowichan Valley – “High-quality child care that is accessible for families throughout the province is an absolutely essential aspect of our COVID-19 economic recovery, and I am pleased to see more spaces being announced at this time. We will continue to work collaboratively to further improve child care and support B.C. families.”Leonard Krog, mayor, City of Nanaimo –  “Child care is both a family and an economic issue facing many people in our community, which at times keeps parents up all night. Thanks to the Province, parents in Nanaimo can now have some peace of mind knowing that there will be additional child care spaces available in our city that will lay the foundations of learning and early childhood development for their children.”Charlene McKay, chair, Nanaimo-Ladysmith Board of Education –“As a parent of two school-aged children, I know first-hand the challenges families face when searching for child care. This continues to be a topic of conversation throughout the school district for parents. I applaud our government for identifying this major hurdle for our families and funding these greatly needed child care spaces throughout our entire district.”Cynthia Dyer, principal and executive director, Discover Montessori Society –“We are grateful for the investment by the New Spaces Fund toward the development of our Montessori Farm School Campus in Nanaimo. Our farm-based children’s campus will enable more families to have access to desperately needed infant-toddler, preschool and elementary child care spaces in the area. Designed with environmental sustainability and zero carbon in mind, the campus will be clean, bright and welcoming for children, and will offer many hands-on opportunities to connect students with nature.”Keely Freeman, daycare manager, Nanaimo Innovation Academy Foundation –“Nanaimo is in desperate need of quality child care. The New Spaces funding from the Province means we can help more kids grow, learn and thrive in an environment that nurtures all aspects of their development. We’re excited to be opening an additional 14 spaces for families this January 2021.”Quick Facts: Since launching in February 2018, the Childcare BC plan has helped parents save up to $1,600 a month, per child, for a total of nearly $510 million going to families through the Affordable Child Care Benefit and Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative. Through these initiatives, over 32,000 children have received child care for no more than $10 a day. In January 2020, the Province launched a new professional development program, which is giving early childhood educators access to more than 30 teaching specialists at community hubs throughout B.C., helping them to stay up to date on the latest child care teaching trends and techniques. The Province has made significant investments to improve supports to B.C.’s early care and learning professionals, including investing approximately $16 million to provide more than 6,000 bursaries and workforce-development supports for students pursuing a career in child care. To date, the Province has invested more than $27 million to provide more than 12,000 early childhood educators with a $1-per-hour wage enhancement, which increased to $2 per hour in April 2020.

Becoming licensed allows providers to care for more children and will help to enhance the quality of child care around British Columbia: www.gov.bc.ca/childcare/startupgrantsNearly 16,800 new licensed child care spaces have been approved for funding across Childcare BC’s space-creation initiatives, with thousands more to come.Childcare BC Maintenance Fund: Introduced in June 2018, the Childcare BC Maintenance Fund helps eligible child care providers to maintain existing spaces by providing funding to help them with minor repairs or to replace equipment in order to meet licensing standards. The fund also helps cover relocation costs for eligible providers, so they can quickly move their operations if needed, and continue to support B.C. children and their families. In 2019-20 the ministry approved more than 800 applications for funding: www.gov.bc.ca/ccmaintenancefundUBCM Partnerships: The Province is working with the Union of British Columbia Municipalities (UBCM) on two initiatives that support local government and municipalities to plan for and create new child care spaces and make effective use of publicly available assets and lands. The first partnership is the Community Child Care Space Creation Program, funded through a $13.7-million investment from the Early Learning and Child Care agreement with Government of Canada. This program provides up to $1 million for local governments that are working with partners to create new child care spaces in their community.The second partnership, funded through a $3-million provincial investment, will deliver Community Child Care Planning Grants to help communities assess and plan for the creation of new child care spaces that meet the needs of local families. More than 70 communities throughout the province are receiving up to $25,000 to undertake this work over the coming months: www.ubcm.caQualityA key goal under Childcare BC is to improve the quality of B.C.’s child care system through enhanced supports for early childhood educators (ECEs) and other child care professionals. Quality will be achieved by enhancing training and development opportunities, as well as addressing wages and recruitment in the sector.Early Care and Learning Recruitment and Retention Strategy: Early childhood educators are an essential part of the Province’s goal to deliver quality child care to B.C. families. To this end, Childcare BC is delivering investments to better support ECEs over the first three years of its 10-year plan. On Sept. 5, 2018, the Province launched an Early Care and Learning Recruitment and Retention Strategy that lays out key aspects of the quality pillar of Childcare BC: www.gov.bc.ca/childcare/ecestrategyECE Wage Enhancement: Since early 2019, ECEs working in licensed child care facilities have been eligible for a wage enhancement of $1 per hour, which increased to $2 per hour in April 2020. To date, the Province has invested more than $27 million to provide more than 12,000 early childhood educators with these wage enhancements.ECE Education Support Fund: In September 2018, in partnership with the Early Childhood Educators of BC, the Province announced an enhanced bursary program for students enrolled in early childhood educational programs at approved post-secondary institutions in B.C. The Province has made significant investments to improve supports to B.C.’s early care and learning professionals, including investing approximately $16 million to provide more than 6,000 bursaries and workforce-development supports for students pursuing a career in child care: www.ecebc.ca/programs/student_bursary.htmlProfessional Development Funding: In March 2019, the Ministry of Children and Family Development announced a $6.3-million investment through ELCC to improve access to professional development opportunities for early care and learning professionals. Six organizations will use this funding to expand and improve the availability of courses and tools, provide bursaries to access programming and improve access for Indigenous child care professionals.Early Childhood Pedagogy Network: In January 2020, the Ministry of Children and Family Development launched a new professional development program to improve access to training for ECEs and boost the quality of child care in B.C. Child care professionals now have access to more than 30 teaching specialists – known as pedagogists – at community hubs around the province, helping them to stay up to date with the latest child care teaching philosophies, curricula and techniques.Post-secondary seat expansion: In order to increase training and development opportunities for ECEs throughout the province, the Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training is investing $7.4 million over three years to fund an additional 620 early childhood educator graduates at B.C.’s public post-secondary institutions.Early Learning and Child Care (ELCC) AgreementInvestments under Childcare BC are complemented by the B.C. government’s three-year, $153-million ELCC agreement with the Government of Canada, which was signed in February 2018. The following outlines ELCC investments in addition to the $16.3 million for quality child care, the $60 million for Childcare BC Universal Prototype Sites, and the $13.7 million for new spaces through UBCM.Aboriginal Head Start: The B.C. government is investing $30 million to expand Aboriginal Head Start programs around the province, with over 30 communities benefiting from more than 600 new licensed child care and early learning spaces. These programs provide culturally based, inclusive child care and early learning, family bonding and prevention services, with services available to families at no cost. Aboriginal Head Start on Reserve: www.fnha.ca/what-we-do/maternal-child-and-family-health/aboriginal-head-start-on-reserve Aboriginal Head Start in urban communities: www.ahsabc.comYoung Parent Program: In May 2018, the B.C. government announced an additional $3 million over the next three years – on top of its annual funding of $1.6 million – to boost the monthly funding amount available to eligible young parents to up to $1,500 a month per child. The increase in funding is helping to serve the child care needs of approximately 220 young-parent families per year: https://news.gov.bc.ca/17176Supported Child Development: Under ELCC, the Province is investing $30 million over three years to make child care more inclusive.

Overuse of trails leads to environmental impacts, such as trail widening, soil erosion, altered hydrology and damaged vegetation.Beginning Monday, July 27, 2020, people can get a free BC Parks day-use pass and visit certain areas in six of the busiest parks, including: Mount Robson Park: Berg Lake Trail Stawamus Chief Park: Chief Peaks Trail Cypress Park: upper mountain trails, including the Howe Sound Crest Trail, Hollyburn Mountain Trails and the Black Mountain Plateau trails Mount Seymour Park: upper mountain trails including the Seymour Main Trail, Dog Mountain Trail and Mystery Lake Trail Garibaldi Park: trailheads at Diamond Head, Rubble Creek and Cheakamus Golden Ears Park: all trails and day-use areas Garibaldi Park will fully reopen on July 27 with the introduction of day-use passes in select areas. Like many parks in the Sea-to-Sky corridor, Garibaldi has seen a significant increase in visitors during the last four years, which has led to overcrowding in some areas of the park.The free day-use passes are part of a pilot program intended to help BC Parks re-open busy areas and test the passes as a tool to manage overcrowding. The passes can be obtained on the Discover Camping website and will be released daily at 6 a.m. for same-day bookings. The number of passes available each day depends on the park and ranges from vehicle passes for the Berg Lake Trail and Golden Ears Park to individual trail passes in the other parks for morning, afternoon or full day.“We strongly support BC Parks reopening these six popular parks, while working to manage visitation and conserve nature in the places we love,” said Bruce Passmore, executive director, Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, B.C. chapter. “With many people staying home this summer, the demand for outdoor recreation continues to surge, putting more pressure on our park system. We welcome solutions that will help manage overcrowding in certain areas and strengthen our opportunity to protect vital ecosystems.”Backcountry campers with camping permits are not required to reserve a day-use pass, but should carry proof of their camping permit if they are using one of the select trails that require a pass. Park operator staff will be checking passes upon arrival. Visitors can download the pass onto their mobile device or print it to show at the park.Further details about the passes required in each park, along with detailed information about BC Parks response to COVID-19 and which parks remain closed, can be found here: www.bcparks.ca Before heading out, people are advised to visit the individual park page for any changes to available services.Quick Facts: BC Parks is one of the world’s biggest and most diverse parks systems, with 1,035 provincial parks, recreation areas, protected areas, conservancies and ecological reserves covering more than 14% of the province’s land base. In 2018-19, Cypress Park had nearly 1.9 million visitors, Mount Seymour Park had nearly 1 million visitors, Golden Ears Park had more than 850,000 visitors, Garibaldi Park had more than 120,000 visitors, Stawamus Chief Park had nearly 600,000 visitors, and Mount Robson Park had more than 200,000 visitors. Mount Robson Park is the second oldest park in B.C.’s park system and has the highest peak in the Canadian Rockies. The park’s Berg Lake Trail is a world-renowned backcountry hiking trail.

As a government, we are working to ensure the supports people need during this unprecedented time continue to be available, which is why we’re extending provincial state of emergency today.”The state of emergency is extended through the end of the day on Tuesday, Aug. 4, 2020, to allow government to continue to take the necessary actions to keep British Columbians safe.“While some restrictions have been eased, we must stay the course to flatten the COVID-19 curve,” Farnworth said. “This means that even as British Columbians start to carefully adjust to life in Phase 3, we are maintaining the necessary critical supports to respond to and alleviate the effects of this pandemic.”  On July 10, the COVID-19 Related Measures Act came into force. The legislation enables provisions created for people and businesses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to continue as needed after the provincial state of emergency ends.Actions taken in the previous two weeks to support British Columbians include: releasing an economic and fiscal update for 2020-21 to provide a summary of COVID-19 investments to date, as well as a scenario of revenue and deficit projections; extending the temporary authorization that permits food-primary and liquor-primary licensees to sell and deliver sealed, packaged liquor products alongside the purchase of a meal for off-site consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic; and. laying out the details of a repayment framework to be put in place later this summer, helping renters and landlords to transition and tenants in arrears to maintain their housing when the ban on evictions for non-payment of rent is lifted ahead of Sept. 1, 2020. The extension of the provincial state of emergency is based on recommendations from B.C.'s health and emergency management officials. Farnworth made the original declaration on March 18, 2020, the day after Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, declared a public health emergency.Quick Facts: Declarations of provincial states of emergency may be issued by the minister responsible under the Emergency Program Act. The provincial government can extend the period of a declaration made by the minister responsible for further periods of time for up to 14 days at a time. During the 2017 wildfire season, the province was in a provincial state of emergency for 10 weeks from July 7 to Sept. 15.

Search and rescue volunteers take a risk every time they go out to rescue someone, and that risk is heightened due to COVID 19. I’m calling on all British Columbians to be safe and to make sure your family, friends and neighbours are being safe, so we can reduce the risks for everyone.”Since January 2020, ground search and rescue volunteers have responded to more than 700 calls throughout the province.“Every time someone takes a risk in the backcountry, by going off established trails or not being prepared, the safety of ground search and rescue volunteers is put at risk,” said Jennifer Rice, Parliamentary Secretary for Emergency Preparedness. “These skilled and dedicated volunteers work hard, and while they will be there for people who need help, British Columbians need to do their part by being prepared and staying safe in the outdoors.”Since 2013, BCSARA has been working with the Province on a long-term approach to funding. In 2018, the government hired a consultant to review and make recommendations on a BCSARA proposal. In response to the consultant’s recommendations, the Province provided the one-time, $18.6-million investment in 2019. Budget 2020 provides for an ongoing contribution to support ground search and rescue groups starting in 2022-23.“This announcement of sustainable funding and support for the 79 groups and their 2,500 unpaid professional members is truly a milestone for the ground search and rescue service in B.C.,” said Chris Kelly, president, on behalf of the BCSARA board.British Columbians are asked to do their part: Stay close to home on well-marked trails, while maintaining physical distancing. Make sure to pack the right provisions and clothing appriopriate for the weather. When going into the outdoors, be prepared to take care of yourself and your family. Follow the provincial health officer’s directions. Extra caution is needed during this time.

The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.""Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 1,043 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,731 in the Fraser Health region, 140 in the Island Health region, 291 in the Interior Health region, 69 in the Northern Health region and 54 cases of people who reside outside of Canada.""There is a data correction in the overall number of total and active cases.""There have been no new COVID-19 related deaths for a total of 189 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks. In total, one long-term care facility and two acute-care facilities have active outbreaks.“There are several community exposure events and one active community outbreak. Public health teams are actively contact tracing and requesting the assistance of anyone who may have been exposed to monitor themselves closely and follow public health guidance.“As we have seen in many other places, a few missteps can quickly result is a significant resurgence in new cases of COVID-19.“Here in B.C., our curve is trending upward, and we need to bend our curve back down to where it belongs.“Many of the new cases are a result of community transmission from an increase in social interactions this summer. This trend is a concern, but we can turn this trend around.“We are in a very different place than where we were in March, and everyone in B.C. has proven that we know what it takes to flatten our curve and make sure our communities stay safe.“We can stop transmission by seeing fewer people, only spending time with people we know, keeping a safe distance from others and using a mask when that is difficult. Let’s continue to follow these rules for safe social interactions.“We also need to support contact tracing efforts by paying attention to where we go and who we see, and always, without exception, staying home if we are feeling at all unwell.“The recent community cases have meant that some restaurants, wineries and recreational facilities in the Okanagan and Lower Mainland have been notified of a potential exposure with some employees, or have had employees who are confirmed positive for COVID-19.“We commend the businesses who have proactively notified the public and temporarily closed for additional cleaning. This is a clear example of how we can contain the risk when it is known, slow the spread and continue to operate safely.“Let’s play safe and stay safe, and make sure COVID-19 doesn’t spoil our summer.

In May, we committed to significantly increase the number of surgeries performed beyond pre-COVID-19 levels to keep up with new demands for surgery and complete the surgeries lost to COVID-19. The progress to date is an amazing testament to the tireless dedication of our health-care workers.”The B.C. Surgical Renewal Commitment was launched in May 2020 and is an extensive plan to contact patients regarding their surgeries, focus on patients needing surgery most and who it is safest for, add new capacity, hire and train staff, and complete surgeries.The Province is releasing its first public update report on the Surgical Renewal Commitment, which covers May 18, 2020, to June 25, 2020. Progress includes the following:   62,744 patients have been contacted to arrange their surgery from May 7 to July 12, 2020. 52% of the 17,742 whose surgery was postponed, and who have been called, had their surgeries completed by June 25, 2020. 33,723 surgeries have been completed from May 18 to June 25, 2020, representing 91% of last year's volume. Since the ramp-up period ended June 15, 100% or more of 2019 volumes have been completed each week. From May 18 to June 25, 2020, urgent surgery volumes exceeded last year’s volumes. Significant focus on patients waiting longer than two times their target wait time resulted in these patients making up 19.4% of non-urgent surgeries completed during the time period, compared to 10.5% in 2019. 97% of the previous year’s operating hours was achieved during the ramp-up period. Summer slowdowns will be reduced by 52%. In previous years, surgical activity has decreased during the summer as a result of planned vacations.   Surgery durations are back to within 6% of where they were last year.   $815,000 has been provided to Health Match BC to support the recruitment of additional health-care professionals. Since April 1, 2020, 29 new anesthetists have been recruited.  Recruitment efforts have also resulted in the hiring of 111 perioperative registered nurses, six perioperative licensed practical nurses, 60 post-anesthetic recovery registered nurses and 35 medical device reprocessing technicians. “B.C.’s Surgical Renewal Commitment is a massive and necessary undertaking. Our initial progress is significant and encouraging. That progress, in some ways, is an insurance policy against the potential damaging effects of a second wave of COVID-19 and to help us address the 24,400 patients who may be identified as needing surgery. We know that there is a lot of work to do and that we will face setbacks and challenges along the way.

The new school is expected to be ready in September 2021.“The community has been waiting years to see Walnut Park Elementary replaced, so more students in Smithers can have the positive learning experience they deserve,” said Doug Donaldson, MLA for Stikine. “I can’t wait to see children, teachers and staff walking through the doors of a brand-new school and getting the full benefits of a modern learning facility that supports 21st-century learning.”Construction began in early July 2020 on the two-storey school that will be located on the northwest area of the current site. The new school will have open and collaborative learning spaces and will be built to highly efficient LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) gold standards.“The board of education is pleased to support a new and innovative space for current and future students who will attend Walnut Park Elementary,” said Jennifer Williams, chair, Bulkley Valley Board of Education. “Along with the new school comes a new daycare facility. Having an early learning centre attached to the school will be a benefit to the families and children in the community, especially when it comes time to transitioning into kindergarten.”The current school is showing signs of age and has structural deficiencies. The existing building will be demolished following the opening of the new school.The project will also include a neighbourhood learning centre and Strong Start Program on the school grounds. The Province is working with the Bulkley Valley School District and the Town of Smithers to determine the best use of the neighbourhood learning centre for serving the needs of the community.Government is making record investments in B.C. schools to give every student the best learning experience possible. In two and a half years, the Province has approved over $2 billion in school capital investments, creating nearly 13,000 new student seats and more than 26,000 seismically safe seats.To continue this momentum, Budget 2020 includes $2.8 billion for school capital investments over three years.Quotes:Mike McDiarmid, superintendent, Bulkley Valley School District –“The school district is very excited to have construction underway for our new school. The new building will be a state-of-the-art facility and will reflect 21st-century teaching and learning practices. Flexible spaces that have more room for collaboration, hands-on learning, physical literacy and outdoor learning are all features to the new Walnut Park. This new school will be a great asset to the entire community for many years to come.”Dawn Thomas, chair, Walnut Park Elementary parent advisory committee –“Building on the past, we are looking forward to a bright future with a new school that captures who we are as a community.”    "

The first development, located at 2600 35 St., would add 52 new homes with supports to the existing My Place, a 52-unit supportive housing building that TPCS has been operating since July 2019. The property is owned by BC Housing and is already zoned for use, but will need to go through the municipal approval process.The second development, located at 2307 43 St., would demolish the derelict Howard House shelter, which has long been slated for redevelopment, and build approximately 50 units of new supportive housing. The site is connected to Our Place, a 46-bed supportive housing building that TPCS has operated since March 2019. BC Housing will purchase the site from TPCS, which requires approval from the City of Vernon to be rezoned. The property is currently vacant.""We are grateful to all our community partners, especially BC Housing and the City of Vernon,” said Randene Wejr, executive director, TPCS. “Together, we have already created homes for 56 individuals who were once experiencing homelessness. The proposed projects ahead will create more than 100 more homes. The strength of any community can be witnessed in how it takes care of its most vulnerable citizens, today we get to witness that great strength in Vernon.""TPCS would operate both buildings and provide residents with meal programs, life and employment skills training, and health and wellness support services.If the projects are approved by the city, BC Housing will update the community with the estimated project costs and proposed construction timelines. Funding would come from the Province’s Supportive Housing Fund.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts: BC Housing will be hosting a virtual neighbourhood information session and will invite neighbours and members of the community to learn more, ask questions and provide feedback.

In the first reporting period from July 17 to July 18, we had 51 new cases. From July 18 to July 19, we had 19 new cases, and in the last 24 hours, we have had a further 32 new cases.“This represents 102 new cases, including four epi-linked cases since we reported on Friday, for a total of 3,300 cases in British Columbia.""There are 253 active cases of COVID-19 in the province and 2,858 people who tested positive have recovered.""Of the total COVID-19 cases, 16 individuals are hospitalized, four of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.""Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 1,042 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,713 in the Fraser Health region, 142 in the Island Health region, 280 in the Interior Health region, 69 in the Northern Health region and 54 cases of people who reside outside of Canada.""There have been no new COVID-19 related deaths for a total of 189 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks. In total, one long-term care facility and two acute-care facilities have active outbreaks.“There are several community exposure events. Public health teams are actively contact tracing and requesting the assistance of anyone who may have been exposed to monitor themselves closely and follow public health guidance.“Today, we release an early snapshot of the ‘Your story, our future’ survey, as well as the latest data on COVID-19 in British Columbia.“The preliminary survey results show that almost half of British Columbians (47%) have experienced worsening mental health as a result of the pandemic. Many have also faced additional economic burden and the stress that comes with that.“Notably, those aged 18 to 29 have experienced greater economic and mental health impact than the general population.“We know the pandemic has created significant challenges for everyone, so we ask you to please ensure you are reaching out and connecting with those who may be more vulnerable.“The epidemiological data also shows some concerning upward trends: The infection rate for new cases is increasing above one to one, and we are also seeing an uptick in our case curve. This tells us that we are on edge of increasing our social interactions too much and are at risk of a rebound.“We need to bend our curve back down to where it belongs.“Public health teams have been very effective in containing the spread. We also need to do our part and be the voice with our friends and family to remind everyone about the steps to take to keep each other safe.“We are asking everyone to use your connections and influence, whether on social media or in-person, to share the message to socialize safely.“By playing safe and staying safe, let’s make sure COVID-19 doesn’t spoil our summer.“There are a few things we can all do to push that curve back down. Keep your groups small and only spend time with those you know. The more people you see, the more likely someone will have COVID-19 and will spread it to others.“If you are going out, be considerate of people who are working at the restaurants and pubs that you are visiting. Remember servers are at higher risk because of the many people they see, so be kind and show gratitude as they follow the WorkSafeBC requirements for safe operations. Ensure your groups are no larger than six people, avoid table-hopping and stay home if you are feeling unwell.“If you are hosting a small gathering, remember ‘fewer faces and bigger spaces.’ Keep your gatherings small, know everyone who is coming, stay outside as much as possible and have a designated ‘contact keeper’ so you are able to quickly alert everyone afterward, if necessary.“We all have a role to play in keeping our curve flat. Let’s continue to work together and do all we can to keep ourselves and each other safe. Let’s protect our communities, our Elders and our loved ones by standing united against COVID-19.”Quick Facts: Assisted living, long-term care homes and seniors’ rental buildings with ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks are as follows: Vancouver Coastal Health: Holy Family Hospital long-term care facility   Learn More:For the latest modelling information, presented on July 20, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/modelling-projectionsFor resources, or to learn how you can prevent overdoses, visit: stopoverdosebc.caFor more information about BC’s Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/restartbcFor B.C.’s surgical renewal plan, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/conducting-health-research-evaluation/reports-publicationsFor mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca Or: www.anxietycanada.comFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/ Or follow @CDCofBC on Twitter.For non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19 Or call 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268-4319) between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week.For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit: Facebook: www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/  Twitter: https://twitter.com/BCGovNews  YouTube: www.youtube.com/ProvinceofBC    "

This is expanded from 16 weeks, to give employers and workers more flexibility.The new online application simplifies and streamlines the process for employers and workers to jointly apply for an extension beyond Aug. 30 by eliminating the need for hardcopy documents and signatures, while ensuring the integrity of the branch’s decision-making process.Government engaged with stakeholders, including small businesses, to test the online process to make it as simple as possible to support B.C.’s workplaces in economic recovery.Employers are encouraged to apply as soon as they have received worker support. An application deadline of Aug. 25, 2020, has been set to ensure that all applications will be processed by the Aug. 30 expiry date.There are now two steps. Employers must: Survey their workforce to obtain more than 50% support from workers before applying. Workers will receive information about the variance, including what their rights are and can provide their support using a new online response tool; Once worker support is documented, employers complete the online form and submit the document in a new portal directly to the Employment Standards Branch. There are new supportive templates and tools to assist employers and workers in taking these steps. Under B.C.’s Employment Standards Act, temporary layoffs related to COVID-19 can last up to 24 weeks, or until Aug. 30, before the layoff becomes permanent. Government recommends that employers submit their variance applications early to avoid the potential of permanent staff layoffs and compensation for length of service to eligible workers upon the expiry of the COVID-19 emergency layoff period on Aug. 30.BC’s Restart Plan is supporting business to safely reopen and get people back to work.Employers are also encouraged to make use of the federal wage subsidy to assist them in bringing their workers back.Learn More:Visit the updated website for temporary layoff variance applications: www.gov.bc.ca/covidlayoffsFor information on employment standards around temporary layoffs, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/employment-standards-advice/employment-standards/hours/variancesLearn more about B.C.’s economic recovery planning: http://gov.bc.ca/recoveryideasFor information about BC’s Restart Plan, visit: http://gov.bc.ca/restartbc    "
