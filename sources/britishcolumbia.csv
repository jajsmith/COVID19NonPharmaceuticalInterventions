Forest Enhancement Society of BC (FESBC) grants are supporting the Williams Lake First Nation (WLFN) as it creates jobs, fights climate change and reduces wildfire risk near its community.To date, grants have supported the removal of 64,000 cubic metres of slash (debris from forest fires) and over the next two years, the total will reach 200,000 cubic metres.The ongoing project is also creating an estimated 26 jobs for both the WLFN and the Tŝideldel First Nation (TFN), which has partnered to grind the debris on site and ship it to local markets.“The WLFN have partnered with the TFN on this unique ongoing project that is seeing slash piles turned into biomass fuel instead of burning them,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “This green-energy project is reducing greenhouse gas emissions and building new economic opportunities for both communities while contributing to B.C.’s clean energy plan.”Three FESBC grants between 2017 and 2019, totalling more than $3 million, allowed WLFN to develop an ongoing program and enabled it to build several partnerships to grind the debris at site and truck it to local markets. One of the most significant partnerships was with the TFN contractor, Tsi Del Biomass Ltd., which brought logging and grinding experience to the project.Typically, slash from wildfire salvage logging is piled and burned at site because transportation is cost prohibitive. Burning slash piles increases smoke in local airsheds and increases greenhouse gas emissions.“Tsi Del Del has really appreciated the opportunity to collaborate with Williams Lake First Nation on grinding and trucking more than 1,000 piles to customers in our local fibre basket,” said Percy Guichon, director, Tsi Del Del Enterprises Ltd., and Tŝideldel First Nation councillor. “Working together on a business basis has resulted in benefits for both communities and created employment opportunities while making products from this biomass.”High-quality slash fibre from the projects will be used by Pinnacle Renewable Energy to make industrial wood pellets, which are used by large-scale thermal power generators as a greener alternative to produce power. Lower-quality slash fibre will be turned into “hog” fuel to be used by Atlantic Power Corporation’s biomass-fired generating facility located in Williams Lake, to provide thermal electricity for the community’s energy grid.“WLFN continues to seek out partners either in the local, provincial and federal capacities who will assist and build upon WLFN environmental goals and objectives,” said Chief Willie Sellars of the WLFN. “The FESBC funding has been crucial in assisting the shared mandate of reducing these outdated burning programs. FESBC funding allows First Nation communities such as WLFN of the Secwepemc and Tŝideldel of the Tsilhqot'in National Government, two Nations that have historically not worked together, an opportunity that will benefit both Nations and each of their companies.”Ongoing operations over the next two years will continue to support recovery of logging debris from wildfire risk reduction projects and will generate fibre to sell in the Williams Lake market.The projects were funded through FESBC grants supported by the provincial government and the Government of Canada.Quotes:Ken Day, consulting forester, KDay Forestry Ltd. –“On average, biomass costs more to produce than what the market will pay. There are two markets in Williams Lake who can use the fibre — Pinnacle Renewable Energy and Atlantic Power. We also wanted to avoid burning the debris and creating smoke in the air, which would have been hard on the community. Not removing the piles of debris could contribute to a very intense fire — obviously undesirable adjacent to the community. Without funding from FESBC to make up the shortfall, this important project would not have gone ahead.”Dave Conly, operations manager, FESBC –“This project is based on community interest in avoiding burning the thousands of piles of wood waste resulting from salvage harvesting done in the 2017 fire areas. The parties came together and created fantastic results over the course of two years. I was extremely impressed by the collaboration and partnerships developed.”Learn More:For more information about the Forest Enhancement Society of BC, visit: https://www.fesbc.ca

This summer, a nearly 19-kilometre section of Highway 16 will be resurfaced, making the drive safer and smoother for travellers.The $1.2-million project will sealcoat Highway 16, starting at Engen, running east and ending in the west end of Vanderhoof.Highway 16 is a vital transportation corridor between Prince Rupert and the Alberta border.Sealcoating is a common type of road resurfacing done on B.C. highways, involving the application of a special mixture to the road that protects the road base from additional wear and tear. When it is applied over existing pavement, sealcoating is a cost-effective way of resurfacing that extends the life of a road by sealing out moisture. It also provides a skid-resistant, anti-glare surface during wet weather.The ministry is working closely with the contactor, O.K. Industries Ltd. of Vancouver Island, and WorkSafeBC to ensure health and safety are maintained for all workers on site.Provincial construction sites have protocols and policies in place following the requirements of the provincial health officer to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. These measures include physical distancing and other protocols to ensure worker and public safety.Once the project begins, drivers can expect minor delays and, at times, single alternating-lane traffic over the course of work, which is expected to last a week.The ministry appreciates people’s patience during this resurfacing work. Drivers are reminded to obey construction-zone speed limits and directions from traffic control personnel.Learn More:For active highway and infrastructure projects in northern B.C., visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/17700For information on resurfacing methods, visit:

3,2020-07-15 15:45:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020AEST0038-001289,Government Website,New supports for post-secondary students this fall,"

Applications for StudentAid BC, along with the new non-repayable B.C. Access Grant, are now open.This up-front grant, along with new funding for students with disabilities, expanded open education resources and online support through BCcampus, will open doors for students to return to school and earn the college or university credential of their choice.   “Whether you’re a high school grad, a current student or are returning for new skills and training, these new government supports mean the doors are wide open for you to get a post-secondary credential and pursue your dreams,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “Our government is absolutely committed to making life more affordable for all British Columbians. Our investments in post-secondary education empowers students and helps communities get back on their feet and be part of B.C.’s economic recovery.”Every student who applies for StudentAid BC will now be automatically assessed for the new B.C. Access Grant. Announced in Budget 2020, the B.C. Access Grant will break down barriers and enable over 40,000 low- and middle-income students, or about twice as many students as supported under previous grants, to access more affordable public post-secondary education. These students will receive up to $4,000 a year to help with the up-front cost of programs leading to a certificate, diploma or degree.Mark also announced new investments totalling $2.175 million to better support post-secondary students and faculty. The funding includes $1.5 million to be shared by 20 public post-secondary institutions throughout B.C. and will be used to develop or build upon supports for students with cognitive, mental health or physical disabilities to create the conditions they need to succeed.Government is also providing $275,000 to BCcampus to develop online resources and tools for students, staff and faculty to help them navigate a range of topics on well-being, which are needed now more than ever. Resources include a website, videos and webinars on topics such as adapting to online learning, building resilience, stress management and understanding financial supports.BCcampus began running the webinars in April 2020. They will run regularly into 2021, with dedicated sessions planned for students, faculty and staff. Sessions are recorded, transcribed and hosted on the BCcampus website.Also this fall, students and faculty at public post-secondary institutions throughout B.C. will benefit from new OER being created and adapted. Over 310 textbooks, supplementary manuals and guides are available free through B.C.’s Open Textbook collection, which covers a wide range of subjects. These free materials have been a call to action from students and are being developed as part of government’s single largest investment ever in OER: $3 million announced in April 2019.“Especially in this time of COVID-19, tuition fees and the high cost of textbooks create barriers for students to be successful,” said Fillette Umulisa, Lansdowne campus executive, Camosun College Student Society. “The financial grants and open education resources that the B.C. government has announced today are welcome news to post-secondary students. This support is critical to providing easier access to the necessary courses and programs students require to get their credentials, achieve their career goals and contribute positively to our economy and society.”The Province is further investing $400,000 through BCcampus to create fully developed OER courses and support services for a broad range of the most popular courses. This work will better support educators with an expanded choice of free textbooks and more supports for online course delivery, benefiting both faculty and students. As more subjects are identified, additional OER will be developed. B.C.’s Labour Market Outlook predicts over the next 10 years, 861,000 jobs will need to be filled. These range from trades, technology and tourism to health care, management and business. Some level of post-secondary education or training will be required for about 80% of those job openings.Increasing the affordability of post-secondary education is a shared priority between government, the BC Green Party caucus and independent MLA Andrew Weaver, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Lana Popham, MLA for South Saanich –“This is excellent work that makes post-secondary education in B.C. more affordable. I’m so pleased to see more adaptable online teaching and learning resources, including textbooks and homework assignments. They are free for students to access and use.”Sherri Bell, president of Camosun College and board chair of BC Colleges –“Post-secondary education is critical to helping safely restart B.C.’s economy. The BC Access Grant is welcome news right now for students at Camosun and all colleges, particularly since many students are studying for certificates, diplomas and part time. Now is an excellent time for students to take their first steps in post-secondary education or to upgrade their technical skills, whether online or on campus, in a safe way, and Camosun College is ready.”Mary Burgess, executive director, BCcampus – “We are so glad to have such good support from government to help ensure the post-secondary students, faculty and staff of B.C. have what they need to do their best work. The BC Post-Secondary System Collaboration on Open Online Courses is a positive sign of our ability, as a system, to think holistically about the open resources we have. It’s an opportunity to pool our talents with the open-focused educators across the province to collaborate on curriculum development and build on the open ecosystem we’ve been working so hard on for so many years.”Tanysha Klassen, chairperson, BC Federation of Students – ""Now more than ever students and their families need help to afford the education they need to enter the workforce. The BC Access Grant will help students access not only four-year programs, but certificate and diploma programs that are key for the health of our economy.”Learn More:For more information on the BC Student Access Grant, visit: https://studentaidbc.ca/news/grants-scholarships/new-bc-access-grantBrowse open education resources: https://open.bccampus.ca/For further information on BCcampus’ Open Online Courses Project call for proposal, visit:

Indigenous communities, local governments and landowners can now identify specific orphan and inactive well sites for priority reclamation as part of the Province’s efforts to clean up wells in B.C. and create jobs for workers in oil and gas service companies.“We are making sure local communities’ voices are heard and they have a hand in the process,” said Bruce Ralston, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources. “By prioritizing the reclamation of orphan and inactive wells chosen by the public, we’re making use of local knowledge as we clean up the environment and create jobs for B.C. workers.”Specific dormant and orphan sites can be nominated by the public until Sept. 30, 2020, through an online process supported by the BC Oil and Gas Commission.In April 2020, the Government of Canada announced $120 million in funding for B.C. to support the restoration of oil and gas sites, as part of its COVID-19 industry support. To ensure this funding supports B.C. workers and companies, the Province developed three new programs:
$100 million for the Dormant Sites Reclamation Program: this program will reclaim dormant oil and gas sites, which are wells that have been inactive for five consecutive years and are unlikely to return to service. 
$15 million for the Orphan Sites Supplemental Reclamation Program: this program will reclaim orphan oil and gas sites where the operator is insolvent, no longer exists or cannot be located.
$5 million for the Legacy Sites Reclamation Program: this program will address the legacy impacts of historical oil and gas activities that continue to have environmental impacts, such as on wildlife habitat or on the traditional use by Indigenous peoples.
Wells nominated for cleanup will receive priority consideration under the second increment of $50 million that is available through the Dormant Sites Reclamation Program and as part of the $15-million Orphan Sites Supplemental Reclamation Program.These programs are open to oil and gas field service companies and contractors based in B.C., with registration, office and operations in B.C.Quotes:Chief Justin Napoleon, Saulteau First Nation - ""There are thousands of well sites on our Treaty lands that are waiting to be reclaimed and restored.  We welcome any initiative that finally starts to focus attention and resources on restoring those lands. A process for nominating sites is a start, but there is much more work to do on these issues. We look forward to working with the Province and others on programs that include Indigenous perspectives on restoration standards and Indigenous participation in restoration activities. We have experience, knowledge and skills to share and it is only by working together that we can make the dormant and orphan well site reclamation programs successful.”Dale Bumstead, mayor, Dawson Creek - “The cleanup of dormant and orphan wells in the region is a terrific initiative by the federal and provincial governments. To take on the cleanup of the environment, as well as create economic benefits to our small businesses will be a win-win for everyone.”Lori Ackerman, mayor, Fort St. John - “I appreciate that the Province acknowledges the expertise of our local companies and residents. The knowledge and expertise to prioritize and reclaim these sites is held here in northeast B.C. and should be used.”Learn More:Information on the site nomination process and how to access the nomination portal is available here: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/natural-gas-oil/responsible-oil-gas-development/dormant-sites-reclamation-program/site-nominationInformation on the Dormant Sites Reclamation Program is available here: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/natural-gas-oil/responsible-oil-gas-development/dormant-sites-reclamation-program

From: Health Canada (canada.ca) The opioid overdose crisis continues to be one of the most serious public health crises in Canada’s recent history. Tragically, in many communities, the COVID-19 pandemic is worsening this crisis. The Government of Canada continues to support communities across Canada as they respond to drug overdoses and harms during the pandemic.  Today, the Honourable Patty Hajdu, Minister of Health, along with the Honourable Judy Darcy, B.C. Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, and Dr. Richard Stanwick, Chief Medical Health Officer, Island Health, announced approximately $2 million in funding for a pilot project within Island Health. The innovative project will provide pharmaceutical-grade medication as an alternative to the toxic illegal drug supply for people in Cowichan Valley who have not responded to other forms of treatment for opioid use disorder.This project will allow selected patients at risk of overdose to have access to hydromorphone tablets from a licensed prescriber at the Cowichan Valley Wellness and Recovery Centre. The patients will also receive critical wrap-around services, such as peer support, medical care, mental health support and a personal support plan. This project is a four-year pilot that will provide valuable evidence to support the development of best practices for safer supply programs.Expanding access to safer supply pilot projects, such as this one, is one way Health Canada and the province are helping to save lives and improve health outcomes. The Government of Canada and British Columbia also continues to support critical harm reduction, treatment, housing and other services for people who use drugs or who are in recovery. Canada’s overdose crisis requires collaboration from all levels of government, partners, stakeholders, people with lived and living experience, and organizations in communities across the country.Quotes“It has never been more important to provide harm reduction and treatment services to people who use drugs. It is devastating to see that the pandemic has worsened the situation for Canadians struggling with substance use disorders in many parts of country, including Vancouver Island communities in British Columbia. Providing a safer alternative to street drugs will save lives and help people in Cowichan Valley access treatment and other supports.”The Honourable Patty Hajdu, Minister of Health“We know that providing safe prescription alternatives to the highly toxic and illegal drug supply is critical to stabilize people who are at great risk. We’re thrilled that this project will build on the work our government has been doing to separate people who use substances from the increasingly toxic street supply and give them the best chance to find their own pathway to healing and recovery.”The Honourable Judy Darcy, B.C. Minister of Mental Health and Addictions“This medication option will provide a life-saving alternative to the contaminated drug supply that is driving our drug poisoning crisis. The recent increase in overdose deaths in communities within Island Health shows a clear need for better access to a safer drug supply.”Dr. Richard Stanwick, Chief Medical Health Officer, Island HealthQuick facts
There is a growing number of programs now offering injectable opioid agonist treatment using opioids such as hydromorphone and diacetylmorphine, for patients where other treatment options have not worked.
Early findings from Canadian evidence has found that using pharmaceutical-grade medications, such as hydromorphone, as an alternative to highly toxic street drugs for people at risk of overdose, can help to save lives and improve health outcomes. It can also help establish an entry to care and treatment for people with substance use disorder. Some medication-assisted treatment for severe opioid use disorder have been approved and are available in Canada for use by qualified healthcare professionals. These medications include injectable hydromorphone, methadone and buprenorphine products. 
This project is part of the federal investment of $76.2 million announced in July 2019 for new measures to scale up key lifesaving measures, protect people from an illegal drug supply that contains toxic fentanyl, and address the growing methamphetamine use.
Funding for this project is provided through Health Canada’s Substance Use and Addictions Program (canada.ca)  (SUAP). SUAP provides financial support to provinces, territories, non-governmental organizations and key stakeholders for programs and initiatives that aim to prevent, treat, and reduce harm of substance use issues.

The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure has awarded a contract to build a retaining wall along a section of Highway 14 at Parkinson Hill, just east of Port Renfrew.The retaining wall will make this section of the highway more robust and eventually allow for the return of two-way traffic.The $5.3-million contract was awarded to Jacob Bros. Construction Inc. Construction is scheduled to begin later this month, with completion slated for summer 2021.The highway was reduced to single-lane traffic in November 2018 after significant rainfall resulted in a slope failure. Building the 220-metre retaining wall is the first step to restoring two-way traffic on Highway 14, which will make travelling the road to Port Renfrew safer and more efficient for people.The work on the retaining wall will require overnight road closures. To reduce the impact on people using the highway, the ministry intends to close Highway 14 between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. nightly, except for Saturday and Sunday nights. During these closures, accommodations will be made for emergency services access. Overnight closures will run from July to Nov. 30, 2020. The highway is expected to operate at two lanes from Dec. 1, 2020, to Jan. 31, 2021.The second step of the project is expected to start in spring 2021, and will include deep road-base repairs along a 500-metre section of Highway 14. Similar road closures will be required as these repairs are completed, with overnight closures expected between February and June 30, 2021.Further details and the final traffic management plan will be made available to the public prior to the start of construction.Provincial construction sites have protocols and policies in place, following the requirements of the provincial health officer, to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. These include reducing in-person meetings or gatherings, holding meetings outdoors and ensuring physical distancing of workers throughout the work day. These measures, along with other work protocols, such as daily cleaning and sanitizing of common areas and surfaces, will help ensure worker and public safety.For up-to-date information on road work, people are advised to check: DriveBC.ca

Construction has begun to give hundreds of students in Vernon a more inspiring place to learn.“With 10 new classrooms on the way, students are one step closer to saying goodbye to portables at BX Elementary school,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “I can’t wait to see every student at BX learning in classrooms that keep them fully connected to the great school community they have in Vernon.”The Government of B.C. is providing $11.1 million for the 240-seat addition at BX Elementary, nearly doubling the size of the school. The Vernon Board of Education is contributing $425,000 toward the project, which is expected to be ready for students in September 2021.BX Elementary is currently operating at nearly 150% capacity, with many students spending their entire days in portables, and enrolment is expected to grow. Without an addition, the number of portables at the school would be expected to double in the next 10 years.The addition means that once complete, every student at BX will be learning in classrooms. There will also be additional space to accommodate new families moving to the community.“Vernon is a great place to live, and School District 22 is a great place to learn,” said Robert Lee, board chair, Vernon School District. “These classrooms will allow all students and staff to be in one building and will enhance the inclusive and collaborative learning environment at BX Elementary.”This investment is part of government’s work to build new and expanded schools in fast-growing communities throughout B.C.Quick Facts:
Budget 2020 includes a record $2.8 billion for new and improved schools for B.C. students.
Since September 2017, the Province has announced over $2 billion for school capital projects. This includes $749 million to add more than 13,000 new student seats in B.C. schools, eliminating the equivalent of about 520 portables.

Other community exposure events continue to occur, with public alerts issued as required.“As evidenced by the number of new cases of COVID-19 in recent days, the potential for new COVID-19 cases goes up with every increase in our activity.“Public health teams are actively working to manage cases and clusters as they emerge and keep new cases low and slow.“The first incubation period since Canada Day is now complete, which means we must all have a heightened awareness to any symptoms and redoubling our efforts to stay safe.“We can be active and spend time with our close contacts, but we have to do that safely.“You may not know about the health concerns of your friends, but you can take precautions to protect them by remembering that no matter where you may go, you bring your risk with you and you share it with those around you.“COVID-19 symptoms can be mild, making it very easy to spread the virus to those around us. That is why it is so important to be 100% healthy before we step outside our door.“If you are not feeling well in any way, stay home and stay away from others. This is very important whether you are at home or travelling.“Let’s recommit to the basics of fewer faces, bigger spaces. As much as possible, we need to stay away from closed spaces, crowds and close contact with others. To do this, keep your group small, stay outside as much as possible and maintain a safe physical distance from everyone other than those in your bubble.“British Columbians have sacrificed much to flatten our curve. Let’s not lose sight of the effort we have all put in.“Pause, assess and take steps to address. Think about how you are feeling, be aware of the risks you are exposing yourself to and the risks you are sharing with others and importantly, use your layers of protection for yourself and those around you.“Let’s do the right thing for ourselves, our loved ones and our communities and keep our province safe.”Quick Facts:

From: Fisheries and Oceans Canada (canada.ca)  Eight new projects are receiving approximately $10.5M in funding through the British Columbia Salmon Restoration and Innovation Fund (BCSRIF). This brings the total number of projects funded to 38, accounting for $66.9M of $142.85M in total funding allocated. The latest projects that are receiving funding through BCSRIF include:
the Pacific Salmon Foundation will receive approximately $410,000 over three years to integrate traditional and modern technologies to automate salmon counting and species identification from video and sonar data. Connecting these tools with community-run escapement monitoring programs around the North and Central coast to inform adaptive management of salmon fisheries;
the ‘Namgis First Nation will receive approximately $1,977,000 over five years to support Phase 2 of a project to establish an independent British Columbia (BC) First Nations genomics laboratory. Project partners will equip the kł cp̓əlk̓ stim̓ laboratory to analyze samples collected through the Indigenous Monitoring and Inspection Plan (IMIP), as well as providing services to other First Nations in BC with an interest in conducting independent fish health sampling;
the Pacific Salmon Foundation will receive approximately $336,000 over one year to support upgrades to the Percy Walkus Hatchery in Rivers Inlet, which provides local capacity to enhance three local Chinook salmon stocks of significant cultural and economic significance;
the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council will receive approximately $390,000 over four years to undertake an evaluation of spatial and in-season management options for associated food, social, and ceremonial (FSC), and commercial herring fisheries to ensure the sustainability of these fisheries on the West coast of Vancouver Island;
the University of BC will receive approximately $1,829,000 over four years to provide a BC-based solution for growing larger, more physiologically robust Atlantic salmon smolts in freshwater recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). This project will help to improve both the sustainability and productivity of BC’s aquaculture industry by increasing the amount of time farmed salmon are reared in land-based RAS and reducing the amount of time farmed Atlantic salmon spend in marine net-pens;
the Lower Fraser Fisheries Alliance Society will receive approximately $679,000 over four years to contribute to an improved understanding of stock status and trends through the development of passive integrated transponder tag mark-recapture techniques for hatchery Coho salmon in the Chilliwack River during spawning migration. The infrastructure developed for this project will be used to inform future work on stock level studies of Fraser salmon;
the Pacific Salmon Foundation will receive approximately $4,619,000 over four years to develop the monitoring and evaluation framework to determine survival bottlenecks in freshwater and marine environments for hatchery and wild Chinook, Coho, and Steelhead; and,
the Spruce City Wildlife Association will receive approximately $240,000 over two years to support infrastructure upgrades to its conservation hatchery to improve biosecurity and enhance production at the facility to support the restoration and rebuilding of Upper and Middle Fraser Chinook stocks.
BCSRIF will be accepting new applications for funding from July 15 to September 15, 2020. Funding is available for projects that meet the eligibility and assessment criteria in BC. Priorities for the fund in 2020 are:
research to refine the scientific understanding of Fraser Steelhead, Chinook, and Coho through science collaborations and the incorporation of Indigenous knowledge;
habitat restoration projects that target red status conservation units or COSEWIC-listed populations;
innovative processes and technologies to increase the quality and value of BC fish and seafood products and optimize fishing operations;
projects to advance selective fishing practices aimed at minimizing bycatch of species of concern;
new aquaculture technologies and processes to improve environmental performance and increase supply chain transparency; and,
infrastructure upgrades or improvements to existing hatcheries.
Further information on the application process, timelines and program criteria are available on the BCSRIF website: www.bcsrif.ca

Changes to the Workers Compensation Act will provide better support to injured workers and their families and enhance WorkSafeBC’s ability to investigate workplace incidents, while keeping premiums low.“For too many years, we have heard from injured workers in B.C. that the system lacks fairness and doesn’t work for them or support them through their injuries,” said Harry Bains, Minister of Labour. “Today’s changes are an important step in modernizing the Workers Compensation Act, ensuring workers and their families get the support they need, while also increasing everyone’s confidence in the system.”The proposed changes focus on improving supports for injured workers, while also advancing worker safety. The changes include:
raising the maximum annual salary amount on which workers’ compensation benefits are based;
authorizing WorkSafeBC to provide preventative medical treatment before a claim is accepted;
giving powers to the court to issue WorkSafeBC search and seizure warrants that are appropriate for investigating workplace safety infractions; and
giving people a voice in serious workplace prosecutions and trials by using victim impact statements.
This legislation will fast-track the effective date of presumptions if established by WorkSafeBC’s board of directors for occupational diseases caused by viral pathogens. The presumption would simplify the process for workers who make a workers’ compensation claim if they contract viruses on the job. This would ensure that people who are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 at work are able to access benefits more quickly.During the COVID-19 pandemic, WorkSafeBC is allowing businesses to defer paying their premiums for six months without penalty or interest. As well, WorkSafeBC is waiving premiums on wages paid to workers of employers receiving the Canadian Emergency Wage Subsidy for the duration of the program.The amendments are informed by three expert reviews completed during 2018 and 2019 by Lisa Jean Helps, Paul Petrie and Terry Bogyo. Jeff Parr, an industry expert, then consulted with employers, as well as labour and Indigenous organizations, on potential amendments identified in these three reviews and made recommendations. Parr’s recommendations, and subsequently these legislative changes, also considered workers’ compensation systems in other Canadian jurisdictions and possible effects on future employer premium rates.Improving fairness in British Columbia’s workplaces is a shared priority between government, the BC Green Party caucus and independent MLA Andrew Weaver, and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:
Of the more than 44,000 injured workers currently receiving permanent disability benefits because of a work-related injury, about 35% are in the greater Vancouver area and the rest are spread throughout all regions of B.C.
Each year, there are over 100,000 new claims due to workplace injury or fatality.
Last year in B.C., there were 140 workplace fatalities. Of these, 84 were due to occupational disease, 40 were due to traumatic injury and 16 were the result of a motor vehicle incident. In the last five years, WorkSafeBC has conducted an average of 131 investigations per year. In 2019, WorkSafeBC conducted 141 investigations.
The purpose of a WorkSafeBC investigation is to determine the cause of a serious incident and any contributing factors, so that similar incidents can be prevented from happening in the future.

Youth experiencing or at risk of homelessness in the Fraser Valley will soon have access to 16 new homes with supports, funded by the Province.“Young people in our province should always have a safe and secure home,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “These 16 new homes will provide the supports and care that young people who are experiencing homelessness deserve and will help them have a bright future.”Located at 46003 Mellard Ave., the two-storey building consists of eight one-bedroom and eight two-bedroom suites, each with a private washroom, kitchen and in-suite laundry. The building has been recently renovated and has a shared kitchen, dining area, storage and amenity space, and a dedicated supportive services suite for on-site staff. Youth will begin moving in fall 2020.People living in the building will be youth between the ages of 16 and 24 who are homeless or at-risk of homelessness, precariously housed or transitioning out of care.“This new housing for youth is an important step to help them achieve their dreams and build the future they want and deserve,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “Ministry staff will be on hand to help youth access the resources they need and provide them with the right tools and supports so they can get back on their feet.”Cyrus Centre, an experienced non-profit housing provider, will operate the new supportive housing and provide residents with services that include meals, clothing, advocacy, schooling, counselling and life-skills training. Many youth experiencing homelessness are leaving situations of abuse, poverty, exploitation and drugs. Cyrus Centre works to meet the individual needs of each youth, offering programs and services to guide and equip them for success and enhance their quality of life. At least two staff members will be on site 24/7.“Cyrus Centre is thrilled with the purchase of the Mellard Avenue property and recognizes this would not have been possible without the support of BC Housing, the mayor, council and City of Chilliwack staff,” said Les Talvio, executive director, Cyrus Centre. “Once again, Chilliwack is setting the standard for other communities to follow. This property will allow for youth to overcome barriers to housing and develop the skills necessary for success.”Residents will be identified through the Ministry of Children and Family Development or self-referred. However, they do not need to be receiving services from the ministry to qualify.“Chilliwack’s Homelessness Action Plan first identified the need for additional supportive youth housing in 2016, recognizing that youth experiencing homelessness are some of the most vulnerable members of our society,” said Ken Popove, mayor, City of Chilliwack. “We are pleased to support the Province’s investment in our community and look forward to seeing the building open to its new residents.”Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government, the BC Green Party caucus and indpendent MLA Andrew Weaver, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:
The Province purchased the building for $3,896,500 through the Supportive Housing Fund. The City of Chilliwack provided $450,000 for the purchase.
Youth aged 16 to 18 years can reach out to their local Ministry of Children and Family Development or Delegated Aboriginal Agency (DAA) office for information on resources and supports, such as youth agreements, to assist them in finding a place to live, learn life skills, manage mental-health issues or enroll in school.
Young adults aged 19-27 years who have aged out of government care can connect with their local Ministry of Children and Family Development or DAA office for information on the Agreements with Young Adults program, which can help offset living costs as they attend school, rehabilitation, vocational or life-skills programs.

The COVID-19 pandemic will mark British Columbians' lifetimes in ways never thought possible, and the Province is investing in people, businesses and communities to see them through the pandemic and build back better.“B.C. has made extraordinary investments in people and businesses through B.C.’s COVID-19 Action Plan and we will continue to provide the supports people need as the pandemic and the economic impacts evolve,” said Carole James, Minister of Finance.The B.C. government has released an economic and fiscal update for 2020-21 to provide a summary of COVID-19 investments to date, as well as a scenario of revenue and deficit projections.Government has supported people and businesses with $6.26 billion in COVID-19 supports to date. That includes the $5 billion in supplementary spending for B.C.’s COVID-19 Action Plan supports, such as workers benefits, rent supplements, income and disability assistance supports and economic recovery funding. These are in addition to $1.26 billion in other tax and relief measures for people and businesses, including the one-time increase to the climate action tax credit and property tax reductions for businesses.With the pandemic response for British Columbians, and a significant revenue decline due to the pandemic, the Province’s total operating deficit for 2020-21 could be $12.5 billion, based on projections developed by the Ministry of Finance.“B.C.’s safe restart plan is creating signs of hope for our economy as consumer confidence increases. These results have only been possible because of our strong public health measures,” James said. “As we continue our work to create a strong recovery, we also have an opportunity to build a stronger B.C. that works for everyone in our province.”British Columbia has made progress flattening the curve because of its strong health policy and a commitment to help keep each other safe. The Province is building an economic recovery plan that puts people first, with input from British Columbians, businesses and community organizations – so everyone has a good job and a secure future.“The pandemic has exposed underlying gaps in our economy and society,” James said. “We have been reminded of the need for strong public services and supports, workplace safety and our collective responsibility to take care of each other, and I’m looking forward to putting people’s input into action as we move forward with the economic recovery of our province.”As part of the COVID-19 Action Plan, $1.5 billion has been earmarked for economic recovery measures to be announced in September.Quick Facts:
To date, more than 600,000 British Columbians have received the one-time, tax-free $1,000 BC Emergency Benefit for Workers.
More than 80% of B.C. families received an enhanced climate action tax credit in July – helping families with up to an additional $450, double the annual amount.
Over 200,000 people have benefited from the disability and income assistance crisis supplements.
More than 81,000 applications have been approved for the temporary rent relief supplement to date.
Over 250,000 eligible front-line workers will receive temporary pandemic pay, a lump-sum payment of about $4 per hour for a 16-week period.
Businesses are benefiting from an average 25% cut to property tax bills, deferred tax payments, BC Hydro rate reductions, eviction protection and rent relief.
On average, private sector forecasters expect B.C.’s real gross domestic product to decline by 5.4% in 2020 – better than the decline of 6.6% on average across Canada.

The Province has amended worker qualification regulations for non-medical cannabis workers to extend their security verification period from two to five years.Until now, all cannabis workers in non-medical cannabis stores were required to renew their security verification every two years. Security screening and re-screening requirements were implemented as a measure to keep organized crime out of the legal, non-medical cannabis market.Screenings involve background checks with police, courts and corrections databases. To date, 4,300 workers have been screened. The change responds to the cannabis retail industry's need for security-screened workers, reduces costs to cannabis workers and ensures they can continue employment without interruption. It will also allow provincial security screening resources to focus on the qualification of new workers rather than the requalification of current workers who are already working in the legal cannabis retail industry.All workers with a current valid security screening will have their security verification period extended from the date of their initial verification. Security verifications for all new workers will be valid for five years.Since legalization, government has worked to improve screening timelines and support industry growth, while maintaining public health and safety objectives.Learn More:View the Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch policy directive here:

While the COVID-19 pandemic has created challenges for farmers this year, farm-sales numbers from 2019 show that there is a solid foundation in place to build a path to economic recovery.As the Province continues to focus on creating a strong, resilient food system, the 2019 B.C. farm cash receipts show the sector is growing with a record $3.9 billion in sales.“For the past three years, our government has been focused on helping farmers farm and strengthening food security. We know the pandemic has impacted farmers greatly this year, but the farming sector’s record economic growth in 2019 sets the sector up for a strong recovery,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “COVID-19 has opened our eyes to the importance of our province’s self-sufficiency. I urge everyone to continue to show their appreciation for our farmers and support our local food system by making a special effort to Buy BC.”Areas of growth included a close to $300-million increase in cannabis sales, along with a $47-million increase in dairy sales, a $25-million increase in beef sales and a $17.5-million increase in field vegetable sales.As government works on the overall economic restart, more British Columbian farm workers are needed to ensure B.C.’s agriculture sector remains strong and well positioned to provide the fresh, local food that people need, through a healthy, robust food system. In every region, farmers and producers play a crucial role in contributing to both the local economy and the overall provincial economy.“Connecting more British Columbians to agriculture jobs and careers is more important than ever as we work to restart the economy and keep this momentum going,” Popham said. “We are working together with industry as we focus on restarting our farming sector.”In May, government launched the BC Farm, Fish and Food Job Connector and a digital campaign is underway to further promote these job opportunities for the summer. The Province is continuing to look at ways to unlock the prosperity of the agriculture, food and fish sector throughout B.C. with initiatives like Feed BC and the B.C. Food Hub Network.Quick Facts:
Farm cash receipts refer to the revenues from the sale of agricultural commodities, program payments from government agencies and payments from private crop and livestock insurance programs.
The record $3.9 billion in sales represent an increase of more than 13%, or $462 million more, than 2018.
Other sectors/commodities with increased sales include:
eggs - $14 million;
nursery - $14 million;
chicken - $12 million;
blueberries - $7 million;
grapes - $5.6 million; and
grains and oilseeds - $2.7 million.

The Province and the Ktunaxa Nation Council have been working together to conserve wild huckleberry and important grizzly bear habitat.As a result, the Province is restricting commercial-scale huckleberry harvesting to protect grizzly bear habitat in the Kootenay Boundary region.From July 15 to Oct. 15, 2020, commercial-scale picking of huckleberries is prohibited in some areas of the region. Maps identifying the closed areas are available online at: http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/kootenay/eco/access.htmThese areas have been identified as critical foraging zones for grizzly bear and other wildlife species. They are also of high cultural value to the Ktunaxa Nation and other First Nations.Traditionally, the huckleberry harvest was limited to First Nations’ sustenance and public household use. The recent increase in commercial-scale huckleberry harvesting in the Kootenays has resulted in conflicts with grizzly bear foraging areas and damaged habitat, particularly when mechanical harvesting devices are used. Use of mechanical harvesting devices is discouraged throughout the Kootenay Boundary as a best practice. The criteria defining commercial-scale harvesting includes:
harvest or possession of huckleberries exceeding 10 litres per person per season;
use of mechanical pickers or any device other than hand picking; and/or
harvest of any amount of huckleberries for the purpose of resale.
People picking huckleberries in continuance of an Aboriginal right recognized and affirmed by section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, may continue to access the closed areas. The identified closure areas also remain open to household picking (defined as harvest that does not include any of the criteria above defining commercial-scale use).This is the third season closed areas to commercial-scale harvest have been in effect. People are asked to look for road signs identifying the closure areas.The areas will be reviewed again prior to next year.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are providing case updates for three 24-hour reporting periods. In the first reporting period from July 10 to July 11, we had 21 new cases. From July 11 to July 12, we had 20 new cases and in the last 24 hours, we have had a further 21 new cases.“This represents 62 new cases since we reported on Friday, for a total of 3,115 cases in British Columbia.“There are 208 active cases of COVID-19 in the province and 2,718 people who tested positive have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 14 individuals are hospitalized, five of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 1,012 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,643 in the Fraser Health region, 135 in the Island Health region, 209 in the Interior Health region, 65 in the Northern Health region and 51 cases of people who reside outside of Canada.“There have been two new COVID-19 related deaths in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, for a total of 189 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks. In total, two long-term care or assisted-living facilities and one acute-care facility have active outbreaks.“There is one new isolation order and community exposure events are continuing to occur.“Interior Health has issued an isolation order for Krazy Cherry Fruit Co. in Oliver due to two positive COVID-19 cases associated with this farm. Public health teams are monitoring the situation closely and have placed restrictions on those living and working on the farm to limit the potential for further transmission.“Interior Health has also issued alerts for community exposure events in the Kelowna downtown and waterfront area between June 25 and July 9.“Anyone who was at the Discovery Bay Resort from July 1 to 5 and Boyce Gyro Beach Lodge on July 1 is directed to self-isolate. Anyone who was at Cactus Club on Water Street from July 3 to 6 and Pace Spin Studio on July 2, 4, 5, 7 to 9 is asked to monitor themselves and contact public health immediately to arrange to get tested should symptoms develop.“Now is the time to pay attention to how we are feeling and what we are doing, to keep ourselves and those around us safe.“Until a vaccine or effective treatment is available, our focus is to keep new cases low and slow. And to do this, all of us need to do our part, to show kindness and patience with those around us and take precautions to protect each other.“We must not lose sight of the fact that COVID-19 symptoms can be mild, making it very easy to spread the virus to those around us. That is why our foundational rules for safe social interactions are so important.“While the provincial health officer’s order is for no more than 50 people at any gathering, fewer faces and bigger spaces is our guide to move forward. This is important to remember when attending private parties, which tend to be indoors, gathering people from a variety of places.“Spending an extended period of time, even an evening together with a number of people in an enclosed space, increases the likelihood that you will be exposed to someone with COVID-19. As much as possible, British Columbians are asked to avoid closed spaces, crowds and close contact with others.“To keep new cases low, we need to use layers of protection. To always stay home and not travel when ill, even if we may think it is a cold or allergies; to wash our hands regularly; keep a safe distance from others and use a mask when it is more challenging to maintain physical distance.“As COVID-19 remains in our communities, the actions you take every day make a difference and will help to protect all of us.”Quick Facts:

Work will get underway this summer on upgrades to Otter Point Road and Highway 14 through Sooke to make these roads safer for people walking and cycling in the area.“We’re placing an emphasis on active transportation and public transit as we upgrade roads in the Sooke area,” said Premier John Horgan, MLA for Langford-Juan de Fuca. “By encouraging walking, cycling and public transit use, we can help make Sooke’s commercial centre even more vibrant.”Two kilometres of Otter Point Road will be widened and resurfaced between the Sooke municipal boundary and Kemp Lake Road. The work includes widening and paving the existing shoulders and improving the road’s alignment.  A construction contract for the $4.5-million project has been awarded to Scansa Construction Ltd. of Victoria. Work will begin later this month and is expected to be completed in spring 2021.“These improvements to Highway 14 and Otter Point Road are making travel easier for people who live in and around Sooke,” said Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “Adding better walking and cycling infrastructure will help build safe, healthy and active communities where people choose to leave the car at home when they go into town.”On Highway 14 through Sooke’s town centre, new concrete and paving-stone sidewalks will be installed between Otter Point Road and Atherley Close, bus pull-outs will be built and a new crosswalk will be installed near Ed MacGregor Park and the Gateway Trail.“We’re partnering with the Province on this project, which will make the Sooke town centre more welcoming to pedestrians and safer for cyclists,” said Maja Tait, mayor, District of Sooke. “By making our commercial centre more pedestrian-friendly and accessible, we’re supporting local businesses and helping to strengthen our local economy.”A construction contract has been awarded to Ramida Enterprises of Sooke. Work will begin later this month and is expected to be completed this fall. The project is valued at $1.2 million, which includes a $200,000 contribution from the District of Sooke.Provincial construction sites have protocols and policies in place following the requirements of the provincial health officer to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. These include reducing in-person meetings or gatherings, holding meetings outdoors and ensuring physical distancing of workers throughout the work day. These measures, along with other work protocols, such as daily cleaning and sanitizing of common areas and surfaces, will help ensure worker and public safety.Quick Facts:
These projects are the last of the suite of Highway 14 corridor improvements, announced in January 2018, to get underway.
The other projects, all completed, include three new transit pull-outs and a queue-jump lane on Highway 14, a new two-lane bridge on Gillespie Road, Sooke River Road intersection upgrades, a slow-moving vehicle pull-out east of Muir Creek and a new Sombrio rest area.

Government is extending the temporary authorization that permits food-primary and liquor-primary licensees to sell and deliver sealed, packaged liquor products alongside the purchase of a meal for off-site consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic.The authorization, originally set to expire July 15, 2020, will remain in place until Oct. 31, 2020. Extending the temporary authorization will provide businesses with continued relief from the financial hardship of the pandemic and help make it easier for vulnerable British Columbians to continue observing physical distancing guidelines.The extension was among a series of recommendations from the Business Technical Advisory Panel, which consists of liquor and hospitality industry representatives, to help support struggling hospitality workers and businesses during the pandemic.Before the temporary measure was introduced, restaurants and pubs were permitted to sell liquor only for consumption in their establishments unless they had a special endorsement on their licence.Existing safeguards for safe consumption, such as identity verification, continue to be in place. Individuals who deliver the liquor products are required to be certified with Serving It Right.The Province is also extending temporary authorizations that allow for increased hours of retail liquor service to provide greater opportunities for physical distancing for seniors and people who are immunocompromised.In April, the Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch (LCRB) issued a policy directive that temporarily extended liquor retail hours of service for licensee retail stores, wine stores, special wine stores and liquor manufacturers with on-site store endorsements. The Liquor Distribution Branch put into place measures to allow the same operating hours at rural agency stores.The original authorization for the extended liquor retail hours was set to expire July 15, 2020. It will now remain in place until Aug. 31, 2020.Liquor retailers, such as wine stores or private liquor stores, will continue to be allowed to temporarily operate between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. daily until the end of August 2020, if they choose to do so.Learn More:View the LCRB policy directives here:

More than 300 new homes are being proposed for people in Nanaimo as a result of a new partnership between the Province and the City of Nanaimo.These new homes will include new affordable rental homes for individuals, seniors and families, as well as new permanent, purpose-built supportive homes for people experiencing homelessness.“We are working with our partners in Nanaimo to make sure people from all backgrounds, from people who are experiencing homelessness to young families, have homes they can afford,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “This partnership will help us deliver a mix of homes for hundreds of people in the community.”The agreement includes new developments proposed on six sites around the city:
three affordable rental housing developments with approximately 125 homes for people with low to moderate incomes; and
four supportive housing developments with approximately 190 homes for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness in the community.
“We’ve been working hard with BC Housing to move forward on developing housing options,” said Leonard Krog, mayor, City of Nanaimo. “I’m extremely pleased to see these efforts come to fruition, and I look forward to our ongoing partnership with the province.”There is a clear need for more affordable and supportive housing in Nanaimo. The 2016 Canadian Rental Housing index confirmed there were more than 68,000 renters in Nanaimo and 23% of those considered themselves at risk of homelessness. In addition, the 2020 Point In Time Count for Nanaimo confirmed there were 425 people who were counted as experiencing homelessness in the city.The planned new permanent supportive housing is intended to replace the temporary housing at Labieux Road and Terminal Avenue, as well as add new supportive housing at additional locations within the city.Community members will be invited to attend virtual neighbourhood meetings this summer, which will highlight interests heard from the community to date regarding housing solutions in Nanaimo and create a space to offer further input to shape the proposed developments. (Backgrounder 1 outlines details on the developments.)Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Sheila Malcolmson, MLA for Nanaimo –“The housing crisis hit Nanaimo hard, making it difficult for people to get ahead. These new affordable housing projects add to the hundreds our government is building in partnership with the city and community groups.”Doug Routley, MLA for Nanaimo-North Cowichan –“I would like to thank BC Housing and the City of Nanaimo for working hard to develop housing solutions that will make a significant difference for hundreds of people in need in the community. Our government is committed to continuing to tackle the housing crisis facing people in Nanaimo and across the province.”Violet Hayes, executive director, Island Crisis Care Society –“Island Crisis Care Society has worked to provide shelter and care to those in need for over 30 years in the community of Nanaimo. The need has never been greater than it is now, and we are pleased that this partnership will allow those most vulnerable in our community to be supported in a real and impactful way.”John McCormick, executive director, Nanaimo Region John Howard Society – “As one of the community agencies responding to the needs of precariously housed and homeless community members, the Nanaimo Region John Howard Society is keenly aware of the valuable role of BC Housing in addressing the significant challenges that Nanaimo is seeking to address. We look forward to continuing our longstanding partnership with BC Housing through its investment in housing that is both good for our community and that contributes to fostering a safe and supported community.”Quick Facts:
Through provincial investments made since 2017, close to 850 homes are complete, under construction or in development for people with a range of incomes in Nanaimo.
In September 2018, Nanaimo City Council endorsed the Nanaimo Coalition on Homelessness’ Action Plan to End Homelessness. The Action Plan is a five-year vision to help Nanaimo end homelessness, or where homelessness persists, diminish the harms it produces, by guiding and organizing homelessness services.
Nanaimo City Council also adopted an Affordable Housing Strategy in September 2018, establishing the city’s role and priorities to promote affordable, appropriate and accessible housing in Nanaimo over 10 years (2018-28).

The  Province and Interior Health are helping to meet the needs of the growing seniors' population with the largest one-time increase in long-term care beds in the region in over 15 years.The addition of 495 long-term care beds will ensure seniors can continue to receive care where they live, as well as providing more opportunities for jobs in health care.“COVID-19 has shown what we can achieve together,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “The investments we made to raise care standards across B.C. made an important difference when we were met with COVID-19.“The plan we are setting in motion today for nearly 500 beds is what people in the region need. This historical investment is a commitment to seniors living in Interior communities, an assurance that care close to home will be available, when they need it.”There are 140 beds being planned for the Central Okanagan in Kelowna, 100 in Kamloops, 90 in Vernon, 90 in Penticton and 75 in Nelson. The exact location of the beds will be determined through the competitive bid process.Once open, the number of publicly funded long-term care beds available in the Interior Health region will increase by nearly 10%, rising to 6,550.“This is another step in a series of substantive actions that our government has taken to improve and strengthen seniors care in our province,” said Ronna-Rae Leonard, Parliamentary Secretary for Seniors. “Investing in long-term care will help recruit a new generation of health-care professionals to the interior region, ensuring that seniors can get the care they need to age well and with dignity for years to come.”  Michelle Mungall, MLA for Nelson-Creston, said: “The community of Nelson has been a strong voice for services that are truly responsive to the people and families of this area. I am thrilled that we are finally making this long-time vision come true with a strong partnership led by Interior Health and partners in community.”Interior Health has issued five requests for proposals (RFPs) for 495 new long-term care beds. The RFPs were issued Monday, July 13, 2020. Results will be evaluated in the fall and a decision will be awarded in early 2021.""Interior Health supports individuals to live independently through home and community care services. When this is not possible, long-term care is often needed,” said Doug Cochrane, board chair, Interior Health. “The government's commitment to long-term care is a welcome investment recognizing the increasing care needs of our aging population and all that we have learned from the ongoing pandemic. Residents of Interior Health can take heart that high-quality and safe long-term care options will be available now and in the future.”Government is investing more than $1 billion over three years to improve care for seniors, including investments in primary care, home health, long-term care, assisted living and respite services.This includes $240 million over three years to increase staffing levels in long-term care homes, with the goal of achieving the target 3.36 direct care hours per resident day – on average – across all health authorities by the end of 2020-21. In 2018-19, more than one million direct hours of care for seniors in long-term care homes were added throughout the province.Supporting the public health-care system is a shared priority between Government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:
In 2019, 19% of B.C.’s population was 65 years of age or older. In 15 years, this is expected to rise to 25%.
The projected growth rate of seniors who are 75 years or older in the Interior region is 28% over the next five years.
The average age of residents in long-term care facilities is 84 years.
As B.C.’s seniors population grows, it is anticipated the rates of dementia and chronic diseases in the general population will also rise.
Long-term care homes provide professional care and supervision to adults in a supportive and secure environment for people with complex care needs who cannot live safely and independently at home. This includes frail and elderly individuals with chronic conditions, such as those with dementia, as well as adults with complex health needs.

Farmers on Vancouver Island and the Southern Gulf Islands will have more support to adapt to climate change following the development of the Vancouver Island Adaptation Strategies plan.The plan identifies 11 strategies for increasing the resilience of producers in the region. The governments of Canada and B.C. will provide $300,000 in funding through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership to support projects that achieve those strategies. The projects will help farmers respond to four priority impact areas affecting the islands:
warmer and drier summer conditions;
changing pests and beneficial insects;
increasing variability and shifting suitability; and
increasing precipitation and extreme precipitation events.
“Our farmers are on the front line of climate change, and we should all be very proud of the hard work they are undertaking to adapt to changes in conditions,” said Marie-Claude Bibeau, federal Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. “By taking a region-specific approach, we are in the best position to support them with solutions customized to the unique challenges they face. At the end of the day, this is all about keeping our farmers’ operations strong and putting more locally grown food on our kitchen tables.”The Vancouver Island adaptation strategies planning process, managed by the BC Agriculture & Food Climate Action Initiative (CAI), began in summer 2019. Through a series of focus groups, the process brought together 90 farmers to work with six Vancouver Island regional districts, as well as provincial and federal agencies, to identify priorities and actions for agricultural adaptation. The plan builds on the work of a 2013 pilot project, the Cowichan Adaptation Strategies plan.“B.C. farmers are resilient by nature and experience challenges daily on their farms,” said Lana Popham, B.C.’s Minister of Agriculture. “We’re helping farmers plan and develop to respond to the challenges of a changing climate and how that affects their livelihood. These strategies, specifically designed for farmers on Vancouver Island and the Southern Gulf Islands, will help them adapt so they can continue contributing to our economy and providing the fresh local food our communities depend on.”A working group with up to 20 representatives from the agricultural sector and regional and provincial governments will oversee the development of priority projects. CAI will manage project implementation.CAI develops tools and resources that increase the capacity of agriculture to adapt to climate change. Funding is provided by the governments of Canada and British Columbia under the Canadian Agricultural Partnership, a federal-provincial-territorial initiative, and is administered by the Investment Agriculture Foundation of BC and the BC Agricultural Research & Development Corporation. In B.C., action on climate change is a shared priority between the B.C. government, the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Arzeena Hamir, owner of Amara Farm and vice-chair of the Comox Valley Regional District Board of Directors – “Farmers on Vancouver Island have long known that water availability is a critical factor for their production. Being part of the planning process was helpful for understanding the impact that climate change will have on water resources. This information is vitally important to support our current production systems as well as the future of the agriculture sector in our region.”Katie Underwood, owner, Peas n’ Carrots farm – “I feel appreciative to have been part of the BC Agriculture & Food Climate Action Initiative workshops this past winter. I look forward to the B.C. government continuing to consult with non-stereotypical farmers and listening to the voices of female farmers, organic growers, Indigenous food producers, farmers on leased land and young or new farmers to help solve problems that affects us all: climate change, food security and access to good food.”Learn More:To read the Vancouver Island Adaptation Strategies plan, visit: https://www.bcagclimateaction.ca/documents/RegionalStrategies-VancouverIsland.pdfFor more information about the Regional Adaptation Program, visit: https://www.bcagclimateaction.ca/rapFor more information about the Vancouver Island region, visit: https://vancouverisland.travel/regions/For more information about the BC Agriculture & Food Climate Action Initiative, visit: https://www.bcagclimateaction.ca/For more information on the Canadian Agricultural Partnership, visit: http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/about-us/key-departmental-initiatives/canadian-agricultural-partnership/?id=1461767369849A backgrounder follows.

People who use substances in B.C. will have greater access to ongoing support and health care services with seven new and nine expanded substance use teams to help people stay connected to health care services and treatment.“We know that most people who overdose have had contact with health services in the months prior to their death,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “These new teams will help ensure that when someone reaches out for help, they are not left to fend for themselves or sent back out into the community without support. Health professionals will walk alongside them to ensure they are connected to the resources they need when and where they need them.”The new and expanded teams help ensure that people who use substances and access the health care system can stay connected to a range of care options tailored to their needs. They also provide services to prevent overdoses and connect people to ongoing treatment as they work toward wellness and recovery.The services are tailored to the needs in each community and are comprised of a range of professionals working together, including nurses, counsellors, social workers and peers to provide individualized, person-centred care, such as:
outreach workers that bring services to people and help them get connected to services;
a mix of clinical services and social supports including access to prescribers for safe prescription alternatives to the toxic drug supply;
support for people during transitions to ensure continuity of care;
in-reach services to provide even more support for people with substance use challenges residing in supportive housing, as well as hotels or emergency response centres during COVID-19; and
connections to primary care.
The initiative will support adult clients as well as youth and young adults for whom adult services are more appropriate. Depending on the team, people may be connected through self-referral or referral from health care service providers.The initiative will provide $4.27 million in annual funding, for 2020-21, to regional health authorities across the province for new and enhanced team-based substance use care.Developing seamless and integrated substance use care and escalating the response to the overdose crisis are key pillars of government’s actions outlined in A Pathway to Hope, B.C.’s roadmap for making the system of mental health and addictions care better for people in B.C. Implementing A Pathway to Hope is a shared priority with the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts: 
A 2018 Coroners’ report that looked at 872 overdose deaths in 2016 and 2017 found that four out of every five people who died were reported to have had contact with health services in the year before their death.
The new integrated teams and resources will work to address gaps in areas of the province where existing substance use services are not meeting needs.
They will also include a focus on supporting groups who are experiencing high rates of harm related to substance use.

Middle-income families and individuals in Nanaimo will soon have access to 120 new, affordable rental homes in their community as construction gets underway on two new apartment buildings.“People deserve safe and secure homes, but even middle-income people like teachers and small business owners have struggled to find affordable housing in Nanaimo,” said Sheila Malcolmson, MLA for Nanaimo. “These new homes will mean that more people – from young families to seniors – have access to affordable housing in their community, close to their friends, family and work.”Construction is set to start in August on two apartment buildings at 4745 Ledgerwood Rd., which will provide 120 rental homes for people in Nanaimo, thanks to a partnership between the Province and WestUrban Developments. The project is being built through BC Housing’s HousingHub, which was created by the Province in 2018. The HousingHub works with community, government, non-profit and private-sector partners to help create new affordable rental housing and home-ownership options for middle-income British Columbians.“We commend the Province of British Columbia and WestUrban Developments for their commitment to developing 120 new market rental units for middle-income earners in Nanaimo as these units will be a welcomed addition in our community, and will help move people along the housing continuum,” said Leonard Krog, mayor, City of Nanaimo.The new rental homes are designed to be affordable for households with annual incomes between $44,000 and $76,000. The projects will have studio, one-bedroom, two-bedroom and three-bedroom homes. Monthly rents will range from $1,100 for a studio to $1,900 for a three-bedroom unit. Residents are expected to move in spring 2022.“We are very excited to partner with BC Housing on another project to help address middle-income rental housing needs,” said Sean Roy, CEO, WestUrban Developments Ltd. “The HousingHub is a phenomenal program that is making a difference within British Columbia. This latest project will provide high-quality residential living in Nanaimo, and we look forward to continuing to partner with BC Housing on future developments.”Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party Caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:
The Province, through the Housing Hub, is providing interim construction financing of up to $24.8 million for this project in Nanaimo.
Since 2017, the Province has provided funding for nearly 850 affordable homes in Nanaimo, including:

In the heart of Pemberton Meadows is a local brewery known for its farmhouse-style beers.Although The Beer Farmers are relatively new to the B.C. craft beer scene, they are located at Miller Farms, a place with a rich history and B.C.’s latest recipient of the Century Farm Award.“I love hearing the stories of British Columbia’s farming pioneers and the Miller family’s story is inspiring,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “From potatoes to cattle to beer, they have done it all. Congratulations Miller Farms on your Century Farm Award and cheers to many more.”William Miller arrived in Pemberton in the 1890s from Scotland and first settled in the area that is now Miller Creek. He met the Ronayne brothers in those early days. After a failed cattle drive to the Klondike Gold Rush together, they suggested he stop in and visit their sister in Ireland, Teresa Ross, as William was planning a trip back home. William and Teresa eventually married and the newlyweds made their way back to Pemberton.In 1911, the couple bought the farm from Teresa’s brother, John Ronayne. William and Teresa cleared the land and farmed vegetables, raised livestock and did some logging and prospecting when the opportunity arose. One of their sons, Donald Miller, took up the farm after returning home from service in the Canadian Engineers during World War II in Europe. Potatoes and cattle were a mainstay crop, as well as logging, hunting and trapping for extra income. Seed potatoes became a major economic force in the local region during this time, as Pemberton earned the title of seed potato capital of the world.Eventually, Bruce Miller, son of Donald Miller, took over the family farm from his dad after he passed away in the early 1990s. Potatoes and cattle continued to be the main priorities for Miller Farms and the family transitioned the farm to certified organic.In 2018, after many years of planning, they opened The Beer Farmers – family brewing, with Brenda Miller, Bruce’s wife, as head brewer, Bruce growing the barley and their five sons rounding out the brewery staff.“It is is a pleasure to accept this award on behalf of all of our family members, especially those that came before us, and the generations of hard work done expecting nothing in return but a better future for their family,” said Bruce Miller.The family is proud of the fact that every year since the farm has operated in 1911, there has been a tasty crop of potatoes planted and harvested each fall.Century Farm Awards honour agricultural organizations that have been active for a century or longer, as well as pioneers whose farms and ranches have been in families for 100 years or more. Each Century Farm Award celebrates the rich heritage of farming and ranching families and organizations in B.C.Learn More:For more information about B.C.'s Century Farm program, visit: http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/agriculture-seafood/programs/century-farm-awards

Work is expected to begin later this summer on a project to resurface two sections of Highway 97 in the areas of 100 Mile House and Lac La Hache, which will benefit residents, businesses and the community with a safer and smoother travelling surface.A tender for the project will go out later this month to resurface Highway 97 from Campbell Road to Canim-Hendrix Lake Road and Begg Road to Enterprise Road.“This project will improve the safety and reliability of this important corridor for 100 Mile House area residents and travellers,” said Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “This is something that the community has asked for and we are pleased to deliver on it.”The current highway surface is nearing the end of its service life, and this repaving will help reduce the costs of ongoing maintenance work. The project is slated to finish June 2021.“Public safety is of paramount concern to the District of 100 Mile House,” said Mitch Campsall, Mayor of 100 Mile House. “We are very grateful to the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure in its recognition of the importance of this project to move forward as expeditiously as possible. The ministry responded favourably to concerns raised by the community and you can’t ask for much more, thank you.”Provincial construction sites have protocols and policies in place following the requirements of the provincial health officer to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. These measures include physical distancing and other protocols to ensure worker and public safety.Once the project begins, drivers can expect minor delays and, at times, single lane alternating traffic. The ministry appreciates people’s patience during this resurfacing work. Drivers are reminded to obey construction zone speed limits and the direction of traffic control personnel.

British Columbians shopping for a bottle of B.C. wine will see a new area recognized for their grape-growing and winemaking on the label – the Cowichan Valley.The Cowichan Valley is being recognized as a new sub-geographical indication (sub-GI), an official and protected term under B.C. law used to help consumers identify B.C. wines’ origins. The Cowichan Valley sub-GI is roughly defined as the area between the Cowichan watershed, the eastern coastline from Mill Bay to Maple Bay and the western area of Cowichan Lake.“The Cowichan is home to family-owned and operated wineries and grape growers who have been part of the valley for generations,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “They take pride in the wines they produce and recognizing their hard work, skills and growing reputation on the B.C. and international stage is overdue. They make great wine in the Cowichan from the grapes grown in the valley, and the designation both respects and promotes that.”Defining geographic zones on wine labels connects consumers with the unique geographic area the grapes are grown and the wine is made in and increases exposure to the region for both wine and tourism businesses.“Officially recognizing the Cowichan Valley as a distinct and unique wine grape-growing region in B.C. is a testament to the hard work, passion and dedication of the many local entrepreneurs and staff in the wine industry,” said Sonia Furstenau, MLA for Cowichan Valley. “This is a well-deserved accomplishment for all those involved in producing exceptional wines and memorable winery experiences.”Wines labelled with geographical indications and/or sub-GIs commit to consumers that the wine was produced with a minimum of 95% of grapes grown from the specified region. There are nine official geographical indications in the province and five sub-geographical indications. The Cowichan Valley is the first sub-GI outside of the Okanagan and joins the Golden Mile Bench, Naramata Bench, Okanagan Falls and Skaha Bench in the Okanagan Valley.Quotes:Paul Brunner, owner, Blue Grouse Estate Winery –“The newly announced Cowichan Valley sub-GI recognizes our unique terroir and solidifies Vancouver Island’s position as an up-and-coming wine destination. Bailey Williamson, Blue Grouse’s winemaker, led the initiative, but it would not have been possible without the enthusiastic co-operation of every winery and grape grower in the valley. We are proud to be part of such a cohesive group of wine lovers and look forward to being part of an exciting future.”Jill Nessel, executive director, Tourism Cowichan –“This is an exciting opportunity for the Cowichan Valley to again be recognized as a top-quality wine-producing region. Wine enthusiasts can now add Cowichan as an area to explore wines produced with this unique terroir. While the award-winning wines and beautiful vineyards draw thousands of visitors to Cowichan every year, it is the extraordinary people behind the wines that create memorable wine-tasting and tour experiences for locals and visitors from across the globe.” Miles Prodan, president, BC Wine Institute –“Having Cowichan Valley officially recognized as a distinct and unique wine grape growing region in B.C. is testament to the maturity of the wine growers and producers in the region. To put it simply, when you now see Vancouver Island, Cowichan Valley, BC VQA (Vintners Quality Alliance) on a bottle, it is your guarantee that you’re sipping a wine that is 100% grown and made in this particular terroir of British Columbia.”Learn More:A map of the Cowichan Valley sub-GI is available at: http://www.bcvqa.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Cowichan_Valley_GIrev_2020.pdfFor information about all the geographic and sub-geographic indications in B.C., visit: http://www.bcvqa.ca/wine-regions-of-bc/For more information about Cowichan wines and visiting the valley, visit: https://www.tourismcowichan.com/eat-drink/wineries/Blue Grouse Estate Winery and Vineyard: https://www.bluegrouse.caA backgrounder follows.

Willoughby students can look forward to learning in a new school as construction gets underway.The project will also benefit families with a neighbourhood learning centre on the school grounds.“This will be more than a new school. It will be a community hub that will create opportunities close to home for families in this fast-growing neighbourhood,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “Our government is making investments like this throughout the province to ensure children are getting the best start in life and students are learning in inspiring environments.”The kindergarten to Grade 5 school will have space for 555 students. Government made the commitment to invest $28.7 million in the project in May 2019. Without the investment in the new Willoughby neighbourhood school, approximately 23 portables would be required in the school district.“We hear from parents on the Willoughby Slope who have experienced first-hand the challenges of growth in our schools,” said Alicia Rempel, president, Langley District Parent Advisory Council. “We welcome these new education spaces and understand the positive impact the neighbourhood learning centre will have on our community by creating opportunities to provide social emotional supports and programs for families.”In order to better support local families with young children, the neighbourhood learning centre has been designed to accommodate child care and before- and after-school care.“Adding child care to school grounds gives families quality and convenient care in an environment that is already designed to grow young minds,” said Katrina Chen, Minister of State for Child Care. “By partnering with local school districts, we’re bringing much-needed spaces online sooner and helping kids have a smooth transition from child care into the classroom.”The school site is on 78th Avenue, between R.E. Mountain Secondary school and Willoughby Elementary. Construction is scheduled to be completed in time for the 2021-22 school year. Once complete, a total of 2,450 school seats will have been added to the district since September 2018.Government is making record investments in B.C. schools to give every student the best learning experience possible. In two and a half years, the Province has approved over $2 billion in school capital investments, creating over 13,000 new student seats and more than 26,000 seismically safer seats.To continue to support this momentum, Budget 2020 includes a historic $2.8 billion for school capital investments over three years.Quote:Megan Dykeman, chair, Langley Board of Education –“The Langley Board of Education is committed to providing the best education possible for our children so that all learners may reach their full potential. This school will help alleviate the significant enrolment pressures we face in Langley as one of the fastest-growing areas of British Columbia. The board is excited to finally see construction underway. We are looking forward to continuing to work with the minister to address the growing needs that the Langley School District faces.”

Increased access to treatment and recovery services will help more people living with addictions during two public health emergencies – the overdose crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.The Province is investing $16 million to support new treatment and recovery beds and to support existing services that have been challenged by COVID-19.

“British Columbians are facing two public health emergencies and pressures from COVID-19 have tragically resulted in more lives lost to overdose,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “We are working at full speed to stem the tide of these dual crises and connect more people to the treatment and recovery services they need. These new beds will be another step toward building the comprehensive system of mental health and addictions care that British Columbians deserve.”Of the overall investment, $13.5 million in grant funding will increase the number of treatment and recovery beds throughout the province for people struggling with substance use challenges. Because the cost per bed differs based on its location and type of services provided, this funding is estimated to add 50 to 70 new publicly funded beds to help more people over the next three years.Funding will be directed through the Canadian Mental Health Association to deliver community grants – in consultation with the Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions and health authorities – and will prioritize underserved communities. Applications will open in August 2020 for eligible licensed and registered not-for-profit and private service providers.“The COVID-19 pandemic has compounded the existing challenges and risks for those living with mental health and substance use problems,” said Jonny Morris, CEO, Canadian Mental Health Association BC Division. “We welcome the opportunity to support the substance use treatment and recovery sector with more services and supports. This investment is an important step in strengthening community-based care and helping more people get the right care at the right time.”Treatment and recovery beds are an important part of the substance use continuum of care available for people in British Columbia. They provide safe living environments where people can focus on their recovery journey. Over the past decade, investments in bed-based care did not keep up with demand, resulting in long waitlists and lack of service in rural and remote communities.Another $2.5 million will support operators of existing bed-based treatment and recovery services that have been challenged by COVID-19. These services have continued throughout the pandemic, but COVID-19 has stretched operating budgets to the limit. This funding will help maintain quality of care and make sure critical services continue to be available when people need them.“The BC Addiction Recovery Association (BCARA) applauds the Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions on this significant announcement today. In the midst of two health crises, it is imperative that a range of interventions, including treatment and recovery, be available to those suffering from addiction,” said Brenda Plant, chair, BCARA. “Financial supports for the providers that have continued to operate during the pandemic will ensure that these essential services can continue uninterrupted. Increasing the number of recovery beds in B.C. will help our most vulnerable citizens access treatment and recovery more quickly, reduce wait times and ultimately, save lives.”Improving treatment and recovery services is an integral part of A Pathway to Hope, B.C.’s roadmap for making mental health and addictions care better for people in British Columbia. Implementing A Pathway to Hope is a shared priority with the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Learn More:A Pathway to Hope:

Carole James, Minister of Finance, has issued the following statement on the release of Statistics Canada’s Labour Force Survey for June 2020:“The monthly labour force numbers for June continue to show signs of our province’s gradual economic restart, with more than 118,000 people finding jobs last month. Employment gains in May and June have recovered 40% of the total jobs lost since February.“While these numbers are encouraging, the road ahead is a challenging one, as total job losses since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic remain at 235,000. B.C.’s June unemployment rate is down 0.4% since May at 13.0%. The rate stood at 5.0% at the start of the pandemic in February.“Women are more likely to have lost their job due to COVID-19 than men, and youth unemployment remains high at a staggering 29%. However, the significant number of youth who entered the labour force in June is a sign of growing confidence that people can return to work safely.“The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged and changed our province. Thousands of families, young people and businesses continue to struggle to make ends meet. That’s why it was essential that we acted quickly to put supports in place through our COVID-19 Action Plan. Our focus on restarting B.C.’s economy in a safe, responsible manner has also been a key contributor to our success in both battling the pandemic and gradually turning our economy around.“The co-operation and resiliency shown by people throughout B.C. in fighting back against COVID-19 continues to make a huge impact, and thanks to British Columbians, we were recently able to shift to Phase 3 of our four-phase restart plan.“As we build an economic recovery plan for our province, we are listening to the ideas of British Columbians on how to build back a stronger B.C. so everyone has a good job and secure future.”Learn More:For information on services and benefits available to help people and businesses through the pandemic, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVIDgovernmentbenefitsFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/Covid-19

B.C. companies that are developing new technologies in the electric vehicle (EV) sector can apply for $4.18 million in new funding under the CleanBC Advanced Research and Commercialization (ARC) program.“With British Columbia’s economic restart well underway, now is the time to decide the type of recovery we want to see in our province,” said Premier John Horgan. “The ARC program is part of CleanBC and the work our government has been doing since day one to power a more sustainable economy.”Part of the Province’s CleanBC plan, the ARC program supports the growth of the EV sector by providing targeted funding for the research and development, demonstration and commercialization of made-in-B.C. technologies, services and products.“Through CleanBC, we are building a low-carbon economy and creating new jobs and opportunities across the province,” said Bruce Ralston, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources. “By supporting innovative companies, we can develop and produce made-in-B.C. clean technologies, and be a global leader in the growing electric vehicle sector.”The EV sector includes companies across all aspects of the EV supply chain – from raw materials to final consumer products – related to vehicles and vehicle components, batteries and fuel cells, charging stations and other technologies. The sector includes an estimated 250 companies in B.C. that provide 6,000 full-time equivalent jobs (up by 2,150 from 2015) and contribute $600 million to the provincial gross domestic product (GDP) –almost double the 2015 GDP contribution of $373 million.“Through CleanBC we are already seeing very positive results in the EV sector, and these investments will support expanded opportunity for companies, researchers and employees,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “We are always looking for new ways to build on the knowledge and expertise that exists in British Columbia supporting innovation to build cleaner, stronger communities.”Funding submissions to the ARC program will be reviewed by a panel that includes experts from the Province, local and federal governments and B.C. post-secondary institutions.CleanBC is a pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. CleanBC was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s emission targets.Quick Facts:
Created in 2018, the ARC program provides funding to B.C. companies across all aspects of the EV supply chain. The goals of the program are to:
Create employment opportunities and expand B.C.-based businesses in the electric vehicle sector;
Attract international investment in the electric vehicle sector to B.C.; and,
Expand exports of B.C.-based electric vehicle products, services and technologies.

The ARC program awarded $1.19 million to five approved projects last year. This year, the program’s available funding has increased to $4.18 million.
Ten years after the first electric vehicles hit B.C. highways, there are now more than 42,000 on the road. 
In 2019, electric vehicles represented 9% of new cars bought in British Columbia.

“I have seen first-hand the loss and devastation catastrophic flooding can have on people, families and entire communities,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “In order to reduce the effect of flooding on people and their livelihoods, we are investing now to support flood risk assessments, mitigation and planning work. These projects help create resiliency by improving the capacity of local government and First Nations to respond to and recover from severe flooding events.”  
The total investment from this funding intake so far is $3.46 million, but additional projects may receive funding once details are finalized. Since the September 2017 Budget Update, communities and governments throughout B.C. have received more than $52 million through the CEPF.
“Preparation and mitigation are two critical pillars of emergency management,” said Jennifer Rice, Parliamentary Secretary for Emergency Preparedness. “Knowing which hazards exist and how to address them is a cornerstone of preparedness. I’m proud of our government for providing the necessary tools before a disaster hits to lay a strong foundation for improved response and recovery outcomes in our communities. I’m also encouraged to see co-operative projects between communities like Haida Gwaii and northwest Vancouver Island around regional tsunami mapping.”
The CEPF is a suite of programs designed to enhance the resiliency of local and regional governments, First Nations communities and their residents. The Province provides the funding, which is administered by the Union of B.C. Municipalities and divided into seven streams:

Flood risk assessment, flood mapping and flood mitigation planning
Emergency support services
Emergency operations centres and training
Structural flood mitigation
Evacuation routes
Indigenous cultural safety and cultural humility training
Volunteer and composite fire departments equipment and training

With the help of a $1.25-million grant from the Forest Enhancement Society of BC, the Cheslatta Carrier Nation is rehabilitating tree stands that were severely damaged by wildfires in 2018 and re-establishing productive forest ecosystems.“This project is an excellent example of how partnerships are improving the health of B.C.’s forests,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “The funding that the Province provided to back the society’s projects is making a difference and supporting jobs in many parts of British Columbia.”Work on this project started in May 2020 on the south side of François Lake between Grassy Plains, Ootsa and Cheslatta lakes, about 65 kilometres south of the Village of Burns Lake.Fire-damaged trees are being removed so the wood can be used, instead of burning fibre that would otherwise be uneconomical to deliver to a processing facility. The grant from the Forest Enhancement Society of BC will help Cheslatta Forest Products (which is 100% owned by the Cheslatta Carrier Nation) cover the costs of shipping the residual fibre to a pellet plant or bioenergy facility. Diverting this fibre from burn piles will result in a net reduction of carbon emissions.The logging operations were planned with the needs of wildlife in mind, ensuring high-value habitat areas and trees will be preserved. Rehabilitation of these fire-damaged stands will improve wildlife habitat in areas heavily impacted by the 2018 wildfires. The treated areas will be reforested, primarily with spruce seedlings.“The wildfires of 2018 burned 75% of the Cheslatta Community Forest and even more overall on the territory,” said Ben Wilson, forestry co-ordinator, Cheslatta Carrier Nation. “At Cheslatta, we were proportionally impacted along with everyone else, and our goal was to clean the burned wood off the land base and get it growing green again.”The Cheslatta Carrier Nation has a proven history in the forest industry. Its members depend on forests not only for cultural well-being, but also to provide financial opportunities. Logging had just begun in its harvest permit area when wildfires burned through much of it in the summer of 2018, resulting is a substantial loss of revenue. This project supports local employment and makes use of community-owned equipment to remove dead wood, providing benefits to the larger community and support for the local economy.“The Forest Enhancement Society of BC is excited to fund this project to improve forest stands heavily impacted by the 2018 wildfires,” said Gord Pratt, operations manager, Forest Enhancement Society of BC. “The rehabilitation of the ecosystem to pre-fire conditions will improve the damaged forests by creating diverse, healthy stands. It will contribute to the future timber supply and improve many forest values, including wildlife habitat.”Quick Facts:
The Forest Enhancement Society of BC, a Crown agency, was established in 2016 to advance environmental and resource stewardship of the province’s forests by:
preventing and mitigating the impact of wildfires;
improving damaged or low-value forests;
improving habitat for wildlife;
supporting the use of fibre from damaged and low-value forests; and
treating forests to improve the management of greenhouse gases.

The B.C. government has invested $235 million in the society, with about $233 million allocated as of Jan. 30, 2020, for wildfire risk reduction, reforestation, forest rehabilitation, wildlife habitat restoration and raising awareness of the FireSmart program.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are announcing 18 new cases, for a total of 3,008 cases in British Columbia.“There are 162 active cases of COVID-19 in the province and 2,660 people who tested positive have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 17 individuals are hospitalized, three of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 1,018 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,589 in the Fraser Health region, 133 in the Island Health region, 203 in the Interior Health region and 65 in the Northern Health region.“There have been three new COVID-19 related deaths in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, for a total of 186 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks and the outbreak at Tabor Home has been declared over. In total, two long-term care or assisted-living facilities and one acute-care facility have active outbreaks.“While there are no active community outbreaks in B.C., new cases and community exposure events continue to occur in the community.“There has been a community exposure event at the No. 5 Orange nightclub in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. Public health teams have issued an alert for anyone who may have been at the premises on July 1.“If you have been at a location with a community exposure event, monitor yourself for symptoms, limit your contact with others and contact 811 to arrange for testing if any symptoms develop.“Contact tracing to contain the spread of COVID-19 requires all of our involvement to be successful.“Public alerts and the temporary closure of businesses are some of the ways public heath teams are working to effectively manage COVID-19 in our communities.“What each of us can do to support contact tracing activities is to complete our own personal risk assessment when deciding where to go and who to see.“Fewer faces, bigger spaces is the safest approach, because we know crowded, closed spaces where people may be in close contact with each other are higher-risk environments for all of us and need to be avoided at this time.“As we have seen in many other locations around the world, one slip can quickly cause a surge in new cases. We have also seen here in B.C. that our foundational rules for safe social interactions help to protect all of us.“This summer, we can travel within our province, we can enjoy many activities and we can spend time with friends and family. And we can do this safely by all of us doing our part to keep our curve flat.”Quick Facts:

Construction is underway on 40 new homes for Indigenous families, individuals and Elders in Langford through a partnership between the Province, M’akola Housing Society and the City of Langford.“Housing is the foundation on which people build their lives, and everyone in our community deserves a safe, secure and affordable home,” said Premier John Horgan, MLA for Langford-Juan de Fuca. “With these new homes, more Indigenous peoples in Langford will have the peace of mind that comes from having good housing in their community, surrounded by their friends, family and culture.”Located at 731 Station Ave., Phase 1 of the project is complete and consists of 60 homes in a six-storey wood-frame apartment building. The building features a mix of studio, one-bedroom, two-bedroom and three-bedroom apartments. Monthly rents range from $375 to $1,500 per month. Residents will begin moving in on July 15, 2020.The ground floor of the building includes office space for two Indigenous non-profit societies: Indigenous development consulting firm M’akola Development Services, and Hulitan Family and Community Services Society. The latter offers culturally sensitive services and programs for Indigenous youth and families.Construction is now underway on Phase 2 of the project, which will be a six-storey wood-frame apartment building with 40 homes. The building will include a mix of one-bedroom, two-bedroom and three-bedroom units with monthly rents not exceeding 30% of household income. Phase 2 is expected to be complete in fall 2021.“M’akola Housing Society and M’akola Development Services are headquartered in the City of Langford, and we want to acknowledge the city’s instrumental support of affordable housing,” said Kevin Albers, CEO, M’akola Housing Society and M’akola Development Services. “This project is a beautiful display of the value of strategic partnerships and how they benefit the community. We have created a space providing safe, affordable homes for Indigenous and non-Indigenous families through BC Housing, a purpose-built office space for Hulitan providing Indigenous family services, and M’akola Development Services, which specializes in developing affordable housing across B.C. and providing career opportunities for Indigenous professionals.”Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Stewart Young, mayor, City of Langford –“I want to acknowledge the tremendous efforts of M’akola for its continued dedication to providing quality housing to Langford residents. We have been working with M’akola since the 1980s and have seen the efforts of M’akola change many lives. We are proud to support this project. It’s one of the best-looking buildings in Langford.”

Kendra Gage, executive director, Hulitan Family and Community Services Society –“The partnership between Hulitan and M’akola allows us to offer service provision in the same building where families live. Sometimes housing alone isn't enough to keep families together, and without the relationship with M’akola, this wouldn’t be possible. This project is a demonstration of Indigenous ways of being, it’s about relationships and community, and we know M’akola shares the same values as us, and together we will provide much-needed services to families in Langford.”Margaret Pfoh, CEO, Aboriginal Housing Management Association (AHMA) –“AHMA is grateful for our members M’akola Group of Societies for ensuring Indigenous housing vulnerabilities are met through Indigenous community-led solutions. Not only has Kevin Albers and his team at M’akola created 60 new affordable homes, but they have established a community that will provide culturally relevant programs, services and practices that will honour Indigenous traditions, values and history. Indigenous housing is more than putting roofs over heads – it’s about creating a welcome place for every Indigenous person to belong to, and M’akola has successfully achieved that here in Langford at 731 Station Ave. AHMA looks forward to the completion of Phase 2 and welcoming more future residents to the community.”Quick Facts:
The Province is providing $8 million through the Indigenous Housing Fund, as well as an annual operating subsidy of approximately $430,000, toward Phase 2 of the Station Avenue project.
The City of Langford provided approximately $400,000 in municipal waivers.
M’akola Housing Society provided the land valued at approximately $1.4 million and $750,000 in equity.

The B.C. government has formally extended the provincial state of emergency, allowing Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, to continue to use extraordinary powers under the Emergency Program Act to support the Province's COVID-19 pandemic response.“We’re starting to see some restrictions lifting, but there are measures we need to keep in place to continue battling COVID-19,” said Premier John Horgan. “We will continue to take the necessary steps to make sure British Columbians are safe and that the most vulnerable people are protected, while experts work to find a treatment or vaccine.”The state of emergency is extended through the end of the day on July 21, 2020. This will allow government to continue to take the necessary steps to keep British Columbians safe while measures that would allow the state of emergency to be lifted seek legislative approval.“We’ve made a commitment to British Columbians to do all that we can to keep COVID-19 at bay,” Farnworth said. “The extension of the state of emergency will allow us to keep orders in place to ensure public safety until measures are in place to transition out of the state of emergency.”On June 22, government introduced the COVID-19 Related Measures Act, legislation to allow provisions created for people and businesses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to continue as needed after the provincial state of emergency ends.Actions taken in the previous two weeks to support British Columbians include:
completing a successful school restart, with almost 200,000 students safely returning back to the classroom;
launching a $5-million Youth Community Partnership program to engage youth to work on community service projects to help communities build back better from COVID-19 impacts;
investing in a suite of initiatives to protect long-term care and assisted-living residents from COVID-19 as facilities begin allowing visitors;
enhancing B.C.’s climate action tax credit as part of the B.C. COVID-19 Action Plan to help make sure people and businesses have the support they need while B.C. works through its restart plan; and
extending the federal employment insurance exemptions and the temporary crisis supplement to ensure people on income or disability assistance, or low-income seniors, continue to have the supports they need.
The extension of the provincial state of emergency is based on recommendations from B.C.’s health and emergency management officials. Farnworth made the original declaration on March 18, 2020, after Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, declared a public health emergency the previous day.Quick Facts:
Declarations of provincial states of emergency may be issued by the minister responsible under the Emergency Program Act.
The provincial government can extend the period of a declaration made by the minister responsible for further periods of up to 14 days at a time.

Effective immediately, Diane Nicholls, British Columbia’s chief forester, has set the new allowable annual cut for Tree Farm Licence (TFL) 26 near Mission to 60,000 cubic metres.The licence, held by the Corporation of the District of Mission, is located north of the community of Mission, approximately 60 kilometres east of Vancouver.The new cut level set by the chief forester is 33% higher than the previous level of 45,000 cubic metres that was set in 2010. The increase reflects updated data, which indicate tree stands have higher volumes and are growing faster than previously estimated.There are 6,563 hectares available for timber harvesting in TFL 26, which is 10,935 hectares in size. The major tree species is western hemlock, followed by Douglas fir.The licence area was awarded to the District of Mission in July 1958 and is recognized as the first community-managed forestry operation in B.C.The chief forester’s allowable annual cut determination is an independent, professional judgment, based on information ranging from technical forestry reports, First Nations and public input to the government’s social and economic goals.Under the Forest Act, the chief forester must determine the allowable annual cut in each of the province’s 37 timber supply areas and 34 tree farm licences at least once every 10 years.

British Columbians now have more virtual options to set up their mobile BC Services Card.These options make it easier to access online government services during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the future.“We’re using innovation, technology and mobile options to improve the way we deliver services and programs to British Columbians,” said Anne Kang, Minister of Citizens’ Services. “Our new Send Video feature within the mobile BC Services Card gives people the choices and tools they need to connect with government supports and services quickly, safely and securely.”During the COVID-19 pandemic, more and more people need online and telephone access to crucial government services. This is resulting in high call volumes to Service BC and an increased demand for alternative ways to verify a person’s identity in order to activate a mobile BC Services Card. To address this demand, the Province has launched Send Video, a remote identity-verification option for British Columbians.People can use Send Video within the BC Services Card app from their iPhone, iPad, Android phone or tablet to send Service BC a photo and a short video of themselves at any time, day or night. A Service BC representative reviews and verifies the person’s identity and activates their mobile BC Services Card for online use within just a few hours. This service eliminates the need to visit a Service BC Centre for in-person identity verification. Seventeen government services are available online with plans underway to bring more on board. British Columbians, including health professionals, businesses, government employees and students can use their BC Services Card to access these services.One of the most popular services is StudentAid BC. As students begin to apply for StudentAid for the fall semester, they will be able to take advantage of this new service to begin and track their applications. “With all the stress that COVID-19 has put on students, this new video service helping them verify their identity online makes it especially quick, easy and secure for them to apply for StudentAid BC,” said Bob D’Eith, MLA for Maple Ridge-Mission, on behalf of Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “It’s a service that couldn’t have come fast enough, especially as students prepare to continue their education in the fall during these challenging times.”The BC Services Card Verify by Video service, which launched in June 2019, allows people to use the service to launch a live video call with a Service BC representative within the BC Services Card mobile app. During the call, the representative verifies their identity and then activates their mobile BC Services Card. Send Video adds another identity verification option to the Verify by Video service.British Columbia is the first jurisdiction in North America to use an identity-verification solution using video. These services are another step forward in government’s work to help British Columbians conveniently, safely and quickly access services online. They also support B.C.’s new digital framework, which aims to improve the experiences and interactions people have with government.Quick Facts:
The BC Services Card, which launched in 2013, allows British Columbians to access government services, both online and in person, with confidence their privacy is respected and their data is secure.
To date, about 4.7 million British Columbians have a BC Services Card.
To be ready to access online services with a BC Services Card, a citizen must go through a verification step, where their identity is confirmed by a Service BC customer service representative. 
The BC Services Card mobile app was launched in 2018. To date, more than 125,000 mobile BC Services Cards have been activated for online access to government services.
More than 53,000 B.C. post-secondary students have already used the Verify by Video service to verify their identity and activate their mobile card to access StudentAid BC, since it launched in 2019.

A Kamloops firm will begin work this summer to expand the Trans-Canada Highway near the Village of Chase from two to four lanes, making travel safer for people and more efficient for trade.The $25.9-million contract for the Chase Creek Road to Chase West project has been awarded to Dawson Civil Limited of Kamloops and will prioritize hiring local workers through a Community Benefits Agreement.“I’m happy to announce this project has been awarded to a local firm and construction will begin this summer,” said Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “Now is the right time to build infrastructure that hires local workers and improves our communities who are struggling with the impacts of COVID-19.”A 3.3-kilometre section of Highway 1 will be widened to four lanes with a centre median barrier, improving safety. The project also includes:
at-grade protected T-intersections with lighting at both Chase Creek Road and Shuswap Avenue;
a grade-separated pedestrian crossing and multi-use pathway to link the Neskonlith Indian Band and the Village of Chase communities;
a cattle underpass to comply with Agricultural Land Commission requirements; and
conversion of the existing highway to frontage road to consolidate access.
During construction, every effort will be made to minimize disruption and impacts to local traffic, and updates will be provided via DriveBC.“This project will help diversify and grow B.C.’s skilled workforce,” Trevena said. “Apprentices will also get the opportunity to work on site and gain the experience they need to launch life-long careers.”The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure is working closely with all contractors and WorkSafeBC to ensure health and safety are maintained for all workers on site.Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, protocols have been in place following the requirements of the provincial health officer that kept construction sites open and ensured work was happening safely. These include reducing in-person meetings or gatherings, holding meetings outdoors and ensuring physical distancing of workers throughout the work day. These measures, along with daily cleaning and sanitizing of common areas and surfaces, will help ensure worker and public safety.Under the Community Benefits Agreement, the project will prioritize hiring local workers, Indigenous peoples, women, people with disabilities and other under-represented groups who are qualified to do the work in a safe, welcoming environment. Additionally, this project will provide opportunities for Red Seal apprentices to work on site and gain the experience they need to launch careers in the trades.Learn More:Highway 1 four-laning program: http://www.bchwy1.caJob opportunities for the Chase four-laning project: https://bcib.ca/For the most up-to-date highway travel information, visit: DriveBC.ca

The Province, through BC Housing, has bought the former Rose Bowl Restaurant in Campbell River and will convert it into bridge housing for locals experiencing homelessness.“This project will provide people in our community with a safe place to sleep while we work with our partners to build the permanent homes they deserve,” said Claire Trevena, MLA for North Island. “We know our community is safer and healthier when everyone has a place to call home, with supports and services to help them succeed, and we are working closely with the city to build new permanent supportive housing as fast as possible.”Renovations to the building, located at 1221 Cedar St., will begin immediately to create space for 20 beds. The bridge housing will provide residents with a bed, showers and meals, as well as many of the support services found in permanent supportive housing.Vancouver Island Mental Health Society will oversee day-to-day management of the facility. Society staff will be on site 24/7 and will provide guests with outreach services, as well as connection and referral to health services.“On behalf of the entire community, council extends our appreciation for the quick action by the Province and minister of municipal affairs and housing to ensure temporary housing is available in a central location for people who need additional support, especially with the added complications brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Andy Adams, mayor, City of Campbell River. “Establishing bridge housing in this location, run by an organization with proven experience in our community, will support people who have limited or no alternatives for housing. This is also welcome as it bridges services until longer-term supportive housing is available, a much-needed form of housing in Campbell River.”The project is expected to open in August 2020 and will be operational until a new permanent supportive housing project is in place. BC Housing is working with the City of Campbell River to explore potential supportive housing locations and will provide more information to the public once a plan for permanent supportive housing has been developed.“We are pleased to partner with the Province and BC Housing to operate this bridge housing for the homeless in Campbell River,” said Taryn O’Flanagan, CEO, Vancouver Island Mental Health Society. “Having a place to stay is an important step in maintaining the well-being of vulnerable people in this community.”Once the permanent supportive housing is built and residents leave the bridge housing, BC Housing will engage with the community about redeveloping the site at 1221 Cedar St. into an affordable housing project.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:
The B.C. government purchased the Rose Bowl Restaurant in Campbell River for $985,000 through the Supportive Housing Fund.
In addition to this project, the Province is working in partnership to deliver close to 120 new affordable homes for people in Campbell River:
41 homes at the recently purchased Heritage Inn for people who were displaced by the fire at the Pacific West complex.
49 homes for women and children leaving violence.
27 homes for people with low to moderate incomes, including those with brain injuries and their families (Linda’s Place).

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are providing case updates for three 24-hour reporting periods. In the first reporting period from July 3 to July 4, we had nine new cases. From July 4 to July 5, we had 15 new cases and in the last 24 hours, we have had a further seven new cases.“This represents 31 new cases since we reported on Friday, for a total of 2,978 cases in British Columbia.“There are 166 active cases of COVID-19 in the province and 2,629 people who tested positive have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 16 individuals are hospitalized, four of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 1,008 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,570 in the Fraser Health region, 132 in the Island Health region, 203 in the Interior Health region and 65 in the Northern Health region.“There have been six new COVID-19 related deaths over the past three days: four in the Vancouver Coastal Health region and two in the Fraser Health region, for a total of 183 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks. In total, three long-term care or assisted-living facilities and one acute-care facility have active outbreaks.“While cases continue to occur in the community, there are no active community outbreaks in B.C.“With our ‘new COVID-19 normal,’ we can all enjoy many activities by following the rules we have established for safe social interactions. The rules are the foundation to safely move forward.“Young or old, in a city or in a small town, our new normal is doable for everyone.“Anyone who is new to British Columbia from elsewhere in Canada, whether coming for work or on vacation, needs to understand that here in B.C. we are keeping our contacts small, maintaining a safe distance from others, using masks when that is challenging to do and always staying away from others if we are feeling ill.“Anyone from outside of Canada who is here for essential travel or returning home is required to follow Canada’s quarantine order to self-isolate for 14 days prior to interacting with others.“While the quarantine order is an important part of Canada’s border protection during COVID-19, we remind all British Columbians that we must show kindness and understanding to those around us.“We have to remember that many Canadians reside elsewhere and are only now returning home or may have returned home in the past few months. Let’s lead by example, assume the best and remember we do not always know everyone’s story.“COVID-19 has created many uncertainties and fear, but we have built a path forward that will keep all of us safe in the weeks and months ahead.“Through our own personal efforts and actions, we can protect our communities, our seniors and Elders and our loved ones. Our public health teams are monitoring and managing new cases as we have modified how we run our businesses and spend time with others.“We have worked hard to flatten our COVID-19 curve and by continuing to stay vigilant and work together, we can continue to keep our province safe.”Learn More:For more information about BC’s Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/restartbcFor B.C.’s surgical renewal plan, visit:

Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, has released the following statement in response to the First Nations Health Authority release on the overdose death rate:“Since the overdose crisis was first declared in 2016, First Nations throughout British Columbia have shouldered immense loss. The First Nations Health Authority report on overdose shows us just how devastating it has been. This year alone, First Nations peoples are dying from overdose at more than five times the rate of the rest of the B.C. population. First Nations peoples in rural and urban communities are over-represented in this crisis.“During this extraordinary time, as we stare down the fentanyl poisoning crisis and the global COVID-19 pandemic, coming together to harness our collective efforts, our compassion and resolve is more important than ever. In 2019, we saw a significant drop in the overdose death rate amongst First Nations, 44% lower than the previous year. This shows that through our collective efforts we were making an impact before COVID-19, though there is still so much more to do. The global pandemic has posed significant challenges for everyone. But when we work together and focus our energies with First Nations in the driver’s seat, we can and we do make significant gains.“Together we are making significant progress to expand on First Nations-led treatment services, so they are accessible to First Nations individuals, families and communities for culturally safe mental health and addictions treatment. The Province, together with the First Nations Health Authority, is making investments of $40 million to build and renovate First Nations-run treatment centres throughout B.C. Reconnecting to land, history and culture is the focus of an additional $23 million that we are investing in land-based healing programs and services. First Nations designed and delivered programs and services have also received $30 million to flow directly to First Nations communities to meet their peoples’ needs in their communities. We have learned that barriers can come down when health-care services are culturally safe and community led. Addressing the root causes and underlying factors of addiction is a key part of our shared work.  “Indigenous communities are still carrying the weight of the dark legacy of colonialism and the multi-generational trauma that is the result of that history. Through First Nations-led decision-making and service-delivery structures, we are addressing the enormous challenges ahead of us. From day one, we have worked in close partnership the First Nations Health Authority in our collective response to the overdose emergency. Together, we can turn the tide on this terrible crisis. We will not rest until we do.“Not everyone is on the same path, but everyone needs our compassion and a chance to live. I am appealing to everyone who uses drugs and their loved ones. There are options to staying safe. Buddy up so you’re not using poisoned drugs alone, carry naloxone, know the signs of an overdose, get your drugs checked, visit overdose prevention, consider safe prescription alternatives, discuss recovery options with your health provider.“Let’s continue to look out for one another. Let’s continue to take care of each other. Let’s continue to come together to save lives from overdose.”

A new, 450-seat addition is coming to GW Graham Secondary school to eliminate portables and give Chilliwack students a better learning experience.“Families in Chilliwack deserve to see their children learning in the best possible environments,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “With yet another new expansion project coming to Chilliwack, even more students will benefit from positive, engaging and inspiring classrooms, and their educational experience will be better as a result.”The Government of B.C. is providing the Chilliwack School District with up to $23.9 million to increase the capacity of GW Graham Secondary to 1,400 seats by September 2022, eliminating eight portables currently in use at the school.“Students in our community are continuing to see the benefit of the increased provincial investment in Chilliwack schools over the past three years, with new and expanded schools being built where they’re needed most,” said Dan Coulter, chair, Chilliwack Board of Education. “I can’t wait to see GW Graham students learning in brand-new classrooms, just as they will be soon at other new and expanded schools in Chilliwack.”This project is part of the record investment in Chilliwack schools and students. In the last three years, $115.2 million has created 2,220 new student seats, eliminating the equivalent of about 90 portables in one of the fastest-growing areas of the province.Other investments in the district include a new, 930-seat south-side elementary-middle school, a new, 600-seat Imagine High secondary school and a 240-seat addition at Vedder Elementary school.""This expansion is necessary to accommodate significant growth in our community,” said Cynthia Watson, president, GW Graham parent advisory council. “It will allow the school to respond and adapt to the current and future needs of our students.""Creating new student seats in Chilliwack and other fast-growing communities is part of government’s plan to provide the best learning experience possible to B.C. students.Quick Facts:
Since September 2017, the Province has announced over $2 billion for 96 school capital projects throughout B.C., including creating 12,840 student seats at 32 new or expanded schools and 47 seismic upgrades or replacements, creating nearly 26,000 safe student seats.

The Province is extending federal employment insurance exemptions and the provincial temporary crisis supplement.These extensions will help ensure people on income or disability assistance and low-income seniors will continue to have access to the supports they need during the pandemic.“B.C.’s response to COVID-19 has been strong and swift, but we are not out of the woods yet,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “The extension of these programs will allow some breathing room for people to get back on their feet as we move through our restart plan.”On April 2, 2020, the Province announced a three-month exemption of all federal employment insurance benefits, including the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, for people already receiving income or disability assistance at that time. This exemption was put in place to ensure current clients whose employment may have been impacted by COVID-19 did not face any additional barriers and could fully benefit from federal emergency response programs.This exemption, which now includes the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (effective May 1, 2020), has been extended for the duration of these federal emergency support programs so that eligible people will continue to fully benefit without any reductions to their monthly income or disability assistance payments.For those who are not eligible for the federal benefits, the Province’s temporary COVID-19 Crisis Supplement, which has been provided since April, will be extended an additional two months. This supplement will continue to be provided to low-income seniors receiving the B.C. Senior’s Supplement and income assistance and disability recipients residing in special care facilities. No action is required from recipients. The temporary $300 crisis supplement will continue to be automatically applied to cheques distributed July 22 and Aug. 26, 2020.These interim measures are part of the B.C. government’s COVID-19 Action Plan to provide income supports, tax relief and direct funding for people, business and services. Learn More:For more information on supports for people on income or disability assistance:

From: Infrastructure Canada (infrastructure.gc.ca) DELTA - New investments in community infrastructure by the governments of Canada and British Columbia will benefit Lower Mainland communities while also supporting economic recovery in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic by getting projects underway and meeting communities’ needs as they restart their economies.These investments will play a key role in strengthening local economies, and helping ensure sure all British Columbians have access to the services and cultural networks they need to build resilient communities.Today, the Honourable Carla Qualtrough, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion and Member of Parliament for Delta, on behalf of the Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities, and the Honourable Maryam Monsef, Minister for Women and Gender Equality Rural Economic Development; and Ravi Kahlon, Member of the Legislative Assembly for Delta North, on behalf of the Honourable Selina Robinson, B.C. Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, announced funding for 21 projects in the Lower Mainland under the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Plan.In North Delta, the funding will support a new track facility featuring an eight-lane track with a synthetic surface, and an infield made of natural turf. The new venue will also include field lighting, bleachers, additional parking as well as multi-purpose outdoor courts. This community-focused facility will open up new opportunities for residents to stay healthy, come together, train local athletes, and host athletic events.In the District of Squamish, a new sea dyke will be built in Xwu’nekw Park on the Mamquam Blind Channel to address increasing flooding due to rising sea levels. This will help keep people’s homes safe, protect local businesses, and preserve other essential infrastructure communities rely on daily. The work also includes enhancing the site with a new walkway, landscaping, lighting, trees and benches.Among the other projects receiving this funding are improvements to community centres, health centres, storm water management, drinking water and wastewater facilities, cultural facilities and social support hubs.The Government of Canada is investing more than $44.5 million, the Government of British Columbia is contributing over $19.2 million, and the applicants (municipalities, Indigenous communities and not-for-profits) are contributing more than $22.3 million to these projects through the Community, Culture, and Recreation Infrastructure Stream (CCRIS), and the Rural and Northern Communities Infrastructure Stream (RNIS) of the Investing in Canada Plan.More than $19.4 million of the federal and provincial funding is going to nine projects in Indigenous communities.Further announcements of infrastructure investments will follow in the coming months as Canada and British Columbia work together to support jobs, improve our communities, and safely and sustainably restore economic growth.Quotes“When we invest in infrastructure projects like the North Delta Track, we are enriching our communities, making them more resilient and inclusive for the future.  Delta families for generations will benefit from the North Delta Track, as it is sure to become a hub of community activity. Delta athletes will be able to train in Delta. Seniors will have a safe and accessible place to walk and gather. Children and families will have more space to play and be active. Our Government understands the important role that sport, recreation and active living play in our communities. We are also investing in infrastructure projects across the Lower Mainland that are working to make communities more resilient to climate change and increasing flood risks, working to improve community and health centres as well as drinking water facilities.

With increased travel a part of British Columbia’s transition to Phase 3 of BC's Restart Plan, passengers on the Province’s inland ferry system are reminded to adhere to Transport Canada’s COVID-19 safety protocols.Most importantly, all inland ferry passengers travelling by vehicle must remain in their vehicles for the duration of the trip to help protect the safety of passengers and crew. Passengers crossing Kootenay Lake who are not prepared to stay in the vehicle for the full duration of the 35-minute sailing should consider driving the Kootenay Pass instead of taking the ferry.All COVID-19 safety guidelines are set by Transport Canada to reduce the risks of COVID-19. Additional safety measures in place include:
All passenger amenities aboard the ferry are closed until further notice to limit interaction amongst passengers.
Walk-on passengers, cyclists and motorcyclists are encouraged to wear cloth masks or face coverings and maintain physical distance in designated zones.
Walk-on passengers, cyclists and motorcyclists with symptoms of COVID-19 are not permitted aboard the inland ferries. 
These safety measures are in effect until further notice. Signage is displayed at terminals.When you go on the road this summer, bring the rules of home with you and follow provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry’s travel manners:
check before you go;
fewer faces in bigger spaces;
if sick, stay home;
wash your hands;
keep a safe physical distance;
come prepared and bring supplies; and
respect all travel advisories.
Check DriveBC as busy sailings may experience higher wait times due to reduced passenger limits.Summer service schedule at Kootenay Lake begins on July 17, 2020. Learn More:For more information on B.C.’s inland ferry routes, click here: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation/passenger-travel/water-travel/inland-ferriesFor travel precautions due to COVID-19, visit: http://ow.ly/jBGu50yVMRO

65,2020-07-02 17:15:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020EMBC0035-001217,Government Website,British Columbians urged to take caution as water levels rise in province,"

The Province is urging caution and encouraging the public to prepare for localized flooding as water levels are expected to rise in several regions of the province due to heavy rainfall.Areas currently under a flood warning:
the Upper Fraser River, including its tributaries and around Prince George; and
the Quesnel River.
Areas currently under a flood watch:
the Peace region; 
northeastern B.C.;
the Cariboo region, including tributaries and areas around Williams Lake and 100 Mile House;
the Chilcotin River and its tributaries, including Big Creek and the Chilko River;
the Fraser River from Prince George to Boston Bar; and
the North Thompson River, South Thompson River and Thompson River at Kamloops.
As well, there are high lake level conditions and high streamflow throughout much of B.C., including: all areas along the Fraser River and its tributaries, the Quesnel River, the Thompson River and tributaries, and in the Peace and Chilcotin regions.“Water levels rising in these areas are high and very fast moving, so people need to take extra caution right now and be prepared,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “I want to stress that any sort of recreation on these waters is highly dangerous right now, so let’s make sure we’re not taking any unnecessary risks.”Below are some tips to help British Columbians prepare for potential flooding:
Keep clear of eroded banks, as they may result in unstable ground. Most importantly, keep children and pets away from stream banks.
With higher water levels, boaters and water users can expect increased debris.
Boaters should be aware of the effect their wake can have on shorelines and reduce speed accordingly. Wave action can cause erosion or flooding.
Never drive or walk through flooded streets. Water can be deeper than it appears, and levels can rise very quickly.
Stay alert for changing conditions, particularly if you live in low-lying areas or near waterways.
Listen to local officials and follow their instructions if asked to evacuate.
With the potential for high water in many areas of the province, there is a potential for evacuation alerts and evacuation orders. Emergency Support Services (ESS) has launched a new digital registration system, the Evacuee Registration Assistance (ERA) tool, that allows evacuees to register online rather than in person at an evacuation centre. This means that people who are evacuated during an emergency will have a virtual way to access support while maintaining the physical distancing required to protect evacuees and ESS volunteers from COVID-19.If placed on evacuation alert, you are encouraged to reach out to your local government to learn more about how you can be supported should you be evacuated. This will look differently in each community, including instructions on when to self-register using the ERA tool.If placed under evacuation alert, you should immediately:
Get prepared to leave your home on short notice.
Get grab-and-go bags ready. (They should include several days of clothing, toiletries and medications, your emergency plan, copies of important documents and mementos.)
Listen to local emergency officials for further information on the situation.
If you are placed under evacuation order, you must:
Leave the area immediately.
Follow the directions of local emergency officials and evacuate using the route(s) they have identified.
Do not return home until you have been advised that the evacuation order has been rescinded.
Emergency Management BC’s role is to co-ordinate provincial support to local and First Nations governments and collaborate with a number of different agencies, including:
Environment and Climate Change Canada,
the River Forecast Centre,
emergency managers from:
the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure;
the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy;
the Ministry of Agriculture and the Water Management Branch;
the Ministry of Health; and
other partners, such as the First Nations Health Authority, Indigenous Services Canada and a number of non-governmental organizations.

British Columbians can find more details in the new Flood Preparedness Guide released by PreparedBC. The guide contains useful information that will help British Columbians better protect themselves and their homes and understand what to do if their home or community is at risk of flooding.Quick Facts:
A high streamflow advisory means river levels are rising or expected to rise rapidly, but no major flooding is expected. Minor flooding in low-lying areas is possible.
A flood watch means river levels are rising and will approach or may exceed bankfull. Flooding of areas adjacent to affected rivers may occur.
A flood warning means river levels have exceeded bankfull or will exceed bankfull imminently, and flooding of areas adjacent to the rivers affected will result.

The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 989 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,553 in the Fraser Health region, 132 in the Island Health region, 201 in the Interior Health region and 65 in the Northern Health region.“There have been three new COVID-19 related deaths, two in the Vancouver Coastal Health region and one in the Fraser Health region, for a total of 177 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks. In total, four long-term care or assisted-living facilities and one acute care facility have active outbreaks.“There have been no new community outbreaks and the outbreak at New World Technologies has been declared over. This means there are no active community outbreaks in B.C.“A summer in Phase 3 of BC’s Restart Plan means all of us working together to keep our province safe. Whether you live in B.C., are a visitor from another province or are in Canada for essential travel, we all have to do our part to protect our communities, our Elders and our loved ones.“Any traveller from outside B.C. needs to understand that we have established clear rules for safe social interactions, which include keeping our bubbles small, maintaining a safe distance from others and staying away from others if you are feeling ill.“Like all British Columbians, whether a resident or not, if you develop symptoms of COVID-19, isolate yourself immediately and call 811 to arrange to be tested.“We remind anyone coming to British Columbia from outside of Canada that all travellers are required to self-isolate for 14 days prior to interacting with others.“There can be no half measures or exceptions when it comes to COVID-19. It requires ongoing monitoring, modifying our activities as needed and actively managing any new cases that emerge.“Earlier this week, we announced the easing of restrictions for visitors to long-term care homes and seniors’ assisted-living residences.“We know that after many weeks apart, seniors and Elders are eager to see their families. Like every aspect of the restart plan, we must move slowly and cautiously to ensure we move forward safely.“Long-term care homes are actively working to put safety measures in place to allow for safe visits. We ask everyone to please be patient as they ensure all precautions and resources are ready.“Once we see the plans and processes are working, we can further increase and expand activities in long-term care homes and assisted-living facilities.“With each day we keep our curve flat, we can take confidence in knowing the people we care about the most are staying safe. Whether from near or far, what we do makes a difference. Let’s show kindness and respect to others by remaining 100% committed to our efforts.”Learn More:For the latest modelling information presented on June 24, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/modelling-projectionsFor more information about BC’s Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/restartbcFor B.C.’s surgical renewal plan, visit:

Learning how to live peacefully with bears is an ongoing challenge for many communities in B.C., but after several years of hard work and dedication, the District of Port Hardy has officially become Bear Smart.The Bear Smart Community Program is a voluntary, preventative conservation measure that encourages communities, businesses and individuals to work together to reduce conflicts with bears. The program is designed by the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, in partnership with the Union of B.C. Municipalities, and is based on six criteria that communities must meet in order to achieve Bear Smart status.“As communities grow, we all have a responsibility to protect wilderness and the animals that rely on these beautiful natural spaces,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “I congratulate Port Hardy for taking action and demonstrating its commitment through achieving Bear Smart status. This is another example of community leadership that others will follow. This made-in-B.C. solution brings out the best in business, community and local government to create a positive legacy for our children and grandchildren.”Located in a lush riparian area between two rivers on northern Vancouver Island, Port Hardy has a large population of black bears that frequently travel through the community to access the rivers and green space. Sometimes the bruins would stop in town to feast on unsecured garbage and food stored in outdoor fridges and freezers, which often generated calls to conservation officers.  To address the ongoing challenges with bears, Port Hardy completed a bear hazard assessment in 2009, followed by a Human-Bear Conflict Management Plan. Several policies were implemented from the plan and assessment, such as bylaws to manage garbage and a wildlife-resistant solid-waste management system that includes bear-resistant containers.The initiative towards becoming a Bear Smart community gained momentum in 2016 with the formation of the Bear Smart Port Hardy Committee, which was made up of a councillor, staff member and community volunteers. The community has also developed and implemented a robust education and outreach program that includes presentations at elementary schools, brochures, a booth at local fairs and door-to-door campaigns.Port Hardy is the ninth community in B.C. to obtain official Bear Smart status, joining Kamloops, Squamish, Lions Bay, Whistler, Port Alberni, Naramata, New Denver and Coquitlam. Several more communities are actively pursuing the designation.Quotes:Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure, MLA for North Island –“Achieving Bear Smart status is difficult. People, businesses and communities have to work together to manage material that attracts bears. Congratulations to Port Hardy, which is setting a great example. If bears do not have access to non-natural food sources, they have no reason to hang around communities.”Doug Forsdick, chief conservation officer, B.C. Conservation Officer Service –“The B.C. Conservation Officer Service commends the hard work and dedication of Port Hardy to help mitigate human-wildlife conflicts. We hope other communities will turn to Port Hardy as an example of how to properly manage attractants to keep wildlife wild. Communities where Bear Smart practices are followed report fewer human-wildlife conflicts, which means fewer bears are destroyed. Thank you again for all of your hard work.”Dennis Dugas, mayor, Port Hardy –“It was the commitment of the volunteers working with the community that led to achieving the Bear Smart designation. I am so proud of our Bear Smart Port Hardy Committee and community for what they have accomplished as we work towards reducing the number of bears destroyed. This is only the beginning of what Port Hardy needs to do to become truly bear smart.”Quick Facts:
In 2019, the B.C. Conservation Officer Service received more than 23,000 calls related to conflicts with bears. Only a small fraction of those calls led to bears being destroyed in the interest of public safety or animal welfare.
Kamloops was the first community to earn Bear Smart status in 2009.
Communities where attractants are managed properly have seen a decline in related human-wildlife conflicts and in the number of animals that must be destroyed.
The most effective and natural way to reduce human-wildlife interaction is to secure food attractants, such as garbage, birdseed, compost, pet food and fruit.

A new state-of-the-art emergency department and intensive care unit at Richmond Hospital will bring more services and better care for people in this growing community. Featuring double the amount of floor space, the new emergency department will be among a suite of added facilities and services to the new nine-floor tower, including a fully equipped medical imaging department, intensive care unit and pharmacy. The new concept plan also includes renovations to the existing South Tower to create new inpatient psychiatry and psychiatric emergency units.“People have been calling for a new tower at Richmond Hospital, and our government took decisive action to make it happen,” said Premier John Horgan. “That’s why we’re proud to give the green light for a bigger, bolder plan for Richmond Hospital that will bring the facility into the 21st century and deliver the care Richmond needs, while creating thousands of jobs to help get our economy back on solid ground.”Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, said: “During the business planning stage, it became clear that the fast-growing community of Richmond needs a bigger patient care tower with more services. The renewed and expanded concept plan reflects our government’s ongoing commitment to the people who live and work here, ensuring that timely, quality public health care will be there for them, now and into the future.”The initial concept plan for the acute care tower was approved in March 2018.Detailed business planning for the expanded plan is underway. Completion is expected in September 2020. The project will then proceed to procurement and construction.Redevelopment is required to address the critical needs and deficiencies of Richmond Hospital's original tower, the North Tower, including outdated patient-care delivery areas. A structural assessment of the original tower determined it to be at a high risk of widespread damage or structural failure after an earthquake.Richmond Hospital opened in 1966 and has 240 beds, serving Richmond, South Vancouver and Delta, as well as people using Vancouver International Airport and BC Ferries.The original six-storey North Tower has 108 beds and is home to surgical suites, in-patient units, a mammography clinic, cancer care, medical imaging and a pharmacy, as well as administrative, academic and support services.Quotes:Dr. Penny Ballem, board chair, Vancouver Coastal Health – “Vancouver Coastal Health is grateful to the Ministry of Health and the Richmond Hospital Foundation for supporting our vision for an innovative and modern acute-care facility that meets the growing needs of our Richmond community. Taking bold steps now to increase access and expand services will allow us to better serve Richmond patients and clients for years to come.”Natalie Meixner, president and CEO, Richmond Hospital Foundation – “Our community of philanthropic leaders will be ecstatic to learn about the additional services that will be included in the new acute care tower and the opportunities for innovation that an expanded project scope will bring to Richmond. People across our vibrant and diverse community have made commitments to help us reach 88% of our $50 million goal, and we look forward to even greater philanthropic support and involvement from our donors in the future.”A backgrounder follows.

Starting this week, more than 80% of families and individuals in British Columbia will automatically receive an enhanced climate action tax credit.“Many British Columbians are still worried about how they can cover costs such as transportation so they can return to work, pay for groceries and find day camps for their children,” said Carole James, Minister of Finance. “The enhanced climate action tax credit puts extra money in the pockets of British Columbians for their household expenses and to spend at local businesses. This is a needed boost as we work together to restart the economy.”Eligible individuals will receive up to $218, children will receive up to $64 in a one-time increase and a family of four will receive up to $564. That is a $174.50 boost for individuals, a $51.25 increase for children and a lift of $451.50 for a family of four – double the annual amount eligible households would have received prior to B.C.’s COVID-19 Action Plan.Prior to B.C.’s COVID-19 Action Plan, the scheduled July payment was up to $43.50 per adult and up to $12.75 per child. An eligible family of four was set to receive up to $112.50.The enhanced credit is part of B.C.’s COVID-19 Action Plan that is helping make sure people and businesses have the support they need while B.C. works through its restart plan. The plan includes the B.C. Emergency Benefit for Workers that was recently expanded to include workers whose jobs were affected by COVID-19 between March 1 and March 15.British Columbians will receive the climate action tax credit along with their federal GST/HST credit payments. Those who are eligible for the enhanced benefit will automatically receive it if they have completed their B.C. 2019 income tax return.CleanBC is the province's pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. It was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus, and supports the commitment to the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.'s emission targets. Learn More:To learn more about the supports and services available for people, businesses and communities through the pandemic, visit: http://gov.bc.ca/covid19For additional information about the one-time increase to the climate action tax credit, visit: https://gov.bc.ca/gov/content/taxes/income-taxes/personal/credits/climate-actionFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://bccdc.ca/

It also retains the independent dispute resolution system.“This final step in the agreement process fulfills the commitment made by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland to ensuring Canadian competitiveness in international markets and their dedicated efforts to negotiate a fair deal for Canadians.”

Premier John Horgan has issued the following statement to recognize Canada Day:“This year on Canada Day, people from coast to coast to coast have much to reflect on. The COVID-19 pandemic has reminded us that we are all connected and that we do our best when we work together. I am incredibly proud of how British Columbians have risen to this challenge.“Our shared values as Canadians and British Columbians – of generosity, fairness and inclusion – have helped us pull together through one of the most difficult times in our history. We have seen acts of generosity as people have helped their neighbours and loved ones stay safe and cared for. We have discovered that our communities are full of everyday heroes and that no job is insignificant. We have seen that when presented with an obstacle, we have the innovative resources to overcome it, right here in B.C.“Canada Day is also an opportunity to reflect on the work ahead of us to make British Columbia a safe place for everyone – free from violence and discrimination – as we continue to right the wrongs of our past and present. On this day, we reflect on our colonial history and reaffirm our government’s commitment to walking the path to reconciliation with Indigenous peoples.

“We are all connected – our physical, mental and economic health is part of a whole. Let’s keep taking care of each other as we work together to build a stronger, more inclusive future.“Happy Canada Day!”

Carole James, Minister of Finance, has released the following statement on the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) program and eviction restrictions in British Columbia:“The B.C. government welcomes the federal government’s decision to extend the CECRA program for an additional month for businesses most impacted by the pandemic. Our government has been advocating for an extension beyond June for businesses that need more time to reopen and begin their recovery.“As the CECRA program will be extended through the month of July, the Province’s emergency order protecting eligible businesses from being evicted continues. The restriction will remain in place for the duration of the federal rent assistance program.“The ban will continue to protect small businesses in British Columbia that would be eligible for rent relief but whose landlords have not applied, and it will encourage landlords to apply for the joint federal-provincial relief program. It is important for B.C. businesses to know that they may not be evicted if they have lost at least 70% of their pre-pandemic revenue and would qualify for the CECRA.“I encourage all commercial tenants and landlords to work together on this – for eligible landlords to apply for the assistance program when their tenants cannot make rent and for small businesses to support their landlords to complete the application.“Our aim is to put B.C. businesses – property owners and tenants – in a stronger position to participate in the Province’s restart and recovery plan.”Learn More:To apply for the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program, visit: www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/en/finance-and-investing/covid19-cecra-small-businessFor information on all provincial and federal supports available to B.C. businesses, visit: https://covid.smallbusinessbc.ca/hc/en-us

The Province has released the first annual report on progress for implementing the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act.The report was developed in consultation and co-operation with Indigenous peoples, including the First Nations Leadership Council.“B.C. is a leader in Canada in advancing reconciliation, and we remain committed to working together with Indigenous peoples on this important priority,” said Premier John Horgan. “The historic legislation we passed last fall, developed in partnership with Indigenous peoples, provides a path forward for all of us, one that respects Indigenous peoples’ human rights and creates clarity and predictability for everyone who lives in British Columbia.”The 2019-20 annual report covers the period from when the act came into force on Nov. 28, 2019, until the end of the fiscal year. In these first four months of initial actions under the act, government has actively engaged with First Nations, negotiating partners, modern treaty nations and the First Nations Leadership Council on next steps for consultation and implementation. These discussions helped shape the annual report and will continue as work moves ahead to develop an action plan and begin to align provincial laws with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UN Declaration).The report also highlights some examples of the progress government and Indigenous peoples made together that have built a strong foundation for implementing the act. These include major investments in language revitalization and Indigenous housing on- and off-reserve, and sharing long-term, stable revenues with First Nations.The government has also updated B.C.’s K-12 curriculum to include Indigenous culture and history in all grades and amended child welfare laws to keep Indigenous children with their families and communities. A First Nations justice strategy and a poverty reduction strategy contribute to this work, as part of the Province’s commitment to implement the UN Declaration.“B.C. is proud to have been the first province to pass legislation to implement the UN Declaration, developed with unprecedented collaboration with Indigenous peoples,” said Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. “As we continue to move forward together to advance reconciliation, our government will do that work in consultation and co-operation with Indigenous peoples every step of the way. We present the first annual report on the act to support transparency and accountability for this work as we build an action plan on the way forward.”An action plan is required under the act and will include prioritized, tangible activities to implement the objectives of the UN Declaration. It is expected to be complete before the end of the year. The action plan will be informed by continued engagement with Indigenous peoples, as well as existing and previous consultations and agreements, which have laid significant groundwork in collaboration with Indigenous peoples.The annual report was filed with the clerk of the legislative assembly on June 30, 2020, and will be tabled before the legislative assembly next week.A commitment to adopting the UN Declaration in B.C. is a component of the Confidence and Supply Agreement with the BC Green Party caucus.Quick Facts:
B.C. is the first province or territory in Canada to pass legislation to implement the UN Declaration – recognizing in law the human rights of Indigenous peoples.
The Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act (Bill 41) was introduced in the B.C. legislature on Oct. 24, 2019, and passed unanimously on Nov. 28, 2019.
The legislation was developed in collaboration with the First Nations Leadership Council at the direction of First Nations chiefs throughout the province. The act creates a framework for reconciliation as called for by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
In 2017, every cabinet minister in the provincial government was given a mandate from Premier Horgan to implement the UN Declaration and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's Calls to Action.

The Province is investing in a suite of initiatives to protect long-term care and seniors’ assisted-living residents from COVID-19, as facilities begin allowing visitors.“British Columbians flattened the curve through individual actions and a commitment to look out for each other – our families, friends and neighbours,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “That commitment has come with many sacrifices, especially from our seniors and Elders who have been separated from their loved ones. That’s why throughout this pandemic, we are have sought to continually improve our long-term care and seniors’ assisted living operations, to make them safer for residents and those who care for them. Each of us must continue to be completely committed to combatting this virus for these historic investments to be effective.”Residents will begin to be able to have a single designated visitor in a specific visiting area. This approach will be monitored through July, with an aim to expand it in August.“We know how important it is for our family members in long-term care to receive visits from family, friends and supporters. We also know that's a risk when we have COVID-19 in the community,” said Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer. “Once long-term care homes have plans in place and they’re taking the extra precautions needed, I’m so happy to say that we can safely move towards allowing visitors again.”Updated provincial requirements will ease the current visitor restrictions for long-term care homes and seniors’ assisted living residences with clear guidance on required precautions. Each facility must develop written plans outlining how they will meet the requirements.Visitation requirements for long-term care home and seniors’ assisted living facilities include:
Visitation in individual facilities can resume once they have their required written safety plan in place.
Once in place, residents will be able to have one designated visitor in appropriate designated spaces.
Designated spaces will include outdoor or indoor locations; and
all visitors must bring and appropriately wear masks.
Essential visitor restrictions remain in place for other health-care settings.In addition, personal service providers, including hairdressers, will be able to come into long-term care and seniors’ assisted living facilities if they have completed a WorkSafeBC safety plan.The Province is providing more than $160 million for facilities to hire up to three full-time equivalent staff in each of B.C.’s 680 long-term care homes and seniors’ assisted living residences, including both public and private facilities. This could total as many as 2,040 additional staff dedicated to ensuring infection prevention and control measures for COVID-19 are followed to support safe visitation. “These investments are an investment in our province’s safety and health,” said Ronna-Rae Leonard, MLA for Courtenay-Comox and Parliamentary Secretary for Seniors. “We’re showing the world that through careful consideration, we can connect families to their loved ones in care homes safely during what has become an extremely challenging time for the world. This is great news for British Columbians, and together, we are leading the way.”The additional staff will also work to schedule visits and make sure visitors do not enter the facility if they are sick, wash their hands frequently, practise respiratory (cough) etiquette and maintain a safe physical distance of at least two metres from patients and staff wherever possible.The Province will also provide $26.5 million for facilities to address costs that they incurred between March 1 and June 30, 2020, including:
additional screening so only those approved to enter facilities do so;
costs incurred due to sick time and self-isolation;
costs for changes to services, i.e., delivering meals to rooms or staggering meal times to ensure physical distancing, additional housekeeping and enhanced cleaning; and
infection prevention and control costs. 
In April 2020, the Province partnered with the BC Care Providers Association to launch EquipCare BC. EquipCare BC is a new program that will provide $10 million to enhance infection prevention and control and improve quality and safety in long-term care and seniors’ assisted living homes throughout the province.During the pandemic, supporting seniors has remained a key element of government’s response. In April, using orders under the Public Health Act and Emergency Program Act, the Province implemented a process to support workers to work at a single facility. This includes the development of a new labour agreement that ensures all workers at health authority, non-profit and private facilities receive an equitable wage and have their work hours scheduling stabilized so they can work at a single site without disrupting services for residents. The expected total cost of the program in 2020-21 is approximately $10 million to $15 million a month, funded by the Province.Learn More:For the updated guidance for long-term care and seniors’ assisted living facilities, visit BC Centre for Disease Control’s website:

More opportunities are coming for B.C.’s Indigenous entrepreneurs interested in developing food and agriculture businesses and supporting local food security in their communities.“Our government recognizes the importance of supporting Indigenous entrepreneurs who are growing food and developing agriculture businesses in their communities,” said Marie-Claude Bibeau, federal Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. “By providing tools and knowledge needed to succeed in the sector, we are investing in a more-resilient food system that will keep high-quality, local food on tables in communities throughout B.C.”A new stream of support is being added to the B.C. Indigenous Agriculture Development Program to help Indigenous entrepreneurs with up to $8,000 in specialized planning and coaching services to develop and plan their food and agricultural businesses.“Supporting Indigenous entrepreneurs to develop their agriculture business is a vital part of continuing to build local food security in B.C.,” said Lana Popham, B.C.’s Minister of Agriculture. “Through the program, more opportunities are available to bring agriculture to more places, helping create jobs and growing the province’s agriculture industry.”The expansion of this program to individuals is helping ensure accessibility and flexibility for Indigenous entrepreneurs in the B.C. food and agriculture sector. Supporting Indigenous entrepreneurs to strengthen and grow their businesses helps create economic activity, local employment and contributes to the province’s food production capacity and food security in rural and urban communities.“The Williams Lake First Nation fully supports B.C.’s agriculture sector, food security and our People’s entrepreneurial spirit, especially during this pandemic,” said Chief Willie Sellars, Williams Lake First Nation. “We are happy to see this new addition to the B.C. Indigenous Agriculture Development Program for Indigenous Entrepreneurs. With this program, our entrepreneurs will now receive assistance in business development, along with coaching provided by qualified business consultants. This new program is both beneficial and supportive for my community members and to all Indigenous agricultural entrepreneurs in B.C.”Applications are now being accepted on a first-come, first-served basis and will remain open until the funding is fully subscribed.

Through historic and collaborative legislation, British Columbia is the first province in Canada to create the option of benefit companies, a new way to do business that benefits people, communities and future generations.“As government, we’re proud to support B.C. businesses that not only want to do well for their stakeholders, but also give back to their communities in important ways,” said Carole James, Minister of Finance. “By providing the framework through legislation, benefit companies will help propel B.C.’s economy into the future, grounded by the values and beliefs that define us as British Columbians. This is especially important now, as we work to build back better from the impacts COVID-19. I want to thank independent MLA for Oak-Bay Gordon Head Andrew Weaver and my colleagues in the third party for being champions of this new business structure from day one.”Changes to the Business Corporations Act give British Columbians a new option when choosing a corporate structure for their business. A benefit company is a for-profit corporation committed to conducting its business in a responsible and sustainable manner, as well as promoting public benefits in addition to serving the interests of its shareholders. For example, the benefits could be artistic, charitable, cultural, economic, educational, environmental, literary, medical, religious, scientific and/or technological.“I was pleased to sponsor this bill and to collaborate with government to see it become the first ever opposition private members’ bill passed into law in B.C.,” Weaver said. “Our province is home to incredibly innovative companies that want to play a larger role in addressing the challenges and opportunities we face. This legislation helps position our province to be a leader on the cutting edge of global economic trends. By becoming the first jurisdiction in Canada to create benefit companies, B.C. can position our economy for success as we work to recover from the impacts of COVID-19 and beyond.”A business that becomes a benefit company must:
specify its public benefit goals in its articles of incorporation, allowing investors to determine if the stated public benefit aligns with their investment and social goals; 
complete and publish an annual benefit report assessing the company’s performance in its promotion of its stated public benefits;
compare its progress against an independent, third-party standard;
share the report publicly by making it available at the company’s records office and on the company’s website, if it has one; and
require the company’s directors to balance the commitments in the benefit provision with their duty to act in the best interests of the company.
“Our work to expand and modernize BC Registries has played a key role in bringing this exciting legislation to life,” said Anne Kang, Minister of Citizens’ Services. “Allowing businesses to register as benefit companies gives them more tools to help improve our communities and the well-being of people. This initiative is another step forward in our work to deliver modern, reliable and easy-to-access services for British Columbians, where and when they need them.” These amendments ensure that B.C. companies committed to considering the impact of their decisions are able to balance the needs of their shareholders with the values of British Columbians.The values of collaboration, partnership and public good are foundational to the Confidence and Supply Agreement with the BC Green Party caucus, and it continues to provide the basis for a strong, stable government for British Columbia. By working together, progress continues to be made on shared priorities, like climate change, tackling the housing crisis and building a sustainable economy that works for everyone.Quick Facts:
Benefit companies were first introduced in 2010 in the United States and are now possible in 35 U.S. states, as well as Italy and Colombia.
On May 16, 2019, the Business Corporations Amendment Act (No. 2) received royal assent.
This is the first private member’s bill from an opposition party to be passed directly into law in B.C.

Work will start soon on a new westbound passing lane leaving Jaffray on Highway 3 to improve safety and traffic flow through the area.Traffic leaving Jaffray frequently gets backed up. Construction of a passing lane will provide people with a safe opportunity to pass slower-moving vehicles. Work will also include the addition of a two-metre wide paved shoulder to improve cyclist safety, as well as a wildlife tunnel and wildlife-exclusion fencing to help prevent collisions with wildlife.A contract for the project has been awarded to Bad Ventures Ltd. of Cranbrook. Work is expected to get underway in early July and be complete in 2021. During construction, every effort will be made to minimize disruption and impacts to local traffic. Updates will be provided via DriveBC.The ministry is working closely with all contractors and WorkSafeBC to ensure health and safety are maintained for all workers on site.Provincial construction sites have protocols and policies in place following the requirements of the provincial health officer to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. These include reducing in-person meetings or gatherings, holding meetings outdoors and ensuring physical distancing of workers throughout the work day. These measures, along with daily cleaning and sanitizing of common areas and surfaces, will help ensure worker and public safety.This $9.2-million project is cost shared, with a federal contribution of more than $3 million through the New Building Canada Fund, Provincial-Territorial Infrastructure Component. The Province is providing $6.2 million for this improvement.The ministry has been collaborating with the Highway 3 Mayors’ and Chairs’ Coalition to identify priorities for infrastructure improvements along the Highway 3 corridor. Improvements include constructing passing lanes, increasing safety through tight curves, replacing aging infrastructure and improving access within communities.Quick Facts:
The Highway 3 corridor is approximately 840 kilometres long, stretching from Hope to the Alberta border. It serves as a vital east-west trade route for goods and services.
More than 4,600 vehicles use this section of Highway 3 daily, increasing to 5,400 vehicles during the summer months.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:""Today, we are providing case updates for three 24-hour reporting periods. In the first reporting period from June 26 to June 27, we had 10 new cases. In the second reporting period from June 27 to June 28, we had 14 cases. In the last 24 hours, we have had a further two new cases.“This represents 26 new cases since we reported on Friday, for a total of 2,904 cases in British Columbia.“There are 153 active cases of COVID-19 in the province, and 2,577 people who tested positive have recovered.""Of the total COVID-19 cases, 18 individuals are hospitalized, five of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 979 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,529 in the Fraser Health region, 131 in the Island Health region, 200 in the Interior Health region and 65 in the Northern Health region.“There have been no new COVID-19 related deaths for a total of 174 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks. In total, five long-term care or assisted-living facilities and one acute care facility have active outbreaks.“There has been one new exposure event at Brandi’s Exotic Show Lounge in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. Public health teams are actively contact tracing and have issued an alert for anyone who may have been at the premises June 21, 22, 23 and 24 between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m.“The outbreak at the Beresford Warming Centre has been declared over. Public health teams continue to provide support for the one additional community location.“COVID-19 remains a high risk for everyone in our province even though the number of new cases is low. As we gradually transition into Phase 3 of BC's Restart Plan, we must remain vigilant.“A key part of our efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 is for all of us to support contact tracing efforts, by keeping our bubbles small and paying attention to where we go and who we are seeing. It is a team effort requiring all of us to participate.“In this most recent community outbreak, public health teams were required to issue a public alert because they have been unable to reach all those who may be at risk.“Here in British Columbia, we have established clear rules for safe social interactions that apply to everyone. These foundational rules allow us to increase our time with others, to restart many businesses and most importantly, to stay safe.“We want to be absolutely clear there are no exceptions or half measures. British Columbians have flattened our curve. To be successful and weather this storm, everyone needs to do their part, whether at home, at work or travelling.“Businesses need to understand that they are responsible for keeping their employees safe and for taking appropriate precautions to protect employees while they are at work.“Visitors from other parts of Canada or within the province need to stay home if they are ill. Now is not the time to travel with any symptoms of COVID-19.“One slip is all we need to cause a significant rebound, something we are working extremely hard to avoid.“Phase 3 allows for more types of activities, but how we interact with each other does not change.

People and families in Nanaimo now have access to more primary health-care services with the opening of the first primary care clinic led by nurse practitioners on Vancouver Island.The Province is launching Nexus Primary Care Clinic, in collaboration with the Nurses and Nurse Practitioners of BC and Island Health, to provide team-based primary care services to residents. Nurse practitioner-led primary care clinics are part of B.C.’s primary care strategy and are developed by nurse practitioners.Nurse practitioners are health practitioners who can work on their own, or with physicians and other health professionals, to provide care across a person’s life span. This includes diagnosing and treating illnesses, ordering and interpreting tests, prescribing medications and performing medical procedures.“Our priority is to find new, innovative ways of working, co-ordinating services and delivering care so that British Columbians don’t have to wait so long, travel so far and search so hard for the care they need,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “Nurse practitioners are a viable, patient-centred solution to improving access, but we know that compared to other jurisdictions, B.C. has not made the best use of nurse practitioners. This is the first nurse practitioner primary care clinic that we have established under the Province’s Primary Care Strategy, and there is more to come. These clinics will connect more people with the care they need, when they need it most.”Located at #3-1273 Island Hwy., Nexus Primary Care Clinic offers team-based primary care to residents. This includes attaching approximately 6,800 people to a primary care provider in the next three years.The clinic will open gradually starting on Tuesday, June 30, 2020, with two full-time nurse practitioners. By Sept. 15, the clinic will have four more nurse practitioners, two registered nurses, a social worker and mental-health clinicians to provide team-based care to people in the greater Nanaimo area.Current hours of operation at the clinic are Monday, Tuesday and Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and Wednesday and Thursday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Once fully staffed on Sept. 15, the clinic hours will expand to include evenings and Saturdays.“We know that thousands of people in Nanaimo do not have a consistent primary care provider. The Nexus Primary Care Clinic is another valuable resource for people to get attached to a nurse practitioner and to receive primary health care,” Dix said. “Island Health and Nurses and Nurse Practitioners of BC are to be thanked for their continued support in helping residents live their healthiest lives.”The B.C. government is providing an approximately $2-million operating budget, as well as approximately $495,500 as a one-time cost.The establishment of nurse practitioner-led primary and community care clinics coincides with the Ministry of Health’s 2018 announcement to create 200 nurse practitioner positions in primary care settings throughout B.C. This is to fully leverage and integrate nurse practitioners into the province’s primary care system to improve access to primary health care for British Columbians.Learn More:To learn more about the Province’s primary health-care strategy, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018PREM0034-001010To learn more about the Province’s strategy to increase the number of nurse practitioners, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018HLTH0034-000995To learn more about the Province’s strategy to recruit and retain more family medicine graduates, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018HLTH0052-001043Two backgrounders follow.

The Province has appointed the City of Surrey’s first police board members as part of Surrey’s transition from an RCMP detachment to a municipal police department.The lieutenant governor in council has appointed seven community members under section 23(1)(c) of the Police Act to the City of Surrey’s municipal police board, joining the mayor of Surrey as chair and a municipal council appointee to complete the nine-person board:
Chief Harley Chappell, elected Chief of the Semiahmoo First Nation
Cheney Cloke, director, Fraser Health Authority
Elizabeth Model, CEO, Downtown Surrey Business Improvement Association
James Carwana, mediator and arbitrator
Jaspreet Sunner, lawyer and labour relations representative, Hospital Employees’ Union
Manav Gill, manager, clinical operations, Fraser Health Authority
Meena Brisard, regional director, Canadian Union of Public Employees
Following an extensive assessment and screening process, members were chosen by aligning individual skills, competencies and attributes with the needs and responsibilities of the board and to reflect the diversity of the community. Initial appointments will range from 12- to 18-month terms.Under the Police Act, the board is required to establish and oversee the Surrey Police Department and is subject to oversight by the director of police services, who has a statutory responsibility to superintend policing in B.C. The board has four main governance functions: 
employing the police and civilian employees;
providing financial oversight for the police department;
establishing policies and directions for the department; and
managing service and policy complaints against the department.
The next step in the City of Surrey’s transition plan will be for the new board to hire a chief constable. Ministry staff will work with the board to assist in the transition process, including providing an orientation and training session in the coming weeks.A backgrounder follows.

The Province, through BC Housing, has purchased the 42-unit American Hotel in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside for people who have been living in supportive housing and are ready to take the next step toward independent living.“Housing is the foundation of peoples’ lives, and we’ve seen that our supportive housing model works in helping people transition to the next chapter in their story,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “These homes will provide another safe, secure and supportive option for people as they move forward in their journey to independent living.”The building will be managed by experienced BC Housing staff, who will provide residents with supports like daily living skills training, such as budgeting, nutrition management, meal preparation, medication management, house cleaning and other skills.“Affordable housing with wraparound services is key to supporting people in the Downtown Eastside and neighbouring communities,” said Melanie Mark, MLA for Vancouver-Mount Pleasant. “These new 42 BC Housing units represent an opportunity to empower community members as they transition into independent living and build new pathways for themselves.”  Current tenants will be able to remain at the American and will have access to the supportive services, as needed. Over time, as existing tenants choose to leave and units become vacant, they will be occupied by new residents ready to leave supportive housing and live more independently.In addition to purchasing the hotel at 928 Main St., the Province has also bought the adjacent vacant site at 938 Main St., for a total investment of $17.9 million through the Supportive Housing Fund. Over the long term, BC Housing plans to redevelop the American Hotel, as well as the adjacent vacant site, to create additional rental housing in the community. BC Housing will engage with the community on how these sites can be used to build a mix of homes for people in Vancouver and will go through the municipal rezoning process.“Nothing is more critical for the City of Vancouver and our residents than tackling the housing affordability crisis, that's why seeing the Province of B.C. purchase the American Hotel to provide more affordable housing is welcome news,” said Kennedy Stewart, mayor, City of Vancouver. “The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need to provide all residents with safe, affordable housing, especially for our most vulnerable neighbours, and the only way to do this is through strong partnerships between the City of Vancouver and the Government of B.C.”Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:
The hotel was renovated in 2010 and has since operated as a single-room occupancy hotel.
The Province is working in partnership to build close to 3,700 new affordable homes for people with a range of incomes in Vancouver:
Housing for people with middle incomes: 135 homes
Housing for people with low to moderate incomes, including families, seniors and Indigenous peoples: 2,518 homes
Housing for women and children leaving violence: 73 homes

The Government of British Columbia is amending regulations to allow all remaining independent wine stores (IWS) in the province to convert their licence type to sell beer, cider and distilled products in their current locations.This change will likely result in the elimination of the IWS retail licence class, which consists of 11 retail licensee locations provincewide.Historically, IWS were a licence type established to promote wine sales in the province, where licence holders were restricted to selling wine only. In exchange for the sales restriction, IWS operators received an additional discount on the wholesale price of wine that other liquor retail store operators did not.In 2015, the previous government eliminated the IWS wholesale discount. In exchange, IWS licensees were given the option to sell other products by converting into full-service liquor stores. However, the policy change required that if they converted, the full-service licence store could not be located within one kilometre of an existing public or private liquor store. As a result, only one IWS converted under the new policy.This rule amendment allows the remaining 11 IWS locations in the province to convert to a full-service liquor store without having to relocate one kilometre away from other liquor stores, if they wish to convert and stay in their current location. If an IWS chooses to move after converting its licence type or as part of the process of converting, it will be subject to the one-kilometre rule.Government is not considering revisions to the one-kilometre distance requirement for any other retail licence types and will not be increasing the number of retail liquor licences in the province. This reform will address the unfairness for IWS retail licensees that resulted from the removal of the IWS discount in 2015 and has been made in a manner consistent with a recommendation from the Business Technical Advisory Panel (BTAP), an industry advisory group to government.The Province continues to act on BTAP recommendations, while also supporting industry recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic. Temporary measures taken to support the industry so far include allowing hospitality licensees to purchase liquor at wholesale price until March 31, 2021, permitting the expansion of service area footprints through an expedited process and authorizing food-primary and liquor-primary licensees to sell packaged liquor for off-site consumption with the purchase of a meal.Learn More:View the Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch policy directive: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/business/liquor-regulation-licensing/liquor-law-policy/liquor-policy-directivesView the BTAP report: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/employment-business-and-economic-development/business-management/liquor-regulation-licensing/documents/business_technical_advisory_panel_report_and_recommendations.pdf

A new online service simplifies the registration process across provincial lines, making it easier for owners to grow their business.Until now, British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba had separate processes and systems for corporations and limited partnerships to complete their extraprovincial business registrations and maintenance filings. On June 27, 2020, the four provinces were the first to implement the online Multi-jurisdictional Registry Access Service (MRAS), a hub that allows corporate information sharing between the provinces, making extraprovincial registration faster and easier.  “People using this new service will find it easier to register their business in multiple provinces and efficiently complete necessary paperwork through one central hub,” said Anne Kang, B.C.’s Minister of Citizens’ Services. “This joint effort under the New West Partnership Agreement streamlines trade between our provinces and opens up the possibility of including other provinces and territories in the future.”As members of the New West Partnership Trade Agreement, the four western provinces committed to reconciling business registration and reporting requirements between the jurisdictions, thus simplifying extraprovincial business registration processes.“The launch of this online service is just one of the ways we are cutting red tape for businesses, which is especially important as we relaunch our economy,” said Nate Glubish, Minister of Service Alberta. “MRAS is convenient and efficient, and makes it easier for Alberta job creators to expand their operations across Western Canada and for western Canadian job creators to grow into Alberta.”Through MRAS, other jurisdictions will eventually be able to share corporate information, thus extending the New West Partnership’s efficiencies across Canada.“We are always pleased to reduce red tape and make it easier for businesses to register and set up operations in Saskatchewan and Western Canada,” said Don Morgan, Saskatchewan’s Minister of Justice and Attorney General.Scott Fielding, Manitoba’s Minister of Finance, said: “Manitoba is eager to work with our western neighbours under the New West Partnership Agreement and find ways to make life easier for business owners. A priority for our government is to reduce red tape, and this is another way we are able to do so and improve economic trade across Western Canada.”Marilyn Braun-Pollon, vice-president, Western Canada and Agri-business, Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB), said: “We are pleased to see the western provinces move ahead with the Multi-jurisdictional Registry Access Service and reduce the regulatory burden on businesses who operate within different provinces. Today’s announcement is one step in the right direction on creating a more open interprovincial trade environment in Canada. It is encouraging to see these provinces move on this key recommendation CFIB made to the Canada Free Trade Agreement.”Quick Facts:
MRAS allows jurisdictions to share corporate information so corporations and limited partnerships can complete and update their extraprovincial registration online.
MRAS also includes a national corporate registry search tool, which provides core registration information for corporations and extraprovincial corporations.
At this time, MRAS is not available for limited liability partnerships and co-operatives. These filings will continue to be completed through the current model.

Taxi and limousine operators will pay less to keep their vehicles on the road as part of the Province’s ongoing work to support the industry during the COVID-19 pandemic.“We’ve heard from operators and drivers about the impact of COVID-19 on British Columbians who make their living in the taxi industry,” said Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “Lowering the annual licence fee is just one of the ways our government can step in and help this industry as we continue to reopen and recover together.”On June 22, 2020, the annual licence renewal fee was reduced for commercial operators who hold a Passenger Directed Vehicle Authorization, which includes taxi and limousine operators. In the past, these licensees paid an annual fee of $100 per vehicle with no overall fee cap. It has been reduced to $50 per vehicle with a licence fee cap of $5,000.“There have been significant impacts on our industry as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as there have been for so many,” said Carolyn Bauer, spokesperson for the Vancouver Taxi Association. “We have been working closely with the Province, and are pleased with this change that I believe will support our industry during this challenging time.”Additional temporary measures to support the passenger transportation industry during the COVID-19 pandemic have also been introduced, including:
waiving plate fees for all operators during COVID-19
allowing eligible licensees to defer their passenger transportation renewal fee for up to six months
allowing insurance payments to be temporarily suspended for fleet and non-fleet customers
“Throughout the pandemic, operators and drivers in the taxi and limo industry have worked hard to protect passengers, with new measures focused on hygiene to prevent transmission,” Trevena said. “This work has been so important in maintaining what has been designated an essential service.”In addition to these measures, over the past two years government has worked to support fairness for drivers through a package of initiatives including:
implementing a more flexible, distance-based insurance product that ICBC now offers for the taxi industry, similar to what is available for ride hailing. This product became available on May 1, 2020.
continuing work on how the per-trip fee for ride-hail trips can support accessible vehicles in the taxi industry.
requiring both ride-hail and taxi drivers to have a Class 4 licence and undergo the same criminal record checks.
in 2018, the ministry allowed taxi licensees to increase their fleet size by 15% in advance of ride hailing becoming legal in the province.
The Passenger Transportation Branch has issued best practices for the Commercial Passenger Vehicle Industry during COVID-19 and supports the development of COVID-19 safety plans with the help of WorkSafeBC.For more information, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=F6DAB4715B414A21AA9EBA4DAF29896ALearn More:For information on Phase 3 and guidelines and advice for safe travel this summer, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID-19For information on BC’s Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/RestartBCLearn more about B.C.’s economic recovery planning: http://gov.bc.ca/recoveryideasFor information on federal and provincial government supports available to individuals, families, businesses and organizations, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covidgovernmentbenefitsFor recommendations on protecting yourself and your community, including for employers, businesses and schools, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseasesconditions/coronavirus-(novel)For more information and latest medical updates on COVID-19, follow the BCCDC on Twitter @CDCofBC or visit its website: http://www.bccdc.ca/

Engaging youth to work on community service projects so they can help their communities “build back better” from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic is the goal of a new $5-million Youth Community Partnership program.“We recognize that COVID-19 continues to dramatically impact young people’s prospects for work, which they typically use to leverage future job prospects or to pay for their education or training,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “Now, more than ever, young people are looking for ways to support themselves, while giving back to their communities. Engaging in safe, physically distanced local projects is an incredible opportunity for young people to acquire new skills, earn money and contribute to building back an even better B.C.”  Communities around B.C. can apply to fund a community-service project of their choosing – like trail building, beach clean-up or invasive species removal, upgrading local parks or working for a local charity. In turn, they provide skills and work experience to young people who are unemployed, between 15-29 years of age, through the project. These young participants will benefit by applying the work-related skills and experience they gain on various projects in further education, employment or future careers.“I encourage communities around B.C. to take advantage of the Youth Community Partnership program,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “These grants will help youth build their skill sets, gain work experience and help rebuild their communities as the province begins economic recovery from COVID-19.”Local governments, non-profit community and environmental organizations, employer associations, chambers of commerce and Indigenous communities are encouraged to apply.“Our youth are the future of our Nations,” said Robert J. Dennis, Sr., Chief Councillor of Huu-ay-aht First Nations. “Opportunities like this not only give us a chance to rebuild our communities following COVID-19, but allow us to invest and build capacity in the next generation of leaders. Students face an uncertain future in the wake of this pandemic and participating in this innovative program will give them an opportunity to do something positive while gaining skills they can use in their education path or in a future career.”Applicants can receive grants of up to $10,000 per youth for projects running up to 16 weeks. The youth then receive a training stipend of up to $2,000 per four-week period (to a maximum of $8,000) for work between June and October 31.Participants can also receive wraparound supports like bus passes, child care, work boots and personal protective equipment for the work, which will incorporate physical distancing and include no more than 10 youth per project.It is anticipated that up to 500 youth and more than 50 communities in B.C. could benefit from the grant. Quotes:Chief Don Roberts, Kitsumkalum Band, Tsimshian Nation –“Kitsumkalum Band is fully in support of this unique and innovative response to both post COVID-19 impacts, and youth and community capacity-building and development. Kitsumkalum Band is excited about the ministry’s ongoing commitment of First Nations youth and community engagement as demonstrated through such programming. We are confident other B.C. communities will follow the ministry’s lead by joining in with this Youth Community Partnership program and help their youth and community recover from the impacts of COVID-19.”Colleen Giroux-Schmidt, vice-president corporate relations, Innergex Renewable Energy Inc. –“At Innergex we believe that nurturing a resilient COVID-19 recovery that gives youth the opportunity to care for the environment in their communities is the best investment into a sustainable future for all. This program is an opportunity to help build a new normal that both addresses COVID-19 recovery and tackles climate change. We at Innergex support this as it aligns with our mission to build a better world with renewable energy.”Allyson Graf, vice-president, community and strategic initiatives, YMCA of Okanagan –“The successful transition to adulthood depends on a young person's ability to attain employment. Yet right now, youth are at a particular disadvantage, not only due to high unemployment, but also due to the isolation they have experienced over the past few months. As a charity that is a large employer of youth and one that delivers youth employment services, YMCA of Okanagan supports programs that invest in youth, teach skills and enable them to be part of the solution as we recover from this pandemic.” Adriana Laurent Seibt, projects administrator, UBC Climate Hub –“This new initiative is an important way to respond to both the impacts of COVID-19 and provide more support for youth. It’s great to see an initiative like this that aims to create paid opportunities for youth, while uplifting communities on a path toward recovery for a safe, inclusive and just society. I am hopeful that there will be further supports from the B.C. government for youth-driven organizations and initiatives, especially those working on issues like racial justice, climate justice, food security and youth empowerment.”Quick Facts:
The funding is being provided by the Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training ($2 million) and the Ministry of Social Development and Poverty Reduction ($3 million) through the Canada-BC Workforce Development Agreement and Labour Market Development Agreement, which helps Canadians get training, develop their skills, gain work experience and find employment.
Many of the programs funded under these agreements help members of under-represented groups, such as Indigenous peoples, youth, older workers and newcomers to Canada overcome barriers to their full participation in the labour market.
The unemployment rate for youth in B.C. aged 15 to 24 years was 28.9% in May 2020, up from 24.2% in April.
Compared to May 2019, the unemployment rate for youth has risen 20.2 percentage points. (BC Stats)

A new online learning hub is giving thousands of early care and learning (ECL) professionals an opportunity to take courses virtually at a time, pace and place that is convenient for them.The BC Early Years Professional Development Hub is a shared platform where ECL professionals at any stage of their career can come together in virtual discussion forums, learn from each other and take courses from a distance. Course examples include learning the principles of the early childhood education’s professional code of ethics and recognizing what they look like in practice, to leadership-development training to help ECL professionals improve or expand on their specific areas of expertise.“As governments, our ability to ensure access to high-quality early learning and child care hinges on having a knowledgeable and experienced workforce,” said Ahmed Hussen, federal Minister of Families, Children and Social Development. “While the COVID-19 pandemic is creating challenges for all of us, it has also created an opportunity for our early learning and child care professionals to learn from each other and enhance the skills they need to care for our youngest citizens.” All ECL professionals will have access to the hub, including early childhood educators (ECEs), ECE assistants, and responsible adults (RAs) working throughout the province. ECEs require 40 hours of professional development every five years in order to renew and maintain their provincial certification, and RAs require a minimum of 20 hours of combined coursework in child development, guidance, health and safety, and/or nutrition to be eligible to work in licensed child care programs. The hub has the capacity to store users’ professional-development certificates, allowing them to easily keep track of their hours and certificates.“As a former ECE, I know how important continuous learning is to ensuring children are provided with the best care possible,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “As the province continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, finding safe ways to provide education and training opportunities is more important than ever before, as many in-person trainings and conferences are not possible.”The hub was developed through a partnership between the Government of B.C., Westcoast Child Care Resource Centre, Early Childhood Educators of BC (ECEBC) and BC Family Child Care Association, using funding from the Canada-British Columbia Early Learning and Child Care (ELCC) Agreement. The Early Childhood Pedagogy Network (ECPN) is also a key member of the partnership and has been using the platform to host an orientation course and facilitate online discussions for pedagogists.“Many of us have been practising safe distancing during this time, but being apart should not put our learning and growth on hold, especially for those who continue to care for our children,” said Katrina Chen, Minister of State for Child Care. “This platform will create an online community for early care and learning professionals to learn with and from each other, share knowledge and connect with others across the child care sector.”The hub is part of the Province’s $136-million Early Care and Learning Recruitment and Retention Strategy and is one of the first investments in professional development for the child care sector in more than a decade. By supporting the creation of an online platform, the government is improving access to high-quality learning opportunities for rural and remote ECL professionals and those who have barriers to accessing traditional face-to-face courses and conferences.“Having a variety of options for professional development and learning programs, including online, is valuable to us as ECEs,” said Katie Wahl, an ECE at Westview Child Care Centre in Prince Rupert. “Living in a rural community makes access to these difficult and sometimes unattainable. It helps to create a sense of community and belonging when we are able to learn with each other.”Investing in child care and early childhood education is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Emily Gawlick, executive director, ECEBC –“ECEBC, along with our hub partners, is extremely pleased with the development of this learning platform. It will serve the professional body well for increasing the delivery of online continued ECL learning, today and beyond.”Pam Preston, executive director, Westcoast Child Care Resource Centre (CCRC) –“Westcoast CCRC has had the privilege of working in collaboration with this amazing group to prepare this offering for the community in support of continued professional learning. The Early Learning and Child Care funding enabled this project to see the light of day and we are very excited to share it today. It is a one-stop website for continuous professional learning for the ECE and child care providers in British Columbia. It couldn’t come at a better time, as the virtual engagement will enrich online learning when we can’t get into the classroom in person.”Denise Hodgins, deputy director, ECPN – “We welcome the Early Years Professional Development Hub as a virtual space for pedagogists to think, imagine and create curriculum and pedagogy with educators across the province.”Rena Laberge, co-chair, BC Family Child Care Association – “BC Family Child Care Association is very pleased to announce our partnership with ECEBC, WCCRC and ECPN. We have been working collaboratively on the formation of the BC Early Years Professional Development Hub. With the provincial funds we received from the ELCC agreement, our association will be offering our Good Beginnings: Professional Development for Child Care Providers course across the province, which includes the Responsible Adult and The Business of Family Child Care training.

British Columbians wanting to switch from fossil fuel-based heating to cleaner, more energy-efficient heat pumps now have access to low-interest financing as part of CleanBC.Depending on the type and efficiency of heat pump chosen by homeowners, the loans will have interest rates as low as 0% over a five-year repayment period and are being offered as an alternative to CleanBC home-heating retrofit rebates.“Through CleanBC, we’re supporting clean technologies like heat pumps that will reduce climate pollution and help families save on energy costs,” said Bruce Ralston, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources. “This innovative financing program will help British Columbians make the switch to clean energy and ensure their homes are as efficient, comfortable and affordable as possible.”The Province’s CleanBC program aims to reduce the environmental impact of existing buildings and to waste less energy. By using more clean energy and using it more efficiently in buildings, greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced and air quality improved.Canadian firm Financeit will manage the low-interest loan process, which conforms to all Canadian finance and privacy requirements. Specially trained contractors will guide homeowners through the online loan approval process on site or remotely – in most cases providing on-the-spot loan approvals for upgrades to change from fossil fuel home-heating systems to electric heat pumps.CleanBC is a pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. CleanBC was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s emission targets.Quotes:George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy –“We’re continuing to explore and develop new ways to help people improve their homes and reduce carbon emissions by switching to energy-efficient electric heat pumps. Access to low-interest loans will provide another avenue for people looking to transition their homes from fossil fuels to clean energy in a more affordable way.”Heathe Thompson, director of operations, Combined Comfort Systems –“There is no doubt that this program is a huge help for homeowners who want to make the change from burning fossil fuels to heat their homes to the environmentally friendly alternatives that are now available. We already have a job on the board where, without the program, as with the majority of homeowners, the cost of the retrofit is simply too large of a number.

The voices of B.C. Columbia Basin communities are captured in a new report that details a series of Columbia River Treaty meetings held in fall 2019.The 2019 Columbia River Treaty Community Meetings Summary Report reflects in-person engagement between the Province and communities, as Canada-U.S. talks about the treaty’s future continue.In October and November 2019, the Province hosted public meetings in 12 Columbia Basin communities: Revelstoke, Valemount, Cranbrook, Jaffray, Creston, Golden, Invermere, Genelle, Nelson, Meadow Creek, Nakusp and Fauquier.The meetings served two purposes:
Update communities about the current Columbia River Treaty negotiations and projects underway to address community interests.
Give residents an opportunity to connect with the Canadian negotiating team, including the Indigenous Nations who became part of the negotiating contingent in 2019.
The document captures the presentations, feedback and discussions that took place in each community.In addition to presentations by the negotiating team, each meeting had representatives from the Ktunaxa, Secwepemc and Syilx/Okanagan Nations provide details about work they are leading to address Columbia Basin ecosystem health and explore reintroducing salmon to the Upper Columbia River. Members of the Columbia River Treaty Local Governments’ Committee shared their updated recommendations for a modernized treaty, which the committee will submit to the provincial and federal governments.The B.C. government’s Columbia River Treaty Team concluded the meetings by detailing various community projects in development to address some of the treaty-related issues raised by Columbia Basin residents over the years. These include the Columbia River Treaty Heritage Project, a proposed touring route that aims to acknowledge what was lost in the B.C. Columbia Basin as a result of the treaty dams.Learn More:The 2019 Columbia River Treaty Community Meetings Summary Report is available at: https://engage.gov.bc.ca/columbiarivertreaty/2019-community-meetings/

Premier John Horgan has issued the following statement marking Canadian Multiculturalism Day:“On Canadian Multiculturalism Day, we celebrate the multicultural province and country that we are privileged to live in. We also recognize that our work to make B.C. and Canada a safe and inclusive place for everyone is not done.“We acknowledge the rich cultures and unceded territories of Indigenous peoples who have lived here since time immemorial. We have welcomed and continue to welcome newcomers who have travelled here from countries around the world to build a better life for their families. Generations of families now call this province home. Today and every day, we honour and celebrate the diverse cultures and traditions that make our province and country what they are.“Our government re-established B.C.’s Human Rights Commission to protect and defend human rights, and we have launched Resilience BC, a new anti-racism network that targets racism, discrimination and hate in communities around the province. We have also selected the Victoria Immigrant and Refugee Centre to act as a provincial hub to help communities respond to racism. We have made good progress, but there is more to do and I look forward to working with communities to build a more equitable province for everyone.”“Today, we recommit to fighting racism and prejudice in all their forms. We all have a role to play in this work, especially those of us with privilege. At a time when hate crimes are on the rise here at home and across the border, we must challenge racist remarks, condemn stereotypes and scapegoating, correct misinformation and safely report racist incidents in our communities.”“We join all Canadians in celebrating Canadian Multiculturalism Day and standing up for diversity, inclusion and respect for every person, in every community. Together, we can build a more just and inclusive province and country for everyone.”

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are announcing 10 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 2,878 cases in British Columbia. This total includes a data correction of one case from yesterday’s report.“There are 159 active cases of COVID-19 in the province and 2,545 people who tested positive have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 17 individuals are hospitalized, five of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 969 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,514 in the Fraser Health region, 131 in the Island Health region, 199 in the Interior Health region and 65 in the Northern Health region.“There has been one new COVID-19 related death in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, for a total of 174 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks and the outbreak at Nicola Lodge has been declared over. In total, five long-term care or assisted-living facilities and one acute-care facility have active outbreaks.“There have been no new community outbreaks.

The need to put aside important cultural gatherings to maintain a safe physical distance and to limit visitors has had a great social, mental and economic impact on many. It also reminds us of the resilience that First Nations communities continue to display in the face of hardships.“Like all of us, communities need to assess the risks and do what is right for them. A slow and cautious approach has allowed us to flatten the curve and will keep us safe in the months ahead.“We have seen that by working together, we can ensure the right tools and resources are in place to provide the care and support needed to effectively respond to COVID-19.“Every day that we do our part and take steps to protect our families, Elders and loved ones makes a difference.

Updates to Agricultural Land Commission (ALC) Act regulations will make it more affordable for multi-generational farmers on the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR) to apply to build housing that meets their needs.The updates will also make it easier for farmers on the ALR to maintain and build roads that help them grow the food British Columbians rely on.“B.C.’s farming families work hard to put food on our tables, and these changes will help reduce the expense and anxiety of maintaining an extended-family lifestyle on the farm.” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “It takes a lot of people to run a large farm. Having parents, in-laws and siblings on site helps many B.C. farms produce the food we need more efficiently. Our government will continue to make life better for these hard-working farming families.”Fees for non-adhering residential-use applications will be reduced from $1,500 to $900. The 40% reduction in the application fees to build additional housing follows feedback from local governments and farmers and others living in the ALR.“West Kelowna’s agricultural land base and the ALR are vital components to the fabric of our community,” said Gord Milsom, mayor, West Kelowna. “The proposed changes to the ALC fee structure will support our farmers by reducing costs to build housing and will further recognize the role local governments have in evaluating applications. By making applications more accessible and assisting local governments with processing, we can continue to work collectively to protect our food-producing land base and support jobs in the agricultural industry. I look forward to continuing to work collaboratively regarding changes introduced by the Ministry of Agriculture and the ALC with our residents, business owners and agricultural operators.”Each application will continue to be reviewed by the ALC to ensure it is consistent with its mandate to preserve farmland and encourage agriculture. In recognition of the work local governments and First Nations contribute to the process, the portion of the fees they receive when a non-adhering residential-use application requires its review will increase by 50%, from $300 to $450.Additional amendments to the regulations make it easier for farmers on large land parcels in the ALR to maintain roads on their properties. This is done by increasing the amount of soil removal or fill placement permitted for annual farm-road maintenance without requiring permission from the ALC. The change provides farmers with large properties a little more leeway to maintain their farms and will also reduce the workload for ALC staff.“These changes help farmers in the ALR maintain the farm roads we need and use to get our equipment and machinery to and from the fields, and to get the food we produce on the farm to the marketplace and to people who enjoy it,” said Jeffrey Spitters, Oranya Farms. “As organic farmers, we take pride in the sustainable practices, philosophy and materials we follow in raising our poultry, and the responsible use of fill to keep farm roads smooth and serviceable makes a real difference in our daily work on the farm, and our jobs producing food for our communities.”The changes to the Agricultural Land Commission Act were requested by B.C. farmers, the ALC and local governments. They will be effective Sept. 30, 2020, to allow local governments and the ALC sufficient time to prepare for the amended regulations.Learn More:Agricultural Land Reserve and Agricultural Land Commission: https://www.alc.gov.bc.caB.C. crop and farm statistics: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/agriculture-seafood/statisticsA backgrounder follows.

A historic agreement between the Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish) and Líl̓wat Nations, the Province, the Resort Municipality of Whistler (RMOW) and Whistler Blackcomb creates new opportunities for economic development, reflecting B.C.’s commitment to reconciliation.“After many years of negotiations and a lot of work on the part of the Squamish and Líl̓wat Nations, the Province, Resort Municipality of Whistler and Whistler Blackcomb, I am excited to see this agreement finalized,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “This step empowers the community to move forward with its partners on planning the future of Whistler, one of B.C.’s cherished resort destinations.”The agreement signed earlier this month provides a framework for establishing stronger government-to-government relations and a co-operative relationship between partners in the spirit of reconciliation.As part of the agreement, changes have been made to remove ministerial approval from the municipality’s official community planning process, making it consistent with local governments across British Columbia. This means the community has clearer processes to guide future planning that will allow it to reflect the goals and vision of the community, while addressing its anticipated needs.“The Líl̓wat Nation is pleased to support the Resort Municipality of Whistler’s Official Community Plan and looks forward to continued consultation on future amendments,” said Ku̓kwpi7 Skalúlmecw Political Chief Dean Nelson. “Our support comes after many years of engagement and discussions. The cornerstone of this approval is the continued commitment to relationship building and creating opportunities for Líl̓wat within their traditional territory.”The signed framework includes development opportunities for the Nations, including a land exchange between the Nations and the RMOW, and potential collaborations on employee housing. The combined efforts of all parties established a solid foundation for future planning, land use and economic development that meets the needs and interests of the Whistler area.“The signing of this agreement represents a significant milestone in the strengthening of relationships between the Skwxwú7mesh Nation, Líl̓wat Nation, the Resort Municipality of Whistler and Whistler Blackcomb,” said Syeta'xtn (Chris Lewis), Skwxwú7mesh Nation Councillor and Spokesperson. “We look forward to moving forward together in the spirit of reconciliation, creating meaningful opportunities for the original inhabitants of these lands that benefit all those involved.”The Framework Agreement was signed by all partners as of June 15, 2020. For more information, contact any one of the signatories.Quotes:Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development –“This agreement acknowledges the important role that First Nations will play in future planning and development in this area. It also provides greater certainty for the community and the resort as they build on their accomplishments in the tourism sector and enhance the region’s economic potential.”Jack Crompton, mayor, Resort Municipality of Whistler –“The framework agreement is a significant and meaningful step in continuing to build a government-to-government relationship with the Lil’wat Nation and Squamish Nation based on trust and good faith. It furthers reconciliation and demonstrates a commitment to respectful partnerships. We are very pleased that it paved the way for provincial approval of RMOW’s Official Community Plan and enactment of recent provincial legislative amendments to the Resort Municipality of Whistler Act.”Geoff Buchheister, chief operating officer, Whistler Blackcomb –“This agreement affirms the special relationship between the Nations, the RMOW and our company. It is a commitment to creating a new path for opportunity and development that we believe will benefit everyone in our region. I am committed to this partnership and want to thank the Nations, the Province and the RMOW for helping to lay the groundwork for our shared future success as we welcome Canada and the world.”Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation –“This agreement is a strong example of the work we are doing in partnership with First Nations, local governments, communities and businesses across B.C. to put the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples into action. We are seeing more and more relationships growing between local governments and Indigenous Nations. Collaborating to create economic development opportunities not only advances reconciliation, but creates opportunities for everyone in the region.”  Quick Facts:
In February 2017, the Province and Whistler Blackcomb successfully concluded the first phase of negotiations on interests related to future resort development, resulting in new 60-year master development agreements and master plans.
The framework agreement marks the successful conclusion of the second phase of negotiations on land-use planning interests and economic development opportunities for the Nations.
As a result of the agreement, a land exchange will take place between the Kadenwood land (Resort Municipality of Whistler owned) and the Emerald land (Nation owned). 
Whistler’s Official Community Plan was recently approved by the Province with the support of the Nations and adopted by council.
Official community plans describe the long-term vision of communities and guide decisions on municipal and regional district planning and land use management.

As parents return to work, the Province is making affordable, quality child care more accessible for families in New Westminster by investing in more than 180 new licensed spaces. “COVID-19 has changed so much of our lives, but as we begin to restart our economy, one thing remains – parents need safe, affordable child care in their communities,” said Katrina Chen, Minister of State for Child Care. “These 180 new child care spaces will be a huge relief for many New Westminster parents, so they can focus on getting back to work or school and creating the best future for their families and community.”The Childcare BC New Spaces Fund is supporting three projects that will create more child care options for local families. The City of New Westminster is creating 45 new spaces, made up of 12 infant/toddler spaces and 33 spaces for children aged three to five years, as part of the new Aquatic and Community Centre.The city will work with the Kinsight Supported Child Development Program to create accessibility plans for children with extra support needs. The facility will be operated by a non-profit child care provider, with the city leasing space at a low cost to keep fees affordable for families.School District 40 (New Westminster) is creating 37 new spaces as part of the seismic replacement of Sir Richard McBride Elementary school, including 12 infant/toddler spaces and 25 spaces for children aged three to five years. Children at the facility will play, learn and grow in an inclusive and supportive environment centred around best practices in early childhood education – an opportunity that will help set them up for success as they move on to K-12 education. Construction is anticipated to finish in fall 2021.“When families have quality, affordable child care close to home, it allows parents to continue working and living in their communities,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “That’s why our government is making it easier for schools to offer child care, so more families can have peace of mind knowing their kids are benefiting from school facilities that are already enriched for learning and play.” Mongio Early Learning Center is adding 98 spaces at its existing facility on Royal Avenue, including 12 infant/toddler spaces, 50 spaces for children aged three to five years, 20 preschool spaces and 16 school-age spaces. This takes the total number of spaces at the facility to 183.The organization works closely with the Kinsight Supported Child Development Program to offer inclusive child care, as well as the Spirit of the Children Society to teach children about Indigenous cultures and traditions. The centre, expected to open in July, will have an in-house chef to provide children with healthy, nutritious meals.“The east end of New Westminster is experiencing significant population and employment growth, especially fuelled by the Royal Columbian Hospital,” said Judy Darcy, MLA for New Westminster. “In this diverse city, these new child care spaces mean families who are new to the Royal City or new to Canada can be sure their children are getting the best start in life, close to home, where experienced staff are passionate about nourishing their children’s development.”These new spaces in New Westminster are part of the fastest creation of child care spaces in B.C.’s history. They were included in March 2020’s milestone announcement of 13,000 new spaces the Province has funded since July 2018.An additional 4,100 spaces, funded through the 2017 Budget Update and the Early Learning and Child Care agreement with the Government of Canada, takes the total to more than 17,000 licensed spaces since July 2017.Since launching in February 2018, the Childcare BC plan has helped parents save almost $500 million through the Affordable Child Care Benefit (ACCB) and Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative (CCFRI). Over 69,500 children have been approved for ACCB benefit plans since the start of the program. Currently, over 61,000 licensed child care spaces are approved to receive CCFRI funding. Investing in child care and early childhood education is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Jonathan Coté, Mayor of New Westminster – “The City of New Westminster is committed to working with the Province, School District 40 and the non-profit sector to enhance access to quality and affordable child care. These projects not only demonstrate the power of partnership, but also meet an important community need and contribute to the family friendliness of our city. We look forward to exploring future partnership opportunities that can help New Westminster families meet their child care needs.”Anita Ansari, chair, board of education, New Westminster Schools —“We have been hearing from parents across the district about child care pressures they’re facing and we’re working hard to help alleviate them. That’s why it made sense to use the opportunity of the new Richard McBride school building to meet that goal – to not only keep delivering the care options that are remaining on the site, but also to add more spaces to help more families. It’s all part of making public schools more accessible for students and families alike.”Xiang Li, Mongio Early Learning Center — “On behalf of the families and staff at Mongio, I wanted to say how grateful we are to have received this funding. Even before we opened our doors to the public in May 2019, we were very aware of the shortage of child care spaces in our community. For the needs of the families in New Westminster and surrounding areas, we knew we had to open up more spaces. Some of our current children who will be moving into our upstairs classrooms are very excited and can’t wait to see their new rooms.”Quick Facts:
As the Province moves toward its “new normal” under COVID-19, child care capital builds may see unexpected delays.
Once operational, child care providers will be required to follow guidelines provided by the Ministry of Health and BC Centre for Disease Control to keep staff and the families they serve safe and to limit the risk of transmission.
Recent changes made by the Ministry of Education to the School Act will make it even easier for school boards create and operate before- and after-school care. The changes will also require school boards to create an inclusive child care policy and prioritize space that is not being used for K-12 students for child care.
To date, the Province has invested more than $19 million to provide nearly 12,000 early childhood educators with a $1-per-hour wage enhancement, which increased to $2 per hour in April 2020, to better recognize the important work they do.

It offers an enriching play-based program that follows the early learning framework. Activities will include child-directed learning at learning centres, circle time, art, yoga and large movement, music, weekly baking opportunities and a soccer program in the summer.The covered outdoor play space allows for the extension of indoor activities in all weather conditions.

The curriculum will teach children about Indigenous cultures, with Elders visiting for storytelling and traditional drumming. Children will also have the opportunity to learn about science, math, drama, music, arts and culture. Supports are available for families who are new to Canada, as well as for Indigenous families and those with extra support needs.“KCDC was relieved and excited for the funding with the creation of 42 more spaces,” said Helen Blair, director of education for the Kamloops Child Development Centre. “The new spaces mean we will not have to ask parents to find new child care when they age up to the next age group.

As parents return to work, the Province is making affordable, quality child care more accessible for families in North Vancouver by investing in 16 new spaces, scheduled to open in September 2020.“Having access to culturally sensitive child care can help keep children connected to their community, history and traditions throughout their life,” said Katrina Chen, Minister of State for Child Care. “These new licensed spaces will provide quality care that parents can rely on and an inclusive curriculum where children can grow and learn while immersed in their Indigenous culture.”With support from the Childcare BC New Spaces Fund, the Squamish Nation is creating 16 new licensed child care spaces for children aged three to five years at a new facility on the Capilano Reserve.

The programs will align Indigenous knowledge with how children learn and develop during their early years, focusing on nurturing connections to the land and environment through outdoor cultural practices.“We are looking forward to the new daycare opening in North Vancouver this fall, which is in direct response to our community’s need for supportive and accessible child care,” said Kristen Rivers, co-chair, Squamish Nation Council. “We will be offering community-based child care, with our approach, philosophy and practices developed through a Squamish Nation lens.

As parents return to work, the Province is making affordable, quality child care more accessible for families in Port Alberni by investing in 48 new licensed spaces.  “As people in communities across B.C. begin returning to work as part of the gradual restart of our economy, having safe access to child care close to home is critically important,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “These new spaces will support Port Alberni parents as they return to work and offer a safe and nurturing place for children to begin on a pathway to lifelong learning.”The Childcare BC New Spaces Fund is supporting two projects that will create more child care options for Port Alberni families. Kackaamin Family Development Centre (KFDC) is building a new child care centre with 32 spaces for children under the age of 12. In addition, Alberni Valley Saplings is creating 16 spaces for children under the age of 12.KFDC is a trauma and addictions recovery treatment facility for Indigenous and non-Indigenous families. The centre allows families to stay together while a parent receives treatment. The new child care spaces mean the centre will be able to accept up to 14 families into the treatment program and provide children with safe and inclusive care on site.“We believe that healthy families are the foundation of healthy communities,” said Lisa Robinson, executive director, KFDC. “This support from the Province means we can make child care available at our facility for even more families, helping to keep children with their parents while they recover and learn to make positive choices that enable them to cope better with life’s challenges.”Alberni Valley Saplings will offer inclusive programming and extended hours to accommodate families who need care outside of traditional business hours. The centre is located within a collection of community services, including the Citizens Advocacy Society and Literacy Alberni. The location provides Saplings children with the opportunity to build relationships and connections with a diverse community right outside their door. The centre is expected to open in July 2020.“Our community is desperate for more quality child care and we are so pleased that the Childcare BC New Spaces Fund means we can offer that for Port Alberni families,” said Jessica Thompson, co-owner and operator of Alberni Valley Saplings. “We are a play-based and nature-focused centre and look forward to spending lots of time outside, helping the children in our care build a connection to the natural world.”These new spaces in Port Alberni are part of the fastest creation of child care spaces in B.C.’s history. They were included in March 2020’s milestone announcement of 13,000 new spaces the Province has funded since July 2018.“For too long, families in our community weren’t able to access quality, affordable child care,” said Scott Fraser, MLA for Port Alberni. “Our government is delivering new spaces right here in Port Alberni so that more parents will able to go to work, attend school and enjoy life, knowing that their kids are being cared for in a safe, nurturing environment.”An additional 4,100 spaces, funded through the 2017 Budget Update and the Early Learning and Child Care agreement with the Government of Canada, brings the total to more than 17,000 new licensed spaces since July 2017.Since launching in February 2018, the Childcare BC plan has helped parents save almost $500 million through the Affordable Child Care Benefit (ACCB) and Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative (CCFRI). Over 69,500 children have been approved for ACCB benefit plans since the start of the program. Currently, over 61,000 licensed child care spaces are approved to receive CCFRI funding. Investing in child care and early childhood education is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:
As the Province moves towards its “new normal” under COVID-19, child care projects may have unexpected delays.
Once operational, child care providers will be required to follow guidelines provided by the Ministry of Health and BC Centre for Disease Control to keep staff and the families they serve safe and to limit the risk of transmission.
Three child care providers in the mid-island are providing child care for no more than $10 a day as part of the Childcare BC Universal Prototype Sites.
To date, the Province has invested more than $19 million to provide nearly 12,000 early childhood educators with a $1-per-hour wage enhancement, which increased to $2 per hour in April 2020, to better recognize the work they do.

As parents return to work, the Province is making affordable, quality child care more accessible for families in Hartley Bay by investing in 24 new licensed spaces, scheduled to open by summer 2021.“A child’s early years are so important, and I am pleased that this new child care centre will offer culturally relevant, quality child care for Gitga’at children and play a positive role in helping them remain connected to their community, traditions and history as they grow older,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “Having this centre near the local elementary school will also provide parents with one drop-off and pickup location and will help younger children feel safe and comfortable knowing their older siblings are nearby.”The Childcare BC New Spaces Fund is supporting the Gitga’at First Nation's construction of a new standalone building where 15 school-aged child care spaces and nine spaces for children under the age of 12 will be available for local families.“By making investments in child care, we are giving more parents the option to pursue their work or educational goals, knowing that their kids have a safe, nurturing environment to learn in,” said Jennifer Rice, MLA for North Coast. “I’m proud that this investment will mean better access to good-quality and culturally appropriate child care for families in Hartley Bay, and a facility that meets the community’s needs.”The curriculum will be created with input from Elders to provide children with culturally enriched learning, such as storytelling, language and traditional art. The existing centre currently provides morning and afternoon snacks for children at no additional cost to parents, and at the new building, which is located across from the local elementary school’s home economics building, the children will receive lunch as well.“The funding for this daycare is very important, as it is currently run from a small two-bedroom house, which makes it hard to have separate programs customized for different age groups,” said Teresa Robinson from Gitga’at First Nation. “Parents are welcome to join the children in the afternoon programming, but because of the limited space, that doesn’t often happen. The new building will be a great asset to the program and community, helping to bring families together and be more involved in their children’s early learning.”The centre will provide staff with the opportunity to upgrade their qualifications locally and become certified early childhood educators without having to travel for their certificates. In addition to the child care centre, the building will house an Aboriginal Head Start on Reserve, with seven spaces moving from another location. The project is part of the Gitga’at First Nation’s strategic plan, which includes building a hotel and restaurant, grocery store and commercial community kitchen.These new spaces in Hartley Bay are part of the fastest provincewide creation of child care spaces in B.C.’s history and were included in the March 2020 milestone announcement of 13,000 new spaces the Province has funded since July 2018.An additional 4,100 spaces, funded through the 2017 Budget Update and the Early Learning and Child Care agreement with the Government of Canada, takes the total to more than 17,000 new licensed spaces since July 2017.Since launching in February 2018, the Childcare BC plan has helped parents save almost $500 million through the Affordable Child Care Benefit (ACCB) and Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative (CCFRI).

The Province, through BC Housing, and the City of Vancouver, the BC Non-Profit Housing Association and the Pembina Institute, are working together to find ways to make homes safer, more energy-efficient and less polluting, while reducing heating costs for residents.The partners are launching an initiative called the Reframed Lab to do retrofit demonstration projects on up to five multi-unit residential buildings.“The way our homes are built has a direct impact on our health and well-being, and the environment,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “That’s why it’s so important we work together to find new ways to make buildings work better. This partnership will help us take significant action on climate change, while protecting and improving the safe and affordable homes that people need.”While new homes in B.C. must be built to high health, safety and environmental standards, there are significant opportunities to make existing buildings better places to live and reduce the energy they use. Building retrofits also create good, long-term jobs for people in the province and support the growth of B.C.’s sustainable economy.This summer, BC Housing will issue a request for proposals for partners to join the Reframed Lab. Partners from all corners of the construction sector, including architects, contractors, engineers and manufacturers, will come together to create innovative and integrated ways to retrofit existing buildings. Selected teams will be invited to join a six-month exploration lab to learn and share ideas.Teams will prepare designs for a specific building, with support from experts on climate change, energy and health. Their goal will be to demonstrate next-generation solutions that integrate seismic and fire safety, energy efficiency and climate-adaptation upgrades, while dramatically reducing the buildings’ carbon pollution.BC Housing will support the retrofit of the selected buildings with funding from the Capital Renewal Fund, a 10-year, $1.1-billion investment to preserve and improve B.C.’s 51,000 units of social housing.This initiative received $250,000 from the Province’s CleanBC Building Innovation (CBBI) Fund. The CBBI Fund has provided $1.65 million to manufacturers, developers, builders and researchers to accelerate the availability and affordability of advanced building designs, construction methods and technologies that are super efficient and have minimal greenhouse gas emissions over their lifetime.The City of Vancouver will be providing technical and regulatory guidance to help support this work, which will help advance the city’s climate goals as well as housing affordability.CleanBC is a pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. It was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus, and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.'s emission targets.Quotes:George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy –“People’s lives improve immeasurably when they live in well-designed, energy-efficient homes. We are expanding housing options and improving the way those homes function through innovation and design. As part of CleanBC, this program will help build skills and approaches that lead to lower emissions, less pollution and reduced heating costs, among other benefits.”Bruce Ralston, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources –“This new initiative is a great example of how made-in-B.C. innovations, expertise and technology are putting us on the path to a cleaner, better future. Through CleanBC, our government is working to make buildings more energy efficient, reduce carbon pollution and support local communities.”Kennedy Stewart, mayor, City of Vancouver –“To keep Vancouver liveable, we need to decrease our emissions, as well as focus on housing affordability. This initiative is a strong example of how the city is collaborating with other levels of government and external organizations to advance our climate goals, while prioritizing the improvement, resiliency and comfort of residential buildings.”Jill Atkey, CEO, BC Non-Profit Housing Association –“The community housing sector plays a critical role in addressing the climate crisis. Through initiatives like this, we can create sustainable homes and help reduce the energy poverty facing those British Columbians who are disproportionately impacted by climate change.”Karen Tam Wu, B.C. director, Pembina Institute –“We need to transform the renovation of residential buildings in order to eliminate carbon pollution from housing operations, protect tenants from earthquakes and extreme weather, and support affordability. Working together, we can shift the retrofit ecosystem and open the door to healthier, more comfortable, low-carbon homes.”Learn More:To find out more about the Reframed Lab, visit: https://reframedinitiative.org/lab/To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/

More than 100 local governments and First Nations communities have been approved to receive their share of $4.2 million in provincial emergency preparedness funding.This funding is part of the nearly $69.5-million Community Emergency Preparedness Fund (CEPF), designed to help communities prepare for, and respond to, disasters.This investment through the CEPF will support emergency support services (ESS), which provide short-term, essential supports to British Columbians impacted by disasters. It will also support emergency operations centres (EOC), equipment and emergency training at the community level.  “I’m pleased to see so much interest from communities across B.C. in improving ESS and increasing the capacity of their EOCs,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “In B.C., local and First Nations governments lead the initial response to emergencies and disasters in their communities, and this funding will help give them the tools necessary to make sure everyone in B.C. impacted by an emergency is looked after and kept as safe as possible.”The Province is investing more than $2.3 million in communities for the current ESS funding stream. This is in addition to a $1.9-million investment in locally run EOCs. An additional $600,000 is approved in principle, pending further information from communities. Since the September 2017 Budget Update, communities and governments throughout the province have received more than $48 million through the CEPF.“I know how critical it is to be prepared for any possible emergency scenario,” said Jennifer Rice, Parliamentary Secretary for Emergency Preparedness. “When it comes to emergencies in B.C., it’s not a matter of if one will happen, but when. This funding is another step we’re taking as a government to help communities be ready for when disaster strikes.”The CEPF is a suite of programs designed to enhance the resiliency of local and regional governments, First Nations communities and their residents. The Province provides the funding, which is administered by the Union of British Columbia Municipalities and is divided into seven streams:
Flood risk assessment, flood mapping and flood mitigation planning
Emergency support services
Emergency operations centres and training
Structural flood mitigation
Evacuation routes
Indigenous cultural safety and cultural humility training
Volunteer and composite fire departments equipment and training
Emergency Management BC has been working to modernize the ESS program and has transitioned to a digital platform for delivering supports to evacuees impacted by floods and fires. After a successful pilot program in 2019, and after being used in real-life scenarios, such as the recent flood evacuations near Williams Lake and in the Regional District of Kootenay Boundary, the evacuee registration and assistance tool has been launched provincewide.The evacuee registration and assistance tool allows evacuees to self-register online rather than in person at a reception centre. This ensures timely supports and enables evacuees to maintain a safe physical distance during COVID-19, helping to protect them, as well as volunteers, communities and ESS partner agencies.Learn More:For a backgrounder on the CEPF program, with the local and First Nations governments receiving funding and the values of their projects, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/6-26-20_emergency_preparedness_BG.pdf

Lisa Beare, Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture, responsible for Sport, has issued the following statement regarding Vancouver’s bid to host the National Hockey League (NHL) playoffs:“The opportunity to host the NHL playoffs is an exciting event for any community.“While I am disappointed that Vancouver was not chosen as an NHL playoffs hub city, it was an honour to be considered.“I want to thank the Vancouver Canucks for leading the bid efforts to bring the NHL playoffs to Vancouver. Our government was proud to support the bid, and we appreciate the hard work and enthusiasm that went into the process.  “Our government has been clear that our priority is the health and safety of British Columbians. Our hard work in flattening the curve against COVID-19 is what made Vancouver a strong candidate. We are proud of the progress B.C. has made, and we have been clear that we will not bend our rules and risk this progress.  “British Columbia has a record of success hosting high-profile sport events, including the 2010 Olympic Winter Games, 2019 World Junior Ice Hockey Championship and World Rugby Sevens series. Being a potential host has helped highlight the province as a world-class sports destination, and I look forward to future opportunities to bring professional sporting events to our province.“Sport brings communities together, and I am proud of our government’s continuing work to support all levels of sport to return to play and work toward our ‘new normal.’ Our collective efforts made B.C. a strong contender, and we will continue to consider all opportunities to showcase sport in B.C.“Go, Canucks!”

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:""Today, we are announcing 20 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 2,869 cases in British Columbia.""There are 179 active cases of COVID-19 in the province, and 2,517 people who tested positive have recovered.""Of the total COVID-19 cases, 15 individuals are hospitalized, seven of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.""Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 970 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,504 in the Fraser Health region, 131 in the Island Health region, 199 in the Interior Health region and 65 in the Northern Health region.""There has been two new COVID-19 related deaths, one in the Vancouver Coastal Health region and one in the Fraser Health region for a total of 173 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks.

Close contacts have been notified and no students are connected.“Yesterday, Premier John Horgan announced that we are ready to get underway with our transition into Phase 3 of BC's Restart Plan.“This means more parts of our economy, such as the film industry, hotels and spas, can reopen with safety precautions and measures in place. Many businesses that have remained closed will also be reopening their offices.“This is an exciting time because it shows us that we have been able to find our balance in British Columbia. We have flattened our curve and are keeping new cases low, while slowly increasing our social interactions.“This transition is also a time of fear and anxiety for many who have concerns that we are going too far and risking a surge in cases.“We can all take confidence in knowing that we have established clear foundations for a safe path ahead. These are the foundations that will carry us forward for the remainder of this year and into the next, until an effective treatment or vaccine is in place.“Continuing to use our layers of protection will keep us safe; always staying home when ill, fewer faces and bigger spaces, plexi-barriers and one-way pathways, washing our hands, cleaning more, maintaining a safe physical distance from others and using non-medical masks when distancing is challenging.“We can all move at our own pace, based on our own risk assessment. Some individuals may choose to limit their social interactions, and some communities may decide that it is best for visitors to come at another time. As we go through our day, it is important to be respectful of those around us.“We know what we do makes a difference.

People with low to moderate incomes, including those with brain injuries and their families, are moving into 27 new affordable rental homes in Campbell River.The building, named Linda’s Place, is a partnership between the Government of Canada, the Province and the Campbell River Head Injury Support Society.“These new homes will provide new opportunities, security and peace of mind for brain injury survivors and their families,” said Claire Trevena, MLA for North Island. “Our government will continue to work with partners to invest in homes, like the 27 affordable homes at Linda’s Place, to help create healthy and thriving communities.”Located at 531 9th Ave., the four-storey building includes a mix of studio, and one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments. Nine of the units are allocated to people with brain injuries and their families, with rents at or near the shelter rate allowance for people with disabilities. The remaining 18 units will be rented at below-market rents, ranging from $750 per month (one bedroom) to $1,250 (three bedroom).“Our government’s investment in affordable housing in Campbell River is helping improve the lives of people living with brain injuries and their families,” said Adam Vaughan, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development, on behalf of Ahmed Hussen, federal Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and the Minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). “With a safe and affordable place to call home, along with support from the dedicated people at the Campbell River Head Injury Support Society, these families can now focus more energy on rehabilitation and other positive pursuits. This is a community achievement we can all be proud to be a part of.”People started moving into their homes in early June 2020.“On behalf of the City of Campbell River council and community, we thank the continued efforts of the Campbell River Head Injury Society and greatly appreciate the provincial and federal funding support for this important and much-needed community housing resource,” said Andy Adams, mayor, City of Campbell River. “The city has been proud to support this project through waiving development and other cost charges, and to advocate on behalf of the people leading the charge on the development of Linda’s Place over the years. Congratulations and thank you to all for the difference you are making in people’s lives by ensuring they have a safe and supportive place to call home.”The Campbell River Head Injury Support Society, which provides education, support, advocacy and fellowship to brain injury survivors, caregivers and the public about brain injury, will operate the housing. The society created a brain injury specific housing program in 2011 and will provide support services and daily contact with a support worker for brain-injured tenants.“We are very excited for Linda’s Place, where we now have 27 affordable homes to offer to our members and the community,” said Shelley Howard, executive director, Campbell River Head Injury Support Society. “Being able to spend less on rent means more money in their pocket, which means a better quality of life. We are thankful to so many who helped us make this dream a reality.”Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:
The Province, through BC Housing, provided approximately $5.3 million in capital funding for the project.
The Government of Canada, through CMHC, provided $830,000 under the National Housing Co-Investment Fund, including an insured takeout mortgage of $1.97 million.
The City of Campbell River provided approximately $100,000 in municipal waivers.
In addition to this project, the Province is working in partnership to deliver 90 new affordable homes for people in Campbell River:
41 units at the recently purchased Heritage Inn for people who were displaced by the fire at the Pacific West Complex; and

Following conversations with business and worker representatives, the Province of British Columbia has extended the temporary layoffs provisions to a maximum of 24 weeks expiring on Aug. 30, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic.The extension will give employers and workers additional flexibility to support economic recovery in the province with the expectation that businesses honour their obligations to workers and reach agreement with their employees in the event a further extension is required. “This extension will provide even more certainty and flexibility,” said Harry Bains, Minister of Labour. “This will also give additional time to ensure that employers and workers are able to craft agreements if there is a need to further extend temporary layoffs, while still protecting workers’ rights to compensation for length of service.“Our goal is to maintain connections between employers and workers who have a joint interest in supporting the economic recovery of businesses in B.C. and the jobs that go with them. Employers who are not able to return to full operations and need additional time can do so with agreement from their employees, but we expect those employees will be recalled when operations have resumed.”Section 72 of the B.C. Employment Standards Act provides a tool unique in Canada, allowing employers and workers to extend temporary layoffs by making a joint application to the Employment Standards Branch.“We heard loud and clear from employers that they need this extension,” Bains said. “We also know it is important to ensure that workers know that they have to be involved in the agreement with the employer to extend the temporary layoff and have a right to decline the layoff and accept the compensation for length of service which they are entitled to.”Government will continue discussions with worker and employer representatives to ensure the Section 72 applications are processed in a timely and effective manner to support economic recovery and protect workers’ rights.BC’s Restart Plan is supporting business to safely reopen and get people back to work. Employers are also encouraged to make use of the federal wage subsidy to assist them in bringing their workers back. Learn More:For information on employment standards around temporary layoffs, visit: www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/employment-standards-advice/employment-standards/termination#laying-offLearn more about B.C.’s economic recovery planning: http://gov.bc.ca/recoveryideasFor information about BC’s Restart Plan, visit: http://gov.bc.ca/restartbcFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: www.bccdc.ca

The June school restart saw almost 200,000 students safely return back to the classroom, giving the Province and a newly appointed education steering committee important information to prepare for the 2020-21 school year.“Students, educators and families throughout the province have shared heart-warming stories of how meaningful those in-person connections in the classroom were,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “What we’ve learned from this successful June school restart will be invaluable in planning to have even more students in class in September, if it is safe to do so.”On June 1, all kindergarten-to-Grade 5 students had the option to attend school half-time, while students in Grades 6 to 12 had the option to attend school for the equivalent of one day a week. During this time, the student population was limited to no more than 50% in kindergarten to Grade 5, and no more than 20% in Grades 6 to 12. Children of essential service workers and students who require additional support were welcome to attend schools full time.To prepare for September, Fleming appointed a steering committee with representatives from teachers, parents, First Nations, support staff, principals and vice-principals, school boards and trustees, and the public health sector to learn from best practices and find solutions to issues.The committee will review lessons learned from March to June, identify existing and potential issues and propose solutions, and develop and support parent and teacher resources. The Province is committed to ensuring families and education-sector workers have regular updates so they can plan for the school year ahead.  “Boards of education across B.C. recognize the important role that schools play in their communities and the healthy development of children,” said Stephanie Higginson, president, BC School Trustees Association. “With this in mind, boards are committed to ensuring that the students they serve are provided with the best educational opportunities available during these challenging times. Throughout the summer and into September, boards will work closely with the Ministry of Education to ensure as many students as possible will benefit from in-class instruction with strict health and safety guidelines in place in the upcoming school year.”Throughout the pandemic, educators and support workers have ensured that health and safety standards are strictly followed. These include greater space between desks, minimal physical contact, hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette, cleaning of high-contact surfaces twice daily, and clear protocols for drop-offs and lunch and recess breaks, to name a few.Plus, teachers have supported students in new and innovative ways, like organizing virtual music performances, keeping students active and engaged through phys-ed video challenges, teaching Indigenous cooking classes and arranging video scavenger hunts to keep students engaged.Enabling the use of Zoom for B.C. schools has allowed 35,000 educators using that secure video-conferencing platform to bring students together online.The goal is to have even more students in class in September, as long as it is safe to do so based on the advice of Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer. Several return to school scenarios are being developed based on a five-stage approach, allowing schools to respond quickly in the event of a second wave. All five stages are supported by strict health and safety guidelines from the provincial health officer, the BC Centre for Disease Control and WorkSafeBC.Quotes:Teri Mooring, president, BC Teachers’ Federation – “Our teachers and support staff in B.C. have worked incredibly hard throughout this health emergency to support our students and each other. From emergency remote learning to the staged reopening, school staff have been creative, caring and committed.  They have also been concerned about their safety and the well-being of their students. It has been a difficult time for everyone. That’s why it’s good to see the Ministry of Education create this steering committee and working groups to ensure we collaboratively identify all of the issues and plan for solutions before September. This will go a long way to help teachers, support staff, students and their families feel more comfortable about school resuming in the fall.”Paul Faoro, president, CUPE BC –“I want to thank all the CUPE members who work in the K-12 education system. These were uncharted waters for everyone, and collectively we did a great job welcoming students back to school. Over the summer, we’ll be working with our partners in education to ensure schools are safe, welcoming and inclusive in September.”Andrea Sinclair, president, BC Confederation of Parent Advisory Councils (BCCPAC) – “BCCPAC truly appreciated the organization and collaboration put forward by our educational partners and the Ministry of Education. Concerns parents had regarding the reopening of schools, though voluntary, were brought forward and alleviated due to the enormous efforts of our educators and support staff. We believe the spirit of ‘in it together’ will continue to ensure the new school year provides all our students educational opportunities for success.”Quick Facts:
5,000 children of essential service workers and students who needed the extra support attended B.C. schools from March to June 2020.
During the same period, almost 75,000 meals a week were arranged for 16,000 families, and 23,000 technology loans were arranged for students.
Since March 27, 2020, there have been 308,093 visits to the Keep Learning website where students have access to lessons and device-free activities for any age.

As parents return to work, the Province is making affordable, quality child care more accessible for families in Surrey and Coquitlam by investing in five projects that will create 217 new licensed spaces.  “Now more than ever, it’s critical to have good supports like quality and inclusive child care to help families find their ‘new normal’ and continue to thrive,” said Katrina Chen, Minister of State for Child Care. “With the addition of more than 200 new child care spaces in Surrey and Coquitlam, we’re helping them do just that, by making life better and more affordable for parents with young children.”Through the Childcare BC New Spaces Fund, the Province is investing in the following projects:
Just Kiddies Childcare (Coquitlam) – 36 spaces
City of Surrey – 36 spaces
Sowing Seeds Preschool (Surrey) – 20 spaces
St. George Malankara Orthodox Church (Surrey) – 37 spaces
School District No. 36 (Surrey) – 88 spaces
“For too long, families in Surrey have struggled to find quality, affordable child care close to home, and that’s why our government is undertaking the fastest creation of child care spaces in the province’s history,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “We’re making it easier for child care to be delivered on school property, because everyone benefits when kids have services in facilities already equipped for enrichment and play, while families save time and money with one central drop-off location in their neighbourhoods.”These new spaces in Surrey and Coquitlam are part of the fastest creation of child care spaces in B.C.’s history. They were included in March 2020’s milestone announcement of 13,000 new spaces the Province has funded since July 2018.An additional 4,100 spaces, funded through the 2017 Budget Update and the Early Learning and Child Care agreement with the Government of Canada, takes the total to more than 17,000 new licensed spaces since July 2017.Since launching in February 2018, the Childcare BC plan has helped parents save almost $500 million through the Affordable Child Care Benefit (ACCB) and Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative (CCFRI). Over 69,500 children have been approved for ACCB benefit plans since the start of the program. Currently, over 61,000 licensed child care spaces are approved to receive CCFRI funding. Investing in child care and early childhood education is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Garry Begg, MLA for Surrey-Guildford – “The announcement of 88 new child care spaces in Surrey-Guildford is wonderful news for our community. I am so proud to be part of a government that is investing in quality, affordable child care to make life better for families in Surrey.”Harry Bains, MLA for Surrey-Newton – “For too long, calls for affordable, quality child care in our community went unanswered and ignored. Our government is making different choices, creating new child care spaces in Surrey so that families have access to the quality child care they deserve.”Jinny Sims, MLA for Surrey-Panorama – “Investments in child care are good for the economy, and good for kids and families. I’m so proud to be part of a government that is committed to making life better for families in our community.”Quick Facts:
As the Province moves towards its “new normal” under COVID-19, child care capital builds may see unexpected delays.
Once operational, child care providers will be required to follow guidelines provided by the Ministry of Health and BC Centre for Disease Control to keep staff and the families they serve safe and to limit the risk of transmission.
The City of Coquitlam is receiving a $25,000 grant through the Union of British Columbia Municipalities’ Community Child Care Planning Grant Program to help create a long-term child care plan to support families in the community.
Six child care providers in Surrey and three in Coquitlam are providing child care for no more than $10 a day as part of the Childcare BC Universal Prototype Sites Program.
To date, the Province has invested more than $19 million to provide nearly 12,000 early childhood educators with a $1-per-hour wage enhancement, which increased to $2 per hour in April 2020, to better recognize the important work they do.

As parents return to work, the Province is making affordable, quality child care more accessible for families in Vancouver by investing in more than 200 new licensed spaces.  “We know high-quality, affordable child care goes hand in hand with the success of B.C.’s economy,” said Katrina Chen, Minister of State for Child Care. “Now, more than ever, it’s critical that we keep working to make sure our Childcare BC plan reaches families across the province. By partnering with the local school board, we can quickly add new licensed child care spaces to Vancouver neighbourhoods, strengthening the community and giving more parents access to quality care close to home.”  With support from the Childcare BC New Spaces Fund, the Vancouver School Board (SD 39) is creating 226 new licensed child care spaces for school-aged children. These spaces will be run by non-profit organizations and co-located at five elementary schools across the city, including:

A major component of this program is creating a positive, social environment where children can grow and develop the skills they need to succeed.Britannia Community Services will operate school-aged child care at Grandview Elementary school. The organization will work with the local Supported Child Development program to ensure that programming is inclusive and meets the unique needs of each child.Recent changes made by the Ministry of Education to the School Act will make it even easier for boards of education to create and operate before- and after-school care. The changes will also require boards to create an inclusive child care policy and prioritize space that is not being used for K-12 instruction for child care.“Helping families find quality, affordable child care close to home is a priority for our government as we proudly lead the fastest creation of child care spaces in B.C.’s history,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “These new spaces, many of which will be located at schools that are being seismically upgraded or replaced, are great examples of how we can work together to give parents more convenient child care options, and help children transition more easily to kindergarten.”These new spaces in Vancouver were included in March 2020’s announcement of 13,000 new spaces the Province has funded since July 2018.An additional 4,100 spaces, funded through the 2017 Budget Update and the Early Learning and Child Care agreement with the Government of Canada, takes the total to more than 17,000 new licensed spaces since July 2017.Since launching in February 2018, the Childcare BC plan has helped parents save almost $500 million through the Affordable Child Care Benefit (ACCB) and Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative (CCFRI).

As parents return to work, the Province is making affordable, quality child care more accessible for families in Merritt by investing in more than 48 new licensed spaces, expected to open in September.“Ensuring families have access to safe, high-quality child care is critical as we begin the gradual restart of our economy under COVID-19,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “These new spaces will provide much-needed relief to families in Merritt, support the economic growth of our province and help children along a path to lifelong learning.”With support from the Childcare BC New Spaces Fund, the Merritt Youth and Family Resources Society is creating 48 new spaces, including 20 infant/toddler spaces, 12 school-age spaces and 16 multi-age spaces. These are in addition to 28 spaces that were previously funded in part by the government. These included 24 school-age spaces and four infant/toddler spaces, bringing the total number of spaces at this location to 76.“We were able to make the necessary changes required to remain open throughout COVID-19 so we could continue to help families in Merritt and the surrounding communities,” said Lenora Fletcher, executive director, Merritt Youth and Family Resources Society. “For people living in a rural community, it’s important to stay connected and work together.“As parents return to work, we are here to support their families and our communities as we navigate this ‘new normal.’ Our child care approach honours First Nations’ practice and the small-community belief that it takes a community to raise children. It’s an approach that takes more time, but it’s worth the investment and time for the children’s development.”Located at a historic movie theatre site, the facility is downtown, making it accessible for families who live in the city or commute to Merritt. The space will feature an outdoor garden where children can learn about growing fruits, herbs and vegetables. It will also have stroller parking to accommodate parents who walk to drop off and pick up their children.These new spaces in Merritt are part of the fastest creation of child care spaces in B.C.’s history. They were included in March 2020’s milestone announcement of 13,000 new spaces the Province has funded since July 2018.  An additional 4,100 spaces, funded through the 2017 Budget Update and the Early Learning and Child Care agreement with the Government of Canada, brings the total to more than 17,000 new licensed spaces since July 2017.Since launching in February 2018, the Childcare BC plan has helped parents save almost $500 million through the Affordable Child Care Benefit (ACCB) and Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative (CCFRI). Over 69,500 children have been approved for ACCB benefit plans since the start of the program. Currently, over 61,000 licensed child care spaces are approved to receive CCFRI funding. Investing in child care and early childhood education is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:
As the Province moves toward its “new normal” under COVID-19, child care capital builds may see unexpected delays.
Once operational, child care providers will be required to follow guidelines provided by the Ministry of Health and BC Centre for Disease Control to keep staff and the families they serve safe and to limit the risk of transmission.
To date, the Province has invested more than $19 million to provide nearly 12,000 early childhood educators with a $1-per-hour wage enhancement, which increased to $2 per hour in April 2020, to better recognize the important work they do.

The Province is now accepting applications from local governments, community groups and First Nations for nearly $160 million in infrastructure grants to help strengthen communities throughout British Columbia.The funding targets projects ranging from recreation and cultural centres to drinking water and wastewater facilities.In partnership with the Government of Canada, the funds are being made available as part of the second intake of the Community, Culture and Recreation (CCR) infrastructure stream and the Rural and Northern Communities (RNC) infrastructure stream, both part of the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Plan.“Investment in infrastructure is an investment in people. We saw with the first intake in 2018 that there was huge demand for upgrading arenas, building new community centres and improving natural disaster resiliency,” said Selina Robinson, B.C.’s Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “Projects like these will strengthen communities by bringing people together, celebrating our province’s diversity and improving services to support economic growth.”The provincial and federal governments are investing up to $58.7 million under the RNC program and up to $100.6 million under the CCR program.“Investing in community centres, recreation and cultural facilities means children and youth will have a safe place to play and learn, seniors have a place to meet and our clubs and groups can have a home. These facilities build strong, dynamic communities where people want to put down roots and do business,” said Catherine McKenna, federal Minister of Infrastructure and Communities. “Together with the Province, we are supporting projects that will create jobs and bring residents new facilities and programs that will make a real difference in people’s lives for years to come.”The CCR program provides access to funding for projects that will provide upgrades or build new recreation facilities, recreational trails, local community centres and arts and cultural spaces. The program also supports health and educational facilities that uphold the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's Calls to Action. The total federal-provincial contribution for the first intake of CCR was nearly $134 million. The first six successful applicants were announced last fall and the rest will be announced soon.“Investment in infrastructure such as trail and cycling networks, arts and cultural installations and improving accessibility is so valuable to the tourism sector,” said Lisa Beare, B.C.’s Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture. “This funding will help drive visitation, create jobs and increase revenues, benefiting the people in the tourism industry, which is especially important as we work towards recovering from the impact of COVID-19.”The RNC program responds to the unique needs of British Columbia’s small, rural and remote communities that have populations under 25,000. As with the first round of applications under this fund, provincial and federal funding has been set at a higher level to ensure that communities under 5,000 people will have all eligible project costs covered, while those in communities up to 25,000 people will only have to cover 10%.Project criteria support a wide range of infrastructure needs and priorities, including broadband connectivity, efficient and reliable energy, Indigenous health and educational facilities, local public transit and reliable road, air or marine infrastructure, as well as improved resilience to natural disasters and environmental quality. The total federal-provincial contribution for the first intake of RNC is more than $94 million and successful applicants will be announced soon.Local governments and Indigenous communities, as well as for-profit (RNC only) and not-for-profit organizations, are encouraged to submit applications for these programs, through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program on the B.C. government website: www.gov.bc.ca/Investing-in-Canada-Infrastructure-ProgramApprovals for the second intake are expected to be made public in 2021.Quick Facts:
Through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities.

The first of three new fuelling stations for hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles opens this week as part of the Province’s CleanBC transition to cleaner energy solutions to meet 2030-50 greenhouse gas reduction targets.“Hydrogen will play a critical role in B.C.’s transition to a clean energy future, even more so as we focus on economic recovery following COVID-19,” said Bruce Ralston, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources. “Through CleanBC, we are developing a hydrogen roadmap to grow the low-carbon economy and create new opportunities across the province.”North Vancouver-based Hydrogen Technology and Energy Corporation (HTEC) has partnered with 7-Eleven Canada to open a hydrogen fuelling station at the Esso at the Westview Shopping Centre in North Vancouver. Unlike cars and trucks with internal combustion engines and gasoline tanks, hydrogen fuel cell-powered vehicles have a fuel cell that combines hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity, which runs an electric motor. The technology is safe and has existed since the 1960s, but adoption as a means of transportation is relatively new.Support for this station comes partly through a Part 3 Agreement under the BC Low Carbon Fuel Standard. This includes investment for actions that increase the use of low-carbon fuels, as well as $500,000 from the Province’s CleanBC Go Electric Hydrogen Fuelling and Fleet Program.“The BC Low Carbon Fuel Standard is a significant contributor to realizing the new fuelling stations,” said Colin Armstrong, president and chief executive officer, HTEC. “Support through the Part 3 Agreement program and other CleanBC programs have made HTEC's vision a reality.”HTEC and 7-Eleven have begun construction on a second station, which will open on Vancouver Island later this year. The companies are also expanding the network into the Okanagan, with a station set to open in Kelowna next year.CleanBC is a pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. CleanBC was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s emission targets.Quick Facts:
There are currently two public hydrogen fuelling stations operating in the province, with four more (including the one opened on June 25) to open by the end of 2021.
Hydrogen fuelling takes just three to five minutes for an average-sized tank.
The range of light-duty hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles is 600 kilometres.

The Province is investing in Okanagan communities to help with the annual arrival of seasonal fruit pickers and to better protect worker, employer and community health and safety with respect to COVID-19.The B.C. government is providing funding to local governments to help set up designated campsite accommodations and ensure they meet health and safety requirements as outlined by the provincial health officer. All seasonal fruit pickers will also need to take a new online COVID-19 awareness course through AgSafe, an independent association representing B.C. farm employer and worker organizations. The course will outline the rights and responsibilities of both employers and workers when it comes to COVID-19 and the provincial health officer’s rules and guidelines.“Seasonal fruit pickers are a crucial part of our food supply system, helping to get delicious, B.C.-grown fruit, such as cherries, apples, grapes and berries, onto our plates,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “Our government is protecting these workers and local residents by making sure workers have a safe place to camp and are educated on the rules and guidelines Dr. Bonnie Henry has put in place here in British Columbia. The goal is to ensure community safety and this is an important step towards that.”The Province has offered initial support to help ensure the provincial health officer’s requirements are met at Loose Bay campground in Oliver and two camping accommodation sites in Creston. The Ministry of Agriculture has provided the Regional District of Okanagan-Similkameen with $60,000 and the Creston Valley-Kootenay Lake Economic Action Partnership with $112,000 to help support these camping sites with on-site co-ordination and ensure they meet health and safety requirements. Campsite accommodations are also currently being explored in Summerland, Osoyoos, Naramata and the Similkameen.“Domestic temporary workers are a designated essential service and they are a crucial and appreciated resource in maintaining part of the food supply system,” said Karla Kozakevich, chair, Regional District of Okanagan-Similkameen. “Providing seasonal accommodations at Loose Bay Campground helps agricultural workers remain safe and available for service.”Seasonal workers will have to complete the AgSafe COVID-19 awareness course to be able to stay at these campsites. The online course is available in English and French and includes information on physical distancing, hygiene and cleaning, work pods, transportation, tools and equipment, safeguarding community and First Nations health and monitoring employee health.To stay in a designated campsite in the Okanagan, workers must complete the course by passing the online quiz and show proof of completion to employers.“In B.C. the agriculture community has worked hard to meet the COVID-19 outbreak head on,” said Wendy Bennett, executive director, AgSafe. “It is our responsibility to employers and workers in B.C. to provide them with accurate information and useable resources. The COVID-19 awareness course will help keep workplace and communities safe.”The course is available on AgSafe’s website and will be distributed by the BC Agricultural Council and BC Fruit Growers’ Association to their members. Having workers with a certificate will lessen the need for re-teaching the course content when a new person starts work.“We are very pleased that the B.C. government has stepped forward to provide support for Canadian farm workers and their employers,” said David Geen, owner, Jealous Fruits. ""All growers and workers benefit by the training and the raising of awareness around COVID-19. This is a very important public-health measure for the entire community, which also ensures food security in the province of B.C.”Learn More:The online course can be found at: http://agsafe.lingellearning.com/login/index.phpProvincial health officer’s order on industrial work camps: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/covid-19/covid-19-pho-order-industrial-camps.pdf

The Province, through BC Housing, has purchased the 110-room Howard Johnson Hotel at 1176 Granville St. as part of a long-term plan to build a mix of affordable homes for people in Vancouver.“Housing is the foundation of people’s lives and of healthy, safe communities,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “We’re taking action to build more affordable rental homes in Vancouver, as we continue to provide supportive housing and health care to people right now. There’s a real need for housing for people with different incomes, from young families to seniors, and we’ll be engaging with the community on how we can use this site to deliver urgently needed homes.”In the interim, the Howard Johnson site will operate as temporary supportive housing while long-term plans are developed. BC Housing will connect with partners and the community to begin the conversation about how the site and the adjacent parking lot can be used to tackle the housing crisis and build a mix of homes for people in Vancouver.“The purchase of these hotels holds great short- and long-term potential for providing much-needed safe and secure housing that goes beyond four walls and a bed,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “We are working to develop a model of supportive housing that meets people’s needs with appropriate health, mental health and addictions supports, and creates opportunities to live a safer, healthier life as part of a community.”The Province has also purchased the 63-room Buchan Hotel at 1906 Haro St. to provide housing with supports for women. The site is empty, and residents will begin moving into the Buchan in July.Atira Women’s Resource Society will operate the housing at both hotels, which include wraparound supports where people have access to services such as meals, health care, addictions treatment and harm reduction, as well as storage for personal belongings. The sites also have 24/7 staffing to provide security to residents of the building and the surrounding neighbourhood.”Atira is thrilled to be a partner in this essential housing,” said Janice Abbott, CEO, Atira Group. “Especially at this time, it’s even more important that we all come together to ensure people’s fundamental right to housing is honoured, while at the same time, ensuring that the health and well-being of everyone, including people traditionally marginalized by mainstream society, is paramount.”BC Housing is setting up a new community dialogue group that will oversee the supportive housing’s integration within the community and will address any concerns raised by people in the neighbourhood.“The COVID-19 pandemic has put into even-sharper focus our urgent need for housing, especially for our most vulnerable neighbours,” said Kennedy Stewart, mayor, City of Vancouver. “These hotel rooms will provide immediate safety and shelter while we work with the Province and the community to develop the long-term vision. Now, more than ever, we must come together to make sure all our neighbours are safe and supported, and I cannot thank the Government of B.C. enough for its leadership.”These purchases are part of the Province’s ongoing actions to provide housing for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness and build on the more than 780 supportive homes that have been opened in Vancouver in the last two years.In Vancouver, BC Housing and its partners are also operating various temporary housing options in hotels and shelter facilities to serve vulnerable people in Vancouver during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Province will continue to support people after the COVID-19 pandemic and these homes deliver on that commitment.Quick Facts:
The B.C. government provided approximately $55 million to purchase the Howard Johnson hotel and the neighboring development site.
The B.C. government provided approximately $19.4 million to acquire the Buchan Hotel.
The Province is working in partnership to build more than 3,500 new affordable homes for people with a range of incomes in Vancouver:
housing for people with middle incomes: 135 homes
housing for people with low to moderate incomes, including families, seniors and Indigenous peoples: 2,653 homes
housing for women and children leaving violence: 73 homes
housing for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness: 784 homes

New legislation confirms supports for people and businesses, while responding to the fiscal impacts of COVID-19 by allowing government to run deficit budgets.“We are making sure people and business have the support they need, while we work together to restart and rebuild an economy that works for everyone,” said Carole James, Minister of Finance. “Much has changed since we released Budget 2020, and deficits will occur as a result of lower government revenues and our plan to invest in people and support our province’s recovery.”The amendments introduced authorize deficit budgets for the next three years, while the Province supports economic recovery from COVID-19. Additionally, the amendments allow government to continue to table supplementary estimates before the legislative assembly. The amendments also clarify the existing limits and uses of special warrants while the legislative assembly is not in session to maintain essential services and respond to provincial emergencies and disasters like a pandemic. While the amendments allow deficit budgets, the legislation makes no changes to salary holdback requirements for executive council for years where deficits occur.The Economic Stabilization Act brings the B.C. Emergency Benefit for Workers into law and updates the eligibility date to March 1, 2020. The change will allow people whose income is affected by COVID-19 and who filed federal employment insurance claims between March 1 and March 15 to benefit from the support. The application for these individuals will be available as of June 26, 2020. Almost 600,000 people have been approved to receive the benefit to date.The legislation introduced also confirms many of the previously announced supports for people and business from the COVID-19 Action Plan, including:
authorizing filing and payment deferrals for employer health tax, provincial sales tax, hotel tax, carbon tax, motor fuel tax and tobacco tax to Sept. 30, 2020;
postponing the date that late payment penalties apply for commercial properties in classes 4,5,6,7 and 8 to Oct. 1, 2020, to give businesses and landlords more time to pay their reduced property tax, without penalty;
allowing municipalities to keep school taxes and the police tax collected for the Province until January 2021; and
requiring municipalities to remit taxes they collect for TransLink in July 2020 so it can continue operating, as well as allowing other municipalities to continue to make their service payments to BC Transit.
Other measures from the B.C. COVID-19 Action Plan are being done through regulation, such as reducing the school property tax rate for commercial properties, enhancing the B.C. climate action tax credit and pausing B.C. student loan payments.Learn More:To determine your eligibility and apply for the B.C.

British Columbians are taking the next step in BC’s Restart Plan with a gradual transition to Phase 3, including the safe and respectful return of travel and tourism within the province.“Thanks to the hard work and sacrifice of British Columbians, and under the guidance of the provincial health officer, we are now entering Phase 3 of our four-phase restart plan,” said Premier John Horgan. “As we carefully turn up the dial on our activity, we can now look to travel safely around the province. But as we hit the open roads this summer, we must remember we are not leaving COVID-19 behind, and we need to continue to do our part to bend the curve and protect the progress we’ve made.”British Columbians who wish to travel within B.C. this summer are advised to plan ahead and be respectful while visiting communities, especially smaller and rural towns. The provincial health officer has laid out travel guidelines for everyone travelling to and within B.C.:
pre-trip planning and research on available resources at arriving destination;
respecting any local travel advisories to isolated and remote communities;
no travelling for anyone who is sick, and if symptoms develop while travelling – self isolate immediately and contact 811 for guidance and testing;
practising safe physical distancing of two metres at all times;
spending time in small groups and open spaces; and
practising good hygiene, including frequent handwashing and cleaning.
“Like other activities during our COVID-19 pandemic, summer holidays and travel will be different this year,” Premier Horgan said. “We are asking British Columbians to be respectful of the communities you travel to and do your research before you leave. We will help people get the tools and information they need to navigate this new normal safely.”Most of the businesses listed in Phase 3 of B.C.’s Restart Plan now have the guidance they need to safely begin to open. WorkSafeBC, public health officials and industry representatives have developed guidelines for hotels and resorts, parks, the film industry and select entertainment, like movie theatres, and businesses in these sectors have already begun to open with COVID-19 safety plans in place.“We've succeeded in flattening the curve by working together, but COVID-19 will continue to be in our province until we have an effective treatment or vaccine. By staying vigilant and following our foundational rules, we can safely do many of the things that we enjoy for the months to come,” said Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer.The government has also formally extended the provincial state of emergency, allowing Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, to continue to use extraordinary powers under the Emergency Program Act to support the Province's COVID-19 pandemic response. The state of emergency is extended through the end of the day on July 7, 2020, allowing government to continue to take the necessary steps to keep British Columbians safe.“We’re extending the provincial state of emergency, while we work to keep the economy moving and provide more opportunities for B.C. businesses to welcome our communities back,” Farnworth said. “We’ve also introduced legislation that will allow us to put longer-term solutions in place, so we can continue to provide the support British Columbians need to get through this crisis.”On Monday, June 22, 2020, government introduced the COVID-19 Related Measures Act, legislation to allow provisions created for citizens and businesses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to continue as needed after the provincial state of emergency ends.Learn More:For information on Phase 3 and guidelines and advice for safe travel this summer, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID-19For information on BC’s Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/RestartBCLearn more about B.C.’s economic recovery planning: http://gov.bc.ca/recoveryideasFor information on federal and provincial government supports available to individuals, families, businesses and organizations, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covidgovernmentbenefitsFor recommendations on protecting yourself and your community, including for employers, businesses and schools, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/coronavirus-(novel)For more information and latest medical updates on COVID-19, follow the BCCDC on Twitter @CDCofBC or visit its website: http://www.bccdc.ca/

Students and families in Kitsilano are getting a much-needed, seismically safe replacement of Henry Hudson Elementary along with more than twice the number of child care spaces on the school grounds.“Families deserve to send their children to safe, inspiring and engaging schools, and have access to child care in convenient locations,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “The new Henry Hudson Elementary school will accomplish all of that, as a modern educational facility and a true community hub for generations to come.”The replacement of Henry Hudson Elementary is a $40.1-million project funded by the Government of B.C., the Vancouver School Board and the City of Vancouver.“We’re making great progress toward providing seismically safe schools for every student in B.C.,” said David Eby, MLA for Vancouver-Point Grey. “We have tripled the pace of seismic upgrades, with one in six of our approved capital dollars being spent on seismic safety at Vancouver schools.”The Province is investing $29.06 million from the Seismic Mitigation Program for the project. The Vancouver School Board is providing $1.06 million and the City of Vancouver is contributing $10 million for a rooftop child care centre.""This project is yet another example of our commitment to building strong partnerships that deliver for families in Vancouver and help create more vibrant communities,” said Kennedy Stewart, mayor, City of Vancouver. “The city’s $10-million investment helps to more than double the number of child care spaces, providing hundreds of Vancouver families with quality child care options close to where they live.”Henry Hudson Elementary is nearly 110 years old and in need of an upgrade due to its age and condition. Construction on the replacement is set to begin in spring 2022, with the new school expected to be ready for students by September 2024. The school will be built on the existing property, and the current facilities will be demolished after completion.“We are glad that this new seismically safe school will continue to serve the Hudson community for years to come,” said Janet Fraser, chair, Vancouver School Board.The new school will include a neighbourhood learning centre that will retain Hudson’s current child care programming. The new rooftop child care centre will add 69 spaces for children aged four years and under, as well as an additional 30 spaces of before- and after-school care.“For too long, Vancouver families have struggled to find quality, affordable child care close to home, which is why our government is undertaking the fastest creation of child care spaces in the province’s history,” said Katrina Chen, Minister of State for Child Care. “We’re making it easier for child care to be delivered on school property because everyone benefits when kids have services in facilities already equipped for enrichment and play, allowing families to save time and money with one central drop-off location in their neighbourhood.”This project is the 12th seismic upgrade or replacement in Vancouver since September 2017, with $325 million invested to create nearly 7,000 seismically safe student seats in the district, with more to come.In fewer than three years, the Province has approved over $2 billion for 95 major school capital investments throughout B.C., creating almost 26,000 seismically safe seats that will protect students in the event of an earthquake.To continue this momentum, Budget 2020 includes a record $2.8 billion for school capital projects, including $925 million to keep accelerating the Seismic Mitigation Program.Quotes:Suzanne Hoffman, superintendent, Vancouver School Board – ​“Ensuring that all our students attend seismically safe schools is one of the district’s top priorities.” Robert Ford, parent of a Hudson student – ​""The Hudson Elementary seismic project has been in the works for many years. I am both thrilled and relieved that the students will be in a seismically safe replacement school.""Quick Facts:

Many British Columbians are driving much less than they did before the pandemic.As British Columbians continue to stick close to home and follow the directions of Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, this trend is likely to continue.Unfortunately, having fewer vehicles on the road means some drivers can’t resist the urge to speed excessively. Other drivers still get behind the wheel after drinking or using drugs, or let distractions like texting or eating steal their attention. Ultimately, these drivers are stopped by the police, a ditch or a more tragic result.My message to them is blunt: now, more than ever, is not the time for stupidity at the wheel.People working in our health-care system have faced unparalleled pressures helping to save lives during the COVID-19 pandemic – and more recently, to restore our capacity to provide thousands of important surgeries each week.The pandemic continues to touch thousands of people deeply, and it has affected people even when they make the best possible decisions to protect themselves. In contrast, road trauma is almost always preventable, with impairment, speed and distraction among the top contributing factors.Driving responsibly is one way you can show respect for our dedicated health-care professionals and not add to their burden.Driving safely is also easier on your wallet. Violation tickets for behaviours like excessive speeding and distracted driving carry costly penalties because of the proven, increased risk they pose of contributing to a serious crash.What’s more, measures that our government has introduced in recent years, including electronic ticketing and intersection safety cameras, are making it easier to identify unsafe drivers. This means that we can impose sanctions faster, including participation in the Driver Improvement Program or licence suspension. It is worth noting that a single dangerous driving event may result in a driving prohibition of up to 24 months.With the start of summer, there will be more children playing outside and more cyclists and motorcyclists on the roads. At the same time, physical distancing requirements mean it’s more likely that a cyclist, runner or walker may stray into the path of your vehicle.When you’re slower, sober and paying attention, you’re better able to anticipate other road users’ behaviour and react effectively.My colleague, Health Minister Adrian Dix, continues to encourage us to be “all in” as we follow Dr. Henry’s direction to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Echoing that call to the better nature of each of us, I ask you to commit now to being the best driver you know how to be, for everyone’s sake.

People in the area of Keating Cross Road and the Pat Bay Highway will see workers on site through July and August as initial engineering work gets underway on the Highway 17/Keating Cross Road Flyover Project.Field crews will be on site doing geotechnical investigations. This involves drilling holes and analyzing soil samples to better understand subsurface ground conditions. Environmental management and archeological teams will also be on site to do assessments. The geotechnical work may result in lane closures and minor delays on Keating Cross Road and Highway 17. Drivers are asked to use caution and obey the instruction of traffic control personnel.This work will help the ministry develop the project’s design. Public consultation is expected to get underway this fall.The project involves a new “flyover” overpass from the Pat Bay Highway northbound to Keating Cross Road westbound, eliminating the left turn across highway traffic onto Keating Cross Road. The project will also include a realigned southbound on-ramp to the Pat Bay Highway southbound.These upgrades will allow vehicles to travel this busy corridor more safely and efficiently, helping keep local businesses competitive and promote regional economic growth.The Government of Canada has committed more than $16.7 million to this project through the New Building Canada Fund, Provincial-Territorial Infrastructure Component—National and Regional Projects. The District of Central Saanich will contribute $2.5 million. The provincial government will finalize its investment decision for the project following the business case review.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are announcing 13 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 2,835 cases in British Columbia.“There are 174 active cases of COVID-19 in the province and 2,491 people who tested positive have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 16 individuals are hospitalized, seven of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 960 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,480 in the Fraser Health region, 131 in the Island Health region, 199 in the Interior Health region and 65 in the Northern Health region.“There has been one new COVID-19 related death in the Fraser Health region, for a total of 170 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks. In total, six long-term care or assisted-living facilities and one acute-care facility have active outbreaks.“There have been no new community outbreaks. Public health teams continue to provide support for the three remaining community locations.“Today’s modelling shows us that in British Columbia the measures we have in place to protect ourselves and each other from COVID-19, combined with the slow, gradual transition in Phase 2, is working.“We have eased our restrictions in a way that has allowed us to increase our social interactions to around 65%, while keeping our new cases of COVID-19 low.“Looking ahead, until we have an effective treatment or vaccine, the rules for safe social interactions must continue to be maintained as part of our everyday activities to stay at this manageable level.“The modelling tells us that if we go too far, we risk a rapid rebound in B.C., something many others are now experiencing.“To continue to maintain this careful balance, we have to keep doing what we’re doing as individuals and we all know what we need to do.“The foundations of safety are clear: always stay home when ill, follow good handwashing hygiene, maintain a safe physical distance and use barriers and a non-medical mask if that is challenging. These are our layers of protection and will help protect us all.“Effective contact tracing is another important layer of protection. As individuals, we also have an important role to play in contact tracing. It is a team effort and requires commitment from all of us to be successful.“Our responsibility is to keep our bubbles small and know everyone we are with at all times, to allow public health teams to notify everyone who may be at risk and contain the spread as quickly as possible.“This approach applies to all of us, no matter where we may be: at home, at work, at school or travelling to another community.“The things that we do, the decisions we make each day, make a difference. We can find the balance as we chart our cautious path forward. Together, let’s continue to do our part to protect our province, our communities, our Elders and loved ones.”Learn More:The latest modelling presentation and information is available online: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/modelling-projectionsFor more information about BC’s Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/restartbcFor B.C.’s surgical renewal plan, visit:

Lisa Lapointe, chief coroner of the BC Coroners Service, has issued the following statement in response to proposed legislative amendments to the Mental Health Act:“Today, the BC Coroners Service became aware of the proposed amendments to the Mental Health Act tabled by Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions.“Every death in this province due to illicit drug toxicity is tragic, and the BC Coroners Service is supportive of meaningful efforts to reduce the number of lives lost.“I recognize that the deaths of those under 19 years old remain a small proportion of those tragedies, representing approximately 1% of the more than 6,000 illicit drug toxicity fatalities since 2015.“As evidenced by previous inquest and death review panel recommendations, there is a recognized need for a comprehensive, culturally safe system of care and treatment for those experiencing problematic substance use in B.C., including youth.“Without an established evidence-based, accessible system of substance-use treatment services, I am concerned there is the potential for serious unintended consequences as a result of these legislative amendments, including the potential for an increase in fatalities.“It is also of critical importance that the laudable work being done by the Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions and others in reducing the fear and stigma related to substance use, and encouraging those experiencing problematic substance use to seek help, is not negatively impacted by the proposed legislative amendments.“The BC Coroners Service looks forward to receiving a copy of the proposed legislative amendments and the opportunity to engage in further discussions.”

The Government of British Columbia is taking action to help stratas better mitigate the rising costs of insurance.Actions include bringing more transparency to the strata insurance industry, closing loopholes related to depreciation reports, ending referral fees paid to strata property managers and giving strata owners and corporations the tools they need to do their part.“The rising cost of strata insurance is a major financial pressure facing thousands of British Columbians during an already challenging time,” said Carole James, Minister of Finance. “This is an extremely complex issue playing out in the private insurance industry, but that doesn’t lessen our government’s commitment to doing what we can to make the situation better. Everyone has a role to play in returning the market to balance and today our government is taking a first step, with the understanding that we will take further action as needed.”Through amendments to the Strata Property Act and Financial Institutions Act, as well as associated regulatory changes, government will:
end the practice of referral fees between insurers or insurance brokers and strata property managers or other third parties;
set out clear guidelines for what strata corporations are required to insure to help strata councils make informed decisions on their insurance policies;
require strata corporations to inform owners about insurance coverage, provide notice of any policy changes, including increasing deductibles, and allow stratas to use their contingency reserve fund when necessary to pay for unexpected premium increases; and
protect strata unit owners against large lawsuits from strata corporations if the owner was legally responsible for a loss or damage, but through no fault of their own.
The legislation also paves the way for government to make further regulatory changes to:
identify when stratas are not required to get full insurance coverage;
strengthen depreciation reporting requirements, including limiting the ability to use existing loopholes in the legislation to avoid completing depreciation reports;
change the minimum required contributions made by strata unit owners and developers to a strata corporation’s contingency reserve fund;
require brokers to disclose the amount of their commission, which has been reported to be at times in excess of 20%; and
strengthen notification requirements to strata corporations of changes to insurance coverage and costs, or an intent not to renew. 
These regulatory changes will be made after further consultation with strata community stakeholders.“We understand the difficulty people living in stratas face when they experience a large increase in insurance costs or have challenges finding insurance at all,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “This legislation is a first step to help strata corporations now as we continue to work on this complex issue. I look forward to the BC Financial Services Authority’s final report in the fall, which will help identify further actions government can take to support people living in strata properties.” Government’s actions were guided in part by input from key stakeholders, including:
Condominium Home Owners Association of BC;
Vancouver Island Strata Owners Association;
Insurance Brokers Association of BC;
Insurance Bureau of Canada;
Insurance Council of BC;
Office of the Superintendent of Real Estate;
Real Estate Council of BC;
Mortgage Brokers Association of BC
BC Real Estate Association; and
the interim report of the BC Financial Services Authority.
The Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing and the Ministry of Finance will also review the final report from BC Financial Services Authority in the fall to determine what further changes government can make to help lower strata insurance costs for people.Learn More:To read the interim findings from the BC Financial Services Authority, visit: https://www.bcfsa.ca/pdf/publications/StrataInsuranceFindingsReport.pdfA backgrounder follows.

Government has introduced amendments to the Mental Health Act to improve the care and safety of youth under the age of 19 who are experiencing severe problematic substance use by providing short-term involuntary emergency stabilization care following an overdose.Based on the expert advice of the BC Children’s Hospital and other renowned child and youth advocates, the changes will enable hospitals to keep youth safe immediately following an overdose. The proposed changes are designed to prioritize the best interest of youth and facilitate better connections to voluntary culturally safe care.“This is a new and much needed tool in our toolbox to help youth with severe substance use challenges and their families,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “Experts are telling us this emergency measure is vital to ensure the immediate safety of young people in crisis. We are taking that advice and we are enabling hospitals to extend the care they provide to help youth stabilize and leave the hospital with a clear plan to access voluntary services and supports in the community.”  Youth living with severe problematic substance use who are admitted to a hospital following a life-threatening overdose can be admitted for stabilization care for up to 48 hours or until their decision-making capacity is restored, for a maximum of seven days. This short-term emergency care will be provided at hospitals throughout the province where there is an existing designated psychiatric unit or observation unit.The proposed changes to the Mental Health Act will support health-care providers and hospitals to provide medically necessary health care and observation for a youth to recover from an overdose, regain their decision-making capacity and create opportunities to engage with supports and services to treat the problematic substance use. Following the period of stabilization care, youth will be connected to supports and services in the community.  Quotes follow in a backgrounder.

People in the Cowichan Valley and Victoria will have better, safer access to fresh home-delivered, locally grown produce and products, thanks to a Job Creation Partnership project funded by the provincial government.The Cowichan Valley Co-Operative Marketplace (Cow-op), a non-profit farmer and food processor co-operative, will receive nearly $100,000 to develop a contactless home delivery system while supporting farmers and processors in the region. Two local eligible job seekers will have the opportunity to build transferable skills in logistics, operations and community engagement until May 2021.“The past few months have highlighted the importance of food security, as well as adaptability to deliver food from farm to table during COVID-19,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “Looking forward, Cow-op’s innovative contactless home delivery system will provide training and work experience for two local individuals, while developing a safe way to deliver fresh, healthy food to buyers and supporting farmers to grow and sell their products sustainably.”Sonia Furstenau, MLA for Cowichan Valley, said: “I’m pleased to see that the Cow-op marketplace will continue to build on their model of providing fresh local food from field to front door. This service directly supports the health and well-being of families in the agriculture business and those who enjoy their products, and helps build food security and resiliency in Cowichan.”The Cow-op is an initiative of the Cowichan Valley Co-operative Marketplace in partnership with Cowichan Green Community. It has been providing an online marketplace for locally grown and harvested food since 2014.“When the main sales avenues for local farmers disappeared during the pandemic, the Cowichan Valley Co-operative Marketplace and its online farmers market, Cow-op.ca, became a lifeline for them,” said Derrick Pawlowski, executive director, Cow-op.ca. “We are thrilled to provide a wide range of experiences to participants and hopefully will inspire more passionate work in the sectors of food security, natural resources and agriculture, and sales and services.”The Ministry of Social Development and Poverty Reduction is providing the funding to Cow-op through the Job Creation Partnership stream of WorkBC’s Community and Employer Partnerships (CEP).Quick Facts:
Over $19 million was invested in CEP projects around B.C. in 2019-20.
CEP’s goal is to increase employment and work experience opportunities in communities throughout B.C.

Premier John Horgan has issued the following statement on the National Day of Remembrance for Victims of Terrorism:“It’s been 35 years since 329 passengers and crew on Air India Flight 182 were murdered. Two hundred and eighty Canadian lives lost and countless family and friends’ lives forever changed by this cowardly act. The bombing of Air India Flight 182 is the largest mass killing in Canadian history. Today, we remember all Canadians, both at home and overseas, who have been victimized by acts of terrorism.“I can only imagine how difficult the last 35 years have been for those directly affected by this attack. Annual memorials take place around the world and here in British Columbia, families and friends have gathered to remember at the Air India memorial in Stanley Park.“The trauma from acts of terrorism are still with us today and for some, the trauma may never heal. However, days like today remind us of our shared humanity and the empathy we can have for those in need. It also provides us a moment to pause and reflect on the tragedy of lives lost too soon.“Together, we can build a stronger society when we defend our shared values of diversity, equality, kindness and respect, while also building a more inclusive, multicultural country where everyone feels welcome.”For a French translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/6-23-20_Day_of_Remembrance-French.pdfFor a Chinese translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/6-23-20_Day_of_Remembrance-Chinese(traditional).pdfFor a Punjabi translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/6-23-20_Day_of_Remembrance-Punjabi.pdfFor a Hindi translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/6-23-20_Day_of_Remembrance-Hindi.pdfFor an Urdu translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/6-23-20_Day_of_Remembrance_Urdu.pdfFor an Arabic translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/6-23-20_Day_of_Remembrance_Arabic.pdf

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are providing case updates for three 24-hour reporting periods.“In the first reporting period from June 19 to June 20, we had 10 new cases. In the second reporting period from June 20 to June 21, we had six cases and in the last 24 hours, we have had a further 16 new cases.“This represents 32 new cases since we reported on Friday, for a total of 2,822 cases in British Columbia.“There are 182 active cases of COVID-19 in the province and 2,471 people who tested positive have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 14 individuals are hospitalized, six of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 954 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,474 in the Fraser Health region, 131 in the Island Health region, 198 in the Interior Health region and 65 in the Northern Health region.“There has been one new COVID-19 related death in the Fraser Health region, for a total of 169 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks. In total, six long-term care or assisted-living facilities and one acute-care facility have active outbreaks.“There have been no new community outbreaks. Public health teams continue to provide support for the three remaining community locations.“The gradual easing of restrictions means more activities can get underway, but it does not change the need to maintain a safe social distance from others and to keep our groups small.“The provincial health officer's order for no more than 50 people at any gathering stands and will be in place until we can stop COVID-19 in our province with an effective treatment or vaccine.“This applies to everyone, no matter what the circumstances may be.“Phase 3 will gradually allow for more types of activities, but how we interact with each other does not change. We have to remember that when the virus is anywhere, the risk is everywhere, and, as a result, we must remain cautious.“The same approach we have taken with Phase 2 needs to be taken with Phase 3: staying low and slow, and modifying our approach as needed to move forward with thought and consideration.“The order for restaurants and pubs has been amended to provide greater clarity around the size of barriers. Additionally, if there is an event on the premises, the names and phone numbers or emails of patrons at the event must be collected in case there is a need for public health officials to conduct contract tracing.“If you are considering travelling outside of your local community to another part of the province, be respectful of the communities you plan to visit this summer and take the same precautions you would at home, as you enjoy the many beautiful spots within our province.“Like all of us, B.C. communities are doing their own assessment to determine what may be safe and what is best to avoid. Some towns and regions who rely on tourism are eager to welcome visitors with safety measures in place, while others might not be ready to welcome people this summer.“Respectful travel means maintaining safe social interactions, planning ahead and being prepared.“If you get sick while away, self-isolate immediately, contact the local public health teams to get tested and get direction on whether you should go home or isolate in place.“Before you go, find out what services are available and be as self-sufficient as possible with your own groceries and essential supplies to avoid putting an additional burden on smaller communities.“Once away, closed spaces, close contact and crowds are higher risk, so anything that involves these things needs to be done with caution. This is done by taking precautions to protect yourself and those around you by maintaining a safe physical distance and using a cloth face covering or non-medical mask, for those times when a safe distance cannot always be maintained.“As you travel this summer, please remain vigilant to protect others, recognizing there are vulnerable people everywhere. Be understanding, take care of each other and let’s continue to do our part to protect our province and ourselves by protecting each other.”Learn More:For more information about BC’s Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/restartbcFor B.C.’s surgical renewal plan, visit:

Government has introduced legislation to enable courts to accept electronic wills and to permit the remote witnessing of wills.The changes will benefit British Columbians who, for example, have a disability, are quarantined, live in rural or remote communities, or would have difficulty attending a lawyer’s or notary’s office due to child care or other responsibilities. Proposed amendments to the Wills, Estates and Succession Act will enable the courts to accept wills that are created on a computer and signed electronically, and for which there is no printed copy. The amendments will also allow the use of technology for the witnessing of wills by people who are in different locations. “This modernization initiative was underway before the pandemic, but COVID-19 has made the reasons for these changes obvious to all British Columbians,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “Requiring lawyers or notaries to tromp in and out of hospitals to satisfy legal requirements for wills that could be met easily with existing technology is no longer acceptable to the public. Happily, this is a shift that is endorsed by most practitioners, as well as leading law reform work already underway by a respected national body.”In British Columbia, like many provinces, an emergency order was made to allow the remote witnessing of wills during the pandemic. By making this change permanent, this order will not be necessary going forward.The amendments respond to concerns raised by the public and the legal profession about a lack of flexibility in the rules regarding wills. The changes are based on work being undertaken by the Uniform Law Conference of Canada, which makes recommendations to harmonize and reform laws across the country.“Making a will is important so your estate is distributed as you wish and the people you love and the charities and organizations you care about are provided for,” said Eby. “With this change, lawyers and notaries will no longer have to tell very sick people that there needs to be a personal visit in the hospital, or a court application, before their wishes can be recognized. Technology makes court applications, or the risks of these kinds of visits, unnecessary. COVID-19 has accelerated this necessary reform.”Learn More: For more about wills and estate planning, visit:

The B.C. government has introduced Bill 20, the Motor Vehicle Amendment Act (No.2), 2020, legislation that will, if passed, offer policy flexibility around the use of the decal on B.C. licence plates.For example, the legislation allows for validation decals to be non-expiring or valid for periods longer than one year. It also provides for regulations that could authorize ICBC to issue other documents, or take other actions, respecting the validity of a vehicle licence instead of issuing validation decals.Over the coming months, consultation will begin with law enforcement, brokers and other stakeholders to inform future policy decisions about any changes to use of the decal, as well as to support the drafting of associated regulations.Learn More:ICBC reinstates commercial driver tests by appointment: https://www.icbc.com/about-icbc/newsroom/Pages/2020-jun10.aspxICBC reinstates all knowledge tests by appointment: https://www.icbc.com/about-icbc/newsroom/Pages/2020-may28.aspxICBC waives cancellation and re-plating fees: https://www.icbc.com/about-icbc/newsroom/Pages/2020-apr16.aspxICBC defers payments by 90 days: https://www.icbc.com/about-icbc/newsroom/Pages/2020-mar24.aspxInsurance renewable by phone: https://www.icbc.com/about-icbc/newsroom/Pages/2020-mar18.aspx

Government has introduced the COVID-19 Related Measures Act, legislation that will allow for the provisions created for citizens and businesses in response to the pandemic to be formalized and unwound as appropriate after the provincial state of emergency ends.“This legislation will support the delicate work of formalizing and unwinding emergency measures relied on by British Columbians during the pandemic in a way that recognizes that the impacts of COVID-19 may still be felt for an extended period after the state of emergency is over,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “British Columbians can be confident that these emergency orders will not end abruptly the moment the declaration of a state of emergency ends. They will have adequate notice to prepare.”Currently, all ministerial orders made by the solicitor general under the Emergency Program Act (EPA) end immediately at the conclusion of the provincial state of emergency. Specific orders already made will be extended in the legislation after the end of the state of emergency by 45 or 90 days. Given the possibility of a second wave of COVID-19, the act will also provide the possibility for extension of COVID-19 related orders by up to one year after the act is brought into force, if required. The act will also incorporate current ministerial emergency orders so the legislature may pass and formally recognize them.Separately, the act allows for the creation of regulations that provide protections from civil liability. For example, emergency orders to protect essential service providers, such as child care operators, and amateur sport organizations from liability, where they operate responsibly and in accordance with public health orders and guidelines, are already in place to respond to concerns from those sectors.Finally, the proposed legislation introduces two permanent, targeted amendments to the EPA that clarify the powers available to the minister under section 10 to “do all acts and implement all procedures that the minister considers necessary,” and delegates some specific powers to cabinet instead of a single minister.“Our government took a range of actions to keep communities safe and support essential service workers throughout the pandemic,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “This legislation assures British Columbians that the measures we’ve put in place to fight the impacts of COVID-19 will be there as long as needed.”Learn More:Ministerial orders made under the Emergency Program Act that are being enacted under the proposed legislation and/or extended in effect beyond the end of the state of emergency (as of June 1, 2020): https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/justice/covid-19#emergency-ordersFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/

More effective mines permitting and better protection of workers, the environment and the public are among proposed updates to the Mines Act.“With the changes we are bringing forward today, our government continues to act on the unanimous recommendations of the Mining Jobs Task Force to strengthen B.C.’s mining sector and improve the permitting process,” said Bruce Ralston, Minister of Energy Mines and Petroleum Resources. “The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced that health and safety must remain a top priority as we continue to build a strong economic recovery that works for people.”If passed, the legislation will create a new chief permitting officer position, distinct from the chief inspector of mines. The chief permitting officer will ensure the mine permitting process is efficient and effective. The chief inspector will retain responsibility for health, safety and enforcement.The legislation will further strengthen government’s ability to hold mines accountable. These changes include strengthening investigation authorities, clarifying offence provisions and increasing the limitation period from three to five years in both the Mines Act and the Environmental Management Act.The proposed changes will also formalize the creation of the Mine Audits and Effectiveness Unit, led by a chief auditor. This unit will conduct audits to ensure mining regulation in B.C. is effective and aligned with global best practices.The proposed changes were informed by lessons learned from the Mount Polley disaster, recommendations from the Office of the Auditor General and the Mining Jobs Task Force, consultation with stakeholders and input received during the 2019 public comment period on the proposed changes to the Mines Act.A more efficient and effective permitting process, strengthened regulatory oversight and the creation of an audit function will support quality economic growth for British Columbians while ensuring mining is conducted safely and responsibly.Quick Facts:
B.C.’s mining industry had an estimated value of production of nearly $9 billion in 2019. 
In 2018-19, the B.C. mining industry paid over $400 million in mineral taxes to the Province.

The Province is extending interim measures, including a new round of funding and supports for children with special needs and youth aging out of care, to help children, youth and families through the ongoing pandemic.“COVID-19 has turned our world upside down, and we need to do all we can to support young people and families who are still struggling,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “As a Province, we’re moving ahead with a restart plan focused on restoring services that have been negatively impacted by the pandemic. In the meantime, vulnerable youth and families can continue to rely on interim supports to help them through this time of transition.”A final round of the short-term Emergency Relief Support fund for children and youth with special needs and their families will provide a direct payment of $225 per month for up to three months to assist eligible families. This will be available from July 1 to Sept. 30, 2020, and will reach twice as many families as the first round of funding, helping them to access critical supports.Flexible parameters regarding autism funding and the temporary suspension on maintenance payments for children on special needs agreements will remain through to Aug. 31, 2020. Flexible use of respite funding will continue for families until March 31, 2021.Measures to ensure youth and young adults from care continue receiving the same level of service, even if they were set to age out, have been extended to Sept. 30, 2020. Youth living in foster care, contracted residential agencies or with relatives through the extended family program are able to stay where they are.Independent living and youth agreements will be extended, and participants in the Agreements with Young Adults (AYA) program can continue to receive funding. Any ""paused"" AYA time during the pandemic, or the inability for a youth to find employment because of COVID-19 during a natural program break, will not count toward the maximum 48-month program duration or age limit of 27. A new temporary life-skills option has been developed for AYA, with expanded program access, including cultural programs, and fewer required hours of participation per week.Social workers are reaching out to youth and young adults to support them and modify agreements where extensions are needed over this time frame. Families accessing children and youth with special needs (CYSN) supports are encouraged to contact their local ministry office or speak with their CYSN worker to see how they can benefit from emergency help.These measures are part of government’s COVID-19 Action Plan to provide income supports, tax relief and direct funding for people, businesses and services.Learn More:For questions about CYSN programs or to apply for the Emergency Relief Support Fund, contact a local CYSN office:

This week, people will see crews starting on a project that will improve traffic flow at the busy intersection of Highway 95 at 9th Street South in Golden.Local residents may encounter some minor disruptions to traffic as the ministry prepares the site to install dedicated left-turn lanes and protected signal phases on the highway later this year.These improvements will help traffic flow more safely and efficiently at the intersection. The intersection upgrade will help accommodate future traffic growth.Other related work includes adjustments to the intersection at 6th Street North, which will receive a new traffic signal in time to help manage traffic during canyon closures expected in some off-peak periods due to Kicking Horse Canyon Project construction. The ministry will also realign the S-bend near Park Drive, which will improve the south approach to the Kicking Horse bridges.A design-build contract for the fourth and final phase of the Kicking Horse Canyon Project is expected to be awarded in late summer or early fall 2020, with initial construction to begin in the fall. It will bring the remaining 4.8 kilometres of narrow, winding two-lane highway up to a modern four-lane, 100 km/h standard.Provincial construction sites have protocols and policies in place following the requirements of the provincial health officer to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. These include reducing in-person meetings or gatherings, holding meetings outdoors and ensuring physical distancing of workers throughout the work day. These measures, along with other work protocols, such as daily cleaning and sanitizing of common areas and surfaces, will help ensure worker and public safety.Learn More:For more information on this project, including flyover footage and a virtual reality simulation, visit: www.kickinghorsecanyon.caFor job opportunities for the Kicking Horse Canyon four-laning project, go to: https://www.bcib.ca/

Our government acknowledges the inherent rights and title of Indigenous peoples and recognizes our responsibility to advance reconciliation through government-to-government relationships that respect those rights and title.“Together with Indigenous peoples, we have taken significant steps forward that are making a difference to people in communities – through revenue sharing, affordable housing, language revitalization and working in partnership to transform the child welfare system so families can stay together. On Nov. 28, 2019, we enacted historic legislation that makes sure Indigenous rights are respected. Since then, we have been working with Indigenous peoples, Nations and organizations on an action plan that will guide our work together to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.“As we celebrate National Indigenous Peoples Day and the resilience of Indigenous peoples, we must remember the 150 years and more of colonial injustices fuelled by hate and racism against Indigenous peoples. Many of these historical and horrific injustices still echo in Indigenous communities, our systems and institutions today. Last week's upsetting allegations of racist behaviours in our heath care system is a horrific example. This reignites our resolve to fight racism in all its forms. Indigenous peoples must feel safe and recognized in their territories, which we all call home.“These incidents reinforce our resolve as government to advance reconciliation with Indigenous peoples and build a province where every person can thrive, has access to opportunities and is treated with dignity and respect.“Today and every day, let’s work together to understand our shared history and build a better future for everyone.”For a French translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/6-21-20_Indigenous_Peoples_Day_FR.pdf

To further support B.C.’s mining, forestry and other industries impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government of British Columbia and BC Hydro are extending the opportunity for companies to defer electricity bill payments for another three months.“Thousands of people throughout our province rely on good, family-supporting jobs created by the mining sector, which continues to feel the impacts of lower demand for its products and depressed commodity prices due to COVID-19,” said Bruce Ralston, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources. “Our government continues to take action during these extraordinary times to help sustain industry, protect jobs and build a strong economic recovery.”As part of the BC Hydro COVID-19 Relief Program announced on April 1, 2020, eligible industrial customers with accounts in BC Hydro’s Transmission Service rate category (rate schedules 1823 and 1828) were given the opportunity to defer 50% of their electricity bill payments for the March to May 2020 billing period.To protect jobs in communities throughout B.C. and support a return to normal operations, BC Hydro will allow eligible industrial customers to continue to defer a portion of their bill payments for another three months, to the end of August 2020. The deferred amounts will be repaid over a future nine-month period and are subject to interest.“Extending the deferral of BC Hydro payments builds on other measures – such as the deferral of stumpage fees – we’ve taken to address the specific COVID-19 related challenges industry has raised in our discussions,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “Extending the deferral of BC Hydro payments may allow some companies to resume operations sooner rather than later when we get through the situation we’re in now, or it may keep others running without disruption.”Major industries with accounts in BC Hydro’s transmission rate category use large amounts of energy and represent about 25% of BC Hydro’s domestic electricity load in British Columbia. The deferral program helps to retain load and revenues that, if lost, would also have a significant negative impact for all BC Hydro ratepayers.The B.C. COVID-19 Action Plan dedicates $5 billion to support people, businesses and essential services. That includes $1.7 billion for investments in critical services, $1.8 billion in financial support for individuals and businesses, and $1.5 billion to plan for economic recovery.Quotes: Michael Goehring, president and CEO, Mining Association of British Columbia –“Mining supports more than 35,000 jobs in Metro Vancouver, Vancouver Island, the Interior, southeast and northern B.C. Extending the opportunity to defer electricity payments for another three months will help keep the mining sector operating and British Columbians working through a time of volatile commodity prices and economic uncertainty.”Susan Yurkovich, president and CEO, BC Council of Forest Industries – “Extending this deferral will provide some temporary relief to the significant financial challenges facing B.C.’s forest sector, impacting thousands of workers in communities across the province.”Chris O’Riley, president and CEO, BC Hydro –“We recognize the vital role the resource sector plays in the province’s economy and are pleased to be able to offer temporary relief to our large industrial customers during this challenging time.”Quick Facts: 
To date, 26 BC Hydro industrial customers have taken advantage of the new bill deferral opportunity – including mines, pulp mills, sawmills and pellet plants – deferring more than $25 million in electricity payments from March through May.
In the mining sector alone, the opportunity to defer a portion of electricity bill payments has helped to keep more than 1,600 workers on the job.

When COVID-19 arrived in British Columbia, Cheryl Macarthy and Dave Jorgenson, owners of the Frog on the Bog gift shop and several guest accommodation properties in the historic town of Wells, felt the impact to their tourism businesses immediately.With non-essential travel restrictions in place, the tourism industry throughout B.C. has struggled to navigate the many provincial and federal supports and how they apply to small, seasonal businesses.Macarthy and Jorgenson’s experience with the Cariboo Chilcotin Coast (CCC) Tourism Resiliency Program has been overwhelmingly positive. Jorgenson shared that they felt very isolated at the start of the pandemic. However, through this program and the access to one-on-one support with a CCC program advisor, they were able to stay informed on available government aid and access tool kits, research, training and COVID-19 reopening protocols. These resources were instrumental in their successful application for the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy.“The gift store has a strong, local reputation as a must-visit retail attraction, so we have some confidence that we will survive through our tremendous regional support,” Jorgenson said.With the store’s recent reopening, they are ramping up purchasing products from regional and local artists and artisans in order to support their community.Additional resources available through the BC Tourism Resiliency Network include access to program experts in finance, human resources, business strategy, marketing and a digital-information hub and webinars.For Horne Lake Caves Provincial Park director Richard Varela, learning how to adjust his business after a 75% drop in visitors and the cancellation of school field trips for more than 2,800 students was a significant shift.“Sorting through the flood of information, guidelines and protocols to determine what’s best for our business was a challenge,” Varela said. “It was extremely helpful to get other perspectives and have a sounding board for ideas from someone who understands our industry, right here on Vancouver Island. The Vancouver Island Coastal Tourism Resiliency Program was there when we needed support the most.”The BC Tourism Resiliency Network is available to support the 19,000 tourism-related businesses in the province and is delivered through B.C.’s regional destination management organizations. These organizations have extensive knowledge of the tourism sector and local challenges, and strong relationships with tourism operators. The network was supported through an additional $600,000 from the Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture.  Quick Facts:
To date, over 1,192 tourism businesses have registered in the BC Tourism Resiliency Network, with more registering each week.
The network is a provincewide expansion of the Vancouver Island Coastal Tourism Resiliency Program, funded in partnership with Island Coastal Economic Trust.
Western Economic Diversification Canada has provided $1 million for the BC Tourism Resiliency Network. Canada’s regional development agencies work closely with businesses and innovators in their regions to fuel economic growth.
In 2018, tourism generated $20.5 billion in revenues in B.C.
The tourism industry creates well-paying jobs for over 161,500 British Columbians.
B.C. is a top destination for visitors from around the world, welcoming 6.2 million international visitors in 2019.

First Nations wanting their ancestral remains and cultural objects returned will soon have access to financial support through the BC Museums Association.“The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is clear: Indigenous peoples have a right to the repatriation of cultural objects and remains of their ancestors,” said Lisa Beare, Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture. “We’re supporting this important work with First Nations because we know that returning ancestral remains and cultural belongings is essential for true and lasting reconciliation.”The B.C. government is providing $500,000 to the BC Museums Association to provide a range of grants to support communities at different stages of the repatriation process. First Nations communities and organizations will be eligible for grants to support repatriation planning, building capacity to take on repatriation projects and encouraging collaboration with cultural organizations.These grants follow the Province’s $2-million investment over three years to the Royal BC Museum for repatriation activities. The activities included a provincewide repatriation symposium, a granting program, digital repatriation programs, community work and the creation of Canada’s first repatriation handbook for Indigenous peoples by Indigenous peoples.Reconciliation with Indigenous peoples is a shared priority of government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Jodi Simkin, president, BC Museums Association (BCMA) –“First Nations throughout British Columbia are eager to have their ancestors and related cultural patrimony repatriated. This funding demonstrates a commitment to helping achieve this important and essential step in the reconciliation process and the BCMA is proud to support this work.”Dan Smith, chair, BCMA Indigenous Advisory Committee, and member, Wei Wai Kum First Nation in Campbell River –“This funding allows museums, archives and Indigenous peoples new opportunities to work together towards decolonization and realizing the goals set out by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. True, meaningful and lasting reconciliation must include the return of Indigenous culture back to Indigenous communities.”Jack Lohman, CEO, Royal BC Museum –“The Royal BC Museum's work in repatriation has built credibility with Indigenous communities by expanding our role.

Indigenous students at public post-secondary institutions throughout British Columbia will have more support to succeed in post-secondary education and finish their studies.“We’re investing in the future of Indigenous students throughout British Columbia,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “We are committed to ensuring Indigenous learners have greater access to post-secondary education and training, and cultural supports to succeed in their educational goals. I’m proud to be part of a government that is responding to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action by empowering Indigenous students with the tools they need to pursue their dream careers and make it to the finish line.”This support includes $6.15 million for initiatives and programs that respond to the Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and for annual Aboriginal Service Plans that support the goals of the Aboriginal Post-Secondary Education and Training Policy Framework and Action Plan.The funding will be used by the institutions to develop or enhance respectful and welcoming learning environments, along with partnerships and programs that improve the post-secondary educational experiences and outcomes of Indigenous learners. This includes programs and supports to make post-secondary more accessible and that address systemic barriers.“When Indigenous students have access to learning and cultural supports, a world of opportunity opens up that can make a significant impact on their future careers and lives,” said Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. “Students are our future. By improving Indigenous students’ experiences and outcomes in post-secondary school, we are advancing reconciliation and helping to build a brighter future for everyone.”Programs and activities supported by the funding include:
outreach activities and events that promote Indigenous cultures;
Indigenous cultural training for faculty and staff at post-secondary institutions;
enhanced programs and courses to include Indigenous culture and knowledge;
support services and initiatives for students, such as financial, academic or career counselling;
delivery of programs or courses on campus or in Indigenous communities; and
partnerships and engagement in Indigenous communities, such as through community liaison, peer mentorship or Elders-in-residence programs.
Examples of ongoing and past years’ programs and activities at institutions throughout B.C.:
Tsilhqot’in and St’at’imc science and language revitalization camps in partnership with Thompson Rivers University last summer enabled students to gain fluency in the Tsilhqot’in language and learn traditional science philosophies from Elders along with western science knowledge. 

Students working with the Community Living Lab Project at the University of Victoria (UVic) are helping to co-develop a long-term and impactful land and water restoration program to protect the environment and climate, to sustain communities, the economy and future generations. The project is led by community knowledge-keepers in the Lekwungen and W̱SANEĆ dialects/languages and supported by UVic graduate students.

An Indigenous artist-in-residence course at Langara College called Weaving for Reconciliation teaches Musqueam weaving as a fine arts program, while incorporating reconciliation into the discussion.

After purchasing hotels in their area, local Vancouver Island First Nations identified the need for members of their community to receive training in the tourism and hospitality sector. North Island College’s tourism bridging program has enabled students to complete short-term employment and training-based courses that can lead into entry-level employment. Students completing all program years receive a tourism and hospitality certificate and have the option to continue into the tourism and hospitality management diploma.

An undergraduate research mentorship program at the University of British Columbia pairs undergraduate students with faculty researchers throughout the university. Participation in this program has assisted Indigenous students to transition to paid undergraduate research work, employment opportunities after graduation and enrolment in graduate programs.
Reconciliation with Indigenous peoples is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:
The $6.15 million includes a one-time additional investment of $1.75 million by the Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training in programs and services for Indigenous students.
The funding responds to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada’s Calls to Action 57, 62 and 92, and Articles 14.2, 14.3 and 21.1 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
Approximately 23,240 Indigenous students are in the public post-secondary system in B.C. and they make up 8.3% of the domestic student population.
Indigenous learners in B.C. were awarded 3,637 credentials in 2018-19, an increase of 38%, or 1,003, over 2009-10.

Premier John Horgan has issued the following statement to mark World Refugee Day on Saturday, June 20, 2020:“To be a refugee is to flee violence, persecution and oppression. It takes courage and resilience to leave one’s home, loved ones and everything familiar to seek safety.“On World Refugee Day, we honour those who have faced great risk to find a better life. In British Columbia, we commit to building a province that not only provides sanctuary for asylum seekers and refugees, but empowers newcomers to create the life they dream of.

“Recent events around the world and at home remind us that we have more work to do to make B.C. a safe, inclusive place for everyone – free of racism, violence and hate. Racism is deeply rooted in our colonial history and institutions. Now is the time to hear the experiences of racialized people and commit to the hard work it will take to build a more equitable future where everyone is not only safe, but able to thrive.

“Our government has taken steps toward realizing this goal. We have re-established B.C.’s Human Rights Commission to protect and defend human rights. We have launched Resilience BC, a new anti-racism network that targets racism, discrimination and hate in communities around the province. And we are investing in programs to help newcomers settle with success.

“Since 2018, we have expanded settlement services by more than 60%, helping thousands more immigrants and refugees find good jobs and build better lives. To help remove barriers to employment, we are working to make it easier and fairer for professional credentials to be recognized in B.C., and we’ve made English language learning programs more accessible.

“Multiculturalism strengthens British Columbia’s communities. We are a province of people from all around the world. Let us recommit to our values of diversity and inclusion, and work to make sure our province is a safe, welcoming home for refugees and newcomers from all walks of life.”For a French translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/6-20-20_WorldRefugeeDay_FR.pdfFor a Chinese translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/6-20-20_WorldRefugeeDay_CN.pdfFor a Punjabi translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/6-20-20_WorldRefugeeDay_PJ.pdf

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, has issued the following statement regarding recent allegations of racism in the health-care system:“Last night, I was made aware of serious allegations of racist and completely abhorrent practices in an emergency room or emergency rooms in B.C. If confirmed, this conduct is beyond unacceptable. The allegation is that a game was being played to guess the blood-alcohol level of patients in emergency rooms, with Indigenous peoples and perhaps others.“If this is true, it’s intolerable, unacceptable and racist. Actions like this profoundly affect patient care. This requires, in my view, an immediate and swift response.  “I contacted Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond and asked her to lead the investigation of this issue. I think she has the credibility to do that and will do an excellent job. Foundational to our ongoing work of reconciliation are the voices of Indigenous leaders.“I consider these allegations to be very serious and we have to assess the facts, and that requires an investigation to take place. And I know we must also take action.“As an independent investigator, Ms. Turpel-Lafond will work to determine the facts of these specific allegations. We need to get to the root of these problems, and that begins with an understanding that racist attitudes and actions have a real and devastating impact on health outcomes, creating trauma that can affect generations. She will help determine the prevalence of these attitudes and actions at a systemic level in our health-care system.“Everyone who comes to our hospitals deserves and should be able to expect access to respectful and culturally safe care.“We are committed to continuing the work and engagement that brought these reports forward, and will be working together with Indigenous health and community leaders on next steps.”Learn More:Visit the San’yas San’yas Indigenous Cultural Safety Training developed in B.C. and used across Canada at: http://www.sanyas.ca/A backgrounder follows.

British Columbians living with concurrent brain injuries and mental health and substance use challenges, as well as their families, will soon be able to provide input about the type of care they want and need to help them on their pathway to healing and hope.Friday, June 19, 2020, is the National Day of Collaboration for Brain Injury Services and Supports, and the Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions is providing $35,000 in grant funding to the Constable Gerald Breese Centre for Traumatic Life Losses. The centre serves people and families in B.C. who have suffered a catastrophic loss through death, injury or other life-altering events.“It is a heartbreaking reality that some people are left with life-changing brain injuries after surviving an overdose, and many struggle to find the supports they need,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “That’s why, as B.C. continues to grapple with two public health emergencies, I’m really pleased that we can support the centre to expand its outstanding work to help people living with a traumatic brain injury and their families.”The centre will use the funding for its BC Heads Together Think Tanks project. As part of the project, an interactive website will be launched at the end of August and a series of virtual events will take place between October and November.The purpose of the project is to gather input from communities, health authorities, brain injury associations, family members and people living with brain injuries throughout the province. The centre will use the input to draft a plan and recommendations to improve brain injury rehabilitation and community supports for people living with brain injury and mental health and substance use challenges in B.C.“Having the opportunity to address the intersections of mental health, addictions and brain injury in a meaningful way is a major step forward in the brain injury community,” said Janelle Breese Biagioni, CEO and founder, Constable Gerald Breese Centre for Traumatic Life Losses. “The BC Heads Together Think Tanks project will provide an avenue for the collective voices of British Columbians to work collaboratively with our government on this important issue.”Increasing support for people living with brain injury is an integral part of A Pathway to Hope, B.C.’s roadmap for making mental health and addictions care better for people in British Columbia. Implementing A Pathway to Hope is a shared B.C. government priority with the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Learn More:Constable Gerald Breese Centre for Traumatic Life Losses: www.traumaticlifelosses.com

Indigenous students will have a home away from home and the university community will have a ceremonial space in which to celebrate Indigenous knowledge and culture when a new First Peoples’ Gathering House opens on Simon Fraser University’s (SFU)  Burnaby campus in 2023. The project, funded jointly by the provincial government ($6.4 million) and SFU ($8.6 million) for a total projected cost of $15 million, represents a step toward lasting reconciliation with Indigenous peoples in British Columbia and Canada.“Providing this kind of beautiful, culturally relevant space for Indigenous learners to come together, to celebrate, to practise cultural traditions, to learn and to make lasting friendships and connections is something I could have only dreamed of when I attended SFU,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “This is what reconciliation is all about. We are responding to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action by building safe spaces so that Indigenous students, faculty and staff know that they can achieve their goals and aspirations at SFU and in every public post-secondary institution across B.C.”When completed, the SFU First Peoples' Gathering House will be a 1,346 square-metre (14,485 square-foot) gathering house with a large ceremonial hall for hosting special events of up to 300 attendees. Other features of the new space will include a dressing room, an Elders’ room, a classroom, a wellness room and a multi-generational Indigenous peoples' lounge, as well as a food service kitchen.“The First Peoples’ Gathering House will provide a culturally appropriate space for Indigenous gatherings and for enabling the university community to gain a deeper appreciation of Indigenous knowledge and culture,” said Andrew Petter, president, SFU. “We are very thankful for the provincial government’s support of this important facility, which will assist the university to advance the process of reconciliation through education and engagement.”With the ceremonial hall as its focal point, the new gathering house will expand SFU’s capacity to support Indigenous students in a culturally relevant space designed in the Coast Salish traditions and iconic typologies. SFU’s Burnaby campus is on the traditional territories of the xʷmәθkʷәy̓әm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh Úxwumixw (Squamish), sәl̓ilw̓әtaʔɬ (Tsleil-Waututh) and kʷikʷәƛ̓әm (Kwikwetlem).“Building a First Peoples' Gathering Place was a discussion that began in the 1990s,” said Eldon Yellowhorn, SFU’s first Indigenous faculty member and a member of SFU’s Aboriginal Reconciliation Council, who helped champion this project. “Realizing it is like getting the wish that was always close yet just out of reach. Now that we have grasped hold of it we can pay attention to those other wishes that also seemed unreachable.”The project aligns with the Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training’s goal of lasting reconciliation with Indigenous peoples in British Columbia through post-secondary education skills and training. The project also aligns with SFU’s Aboriginal Strategic Plan to develop infrastructure and facilities to support Indigenous learners.Reconciliation with Indigenous peoples is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes: Ron Johnston, director, Office for Aboriginal Peoples at SFU, who helped champion the project –“I was a student at SFU in the mid-'90s, and we never really had a space that was the heart and soul of the Indigenous community. A longhouse is at the heart of every Indigenous community and now we will have that here at SFU. The way I view it is that the First Peoples' Gathering House will help to create a sacred learning space here.”Katrina Chen, MLA for Burnaby-Lougheed –“I’m so pleased that Indigenous students at the Burnaby Mountain campus will have a beautiful new space to celebrate their culture and connect with their community. As a former SFU student, I know the First Peoples' Gathering House will advance reconciliation and enrich the learning experiences of all staff and students on campus.”Quick Facts:
Funding from SFU is coming from several university sources, including faculties and SFU’s Aboriginal Strategic Initiative, which has provided $9 million in one-time funding for investment in projects and initiatives to support reconciliation at SFU campuses and ensure the university has the capacity to recruit, educate and support Indigenous students to be successful in their chosen educational paths, lives and future careers.
SFU’s 2017 Walk this Path with Us report details 34 Calls to Action to create, support and sustain a changed and improved environment for Indigenous students, staff and faculty. A First Peoples’ Gathering House responds to the call to create safe and culturally appropriate spaces.
Statistics Canada estimates that only 7% of Indigenous people in British Columbia aged 25 to 64 hold university degrees, compared to 25% of non-Indigenous people.
In the 2019-20 fiscal year, there were 781 Indigenous students (559 undergraduate and 222 graduate) at SFU.
SFU is committed to equalling or increasing its Indigenous enrolment.

No one should worry that when they visit a hospital that they will be prejudged and given a lower standard of care. If confirmed, this is a heartbreaking example of systemic racism in our province.“These serious allegations of unacceptable, dehumanizing behaviour will be thoroughly investigated by former justice Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond. Health Minister Adrian Dix will work with Indigenous leaders and leaders in Indigenous health. He has my full support to ensure that the details of this case will be revealed and that the voices of anyone who has experienced this racist practice will be heard.“This will not be swept aside. We will not look the other way when racism is exposed. We will get a full account and changes will be made.”

Construction crews will start work next week on a $1.2-million project to build nearly 25 kilometres of new fencing along the Coquihalla Highway, south of Merritt, that will help keep travellers and wildlife safe.“Our government is committed to a safe, reliable and efficient transportation system, as well as supporting wildlife in their natural ecosystems,” said Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “I am pleased to see this addition to our wildlife-exclusion system, reducing wildlife-related accidents to protect people and wildlife from harm.”On average, there are approximately 160 wildlife-related vehicle accidents each year on Highway 5, 75% of which are with deer. Wildlife-exclusion fencing is 1.2 metres (four feet) higher than livestock fencing, blocking larger animals, such as deer, moose and elk from provincial highways. The exclusion fencing works by redirecting the animals to existing wildlife underpasses, allowing for the safe movement of animal populations under the highway.The fencing will replace current livestock fencing along both sides of Highway 5, starting at Comstock Road and running 12 kilometres southbound until it connects with existing wildlife-exclusion fencing.“The City of Merritt is pleased the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure is creating new wildlife-exclusion fencing along Highway 5 south of Merritt,” said Linda A. Brown, mayor, City of Merritt. “This is an importation corridor not only for our community but for the entire province. I, along with my fellow council members, am proud to have this additional protection for both travellers and our native animal population in the Nicola Valley. This fencing will ensure the safe movement of animals. It comes at a key time with higher numbers of guests visiting our beautiful region each year.”The project adds to the nearly 180 kilometres of wildlife-exclusion fencing already in place along Highway 5.“Every year in B.C., wildlife-vehicle collisions cost society millions of dollars and can have major impacts on wildlife populations,” said Candace Batycki, program director (B.C. and Yukon), Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative. “Wildlife-exclusion fencing combined with road crossing infrastructure is a proven solution for people and wildlife, and we commend the ministry on expanding its exclusion-fencing system.”Highway 5 begins east of Hope and ends in northern B.C. at Highway 16 north of Valemount, and includes the Coquihalla Highway, between Hope and Kamloops. Highway 5 is an essential transportation corridor, linking the southern Interior and the North.While the fence installation is not expected to cause any travel delays, drivers are reminded that for the most up-to-date information, visit: www.DriveBC.caThe ministry is working closely with the contractor, Progressive Fence Installations of Langley, and WorkSafeBC to ensure health and safety are maintained for all workers on site.B.C.’s provincial health officer has directed construction employers to take all necessary precautions to minimize the risks of COVID-19 transmission and illness to themselves and their employees. Anyone exhibiting COVID-19 like symptoms, such as sore throat, fever, sneezing or coughing, will be directed to self-isolate at home for at least 10 days.Learn More:For imagery of wildlife-exclusion projects, including fencing, visit: https://www.flickr.com/photos/tranbc/albums/72157714643808403For travel restrictions and precautions due to COVID-19, visit: http://ow.ly/jBGu50yVMROFor the most up-to-date highway travel information, visit @DriveBC on Twitter or www.DriveBC.caA backgrounder follows.

Students at two Nanaimo schools will soon be safe in the event of an earthquake, with seismic upgrades coming to Cilaire and Pleasant Valley elementary schools.                    “Parents deserve the comfort of knowing their children will be protected at school if an earthquake were to impact Vancouver Island,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “That’s why we’re moving at record speed to upgrade schools in Nanaimo and throughout B.C, continuing our work to ensure every student can attend a seismically safe school.”The Government of B.C. is investing a total of $18.8 million for seismic upgrades at Cilaire and Pleasant Valley elementary schools, creating 500 seismically safe seats for Nanaimo students. This funding includes the cost of renovating Rutherford Elementary school and Woodlands Secondary school to be used as temporary accommodations to speed up seismic projects in the Nanaimo-Ladysmith School District.In addition, construction will soon be underway on a $15.9-million addition at Hammond Bay Elementary school that will add 295 seats to the district.“Our government is investing in people and upgrading schools so students are safe,” said Sheila Malcolmson, MLA for Nanaimo. “I’m thankful that soon, 500 more students will attend seismically safe schools in our community.”Construction is expected to be underway on the upgrades at both schools in June 2021 and for the schools to be seismically safe by September 2022.“The safety and well-being of our students and staff remains our top priority,” said Charlene McKay, chair, Nanaimo Ladysmith board of education. “The district’s capital project submission placed these two schools at the top of the list for seismic mitigation. Thank you to the Province of B.C. for acknowledging the need to upgrade the schools and ensuring peace of mind for the children, their families and the staff of the Cilaire and Pleasant Valley communities.”Both seismic projects include upgrades of the entire schools. To ensure students are disrupted as little as possible and to move the projects forward quickly, Pleasant Valley students will attend Rutherford, while Cilaire students will attend Woodlands school during construction. Transportation will be provided for students to and from their schools.These investments are an example of government’s work to accelerate the Seismic Mitigation Program and provide every B.C. student with a seismically safe space as soon as possible.Quotes:Karen Delves, Pleasant Valley elementary parent –""This announcement is great news for Pleasant Valley as the project has been discussed for a number of years. It is comforting to know that our children will be learning in buildings that should keep them safe in the event of an earthquake.""Carla Smith, Cilaire elementary parent –“Cilaire's parent advisory council is very excited about the approval of the seismic upgrades funding for our elementary school. It has been a project that has been discussed in our Cilaire community for many years and has been a safety concern for families attending the school. We want to thank both the provincial government and School District 68 for choosing this seismic upgrades project as a high priority for the safety of our children and teaching staff.”Quick Facts:
Since September 2017, the Province has approved over $1.9 billion for 94 major school capital investments, creating over 25,500 seismically safe seats and 12,390 new seats at new and expanded schools throughout B.C.
To continue this momentum, Budget 2020 includes a record $2.8 billion for new and expanded schools, seismic upgrades and land purchases for future schools that will improve learning environments for B.C. students.

In early April, the Province introduced COVID-19 border screening measures, unprecedented in Canada, to help ensure British Columbians returning home from international destinations had the support they need to manage self-isolation plans and keep B.C. communities safe.While these border measures were pioneered in British Columbia, other provinces, the federal government and all Canadians have benefited as similar measures have since been implemented nationwide.Following the current transition period with the federal government, B.C. will end provincially led border check points on Saturday, June 20, 2020. Federal screening measures currently in place will continue. Service BC will also continue compliance and wellness checks to ensure travellers can effectively maintain their 14-day self-isolation.“B.C. continues to be a North American leader in the fight against COVID-19, and much credit goes to the hundreds of B.C. public service employees who raised their hands to make sure those arriving home do so safely – both for themselves and for all of us working to keep COVID-19 at bay,” said Premier John Horgan. “The work to put these processes in place in such a short amount of time has been extraordinary, and this would not have been possible if it weren’t for the co-operation and collaboration of the federal government, the Vancouver Airport Authority and our network of public safety partners.”Following the implementation of screening measures in British Columbia, the federal government has been continually refining its own enhanced screening measures for those arriving from international destinations, including the United States, to a British Columbian port of entry. Anyone arriving in Canada must now document their self-isolation plans, for example through the ArriveCan app. The federal government will continue to ensure those arriving in B.C. with or without symptoms are self-isolating for 14 days, per the federal Quarantine Act.“The evolution of federally led border measures has allowed the B.C. public service to step back from border screenings and redeploy our resources to best limit the spread of COVID-19 in British Columbia,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “The hundreds of public servants who deployed to YVR and the land borders – and indeed all British Columbians – should be proud of what we’ve achieved together.”From April 10 to June 15, 2020, the Province processed more than 72,400 passengers arriving at the Vancouver Airport or at 17 land border crossings into B.C. More than 26,100 successful follow-up calls have been completed to check in on progress with those self-isolating.Since provincial screening began, the Province has housed a total of 142 people for a two-week quarantine period, or until their self-isolation plan was deemed adequate.“B.C.’s leadership with this initiative proved to be a key measure in the fight to keep British Columbians safe, and our government couldn’t be prouder of the hard work and dedication of provincial staff,” said Ravi Kahlon, MLA for Delta North. “Over the past months, I’ve had the honour of working with public servants from across government as they’ve stepped up to provide information, help people quarantine and make sure everyone follows the directions of the provincial health officer. British Columbia owes them a debt of gratitude for this accomplishment.”Provincial screening measures will continue for temporary foreign workers arriving in B.C. for seasonal farm work. These workers are required to self-isolate in government-funded accommodations near the airport for 14 days prior to being transported to farms throughout B.C. During their self-isolation period, the Province conducts screening for symptoms, and Service BC conducts check-in calls with each worker during their stay.All temporary foreign workers are screened by health professionals prior to leaving self-isolation to go to worksites. Once on the farms, workers continue to self-monitor and are monitored for symptoms by their employer.Learn More:For information on B.C.’s Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/RestartBC   For information on non-medical issues like travel recommendations and how to manage social isolation, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID-19For information on federal and provincial government supports available to individuals, families, businesses and organizations, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covidgovernmentbenefitsFor recommendations on protecting yourself and your community, including for employers, businesses and schools, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/coronavirus-(novel)For more information and latest medical updates on COVID-19, follow the BCCDC on Twitter @CDCofBC or visit its website: http://www.bccdc.ca/

The Government of British Columbia is extending the temporary rental supplement (TRS) until the end of August 2020 to continue to support renters and landlords.It will also maintain the moratorium on rent increases and evictions for non-payment of rent, while enabling other notices to end tenancy to resume.“COVID-19 has touched all aspects of our lives and our economy. While we are seeing good success at limiting the spread of COVID-19 thanks to everyone’s joint efforts, it has been a difficult time for many,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “Recognizing the financial challenges faced by many people, our government is extending the TRS and maintaining the rent freeze and the ban on evictions for non-payment of rent. We’re continuing to protect renters as we also ensure landlords are receiving some income during this time.”People who have already been approved for the TRS do not need to reapply. They will receive an email asking them to confirm they plan to live at the same address through July and August. New applications will also be accepted until Aug. 31 and will be eligible for a supplement for the month they are received and all subsequent months.The moratorium on evictions has been in effect since March 30 and will continue for non-payment of rent. As the province moves forward with BC’s Restart Plan, the ban on evictions for reasons other than unpaid rent will be lifted later this month.“As we move forward with carefully restarting the economy and look to a new normal, we are taking a similarly phased approach to rental housing,” Robinson said. “We’re recognizing that there are situations where it is safe and reasonable to return to normal processes, but we’re also continuing to protect people who have lost income because of the pandemic from losing their homes.”When these changes come into effect, landlords will be able to serve new notices for reasons including landlord/purchaser use, such as where a new owner has purchased a property and intends to move in, and for cause (e.g., where a tenant is putting the landlord or other tenants at risk, or has sublet the apartment without permission). Depending on the type, these will require a notice period of between one and four months.The Province is committed to giving people advance notice before lifting the moratorium on evictions for non-payment of rent at a future date. It will put in place a framework that will require landlords to work with tenants to repay rent that is owing over a reasonable period of time. Government has been clear that tenants who have not experienced financial difficulties are expected to continue to pay rent. Tenants will also be responsible for outstanding rent when the ban on evictions for non-payment is lifted.When the new order comes in later this month, landlords will also be allowed to access units for activities such as repairs, maintenance and showing of the unit, following the standard notice period. Landlords and tenants are expected to maintain physical distancing at all times and wear appropriate personal protective equipment, including masks. Landlords will continue to be able to set restrictions on shared spaces to ensure physical distancing, such as limiting the number of people in elevators and laundry rooms, and in places where adequate cleaning cannot be maintained, such as gyms.The rental supplement is in addition to funding available from the federal government and the $1,000 B.C. Emergency Benefit for Workers. It is part of the Province’s $5-billion COVID-19 Action Plan to provide income supports, tax relief and direct funding for people and businesses, and to support the services people count on.Quick Facts:
Between April 9, when the TRS program began, and June 15, BC Housing received more than 90,000 applications. The total confirmed eligible applications were nearly 82,500. The program will now continue through July and August.
The TRS program provides $500 per month for eligible households with dependents and $300 per month for eligible households with no dependents. Eligible roommates are also able to apply for the supplement.
When the new order comes in later this month, eviction notices served before the moratorium was enacted will come into effect and orders that were filed with the courts will be enforceable.
Landlords wishing to have an existing notice of eviction enforced will be able to apply to begin that process July 1.

People travelling along Highway 16 between Vanderhoof and Burns Lake will soon have a new rest area, adding to the more than 170 rest areas strategically located throughout B.C.The Savory Rest Area, located approximately 45 kilometres east of Burns Lake, will officially open next week. It offers travellers a safe and convenient place to take a break.“Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the province’s transportation network has been critical to keeping supply chains open, and our commercial vehicle operators have been doing a great job delivering supplies,” said Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “We want to do everything we can to make the drive along our networks safe, reliable and comfortable for drivers. This new rest area will provide a convenient and safe place for them to pull over to take a break from the road.”This new rest area serves people travelling westbound, while the existing Tintagel Rest Area, 15 kilometres east of Burns Lake, serves those travelling eastbound. Both rest areas are open year-round and have washroom and picnic facilities, as well as parking for commercial and non-commercial vehicles.“As we move forward into recovery from COVID-19, people will be eager to get back on our roads, visit friends and family, and enjoy the beauty of British Columbia,” said Lisa Beare, Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture. “We continued to safely build and maintain our highways and related infrastructure during the pandemic, and now we’re looking forward to British Columbians travelling comfortably on safe roadways to those communities wishing to welcome non-essential travel again.”The $2.3-million project began construction in August 2019. It included the construction of the new rest area, widening of approximately 420 metres of Highway 16 to accommodate a deceleration lane and creation of a left-hand turn into the rest area.“Rest stops play a key role in providing motorists with a place to pull over, to use the facilities, rest tired eyes or have a picnic while enjoying the beauty of the area,” said Dolores Funk, mayor, Village of Burns Lake. “We welcome the addition of the Savory Rest Area to the Highway 16 network, and we would like to thank the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure for its continued investment in and around Burns Lake.”An interactive map featuring all provincial rest area locations, along with web cams and current road and weather conditions, can be found at: www.DriveBC.caLearn More:For active highway and infrastructure projects in northern B.C., visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/17700For travel restrictions and precautions due to COVID-19, visit: http://ow.ly/jBGu50yVMROFor the most up-to-date highway travel information, visit @DriveBC on Twitter or: www.DriveBC.ca

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are announcing eight new COVID-19 confirmed positive cases, for a total of 2,783 cases in British Columbia.“There are 190 active cases of COVID-19 in the province and 2,425 people who tested positive have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 10 individuals are hospitalized, five of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 950 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,441 in the Fraser Health region, 130 in the Island Health region, 197 in the Interior Health region and 65 in the Northern Health region.“There have been no new COVID-19 related deaths, for a total of 168 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks. In total, six long-term care or assisted-living facilities and one acute-care facility have active outbreaks.“There have been no new community outbreaks and the outbreak at Nature’s Touch Frozen Fruits has been declared over. Public health teams continue to provide support for the three remaining community locations.“Of the new cases announced today, one adult has been linked to a small, independent school in the Fraser Health region. Public health teams are actively investigating, close contacts have been notified and as a precautionary measure, the school has ceased in-class learning for the balance of the year.“As the new health-care outbreaks demonstrate, COVID-19 can quickly spread, often undetected, resulting in multiple cases in multiple locations.“While public health teams are working hard to contain further spread, this is a challenge that we will continue to face for the foreseeable future until we are able to fully stop COVID-19 in our province.“What we can do to reduce the risk for everyone is to maintain our vigilance to even mild illness and always, without question, stay home from work or school and stay away from others if you are feeling ill.“Our seniors and Elders are most vulnerable to serious illness from COVID-19, which is why a number of precautions are in place for long-term care facilities. However, we understand that these restrictions, in particular the limit on visitors, comes at a high cost for residents and their loved ones.“Every person who enters a facility increases the likelihood for virus to enter with them, regardless of the safety precautions that are taken. This is the challenge we face.“Our approach is to move forward slowly, with caution. Our hope is that, like many parts of our economy and our province, we will be able to modify our approach and ease restrictions once the risk to our Elders and seniors has reduced and it is safe to do so.“Whether at work, out shopping or visiting a friend, using all of the layers of protection is the best approach. Maintaining a safe physical distance, using barriers, having clear policies for employees and finally, as a last layer, using a cloth face covering.“Our strength and our safety lie in adopting multiple layers to keep COVID-19 low and slow.

The Province is partnering with the Municipality of North Cowichan and the City of Duncan to build close to 100 new supportive homes for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness in the Cowichan Valley.“The need for safe, secure housing has never been more important”, said Doug Routley, MLA for Nanaimo-North Cowichan. “We’re taking urgent action with our partners to provide these homes for people in the Cowichan Valley because when people have housing and supports, it’s good for everyone in the community.”BC Housing has purchased two sites, 2983 Drinkwater Rd. in North Cowichan and 260 White Rd. in Duncan, to develop safe, secure housing with wraparound supports. Construction of the two new buildings is expected to begin in fall 2020.""Permanent housing for all citizens is essential for healthy individuals, healthy communities and healthy societies,” said Sonia Furstenau, MLA for Cowichan Valley. “This investment in Cowichan comes as a result of the government responding to the united calls from local housing advocates, health-care providers and leaders in our community.“We have seen successful outcomes for homeless people from the temporary housing plan with wraparound services the Cowichan Housing Association and other organizations put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It works because all the pieces are working together: housing, security, food, mental health support. Permanent housing for people in Cowichan will build on these first steps toward dignity and independence for all citizens.”The Drinkwater Road project will include approximately 50 units and will be operated by Lookout Housing & Health Society. The White Road location will include up to 50 homes. A housing operator for this building will be selected in the coming months. Construction on both projects is expected to be complete in early 2021.“I am pleased to see these projects move forward in our respective communities. I have been a long-time proponent of permanent housing solutions with much-needed wraparound services,” said Al Siebring, mayor, North Cowichan. “These units will help address homelessness both in North Cowichan and in the Cowichan Valley while giving our most vulnerable populations access to vital services.”The housing will be comprised of self-contained studio homes. Residents will be provided with 24/7 on-site staff and support services, including meal programs, life and employment skills training, health and wellness support services and opportunities for volunteer work.“Duncan city council has identified working to address the homelessness and opioid crisis as top priorities for this term,” said Michelle Staples, mayor, City of Duncan. “Service providers and health-care professionals have been asking for supportive housing with wraparound services, including treatment options and safe supply, for many years. These projects are yet another example of what becomes possible when we define a goal, commit to action and work together as local and provincial governments to meet the needs in our communities.”BC Housing will set up community advisory committees in both municipalities to oversee integration of the supportive housing within the community and address any concerns raised by people in both communities as the projects move forward. The committees will be established prior to the housing opening.“I'm pleased to be working with our neighboring communities to address the homelessness or those at risk of becoming homeless,” said Chief William Seymour, Cowichan Tribes. “This gives them an opportunity to have a safe and secure home, especially during this pandemic era.  This is a much-needed resource in the Cowichan community.”Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:
The B.C. government purchased the Drinkwater Road site in North Cowichan for $976,185 and the White Road site in Duncan for $663,730 through the Supportive Housing Fund.
The site acquisitions and expedited development plans are part of the Province’s work to transition people from homelessness to long-term, stable housing and a commitment to continue to support people with appropriate housing options after the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Lax Kw’alaams Band and the Province have partnered to open eight new affordable rental homes for Indigenous Elders in the Village of Lax Kw’alaams.“The project allows our Elders an affordable option to remain in the community thereby staying close to their families, their community and their lifestyle,” said Gary Reece, mayor, Village of Lax Kw’alaams. “The partnership between the Province and Lax Kw’alaams is an example of how public monies can be used for the benefit of all British Columbians.”Located at 2101 Nelson St., the single-storey complex includes two two-bedroom and six one-bedroom units for Elders in the community. Each home has living, dining, laundry and kitchen areas. The building is wheelchair accessible and has a diesel generator to address frequent power outages. Monthly rents range from $375 (one bedroom) to $570 (two bedrooms) per month. “Everyone should have a safe, secure and affordable place to call home in their community,” said Jennifer Rice, MLA for North Coast. “It’s wonderful to see these Elders moving into their new homes, and I’d like to thank everyone who helped make the housing a reality.”The Lax Kw’alaams Band owns and operates the homes, which are on Band land.Residents started moving into the eight-unit building on June 1, 2020.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.The Province provided approximately $2.5 million for the project.Learn More:A map showing the location of all announced provincially funded housing projects in B.C. is available online: https://www.bchousing.org/homes-for-BCTo learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/A backgrounder follows.

Government is continuing to support cannabis workers and provide greater flexibility in the legal non-medical cannabis industry.The requirement that cannabis retail stores be enclosed by non-transparent walls has been removed, and a new mandatory online responsible-service training program, Selling it Right, has been introduced.“These changes underline our government’s efforts to be flexible in the rules governing the legal cannabis industry as we gather more experience in a regulated market,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “These changes will help employees feel safer while at work and ensure cannabis workers will be thoroughly trained to be safe, smart and socially responsible in their jobs.”In response to licensee and local government feedback, the Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch (LCRB) is amending regulations to remove the requirement that stores be enclosed by non-transparent walls. Instead, the branch will require that non-medical cannabis products, packages and labelling cannot be seen from outside the store.This will allow licensees to configure their stores in ways that protect minors from exposure to cannabis products and address concerns regarding employee safety, while also meeting the requirements in the federal Cannabis Act.In addition, the LCRB will require non-medical cannabis retail licensees, marketing licensees and workers who sell or supervise the sale of non-medical cannabis in either private cannabis retail or government cannabis stores, to complete the new Selling It Right mandatory training program. The program is designed to educate employers and employees on the effects of cannabis, how to recognize signs of intoxication, how to handle situations requiring intervention and how to understand their full responsibilities under the law. It was modelled after Serving it Right, the Province’s responsible liquor sales and service program.The course can be completed online for a fee of $35 plus GST, and certification is valid for two years after completion. Existing licensees and staff will have until Sept. 30, 2020, to complete the training before the regulation comes into force. New cannabis retail store licensees, marketing licence applicants, retail and government cannabis store sales staff and supervisors must earn certification prior to operating a store, working in a store or being issued a marketing licence.“Our government is committed to supporting the development of a robust, diverse and sustainable cannabis industry in B.C. that prioritizes health and safety of both workers and the public,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “From the start, we’ve expected the regulatory approach to evolve as the cannabis sector emerged and these changes are examples of that evolution.”Learn More:View the LCRB policy directive here:

Peace Arch Provincial Park will be temporarily closed, effective Thursday, June 18, 2020, at 8 p.m. (Pacific time)This closure addresses the public safety and traffic concerns in neighbouring communities due to a significant increase in the number of park visitors.On April 8, 2020, BC Parks closed all provincial parks in response to widespread calls for increased action to address the spread of COVID-19. The park reopened on May 14.Since then, parking lots and local access roads have been overwhelmed with nearly twice the number of vehicles compared to peak days in the summer season, resulting in illegal parking. Attendance has doubled over the same period compared to last year, leading to an increase in pedestrians along roadways. BC Parks has consulted with RCMP, border officials and numerous local communities. Several measures have been taken to manage the growth in the numbers of visitors, e.g., posting signage, increasing enforcement patrols, installing a permanent gate at the park entrance and reducing park hours from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. The measures have not addressed the risk associated with the significant increases in visitors from both sides of the border.BC Parks understands the importance of unification for families and friends. Through exemptions to the Federal Quarantine Act, the federal government is now allowing immediate family members of Canadian citizens and permanent residents to enter Canada to be with an immediate family member for a period of at least 15 days, as long as they are asymptomatic of COVID-19 and self-isolate for 14 days on arrival.The park will reopen when it is deemed safe to do so.Learn More: For more information, visit: http://bcparks.ca/explore/parkpgs/peace_arch/

Kirby Villeneuve envisioned a family-friendly mountain bike trail network the moment he looked at a forested section of land in Englishman River Falls Provincial Park.The north-facing terrain, along with compactable mineral soil conditions, made the area an ideal candidate for sustainable trail construction.Six years later, that vision has been brought to life. The park, located along the Englishman River north of Nanaimo, now has a 2.3-kilometre multi-use trail network that will be maintained through a 10-year partnership agreement with the Arrowsmith Cycling Club (ACC). Designed for all abilities, the trails are adjacent to a larger network of existing trails outside of the park known as Hammerfest, creating a variety of opportunities for mountain biking enthusiasts to enjoy.“It’s exciting to see the project finished. People staying at the campground can bridge their ability utilizing the park as a safe trail environment and, if they wish, advance into the area outside of the park,” said Villeneuve, recreation section head for BC Parks. “It’s part of a larger strategy for parks as we look at where we can put more bike-friendly facilities.”To develop multi-use trails, BC Parks goes through a full impact assessment process. It looks for the presence of recreation conflicts or sensitive ecological or cultural values that may be nearby before any public engagement takes place. Mapped and plotted using a GPS, the trails are designed to avoid damaging large trees and root structures, and are carefully laid out with pin flags before the top layer of organics is removed by hand or machine.Construction on the $100,000 trail network in Englishman River Falls Park began three years ago and was completed in three phases. About 10 people (contractors and suppliers) worked on the project, along with more than two dozen volunteers from the ACC. Roy Kregosky, vice-president of the ACC, watched the trail come to life on a weekly basis. “I think the new trail is a good thing for the park and it’s a good thing for the bike club as well, because it provides a safe introduction to mountain biking for beginners,” Kregosky said, who typically gets out for a ride at least three times a week. “It’s so nice being in the forest, in a natural environment with fresh air. I really enjoy it.”As mountain biking becomes more popular, so is the demand for construction of pump tracks in or around BC Parks. The figure-eight pump tracks are built like a mini BMX track for kids, complete with dips, bumps and banked turns. So far, nine pump tracks have been built within provincial parks and about 50 parks allow bikes on portions of trails.Learn More:For more information about biking in and around BC Parks, visit: http://bcparks.ca/recreation/biking/For more information about the Arrowsmith Cycling Club, visit: https://arrowsmithcyclingclub.com/To learn more about Englishman River Falls Provincial Park, visit: http://bcparks.ca/explore/parkpgs/englishman_rv/

The provincial government is providing nearly $14 million in grants for over 150 projects to support economic development and recreational opportunities for British Columbians in rural communities throughout the province.“As someone who lives in a rural community, I know that rural B.C. is the backbone of our economy,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted every region of our province, and I’m glad our government is providing these one-time grants to lend extra help to people, communities and economies in rural B.C.”    The grants include approximately $5 million for 39 trail and recreation projects, and almost $9 million for 114 projects that support rural community development. Projects selected for these one-time grants were chosen from the following three categories:
First Nations;
municipalities; and
not-for-profit organizations.
The District of Tumbler Ridge is among the recipients that received a grant for trail and recreation projects. The district will use $500,000 to build a series of world-class mountain biking trails, ranging from beginner-level trails to provide skill-building potential and fun for all ages, to more-challenging cross-country and downhill trails.“This boost from the Province to enhance new economic development opportunities for rural and remote communities is very much welcomed by the District of Tumbler Ridge,” said Keith Bertrand, mayor, District of Tumbler Ridge. “Here in the Tumbler Ridge Unesco Global Geopark, we have the natural terrain to create some world-class mountain biking, which will definitely complement all of the splendour we have to offer here. Our Tumbler Ridge mountain bike association has done a tremendous job to bring this dream to reality.”Among the recipients of grants to support rural community development is the Williams Lake Indian Band (WLIB) that received $500,000 to build a cannabis production facility. The 557-square-metre (6,000-square-foot) facility will have 200 square metres (2,150 square feet) of growing space.“We’re extremely grateful for the generous support of the Province of British Columbia,” said Williams Lake Indian Band Chief Willie Sellars. “The last five years have been very challenging for the Cariboo – with the Mount Polley disaster, the wildfires of 2017 and now the COVID-19 crisis. The WLIB cannabis cultivation project will help to kick-start our economy, create new jobs and stimulate tourism. This project represents a huge opportunity for the Williams Lake Indian Band and the Cariboo-Chilcotin.”The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has created unforseen economic challenges in many rural communities throughout the province. The grants for these projects are in addition to the more than $5 billion in income supports, tax relief and other funding for people, businesses and services the Province has already announced in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.“Our government has been listening to rural B.C., and we’ve got your back,” said Ravi Kahlon, Parliamentary Secretary of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “We know the pandemic has caused challenges for people living in smaller communities, and we are hopeful that funding these projects will help rural B.C. come back strong.”  Grant recipients were identified from applications received during the sixth intake of the Rural Dividend Program in summer 2019. Priority was given to economic development projects that have a focus on and a potential for job creation.Learn More:For a backgrounder listing the rural community development grants by recipient, visit:

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are announcing 19 new COVID-19 confirmed positive cases, for a total of 2,775 cases in British Columbia.“There are 185 active cases of COVID-19 in the province and 2,422 people who tested positive have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 11 individuals are hospitalized, five of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 946 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,438 in the Fraser Health region, 130 in the Island Health region, 196 in the Interior Health region and 65 in the Northern Health region.“There have been no new COVID-19 related deaths, for a total of 168 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There have been no new community outbreaks and the outbreak at the Oppenheimer Group produce distributor has now been declared over. Public health teams continue to provide support for the four ongoing community locations.“There have been two new health-care facility outbreaks, at the Mission Memorial Hospital and Tabor Home in Abbotsford. The outbreak at Tabor Home and at the Maple Hill long-term care facility announced yesterday are connected to the outbreak at Mission Memorial Hospital.“These recent health-care outbreaks are very concerning and clearly demonstrate that COVID-19 remains in our communities.“Mission Memorial is a small hospital, which means services for the local community are now limited to urgent and emergency care only.“Public health teams are working hard to contain further spread. While we are monitoring the situation closely, we are hopeful that we have caught these outbreaks in the early stages.“We know that COVID-19 spreads quickly and can be transmitted to others even when someone has mild symptoms and may not recognize they are ill. One undetected case can quickly result in a surge in new cases.“As we expect increased travel within our province over the summer months, this is a reminder that the impact on small communities with limited health-care resources can be severe.“As a result, we ask British Columbians to continue to take all measures to ensure you are safely increasing your social interactions, you are being respectful of communities you may be visiting when on the road and that you are always, without question, staying home and staying away from others if you are even mildly ill.“Closed spaces, close contact and crowds are higher risk, so anything that involves these things needs to be done with caution. This includes taking precautions to protect yourself and those around you by maintaining a safe physical distance and using a cloth face covering or non-medical mask, for those times when a safe distance cannot always be maintained.“Right across our province, everyone has worked hard to flatten our curve and now we must keep COVID-19 low and slow.

British Columbians are invited to share their feedback as the Province continues to build a strong economic recovery that works for people.“The pandemic has been challenging, but our province has already accomplished so much in this fight, thanks to British Columbians. We are at our best when we work together, and that’s how we’re going to move forward,” Premier John Horgan said.“Throughout the pandemic we’ve been meeting with businesses, labour, First Nations, not-for-profits and more to get their perspective. We’ve heard lots of good ideas, and we are taking action. We want to hear directly from British Columbians to make sure the recovery works for them.”There are three main ways for people to share their ideas, experiences and priorities:
An online survey is the fastest and easiest way to provide answers to some important questions and give advice. Visit: http://gov.bc.ca/recoveryideas
Respond to the paper, Building B.C.’s Recovery, Together: Have Your Say, which was released on Wednesday, June 17, 2020. Ideas and responses can be submitted to: recoveryideas@gov.bc.ca
Participate in virtual town halls. British Columbians can learn more about the virtual town halls here: http://gov.bc.ca/recoveryideas
Building B.C.’s Recovery, Together describes the values the government considers foundational for economic policy-making in the months ahead. It also details the economic effects that COVID-19 has had on B.C., in particular the job losses, and how those losses have been felt across different communities. Nearly half of all jobs lost due to COVID-19 have been in accommodations, food services and retail. Women, young adults and low-wage workers have all experienced relatively greater job losses.“The recovery is going to be a tough task, and we need to be open to new ideas and new approaches. At the same time, core B.C. values like equity, taking care of each other, sustainability and reconciliation have not changed,” said Carole James, Minister of Finance. “In practice, those values will take the form of more good-paying jobs, advancing reconciliation and meeting climate goals, and growing an innovative, resilient economy that works for people.”When the pandemic hit, government acted immediately, focusing on three main priorities: protecting people’s health; providing income, rental and other supports for families and businesses; and ensuring things like groceries, public transit and child care for essential workers remained available.Essential businesses remained open safely during the pandemic, and starting last month the province began a process of restarting safely.Learn More:Learn more about B.C.’s economic recovery planning: http://gov.bc.ca/recoveryideasFor information about B.C.’s Restart Plan, visit: http://gov.bc.ca/restartbcFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://bccdc.ca/

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are announcing 10 new COVID-19 confirmed positive cases and one new epi-linked case, for a total of 2,756 cases in British Columbia.“There are 172 active cases of COVID-19 in the province and 2,416 people who tested positive have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 11 individuals are hospitalized, five of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 940 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,425 in the Fraser Health region, 130 in the Island Health region, 196 in the Interior Health region and 65 in the Northern Health region.“There have been no new COVID-19 related deaths, for a total of 168 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There has been a new health-care facility outbreak at the Maple Hill long-term care facility at Langley Memorial Hospital in the Fraser Health region. In total, five long-term care or assisted-living facilities continue to have active outbreaks.“There have been no new community outbreaks. Public health teams continue to provide support for the five ongoing community outbreaks.“As we continue to gradually ease restrictions, our objective is to keep COVID-19 low and slow. To do this, we are being thoughtful and measured in our response, opening what is safe to open and keeping closed what is risky.“We know that closed spaces, close contact and crowds are higher risk, so anything that involves these things will continue to have restrictions.“Grocery stores, pharmacies and other essential businesses remained open with precautions. Once we flattened our curve, restaurants, retail stores, schools and many other businesses got back underway.“Looking ahead, as we continue to slowly progress, other business sectors, like spas and resorts, as well as recreational sports, will also be able to safely restart. But the same precautions businesses have taken to protect employees, customers and themselves today will still apply.“What also stays the same are the personal measures we are all following to keep ourselves safe and protect those we care for most. These are our foundations and our path forward.“We know that a family gathering in someone’s home, a nightclub or even a choir practice puts people close together inside for an extended period of time, which significantly increases the risk of transmission.“It is far easier to maintain a safe physical distance from four people than 40. It is also much faster for public health teams to complete contact tracing when there are only a few people to alert to potential exposure.“Our most effective way to manage COVID-19 in our communities is to work together, to take care of each other and do our part. This is not forever, but it is certainly for now and until we have the means to fully stop COVID-19.”Learn More:For more information about BC’s Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/restartbcFor B.C.’s surgical renewal plan, visit:

June is Pride month, an event steeped in history that carries with it joy, pain, anger and profound importance for so many people in B.C. each year.This year, Pride month began with the killing of George Floyd, which initiated an international outcry for police reforms and the need to tackle systemic racism. The widespread protests sparked from this injustice are a critical reminder of the ongoing struggle for equality and how Pride month came about from a history rooted in protests led by Black and Hispanic LGBTQ2S+ activists.Pride is a celebration of love. And for many, Pride is also a protest for equality and a time to honour trans activists of colour – such as Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera – who led the Stonewall protests, fighting to modernize LGBTQ2S+ rights, pushing justice, equality and love for all to the forefront.For me, Pride is also a recognition of the challenges many people continue to confront simply because of who they are. Even as we acknowledge the progress LGBTQ2S+ people have fought for, I appreciate how far we still have to go to make sure that everyone has the right to be who they are without fear and stigma, regardless of the colour of their skin, gender identity or sexual orientation.For starters, we need to recognize that LGBTQ2S+ people continue to face discrimination, violence and harassment disproportionately, which puts them at risk for much higher rates of poverty, mental health issues and other complex challenges. For people of colour and Indigenous peoples, there are even more systemic prejudice and barriers to overcome.During this pandemic, we've seen the best in people, with many going above and beyond to support and care for others. Sadly, we've also seen very troubling actions driven by fear and ignorance. More than ever, we must join together and denounce acts of intimidation and violence fuelled by prejudice. Here in B.C., our government is taking action with the reinstatement of the Human Rights Commission and the creation of the Resilience BC anti-racism network to support inclusion and diversity, be it race, gender or sexuality.Additionally, this pandemic has meant that thousands of people who would usually gather need to find new ways of coming together. Even though the pandemic means we must reimagine the way we connect, I hope we can continue to share what Pride means – be it a celebration or a protest – for our friends, family members, neighbours and communities.Pride month – and in fact, every month – is a time for all of us to keep pushing for equality and surround those in our lives who identify as non-binary or as a member of any minority with all our support, compassion and protection.As a government, we have acted and made important strides, even as we know there is still a long way to go. In B.C., we have ensured all 60 school districts, several First Nations and independent schools are part of the B.C. Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Educator Network to help schools be more inclusive for students starting from their very first day in kindergarten. We have provided a third option in the gender field of government-issued identification for those who do not identify as male or female. We have also moved to ensure publicly funded, gender-affirming surgeries are available in B.C., so people don’t have to travel away from home to receive the care they need.We recognize that the COVID-19 pandemic has meant distress for many people who may have faced delays in their treatment plans or who have been distanced from friends, family and support networks.We also know that this pandemic will not last forever. I encourage people to see this year’s Pride as an opportunity to connect with and support one another however you feel safest.Reimagine what you can do to honour and celebrate Pride and diversity in your community. And in doing so, know that you have our unwavering support and commitment to continue the fight to advance the rights and freedoms for people of all sexual orientations, ethnic origins and gender identities so B.C. can be a place where people are truly free to be who they are.

Premier John Horgan has appointed Ravi Kahlon, Parliamentary Secretary for Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development, to lead the expansion and use of mass timber in B.C. buildings.Premier Horgan made the announcement in a call with representatives of the BC Council of Forest Industries (COFI).“As our economy bounces back from the COVID-19 crisis, we want to do everything we can to support forest workers,” said Premier Horgan. “By focusing on mass timber, we have an opportunity to transition the forestry sector to high-value over high-volume production. This will mean opportunities for local workers, strong partnerships with First Nations and greater economic opportunity while making a significant contribution to advancing CleanBC.”Last year, government announced its intention to encourage the increased use of mass timber building products in its capital construction programs, particularly in the development of the new St. Paul’s Hospital and the replacement of the Royal BC Museum.  “These are high-value wood products that are shining examples of our government’s commitment to create jobs using our publicly owned natural resources,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “I’m confident that Ravi will hit the ground running and find even more opportunities to use this world-renowned product.”In mass timber buildings, the primary load-bearing structure is made of solid or engineered wood. These buildings can be one-fifth the weight of comparable concrete buildings, while still meeting performance standards for safety, structural resilience and fire protection.“British Columbia is a leader in the use of mass timber as an innovative way to reduce the carbon footprint of our building sector while supporting good jobs for people in communities across the province,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “Ravi Kahlon is thoughtful and hard-working, and the right choice to grow new opportunities in this sector that will help us meet our CleanBC goals to build a cleaner, better future for everyone.”As part of Kahlon’s new mandate, he will engage with local governments, industry and the construction sector. He will also work with Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, and a new assistant deputy minister of mass timber implementation. As well, Kahlon will reach out to Michelle Mungall, Minister of Jobs, Economic Development and Competitiveness, and Forest Innovations Investment Ltd. in their efforts to develop new markets for mass timber.“Mass timber is key to diversifying and creating a more resilient forest sector,” said Kahlon. “I look forward to working with my government colleagues, COFI and the forest industry, construction sector and local governments to promote made-in-B.C. wood products and their use in our public and private sector buildings.”Kahlon will create and chair a joint industry/government steering committee, which will meet semi-annually, to provide guidance and advice to the government's efforts.“Expanding the use of sustainably harvested, low-carbon wood products in B.C. buildings will help combat climate change and support getting people back to work in forestry-related jobs across the province,” said Susan Yurkovich, president and CEO, COFI. “We know that B.C. can become the ‘Harvard of green building,’ the place the world looks to for the next big idea on how to use our forest resources to support better choices for the planet.”This announcement builds on work announced by government last year, when 13 B.C. communities committed to adopting innovative and safe mass timber technology for taller wood buildings that are faster to build, better for the environment and create new jobs and opportunities for forest communities in the province.

Cannabis producers looking to enter B.C.’s legal market can now use a step-by-step online guide that helps simplify and streamline the licensing process.The Cannabis Production Regulatory Navigator has been created to help prospective cannabis cultivators and processors work their way through the steps required to get their regulated and approved products to market.“This new tool will provide clearer and more accessible information about how to enter the legal cannabis market in B.C.,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “Transitioning more cannabis producers to the legal framework will help increase public health and safety, while creating stable jobs that support B.C. families and communities.”  B.C. continues to make progress in reducing unlicensed cannabis production while supporting the economic development of the licensed sector. In 2019, the value generated by licensed cannabis producers in B.C. increased by $600 million, while unlicensed production decreased by 20%.“The online navigator will help Indigenous, small-scale and craft producers overcome the cost and complexity of attaining the appropriate licences and approvals,” said Michelle Mungall, Minister of Jobs, Economic Development and Competitiveness. “Simplifying the regulatory process will help more producers get their businesses running and create job opportunities across the province.”  The Cannabis Production Regulatory Navigator is a guide for businesses of all sizes for cultivating (such as growing and harvesting) and processing (including manufacturing and packaging) for commercial purposes in B.C.“When the Cannabis Act came into effect in October 2018, transitioning legacy growers, often unaccustomed to regulation, were challenged with the prospect of navigating three jurisdictions of government, plus the standard rules required to operate a successful business in B.C.,” said Paul Kelly, manager, Cannabis Business Transition Initiative Program, Community Futures Central Kootenay. “The Province’s new navigator puts much of it in one place, providing an excellent tool to demystify the pathway to cannabis production licensing.”Quick Facts:
The B.C. government is committed to supporting the development of a robust, diverse and sustainable cannabis industry, with an approach that balances economic development with public health and safety, as well as community interests.
The B.C. government provided funding to Community Futures Central Kootenay to help startup and existing cannabis businesses establish operations in the legal economy.
Over the next two years, this program is expected to support more than 100 clients in their transition to licensed and sustainable cannabis businesses.

To date in B.C., there are 66 standard cultivation licence holders, 10 micro-cultivation licence holders, five nursery licence holders, 51 standard processing licence holders and two micro-processing holders.

The Province has approved a temporary wholesale pricing model that will allow liquor licensees to purchase beer, wine and spirits at reduced cost.This measure will provide much-needed financial support for businesses like restaurants, bars and tourism operators with liquor licences. It will be in place from the end of July 2020 until March 31, 2021, when the program will be reviewed.“The hospitality industry has been one of the hardest hit during the pandemic, badly hurting the more than 190,000 British Columbians who work within the sector,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “Offering a wholesale discount for licensees was something we were exploring before COVID-19, but after the onset of the pandemic we accelerated efforts in order to support these community businesses as they try to find their feet.”Currently, hospitality licensees, including restaurants, bars and pubs pay full retail price – wholesale price, plus a retail markup set by the Liquor Distribution Branch (LDB) – on all liquor purchases. The new model will have licensees pay only the wholesale price of the products they order.“The people working in the hospitality industry are a major driver of B.C.’s economy,” said Lisa Beare, Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture. “This change recognizes the restaurant sector’s important role in supporting tourism activity throughout the province.”In addition to changes to the hospitality pricing model, work is underway by government on several other measures identified within a report created by the Business Technical Advisory Panel (BTAP). This includes the adoption of several recommendations contained in a third-party assessment by Deloitte of the LDB’s liquor distribution centre in Delta, and conversion of all rural agency store authorizations currently administered by the LDB to a new form of rural liquor licence regulated under the Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch by the end of 2020.Learn More:View the Business Technical Advisory Panel report here: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/employment-business-and-economic-development/business-management/liquor-regulation-licensing/documents/business_technical_advisory_panel_report_and_recommendations.pdfView the Deloitte report on BTAP’s original recommendations one and three here: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/6-16-20_BCLDB_FinalReport.pdf2019 news release regarding the Deloitte review commissioned by the government: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2019AG0047-000935A backgrounder follows.

A new 24/7 helpline for clinicians will provide health-care providers around British Columbia with live, in-the-moment addiction medicine support, while they are treating patients.The 24/7 Addiction Medicine Clinician Support Line was launched on Tuesday, June 16, 2020, by the BC Centre on Substance Use (BCCSU). The support line is staffed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to provide rapid response for time-sensitive clinical substance-use inquiries. Addiction medicine experts provide telephone consultation to physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses and pharmacists who are involved in addiction and substance-use care, treatment and recovery in British Columbia.“Earlier this spring, we worked quickly to launch Canada’s first guidance for prescribing safe prescription alternatives to the poisoned and increasingly toxic drug supply in B.C.,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “This helpline is another key step in supporting health-care professionals to meet the immediate needs of their patients and to keep them separated from dangerous, unpredictable street drugs.”The 24/7 support line will connect health-care providers to an addiction medicine specialist who has expertise in addiction medicine, including emergency, acute and community care. Consultation can include support in screening, assessment, treatment and management of substance use and substance-use disorders.This new resource will help support implementation of clinical guidance and improve access to evidence-based treatment for patients. The support is urgently needed as clinical guidance and regulatory amendments are being rapidly developed in response to the dual public health emergencies in response to overdoses and the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, telephone guidance can be provided to support patients with opioid-use disorder. Clinicians can also consider prescribing safer prescription alternatives to the toxic drug supply.“Training in addiction medicine remains a huge gap in the health-care system and people aren't able to access the treatment and care they need as a result, despite the urgent need as we grapple with two public health emergencies that are especially impacting people who use drugs,” said Dr. Christy Sutherland, physician education lead at the BCCSU and medical director of PHS Community Services Society. “This new support line will be a great asset to clinicians in many settings – from an ER doctor working overnight to a nurse in a remote community – and help improve the delivery of life-saving, evidence-based addiction care across the province.”Clinicians can reach the 24/7 Addiction Medicine Clinician Support Line and speak to an Addiction Medicine Specialist by calling 778 945-7619.
Quotes:Emma Garrod, registered nurse, clinical nurse educator, Providence Health Care –“My experience providing substance-use practice support to a variety of disciplines has emphasized to me how vastly improved care is when providers and patients have access to expert guidance. This type of support builds confidence and capacity, and I’m thrilled that nurses will also be able to use this service, from remote settings to hospitals, at any time of the day.”Mona Kwong, community pharmacist and pharmacy advisor/director, addiction pharmacy fellowship program, BCCSU –“Pharmacists are extenders of the health-care team and are accessible at all hours of a day, whether through a phone call or an in-person drop-in. The 24/7 support line will be an important tool for pharmacists in every community across B.C. This line will provide timely access to addiction specialists for clinical guidance to support patient care planning.”Dr. Nel Wieman, acting deputy chief medical officer, First Nations Health Authority (FNHA) –“B.C.'s First Nations people have been historically underserved and disproportionately affected by untreated substance use. The need for increased services and support for addiction medicine in our communities has never been greater, nor has the need for addictions clinical staff trained and supported to deliver that treatment and care.”Zak Matieschyn, nurse practitioner, Interior Health –“Providing addiction care in rural B.C. can be very isolating and management of complex patients with addictions can be especially challenging. Access to a 24/7 support line to addiction specialists will be a huge benefit to rural clinicians, and will help provide patients with the best possible care.”Quick Facts:
The 24/7 Addiction Medicine Clinician Support Line is available for physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses and pharmacists caring for individuals with substance use concerns.

Child care providers and parents can continue to count on funding from the Province to support the ongoing operations of child care centres throughout British Columbia.The temporary emergency funding program (TEF) for licensed child care centres is being extended until Aug. 31, 2020. This funding is a key part of the Province’s COVID-19 response, as it helps to ensure essential-service workers have access to safe, reliable child care and parents can return to work as the economy restarts and more B.C. businesses open.It also ensures that child care centres are holding spots, free of charge, for their existing families who may choose to stay home with their children through the summer. Communicating this timeline well in advance will allow child care providers, as well as parents, sufficient time to plan their next steps.“As a former early childhood educator, I understand what a challenging time this has been for families and for child care professionals,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “Whether centres have remained open or are temporarily closed, I want to thank all child care providers for their unrelenting dedication, support and patience. This funding is another way our government is recognizing the critical role they play in communities, social support systems and the economy.”The funding supports open centres to operate with reduced enrolment and helps those that are temporarily closed to cover fixed costs, like rent or lease payments. In addition, the Province will require operators to use any surplus TEF – after meeting funding and health guidelines – to provide their early childhood educators (ECEs) with temporary wage enhancements or other compensation, such as training or benefits.“With the implementation of the temporary emergency funding, the Britannia Child Care Hub has been able to keep programs open to provide priority care for essential care workers,” said Jacky Hughes, manager of child care services, Britannia Community Services Centre. “The funding has allowed the programs to save child care spaces for families, reduce essential service parent fees by 20%, increase educators' wages by 30% and provide educators with free priority child care. The pandemic has created many uncertainties for the future of ECE, but with the continuation of temporary emergency funding, we are able to provide some relief for families and educators, while ensuring the financial sustainability of our programs.”The fund is a unique program in Canada, providing centres that are open with seven times their average monthly funding from government to help cover their monthly operating expenses. Child care providers temporarily closed due to COVID-19 are also eligible to receive twice their average monthly funding so they can safely reopen. Smaller home-based child care providers are also eligible for these supports.“High-quality, affordable child care goes hand in hand with the success of B.C.’s economy, and that is especially true right now,” said Katrina Chen, Minister of State for Child Care. “By extending this funding, we are providing stability for providers and certainty for parents that their spot will be held, free of charge, so they can return to work as the economy restarts and life returns to a new kind of normal. We’re also ensuring that any surplus funding is redirected to support early childhood educators.”In addition to TEF, the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) and the Ministry of Health have released health and safety guidelines for child care settings that are supporting child care centres, which were temporarily closed, to reopen safely. As well, the BCCDC and the ministry are reassuring parents, as they return to work, that their children will be cared for in a safe environment.One of the conditions of the funding is that centres must prioritize spaces for children of essential service workers. As of May 2020, more than 8,000 children of essential service workers were attending child care, allowing their parents to provide the health care and critical services British Columbians rely on.  To support families who may be struggling with loss of employment and income, child care providers receiving this funding must not charge parents fees for any periods of closure or for any vacant spaces while they are open, including when a parent chooses to temporarily withdraw a child due to COVID-19.Since its implementation on April 1, 2020, the Province has invested more than $150 million through the TEF to support over 4,500 child care centres, representing over 115,000 spaces, both open and closed. Approximately 90% of eligible providers in B.C. are receiving support from the TEF program.Investing in child care and early childhood education is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts: 
Child care centres receiving temporary emergency funding continue to be eligible for the Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative and the ECE Wage Enhancement.
The fee reduction helps parents by providing funding for licensed child care providers to reduce and stabilize their monthly child care fees.
The wage enhancement has provided nearly 12,000 ECEs with a $1-per-hour wage enhancement, which increased to $2 per hour on April 1, 2020, to better recognize the work they do.
Families accessing care from these providers may also be eligible for the Affordable Child Care Benefit. As of June 2020, more than 52,000 families have benefited from savings of up to $1,250 a month, per child.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are providing case updates for three 24-hour reporting periods. In the first reporting period from June 12 to June 13, we had 14 new cases. In the second reporting period from June 13 to June 14, we had 16 cases. In the last 24 hours, we have had a further six new cases.“This represents 36 new cases since we reported on Friday, for a total of 2,745 cases in British Columbia.“There are 182 active cases of COVID-19 in the province and 2,395 people who tested positive have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 13 individuals are hospitalized, four of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 934 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,420 in the Fraser Health region, 130 in the Island Health region, 196 in the Interior Health region and 65 in the Northern Health region.“There have been no new COVID-19 related deaths, for a total of 168 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.""There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks and the outbreak at South Granville Park Lodge has been declared over. In total, four long-term care or assisted-living facilities continue to have active outbreaks.""There have been no new community outbreaks and the outbreak associated with the Kearl Lake industrial site in Alberta has also been declared over. Public health teams continue to provide support for the five ongoing community outbreaks.“We ask British Columbians to not lose sight of the immense effort that we have all put into staying safe and remember that many people have experienced severe illness, and many families have lost loved ones. We must remember there is no treatment and no vaccine for COVID-19, which means the virus will be in our communities for a long time to come.“Our objective is to keep COVID-19 low and slow. To do this, we are opening what is safe to open and keeping closed what is more harmful. We are slowly easing restrictions that are safe to lessen and are keeping measures in place to contain further spread.“We have learned where COVID-19 spreads and we don’t have to look far to see that when left unchecked, a small cluster can quickly surge into multiple super-spreading events. This is a seed we do not want to grow.“The tools we have are: rapid testing for anyone with symptoms, so we can quickly contain every new case and stop outbreaks; giving everyone the space to stay safe, whether at home, at work or with friends; and always following the rules for safe social interactions.“We can see a small number of friends, we can travel within B.C., and we can protect our communities. To do this, we must continue to stand together and support each other as we move forward.” Learn More:For more information about BC’s Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/restartbcFor B.C.’s surgical renewal plan, visit:

People living in Renfrew-Collingwood and surrounding neighbourhoods now have access to more primary care and health promotion services with the opening of the new RISE Community Health Centre.The Province launched RISE Community Health Centre in collaboration with the Collingwood Neighbourhood House (CNH) Society to provide comprehensive primary health care and health promotion services to residents.Community health centres are either community governed or community informed and they are most often not-for-profit organizations with services tailored to meet the health needs of the community they serve. RISE is governed, owned and operated by Collingwood Neighbourhood House.“Our primary care strategy is providing increased and improved access to everyday health care to people throughout B.C., including in Renfrew-Collingwood,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “We’ve listened to the people in Renfrew-Collingwood and have built on the good work their community organizations are already doing. Now that RISE is open in its main location, in addition to the site at CNH, more people will be able to get the care they need when they need it. This will make a difference for those who have been struggling to access health-care services.”Located at 3425 Crowley Dr., RISE will first offer comprehensive primary care and health-promotion services. It is accepting patients by self-referral, community referral and medical provider referral.Services available include attaching people without a primary care provider to a family doctor or a nurse practitioner, providing access to preventative and primary health-care services to patients with complex medical and social needs, mental health and addictions challenges, and co-ordination of specialist care. RISE also provides health promotion programs, such as health education to the broader community, provision of harm reductions supplies, and outreach and collaborations with local programs and services to support residents.RISE has been providing primary care and health promotion services through a clinical space located at CNH since November 2019. Services at this site will continue.More than 12 full time equivalent (FTE) staff will work at RISE. This is an increase of more than eight FTEs since November 2019. Staff include a director, clinical co-ordinator, medical office assistant, clinical lead, nurse practitioner, community health worker, registered nurse, clinical counsellor and social worker. The centre expects to have approximately 20,000 patient visits in the first year of operation.Once the centre is fully operational, it will work to attach more than 3,700 residents, who are struggling to access medical services, to a primary care team.“I would like to acknowledge the passion and dedication of the Collingwood Neighbourhood House Society and all its partners for working tirelessly to improve access to services for the people in the community and surrounding areas,” Dix said.RISE will expand its services and clinical team in the first two years of operation. Once at full capacity, the centre will have more than 20 FTE staff. Over time, people will also benefit from additional health promotion and disease prevention activities, such as a pharmacy dispensary, physiotherapy, nutrition support, counselling and patient education, as well as support to navigate health and social service systems.Quick Facts: 
There are approximately 100 health authority-run community health centres and 30 community-governed community health centres in British Columbia.
These centres focus on integrating services and programs in primary care, health promotion and community well-being, and work to address social determinants of health by linking with other social-sector agencies and services.

Bruce Ralston, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources, has released the following statement on the BC Utilities Commission (BCUC) expanding fuel price transparency for select British Columbia cities:“While our government has taken strong action to get to the bottom of unexplained high gasoline prices, British Columbians in some communities are still paying significantly more compared to neighbouring regions.“I’m pleased to see the BCUC is looking into why people in Powell River, Revelstoke, Port Alberni and Squamish are paying more for gasoline, in response to public feedback from these communities. People deserve transparency and fairness when it comes to gasoline prices.“Using its new powers under the Fuel Price Transparency Act, the BCUC will collect and publish additional data for these cities here: GasPricesBC.ca“We will remain diligent as we watch the market and keep the industry accountable.“For years, British Columbians have felt they are getting gouged when they fill up at the pump. That’s why our government asked the BCUC to do an investigation into gasoline prices.“The inquiry found a lack of competition and substantial markups in British Columbia’s gasoline market, including a 10 to 13 cents per-litre premium being charged to drivers that industry was unable to explain. This unexplained premium results in British Columbians paying an extra $490 million every year.“Following the BCUC’s investigation, our government brought in the Fuel Price Transparency Act. The legislation gives the BCUC the power to collect and publish information on refined fuel imports and exports, fuel volumes at refineries and terminals, and wholesale and retail prices. This will help to ensure companies are held publicly accountable for unexplained markups and price increases.”

Youth around British Columbia and their families will have faster, easier access to mental health and substance use services and supports with eight new Foundry centres to be developed throughout the province.The new Foundry centres will be in Burns Lake, Comox Valley, Cranbrook, Langley, Squamish, Surrey, Port Hardy and Williams Lake.The new locations, as with all Foundry centres, will offer increased access to integrated health and wellness services for young people aged 12 to 24 in both rural and urban communities. Each centre will offer primary care, youth and family peer supports, walk-in counselling, mental health and substance use services, and social services all under one roof, making it easier for youth to get help when they need it.“I am so excited that young people in eight more communities in rural and urban B.C. will be able to get quick access to the mental health and substance use services they need and deserve,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “With COVID-19 impacting the mental health of young people in a big way, and with the overdose crisis continuing, it’s more important than ever that they have quick access to the excellent supports that Foundry provides.”The eight new Foundry centres will be opened and operated by the following local, community-based lead agencies:
Burns Lake: Carrier Sekani Family Services
Comox Valley: John Howard Society of North Island
Cranbrook: Ktunaxa-Kinbasket Child and Family Service Society
Langley: Encompass Support Services Society
Squamish: Sea to Sky Community Services Society
Surrey: Pacific Community Resources Society
Port Hardy: North Island Crisis and Counselling Centre Society
Williams Lake: Cariboo Chilcotin Child Development Centre Association
“A new Foundry within a community is a sign that lets young people know there’s a place just for them where they can get the support they need, right where they live,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “Child and youth mental health workers at Foundry centres play a key role, matching young people with early interventions to help them take on challenges and get back on the road to wellness.”The new locations were chosen after a two-step evaluation process. The process began in October 2019 with a call for expressions of interest and included several independent panels, a two-day in-person convening session, a second written submission and phone and in-person interviews with representatives from interested community organizations.“We were inspired by the communities that participated in the expansion process to identify the next eight lead agencies,” said Steve Mathias, executive director, Foundry. “Communities from all over B.C., urban, rural and remote, felt that this was something that their youth and families needed and wanted. We look forward to our network growing to 19 centres and eventually seeing the great impact these Foundry centres will have on youth, families, care providers and communities.”For youth and families not living near a Foundry centre, Foundry recently launched a new provincewide virtual service accessible by voice, video and chat for young people ages 12-24 and their caregivers in British Columbia. Foundry’s virtual services include drop-in counselling, peer support and family support, and will soon include primary care.The Foundry model is an integral part of A Pathway to Hope, B.C.’s roadmap for making mental health and addictions care better for people in British Columbia. Implementing A Pathway to Hope is a shared priority with the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Michelle Shaw, director of operations, Fraser South, Pacific Community Resources Society — “We are stronger and better when we do things together – a Foundry centre in Surrey, developed in partnership with Surrey youth, families and service providers will create seamless access to the services, connections and early interventions needed to support wellness.”Jessica Soule, provincial youth advisor, Foundry —“Integrated and accessible services are essential for wellness. These new Foundry centres will provide hope for thousands of youth. Over the past four years, Foundry has led the movement towards a better, healthier British Columbia by chipping away at the shame and blame that controlled the conversation around mental health and addictions for so long.”Laila Ferreira, provincial family advisor, Foundry —“As a parent with lived experience, I know first-hand that when a young person lives with mental health or substance use challenges, it impacts the entire family. Foundry’s integrated model ensures families, whether natural or chosen, are connected to available and welcoming programs and resources that assist them in supporting the health of their youth and family. I am optimistic that the opening of these eight new centres across B.C. will provide much needed support, connection and hope to youth and the families that love them.”Learn More:A Pathway to Hope: https://bit.ly/33HyFHyFoundry: https://foundrybc.ca/For a Punjabi translation: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/6-16-20_Foundry_PN.pdfA backgrounder follows.

With the weather heating up and more people enjoying the outdoors, drivers in rural areas are reminded to share the road with others: including horses and their riders.Last year, the government made improvements to signage to alert drivers to use extra caution, allow extra room and be courteous when passing horses and riders in rural areas. Signs remind drivers and riders to “share the road,” as they do with cyclists and pedestrians, to prevent surprise and support safety for all.During the COVID-19 pandemic, people travelling on foot, bikes and horseback are advised to use appropriate physical distancing when passing others. Drivers should allow extra room for horses and riders, cyclists and pedestrians to share the roadway.Horses and their riders are recognized road users in the Motor Vehicle Act. However, drivers may not be expecting these travellers or be aware that loud noises (like horns) or passing vehicles can startle horses. These noises can trigger unpredictable behaviour, causing risk to riders, animals and drivers.The signs, a collaboration between the ministry and the Horse Council of B.C., are available for any regions that want to improve awareness in areas where horseback riding is popular. Drivers are advised to watch for these signs at the start of any roadway or along narrow or winding roads commonly used for horseback riding.The ministry reminds people to use caution and stay alert for diverse road users, even when signs are not present.Drivers are reminded of the following tips when travelling near horses:
slow down long before getting too close;
pass at a slower speed and give the horse and rider a wide berth (typically a one-car width);
brake and accelerate gently to avoid making extra noise or spraying gravel;
turn off stereos and do not honk, yell or rev the engine;
if travelling by bicycle, scooter or motorcycle, ride quietly and approach single file; and
if a horse appears agitated, wait for the rider to get it under control before passing, and once past the horse and rider, accelerate gradually.
Horse riders should use caution when travelling on narrow roads or in times of low visibility, such as dusk or dawn. Riders should wear reflective vests, as well as outfit horses with high-visibility leg bands when possible.Learn More:For more information about sharing the road safely with horses and riders, visit: https://www.tranbc.ca/2016/07/06/how-to-share-the-road-safely-with-horseback-riders/For information and supports that are non-health related, call 1 888-COVID19, anytime between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. (Pacific time), seven days a week, or visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19For travel restrictions and precautions due to COVID-19, visit: http://ow.ly/jBGu50yVMRO

In advance of World Elder Abuse Awareness Day on Monday, June 15, 2020, the government has provided $1.89 million to help raise awareness of senior abuse.The funding will also help create educational programs to protect seniors from physical, emotional and financial abuse.The BC Association of Community Response Networks (BC CRN) received $1.34 million from the Province to work with organizations and service providers to provide a co-ordinated response to elder abuse. BC CRN leads World Elder Abuse Awareness Day events, and both organizations are active in raising public awareness. Seniors First BC received $550,000 from the Province to manage a helpline and create programs to inform seniors and people caring for seniors about abuse, as well as educate seniors on topics such as fraud and scams.“Seniors may be isolated due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and this funding will help create awareness programs for families and friends to recognize the signs of abuse, neglect or manipulation in seniors,” said Ronna-Rae Leonard, Parliamentary Secretary for Seniors. “With a growing population of close to one million seniors in B.C. who are living longer than ever, it is our responsibility to protect seniors as they age so they are treated with dignity and respect.”BC CRN is the co-ordinating body for community response networks (CRN), which are networks of individuals, groups and agencies that work together to create a co-ordinated community response to abuse, neglect and self-neglect of vulnerable adults.“It is our collective responsibility to take care of vulnerable seniors who have the right to be treated with dignity and live free of harm,” Leonard said. “These organizations help inform the public and raise awareness to help ensure seniors are not taken advantage of physically, emotionally or financially.”Funding provided by the Province enables BC CRN to support B.C. communities to help protect seniors and families. Informational workshops, such as It’s Not Right! and Gatekeeper, help service providers learn how to recognize signs of abuse and neglect. The workshops are facilitated by provincial presenters and are available for neighbours, friends and families who care for seniors.“Thanks to the support of the Ministry of Health, we now have 80 community response networks serving 232 communities throughout the province, including the revitalized Vancouver Indigenous CRN,” said Sherry Baker, executive director, BC CRN. “I’d like to thank the thousands of volunteers that are dedicated to building safer communities for seniors. Their combined volunteer hours, donations and gifts in kind add up to $1.5 million worth of service.”Seniors First BC is a non-profit organization that offers a mix of legal, psycho-social and justice-based supports to older adults. Seniors First BC works to prevent elder abuse and to provide support to seniors who are at risk of being abused and whose rights have been violated. Seniors First BC offers a seniors' abuse and information line, workshops and outreach programs, victim services and free legal services for seniors who cannot afford a lawyer.“We are using this funding to educate and protect seniors from malicious COVID-19 related frauds and scams that try to trick seniors into giving out their personal information online or over the phone,” said Rick Gambrel, executive director, Seniors First BC. “We also run a seniors abuse and information line known as SAIL, a victim services program and referrals to an in-house lawyer.”Isobel Mackenzie, British Columbia's seniors advocate, said: “The pandemic has forced many seniors to remain isolated, which increases their likelihood of experiencing elder abuse. Recognizing the signs of elder abuse and knowing who to report it to is key. These grants to two vital agencies will help to achieve this.”Quick Facts:
Funding by the Province supports Seniors First BC’s confidential toll-free Seniors Abuse and Information Line (SAIL) that is available seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. (Pacific time) at 604 437-1940, or toll-free at 1 866 437-1940. For any emergencies, call 911.
Elder abuse, including neglect, is defined as a single or repeated act, or a lack of appropriate action, that causes harm or distress to an older person.
Elder abuse can take place in a senior’s home, a care facility or in the community, and often involves a person in a position of trust or a situation of dependency. The abuse can be physical, emotional, verbal, financial, sexual, spiritual or neglectful.
According to statistics from Seniors First BC, approximately 8% of seniors in B.C. experience some form of abuse. However, this may be higher, as older adults are often reluctant to report abuse.

For the first time, the public libraries’ BC Summer Reading Club (BC SRC) is being offered virtually to young readers and their families, thanks to a $65,000 investment from the Government of British Columbia.This literacy program is usually offered in person. This year, as work continues to flatten the curve of COVID-19, young readers will be able to follow their passion for reading and still participate by registering and tracking their progress online.“Fun and engaging programs like the BC Summer Reading Club that help our kids strengthen their literacy skills and stay motivated to keep reading over the summer are even more important this year,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “I’m so pleased this incredibly popular program will continue this summer with expanded online features thanks to the great work done by library staff and the BC Library Association.”The BC SRC is a free literacy program offered through B.C.’s 71 public libraries to children ages 5-14. Online registration for BC SRC will open Monday, June 15, 2020, and children and families can access the new website until the end of September. Some of the new online features that have been added to the program include:
digital badges for reaching reading goals, as well as a certificate of completion for finishing the program;
live events and video demonstrations, including hands-on crafts and experiments;
weekly stay-at-home activity packages; and
a dashboard for parents/guardians to track their kids’ reading progress and the digital badges they have earned.
All reading counts and participation is easy. Kids can read whatever they want, including story books, information books, graphic novels and comic books, in whatever language they feel most comfortable reading in. They can also listen to someone else read or tell stories. Parents and guardians can register their kids on the BC SRC website, selecting their library and accessing some activities to do at home.

Premier John Horgan has issued the following statement marking June 14, 2020, as World Blood Donor Day:“On World Blood Donor Day, we celebrate those who have helped save lives, thanks to their selfless donation of blood and plasma.“In British Columbia and across Canada, we are privileged in our access to a free and safe blood supply, which allows us to help patients needing treatments and those in emergency situations. There are still many countries where safe blood is not available to those in need, due to a lack of donations and testing equipment.“The COVID-19 pandemic has changed our routines, including reducing the number of life-saving blood donations. We thank all those who have answered the urgent call for blood donations during this challenging time. Your donation will help to ensure supply can keep up with demand and help people receiving cancer treatments, trauma victims and many more.“Safety comes first, and precautions are in place to keep blood donors safe. Today and every day, we encourage all British Columbians who are able to donate blood or blood products to make the choice that can help save the life of a child, a senior, a friend or a loved one in your community. Your single donation can save up to three lives.“With everyone’s help, we can continue to maintain a healthy blood supply in our province and across the country. Book an appointment, save a life.”For a French translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.06.14_STM_World_Blood_Donor_Day-FR.pdfFor a Punjabi translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.06.14_STM_World_Blood_Donor_Day-Punjabi.pdfFor a Chinese (traditional) translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.06.14_STM_World_Blood_Donor_Day-TC.pdf

Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, has released the following statement in response to calls for British Columbia’s Police Act reform:“Everyone deserves to be treated fairly by the police, and our government acknowledges that for many Black, Indigenous and other people of colour, that hasn’t always been the case. Ensuring the police are held accountable to the highest standards for fair and unbiased conduct is crucial to maintaining public trust.“To that end, our government passed legislation last year to strengthen the Independent Investigation Office’s capacity and improve the quality and timeliness of its investigations. We have also introduced new binding standards on police stops – or ‘street checks’ – to promote unbiased policing. Under the new standards, police are not permitted to make arbitrary stops or ones based on race.“But we know more work can and must be accomplished. Earlier this week, I met with Premier John Horgan to discuss B.C.’s outdated Police Act, which is out of step with our government’s approach and our work with police services on important issues including harm reduction and mental health. He asked me to strike an all-party committee to engage with communities and experts on how the 45-year-old act can be modernized to reflect today’s challenges and opportunities for delivering police services with a specific focus on systemic racism. “We also recognize that police officers require a modern policing structure that provides greater clarity for their roles. Expectations on front-line police responders have grown and our policing and public safety model needs to reflect communities’ current and future needs.“When the legislature resumes later this month, I will be tabling a motion to strike this committee and I will look forward to receiving its recommendations.”

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are announcing 16 new cases who have tested positive for COVID-19, for a total of 2,709 cases in British Columbia.“There are 187 active cases of COVID-19 in the province and 2,354 people who tested positive have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 12 individuals are hospitalized, three of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 922 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,396 in the Fraser Health region, 130 in the Island Health region, 196 in the Interior Health region and 65 in the Northern Health region. This includes a data correction of one less case in the Northern Health region.“There has been one new COVID-19 related death in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, for a total of 168 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks. In total, five long-term care or assisted-living facilities continue to have active outbreaks.“There have been no new community outbreaks and public health teams continue to provide support for the six ongoing community outbreaks.“We have been monitoring our COVID-19 restart activities closely and are modifying our approach as we move forward. This includes amending the provincial health officer’s order for food and liquor service establishments to make restaurants and pubs safer for employees and patrons.“The amended order goes step in step with enhanced worker guidance that is now available on the WorkSafeBC website.“The requirements for this sector have been adjusted in response to small clusters of new cases in businesses, as employees spend more time together and in recognition that a safe number of patrons is highly dependent on the amount of space within each location, not the restaurant capacity.“The best way for us to avoid spreading the virus is to ensure everyone, employees and patrons, have the space to stay safe.“Food service owners need to remember that protecting your employees and patrons requires layers of protection in the kitchen and in the dining area. Plans need to include such things as frequent handwashing, increased cleaning, using barriers in kitchens and dining areas, and giving lots of space between tables.“For patrons going to your local establishment, complete your checklist before going out and when you arrive. Are you healthy? Is your group small? Is the WorkSafeBC safety plan clearly posted? Are physical distancing measures and barriers in place?“We all want to stay safe and we all have a role to play. The decisions we make and the actions we take will protect our communities and allow us to continue to progress.”Learn More:For more information about BC’s Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/restartbcFor B.C.’s surgical renewal plan, visit:

The Province is making changes to the Community Gaming Grants (CGG) program to make it easier for non-profit organizations to adapt and continue to provide vital services to British Columbians.The changes will help the many vulnerable people who are particularly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.“The pandemic has highlighted the critical role that not-for-profit organizations play in supporting people in communities across B.C. and now more than ever, we all need to work together to ensure they can meet the increased need for services people are relying on,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “The changes we’ve made to the Community Gaming Grants program will help organizations during these unprecedented times, so that British Columbians can continue to receive the services that improve their quality of life, support local needs and keep our communities strong.”Applications for the human and social services sector, which includes food banks, shelters, domestic violence supports, hospice, counselling services and others, are opening mid-June 2020, nearly two months ahead of schedule. This change recognizes that many not-for-profit organizations supporting vulnerable populations are facing decreases in donations, a diminishing volunteer base, cancelled programming and increased demand for services during the pandemic.Other changes to the CGG program provide:
flexibility in requirements;
the ability to include new programs in an application to respond to COVID-19 specific needs; and
guidance on how to apply for grants given current uncertainty about whether programs such as annual fairs may be postponed or cancelled.
The $5-million capital projects portion of the CGG program is also being adjusted to address some of the financial challenges that organizations are facing due to COVID-19. Funding for 2020-21 will prioritize capital project applications that are facing increased demand for services due to the pandemic, as well as organizations that need to make modifications to facilities to support physical distancing, such as installing protective shields and barriers, kitchen reconfigurations, and renovations to expand handwashing and hygiene stations. The Province will also give priority to new applicants and increase the amount it covers from 50% to 80% of the total cost of eligible capital projects directly related to COVID-19, up to a maximum of $250,000.More information about program changes is available online at: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/sports-culture/gambling-fundraising/gaming-grants/community-gaming-grantsThe Province will continue to monitor the impacts of the pandemic and adjust processes, policies and program delivery to meet the needs of the organizations and the people they serve as the situation evolves.Quick Facts:
Every year, commercial gaming generates revenue that the Government of B.C. invests in key services.
These investments support organizations in the areas of health care and education, arts and culture groups, sports, environment, public safety, human and social services, as well as parent advisory councils in schools throughout B.C.

Up to $140 million of the revenue generated is directed into the community through the CGG program, supporting about 5,000 community organizations each year.

People in Sooke now have better access to team-based primary care, with the opening of the newly expanded West Coast Family Medical Clinic.The expansion of the West Coast Family Medical Clinic is a collaboration with local physicians, Island Health, the South Island Division of Family Practice, community organizations, such as the Sooke Region Community Health Initiative and Sooke Family Resource Society, and residents who attended public engagement events.“People need reliable access to health care close to home,” said Premier John Horgan. “This new clinic will deliver primary health care for people in the fast-growing community of Sooke and the surrounding area. It is part of our government’s focus on helping people with the things that matter most.”The new space includes annual incremental provincial funding of $1 million to support team-based care at the clinic. Island Health has overseen the renovations of the site and contributed approximately $600,000 in one-time capital funding to the renovation.Five new health-care professionals will gradually join the team, which will include a total of 10 family physicians, three registered nurses, one nurse practitioner, a social worker, a registered dietitian and 11 medical office assistants. Most of the primary care resources will be brought on board by August 2020, with full staffing completed by January 2021.The addition of team-based care increases the clinic’s capacity to offer primary care, newborn and post-partum care, non-emergency urgent care, palliative care and medical services for the Elders’ Wellness Clinic at the T’Souke Nation and long-term care in the community.“Families in Sooke share government’s vision that better health is achievable through better access to primary health-care services,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “The West Coast Family Medical Clinic expansion will have significant and lasting benefits for the individuals in Sooke who are unattached to consistent primary care.”Recruitment is underway. When fully staffed, the West Coast Family Medical Clinic anticipates having the capacity to connect approximately 4,250 currently unattached patients to their primary care team and accommodate about 300 patient visits a day.The West Coast Family Medical Clinic is normally open weekdays from 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Opening hours have been temporarily reduced to 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on weekdays as part of the clinic’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.During the pandemic, all patients are asked to call or book online to receive a virtual care assessment first. If required, staff will arrange to follow up with patients in-person.Expanding the West Coast Family Medical Clinic in Sooke reflects government’s commitment to strengthening health care in the region and around the province. In November 2018, the Westshore Urgent Primary Care Centre in Langford opened its doors to enhance access to same-day and after-hours team-based care in the region.Quotes:Leah Hollins, board chair, Island Health –“Island Health is pleased to be a partner in the development and future operations of the West Coast Family Medical Clinic in Sooke. This team-based primary care clinic will enable more residents in this growing community to access a range of health-care services closer to home.”Dr. Vanessa Young, board chair, South Island Division of Family Practice –""The long-standing partnerships between the Sooke community, its dedicated physician group and Island Health have yielded a wonderful outcome for the residents of Sooke. This latest Sooke clinic expansion is yet another step forward in providing top quality, comprehensive primary care to the local population. The South Island Division of Family practice offers congratulations to all involved.""Dr. Anton Rabien, physician, West Coast Family Medical Clinic –“It’s immensely satisfying to see this project come to fruition. All the stakeholders — the local physicians, Island Health, the South Island Division of Family Practice, Mayor Tait, the Sooke Primary Health Services Working Group, Premier Horgan and the Ministry of Health — have pulled together to make this clinic expansion a reality. I think we all share the belief that access to high-quality primary care is essential for the health of our communities.”Maja Tait, mayor, District of Sooke –                                      ""The clinic expansion and transition to a new service delivery model is the culmination of many years of work and commitment by numerous stakeholders. I am very proud to have been a part of this effort as the chairperson of the Sooke Region Primary Health Care Services Working Group since 2014 and would like to thank our members and partners, as well as residents who attended public engagement events. We are grateful to the Province for its response to our advocacy efforts and for investing in the health and well-being of our community.

My heart goes out to the 253 directly impacted workers, their families and the entire Mackenzie community during this difficult time.“Many in the community, including Mayor Joan Atkinson, have worked tirelessly to keep this operation running. It is my understanding that Paper Excellence has said the curtailment is due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as reduced fibre availability due to sawmill curtailments in the region.“Our first priority is to support forest communities, workers and families, and we will be reaching out to UNIFOR and Paper Excellence to determine what supports are needed. All employees impacted by the closure of Paper Excellence’s Mackenzie pulp mill are eligible to access supports and services under our government’s $69-million forestry worker support fund. Supports under this fund include job placements, retirement bridging and retraining.”

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are announcing 14 new cases who have tested positive for COVID-19, for a total of 2,694 cases in British Columbia.""There are 183 active cases of COVID-19 in the province, and 2,344 people who tested positive have recovered.""Of the total COVID-19 cases, 13 individuals are hospitalized, five of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.""Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 917 cases of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,386 in the Fraser Health region, 130 in the Island Health region, 195 in the Interior Health region and 66 in the Northern Health region.""There have been no new COVID-19 related deaths, for a total of 167 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks. In total, five long-term care or assisted-living facilities continue to have active outbreaks.“There have been no new community outbreaks and public health teams continue to provide support for the six ongoing community outbreaks.“We have spoken before about the many unintended impacts of COVID-19 – positive and negative. We have seen British Columbians coming together in kindness and support for each other, and we have also seen tragic death.“COVID-19 is not our only health crisis. Today, the BC Coroners Service announced that 170 people in B.C. have died from overdoses from a toxic illicit drug supply in the month of May alone.“The extent and complexity of the two crises we are facing, the overdose crisis and COVID-19 pandemic, have stretched our public health capacity to the limits. COVID-19 is forcing all of us to stay further apart from others, isolating people and adding to what is already an immense challenge.“There is no one, single cause to the overdose emergency, and there is no one, simple solution.“Addiction and substance use are complex. We must eliminate the stigma and shame that leads people to be afraid to reach out to their family or friends to even talk about their drug use, and we must all do our part to protect ourselves, our communities and our loved ones.“We must all show compassion and understanding for our family, our friends or our colleagues. We have shown what we can do to look out for one another in B.C. and, whether it is COVID-19 or drug use, that saves lives.“The provincial health officer’s order for food and liquor service establishments has been amended to allow for the inclusion of patios when creating a safety plan and calculating the maximum number of patrons to meet physical distancing requirements. The order also includes details on partitions and the maximum number of patrons at each table, requirements for self-service stations and distance requirements for areas where patrons may congregate.“While like many British Columbians, we would welcome the return of NHL hockey, there will be no exceptions to the rules or public health guidelines and orders here in B.C.“We have reviewed the NHL proposal and have written a letter to the federal government confirming our support as the plan exceeds B.C.’s requirements and the criteria for protecting our communities, without compromise.“What we do each day and every day does make a difference.

More locally raised meat will be available for restaurants and retail outlets following provincial government efforts to establish a more resilient B.C. food system.The meat will be available in the Alberni-Clayoquot Regional District, as well as Electoral Area D of the Regional District of Central Kootenay and Electoral Area H of the Regional District of Fraser-Fort George.“We have been working with ranchers, abattoir operators and regional governments since 2017 to increase the amount of locally raised meat British Columbians in rural communities can enjoy, and we are starting to see the results of our collective effort,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “This change will help livestock and poultry producers in the new designated areas expand their sales in stores and restaurants in their communities, supporting a more sustainable regional food system and putting more great tasting B.C. beef, pork and poultry on plates, grills and menus in those areas.”The updated Meat Inspection Regulation now allows Class D licences in each of the three areas and encourages the growing “farm-to-fork” trend in many B.C. communities. Class D licence holders are permitted to conduct on-farm slaughter of up to 25 animal units for direct sale to consumers or retail outlets like restaurants and meat shops in the region where the meat was slaughtered.“These changes will be celebrated at dinner tables, restaurants and butcher shops by people who enjoy the beef, pork and poultry raised by our neighbours in the valley,” said Scott Fraser, MLA for Mid Island-Pacific Rim. “There continues to be growing interest and pride in the food produced and served here. It makes it easier for livestock and poultry producers to sell food in the region that they are part of, strengthening our area’s food security, economy and community ties.”These changes to increase the local meat supply follows Ministry of Agriculture consultation that began in March 2018. The consultation on how to improve rural abattoir licensing in British Columbia was held with ranchers and livestock producers, abattoir operators and local governments. The changes also follow the direction of a recommendation in the June 2019 Agriculture, Fish and Food Standing Committee’s report to seek “public input on new Class D licence regions to help alleviate regional or sub-regional slaughter capacity challenges and increase local livestock production.”The B.C. government continues to consult with ranchers, abattoir operators, local governments and other stakeholders to review and improve the province’s rural slaughter capacity, and support more opportunities for the production and sales of locally raised meat products in B.C.Quotes:Collin Van Horne, Nighthawk Ridge Farms, Port Alberni –“This is another step in the right direction for local farmers. It gives us added flexibility in providing high-quality, locally produced food.”John Jack, chair, Alberni-Clayoquot Regional District (ACRD) –“This is good news for the regional economy. The ability for local producers to access small-scale, on-farm slaughter facilities in the ACRD will support growth in the industry by reducing production costs and improving access to local markets, while encouraging a more accessible and secure local food supply chain. We are excited within the region for the opportunity to access meat that is safely raised, slaughtered and processed right here in the Alberni Valley and our coastal communities.”Aimee Watson, chair, Regional District of Central Kootenay –“This change will mean a reinvigoration of our area’s agriculture sector and provide a great opportunity to harness local food production to feed the remote communities of North Kootenay Lake. It will also assist in a desperately needed economic recovery and support jobs in our remote communities, and hopefully encourage more of the pig, cattle and sheep farms that used to thrive here.”Art Kaehn, chair, Regional District of Fraser-Fort George –“These changes reduce barriers for livestock producers in the Robson Valley to get their products to market.

Bruce Ralston, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources, has issued the following statement in response to the launch of Carbon Engineering’s innovation centre:“I would like to congratulate Carbon Engineering on the groundbreaking of its new innovation centre in Squamish.“As Carbon Engineering’s advanced development and business headquarters, the innovation centre will optimize its direct air capture and air-to-fuels technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and make low-carbon transportation fuels. The facility will be a model for how this technology can be deployed nationally and internationally, transforming energy systems and reducing climate pollution on a global scale.“The fact that Carbon Engineering has chosen Squamish as the home of its innovation centre shows that B.C. is an attractive place for businesses to invest and is fast becoming a global leader in clean-energy technology. Through the government’s CleanBC plan and programs like the Innovative Clean Energy Fund, we’re helping to spur innovation, create new economic opportunities and develop made-in-B.C. solutions to address global challenges.“Carbon Engineering’s achievements are a great example of CleanBC in action and how we can grow the economy as we build a better future.

The B.C. government is taking additional action to help support people, communities and forest companies dealing with challenges from the COVID-19 crisis.Changes to the Manufactured Forest Products Regulation (MFPR) and the Coast-wide implementation of the variable fee-in-lieu of manufacture on log exports that were scheduled to come into force on July 1,2020, are now postponed until Sept. 30, 2020, and December 2020 respectively.Government remains committed to exploring opportunities to resolve long-standing fibre supply issues for smaller forest product manufacturing firms. Over the coming months, government will continue to engage with industry and stakeholders to address this issue.Globally, the forest industry has been hit particularly hard by the challenges associated with the ongoing COVID-19 crisis and the resulting market impacts. Delaying the MFPR and fee-in-lieu provides B.C. forest companies with more time to prepare for and adjust their business models to the upcoming regulatory changes.The MFPR, introduced in 2003, defines the criteria that products must meet to be considered manufactured under the Forest Act. Under the current regulation, logs that are squared off up to a maximum dimension of 43 by 43 centimetres (17 by 17 inches) are categorized as a sawn-wood product and may be exported without further manufacture.As of Sept. 30, 2020, the amended regulation will change the maximum dimension of lumber to be considered a sawn-wood product to 30.5 by 30.5 centimetres (12 by 12 inches), requiring further domestic processing of lumber prior to being eligible for export. Additionally, the regulation amendments will require that in the Coast area, lumber that is made from Western red cedar or cypress must be fully manufactured to be eligible for export, or the seller or exporter must obtain an exemption from the manufacturing requirement and pay a new fee-in-lieu of manufacture to the Province.The new Coast-wide variable fee-in-lieu of manufacture will come into force in December 2020. It will replace the existing fee-in-lieu structure for the Coast and will expand the practice that has been in place for BC Timber Sales advertised in the Coast area since July 7, 2019. The new variable rate fee will be dependent on the economics of the individual stands for harvest, set for the term of the cutting permit to provide cost certainty to forest licence holders.

Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, has released the following statement about the BC Coroners Service report on monthly illicit drug toxicity deaths for May 2020:“Last month, a staggering 170 people lost their lives because of an illegal drug supply that’s more toxic and poisoned than ever. This is truly devastating to all of us. The impact of this tremendous loss is felt in communities and families in every corner of our province and in deeply profound ways. Each person was a light to the people in their world and now that light has tragically gone out. We mourn with each and every family of those we have lost to this terrible crisis. “Before COVID-19, there was so much more to do, but we were heading in the right direction. The overdose death rate was coming down in B.C., and the evidence told us that our collective efforts were making a difference. The rapid scale up and distribution of naloxone and increased access to overdose prevention services (OPS) and treatment showed, through the BC Centre for Disease Control, that we had averted more than 6,000 deaths since the crisis began.“Yet, with the immense pressure of two public health emergencies, so many unprecedented factors are bearing down swiftly on us all at once. Borders are closed and the usual illegal supply chains are disrupted, leading to drugs that are more toxic than ever. Unemployment, social isolation, declining mental health and increased alcohol and substance use are also the reality for so many right now.“In the past three months, we have taken significant steps to begin separating people from the even more poisoned and toxic drug supply and protect people who are using alone. By providing safe prescription alternatives, we are saving lives and connecting people to more treatment and health supports.“Next week, we are launching a 24/7 helpline for prescribers and pharmacists that will provide live, in-the-moment support to doctors, pharmacists and nurse practitioners while they are treating patients with opioid use disorder and considering prescribing safe prescription alternatives to the toxic drug supply.“We’ve supported overdose prevention and supervised consumption sites to remain open under new COVID-19 protocols. We have launched the new Lifeguard app to help protect people who are having to use alone right now.“We are continuing to redouble our efforts, but we need all British Columbians to join us to protect our loved ones at risk of overdose. When it comes to COVID-19, we’ve seen what a difference that each of us has made, coming together to do our part. Now more than ever, as we face two unprecedented public health emergencies, we must harness our collective efforts, our compassion and resolve, so that families don’t have to keep suffering unimaginable and preventable losses.   “Today I am appealing to anyone who is reading this message. If you use illicit drugs, those drugs are incredibly toxic and even more poisoned than before. I am asking each of you to have a plan. Buddy up so you’re not using poisoned drugs alone. Use the Lifeguard app – it will signal for help if you need it. Continue to visit OPS and supervised consumption services sites. They are open and are essential services in B.C.“Carry naloxone. You can pick up your kit free at any pharmacy. Know the signs of an overdose so someone can call 911 to get help right away.“Addictions and substance use challenges are very complex, with underlying social, economic and personal factors. Not everyone is on the same path, but everyone needs our compassion and a chance to live and to thrive.“I am deeply grateful to each and every person who puts their blood, sweat and tears into helping and caring for people at risk of overdose. This has been a long and painful road. I know how unbearable these losses are for you and I am immensely grateful for your heroic efforts under very challenging circumstances.   “Let’s talk about how to stay safe. Let’s look out for one another. Let’s take care of each other. Let’s come together as a province to save lives from overdose.”A backgrounder follows.

The BC Coroners Service has published updated reports on illicit drug toxicity deaths and fentanyl-detected drug deaths to the end of May 2020.The 170 illicit drug toxicity deaths reported in May mark the highest monthly total ever in British Columbia.“It is both sad and deeply frustrating to see the number of illicit drug deaths reach a new high in B.C. four years after the declaration of a public health emergency,” said Lisa Lapointe, chief coroner. “Despite the many collective efforts directed at this crisis, the toxic drug supply continues to take the lives of our family members, friends and colleagues.“We still know that illicit drug toxicity death rates in B.C. remain the highest for any jurisdiction in Canada, and every region in B.C. has been impacted. That said, were it not for the dedicated efforts taken to date, the death toll would be higher. We must continue to build on further access to safe supply in B.C. and for a regulated, evidence-based, supportive treatment and recovery system as important pillars in preventing future deaths.”The illicit drug toxicity death total of 170 for May 2020 surpasses the previous high of 161 reported in December 2016. British Columbia has recorded three consecutive months with over 100 illicit drug toxicity deaths.“The number of people who we’ve lost – not this past month, but over the past four years – is unfathomable and heartbreaking,” said Guy Felicella, peer clinical advisor with BC Centre on Substance Use and the provincial Overdose Emergency Response Centre. “More British Columbians died of overdose in one month than died in the whole first wave of COVID-19. All British Columbians should collectively share our grief and urge action to improve access to safer supply so people can get the help they need.”There have been 554 illicit drug deaths to date in 2020 in British Columbia.“These tragic deaths are a potent reminder that we must persevere with the many interventions in place and continue in our efforts to reduce harm and stigma, stop overdoses and care for people with addiction,” said Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer. “The overdose crisis is taking a toll on families and communities across this province, and we know the second public health emergency of COVID-19 is adding additional challenges. There is no simple solution, but we remain committed to doing all we can to support people who use drugs, as well as their families, friends and loved ones.”Post-mortem toxicology testing data published in this most recent report suggest an increase in the number of cases with extreme fentanyl concentrations in April and May 2020 compared with previous months.“The drug supply is unpredictable and highly toxic, and has led to a sustained increase in fatal and non-fatal overdoses from smoking and injection in recent months,” said Dr. Jane Buxton, harm reduction lead for the BC Centre for Disease Control. “COVID-19 has added challenges and people may be feeling more isolated and anxious, but it’s important to continue to buddy up, or access local overdose prevention and supervised consumption services during this time.”Other key findings of these drug death reports, based on preliminary data, include:
In May 2020, there were 170 suspected illicit drug toxicity deaths. This represents a 93% increase over the number of deaths in May 2019 (88) and a 44% increase over the number of deaths in April 2020 (118).
In April and May 2020, approximately 19% of cases had extreme fentanyl concentrations (exceeding 50ug/L) as compared to 9% between January 2019 and March 2020.
The townships experiencing the highest number of illicit drug toxicity deaths in 2020 are Vancouver, Surrey and Victoria.
The Northern Health Authority has the highest rate of illicit drug toxicity deaths (32 deaths per 100,000 individuals), followed by Vancouver Coastal Health Authority (29 deaths per 100,000) in 2020. Overall, the rate in B.C. is 26 deaths per 100,000 in 2020.
In 2020, 70% of those dying were aged 19 to 49, and males accounted for 80% of deaths this year to date.
In 2020, 85% of illicit drug toxicity deaths occurred inside and 13% occurred outside.
No deaths have been reported at supervised consumption or drug overdose prevention sites.
Quick Facts:
The BC Centre for Disease Control recently posted an alert on increased drug toxicity reported throughout B.C. with spikes in fatal and non-fatal overdose events through smoking and injecting.
The Provincial Health Services Authority launched its new Lifeguard app to help prevent overdoses last month, a made-in-B.C. resource to reduce risk for people who use substances.
According to BC Emergency Health Services, paramedics respond to an average of 2,000 overdose calls per month in British Columbia. There have been no significant changes in that overdose call volume in 2020, aside from a slight increase in May (just over 2,300 calls).

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are announcing 12 new cases who have tested positive for COVID-19, for a total of 2,680 cases in British Columbia.“There are 185 active cases of COVID-19 in the province and 2,328 people who tested positive have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 12 individuals are hospitalized, four of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 911 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,378 in the Fraser Health region, 130 in the Island Health region, 195 in the Interior Health region and 66 in the Northern Health region.“There have been no new COVID-19 related deaths, for a total of 167 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There has been one new outbreak at Holy Family Hospital, a long-term care facility in Vancouver. In total, five long-term care or assisted-living facilities continue to have active outbreaks.“There have been no new community outbreaks, and public health teams are providing support for the six ongoing community outbreaks.“Through our active surveillance and testing, we have recently identified two community clusters of COVID-19 associated with large family connections.“This tells us that our public health teams are quickly identifying new cases. It also tells us that while our overall provincial cases may be low, COVID-19 is active and spreading in our communities.“When you bring households together, regardless of how many people that may include, everyone brings their own risk with them and the potential for spreading COVID-19 increases.“This is why fewer faces and bigger spaces needs to continue to be our guidepost for how we move forward.“If you are someone who works in our health-care system, someone for whom essential travel is required or live in the same household with essential workers, it is very important to continue to limit your other social interactions so you don’t spread the risk around.“Anyone coming across our border from the United States is coming from a high-risk area and needs to take full precautions to avoid inadvertently spreading the virus to your family or community in Canada.“If you are returning from university elsewhere in Canada, it is important to monitor yourself closely for symptoms, as some other parts of Canada are also experiencing community clusters and spread.“A COVID-19 test when you are asymptomatic is ineffective and is not your passport to increase your social circle. Following all of the rules for safe physical distancing and wearing a cloth mask when you can’t keep those distances is.“Monitor, manage and modify are going to be the keys to managing COVID-19, by keeping our communities safe and protecting the ones we care for most.” Learn More:The latest modelling presentation and information is available online: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/modelling-projectionsFor more information about BC’s Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/restartbcFor B.C.’s surgical renewal plan, visit:

The B.C. government has formally extended the provincial state of emergency, allowing Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, to continue to use extraordinary powers under the Emergency Program Act to support the Province's COVID-19 pandemic response.“As we continue to slowly and carefully reopen our economy, British Columbians are starting to see aspects of normal life return. But it's important to remember that we’re not out of the woods yet,” said Premier John Horgan. “There are a lot of people, businesses and communities that continue to need a hand right now, and the extension of this state of emergency helps us do that.”The state of emergency is extended through the end of the day on June 23, 2020, allowing government to continue to take the necessary steps to keep British Columbians safe.“Under the provincial state of emergency, our government continues to address the variety of needs throughout British Columbia in response to COVID-19,” Farnworth said. “We’ve been working with communities throughout this crisis, and the provincial state of emergency helps ensure our efforts continue in a mindful and co-ordinated way.”Actions taken in the previous two weeks to support British Columbians include:
strengthening the federal commercial rent program by issuing a new order that protects B.C. businesses that are eligible for rent support from commercial evictions due to unpaid rent payments through to the end of June 2020;
more than 157,000 students returning to school on the first day of an optional return to in-class instruction for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year;
launching a new online resource to showcase current job vacancies in agriculture, while providing farmers, seafood businesses and food processors with a one-stop shop to support their hiring and planning needs;
expanding the air quality alert subscription service beyond email notifications to allow people to receive real-time air quality advisories and smoky skies bulletins by text;
investing $7.5 million through Creative BC for Amplify BC, a program to help B.C.’s music industry to create and operate during the pandemic;
providing an additional $250,000 to support industry-led Buy BC activities focused on e-commerce, for a total of $550,000 under government’s Buy BC Partnership Program;
providing temporary relief to hospitality licensees who have had to suspend their operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as licensees are allowed to sell their existing liquor stock to other licensees who are still operating and private liquor stores;
beginning to assess courthouses and courtrooms throughout the province to ensure they meet the health and safety requirements established by the provincial health officer and WorkSafeBC; and
providing an additional $250,000, for a total of $550,000 to support B.C. farmers and processors to move online.
The extension of the provincial state of emergency is based on recommendations from B.C.’s health and emergency management officials. Farnworth made the original declaration on March 18, 2020, after Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, declared a public health emergency the previous day.Quick Facts:
Declarations of provincial states of emergency may be issued by the minister responsible under the Emergency Program Act.
The provincial government can extend the period of a declaration made by the minister responsible for further periods of up to 14 days at a time.
During the 2017 wildfire season, the province was in a provincial state of emergency for 10 weeks from July 7 to Sept. 15.

British Columbians will be able to get back to playing sports sooner with the Province’s action to protect amateur sport organizations from COVID-19 liabilities, provided they are complying with public health orders and provincial sport guidelines.Government has created a ministerial order that protects amateur sport organizations, their employees and volunteers from liability. “We want to make sure children and their families can get the benefits of physical activity and get back to playing the sports they love,” said Lisa Beare, Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture. “Many sports organizations are run by volunteers who need to make sure they are protected for risks related to COVID-19. This order will help cover that risk so people can safely get back to playing sports sooner in their communities.”Provincial and local sport organizations have identified challenges with obtaining adequate insurance as a result of the pandemic. Most insurance companies are not providing coverage for COVID-19 related damages, meaning many amateur sports were unable to provide sport programming during the pandemic.The ministerial order protects amateur sport organizations and their representatives from damages resulting, directly or indirectly, from COVID-19 for amateur sports. For example, a sports organization or its representatives will not be liable for a participant in their sports program being exposed to COVID-19 as a result of participation. That liability protection would be in place as long as they follow applicable guidance, such as viaSport’s Return to Sport protocols and public-health guidance on how to prevent the spread of the virus. This guidance includes encouraging proper handwashing, regular disinfecting, limiting shared equipment, physical distancing measures and the use of wellness questionnaires and health self-assessment tools.""We are thrilled that sport is making its return in the province. Today's announcement is welcome news for our partners in the amateur sport sector,” said Charlene Krepiakevich, CEO of viaSport. “This co-ordinated response to address concerns around volunteer and staff liability means that these not-for-profit organizations can focus on delivering safe, high-quality sport experiences for the people in their communities.""Quick Facts:
There are 72 funded provincial sport organizations and 4,100 local sport organizations with over 800,000 youth and adult participants throughout B.C.
ViaSport British Columbia is a not-for-profit organization created with the support of the provincial government in 2011 to lead the province’s sport sector to build a stronger, more effective system that brings more families to the field of play, more fans into the stands, more athletes to the podium and more sports events to the province.

Two new supportive housing buildings will provide more than 100 rooms in Surrey, providing homes for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness.Construction is scheduled to begin in July 2020 on Guildford Place, located at 14706 104 Ave. Guildford Place will consist of 61 permanent studio units, each with a private washroom and kitchen. The building will include a commercial kitchen, dining and lounge areas, storage and amenity space, laundry and a medical room. Construction for Guildford Place is expected to be complete by May 2021, with residents moving in soon after.“The need for safe, secure housing has never been more important,” said Gary Begg, MLA for Surrey-Guildford. “We are taking urgent action with our partners to provide more supportive homes because we’ve seen how successful this type of housing has been for helping people move forward with their lives.”In addition, BC Housing and the City of Surrey have identified a site for another supportive housing building. Located at 13620 80 Ave., the building will consist of 40 homes for people experiencing homelessness in the community.“Our community is safer and healthier when people have housing and the supports they need,” said Harry Bains, MLA for Surrey-Newton. “These new homes are another step forward in reducing homelessness in Surrey and making sure people have a place to call their own.”BC Housing intends to submit a temporary use permit application for the 80th Avenue site to the City of Surrey later in June. If approved, construction will begin by September 2020. Details about the project will be mailed directly to local residents and businesses and posted online: https://letstalkhousingbc.ca/surreyBoth projects are part of a commitment between the Province and the City of Surrey to deliver 250 permanent supportive modular homes to replace the current temporary sites in the community. The first project as part of this commitment, Peterson Place, is under construction: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020MAH0058-000920""Today’s announcement is another step in the right direction to provide safe and supportive housing for our city’s most vulnerable,” said Doug McCallum, mayor, City of Surrey. “These projects will ensure residents have a roof over their head and the necessary support services in place as they transition off the streets. These projects are an illustration of what can be accomplished when various levels of government and organizations work together to end the cycle of homelessness. I commend everyone who has been involved in bringing these projects to realization.” Phoenix Drug and Alcohol Recovery and Education Society will operate the 80th Avenue site and provide residents with 24/7 on-site staff and support services, including meal programs, life and employment skills training, health and wellness support services and opportunities for volunteer work. Lookout Housing and Health Society will operate Guildford Place and will provide similar services.“The Phoenix Society is excited to be working with BC Housing and the City of Surrey to deliver 40 new homes in Surrey,” said Keir Macdonald, CEO, Phoenix Society. “This is an important step in advancing the continuum of care for those experiencing homelessness and will provide residents with many of the supports they need to get back on their feet.”Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:
The Province will provide $15.9 million to the Guildford project as part of the Homelessness Action Plan, $100,000 in one-time startup costs and an annual ongoing operating subsidy of $1.1 million.
The Province will provide details on funding for the 80th Avenue site as the project moves closer to construction.
The City of Surrey provided the land for both projects.
The Province has worked with partners to open 161 supportive homes for people experiencing homelessness in Surrey over the last two years. An additional 330 supportive homes, including the Guildford and Newton sites, are underway.
Over 3,000 spaces in hotels, motels and community centres throughout B.C. have been secured for vulnerable people to reside during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Surrey, BC Housing has secured 206 spaces to date for vulnerable people in the community.

Growth in total number of classes
There are 77,015 classes in B.C. public schools this school year – 0.26% more than the year before and 14.7% more than there were in 2015-16.
For three years in a row, B.C. students have had some of the smallest class sizes in over a decade, as well as more educators and other supports in classes.
There are now 34% fewer classes with more than 30 students than four years ago.
During the 2019-20 school year, the average class sizes were:
18 in kindergarten;
19.5 in grades 1 to 3;
23.3 in grades 4 to 7; and
22.4 in grades 8 to 12.

The majority of classes with more than 30 students are classes such as choir, drama and physical education.
Since 2015-16, average class sizes are down 9% for kindergarten and 11% for grades 1 to 3.
Since 2015-16, class sizes are down 10% for grades 4 to 7 and 4% for grades 8 to 12.
Growth in education funding and in-class supports
Total education funding for the 2019-20 school year is $6.7 billion.
Over three years, Budget 2020 invests nearly $2.2 billion more for B.C.’s schools than Budget 2017.
Overall, education funding has risen by 19.4% since 2016-17, while enrolment has grown by 3.4%.
Government has invested over $400 million annually for direct services for kids.
This includes more than 4,200 new teaching positions, 700 special education teachers and 190 more teacher psychologists and counsellors.

There are about 9,082 (46%) more classes with an education assistant (EA) than in 2015-16.
EAs provide direct support to students and teachers in class, often providing one-on-one support for students with special needs.

This school year, there are more than 35,000 full-time teaching positions – an increase of 19% over 2015-16.
Students in special needs categories make up 11.8% of the total student population this school year – 0.4% higher than the year before.
Education funding has increased along with this growth. Next school year, school districts will receive an estimated $627.4 million to support students with special needs, a $162.8-million (35%) increase since 2016-17.
With an additional $133.4 million in operating funding flowing to public schools in 2020-21, and $151.1 million to fund the recently signed collective agreement with teachers, the ministry is creating more equity and stability in the system to support students.
47% of all K-12 classes included at least one English language learner (ELL) this school year, compared to 48% last school year.
Funding to support ELLs is increasing to an estimated $104.1 million next year, a 24% increase compared to 2016-17.
Government provided $1.2 million to complete an additional 438 assessments of children with autism last year, to ensure they could access the services they need in school.
Inclusion and special education
The Ministry of Education focuses on ensuring all students have an equitable and inclusive learning environment.
This school year, 82% of all K-12 classes include at least one student with a designated special need.
The majority of K-12 classes include between one and three students with a designated special need maintained from last school year (54% in 2019-20 compared to 55% in 2019-20 and 52% in 2016-17).
The percentage of K-12 classes that include between four and seven students with a designated special need has been consistent over the past several school years (28% in 2019-20 compared to 23% in 2017-18 and 25% in 2016-17).
Only 7% of all classes include seven or more students with a designated special need, unchanged from the last school year and a 1% decrease from 2016-17. The majority of these classes are in grades 5 to 12, and most are special education or applied learning skills classes specifically catering to students with diverse needs.
While the proportion of students with special needs is consistent over the past two years, it has increased slightly over the past 20 years.
These increases are a result of more students being diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, learning disabilities and serious mental illness. An increase in diagnosis means more students are receiving extra support in the classroom.
Every student who receives a diagnosis has an individual education plan (IEP) developed in collaboration with teachers, school staff, parents and the student.
IEPs set unique educational goals for students, ensuring increased services and supports are in place to help them reach those goals.

Momentum continues on improved student outcomes
Outcomes for students with special needs in B.C. show steady improvements.
Completion rates were 72.4% last school year, up from 45.6% 10 years ago.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are providing case updates for three 24-hour reporting periods.“In the first reporting period from June 5 to June 6, we had 14 new cases. In the second reporting period from June 6 to June 7, we had six cases and in the last 24 hours we have had a further nine cases.“This represents 29 new cases who have tested positive for COVID-19 and one new epi-linked case since we reported on Friday, for a total of 2,659 cases in British Columbia.“There are 183 active cases of COVID-19 in the province and 2,309 people who tested positive have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 16 individuals are hospitalized, four of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 907 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,362 in the Fraser Health region, 130 in the Island Health region, 195 in the Interior Health region and 65 in the Northern Health region. The number of cases in the Vancouver Coastal Health region has been adjusted to reflect a reporting error.“There have been no new COVID-19 related deaths, for a total of 167 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks and the outbreak at the New Vista Society has now been declared over. In total, four long-term care or assisted-living facilities continue to have active outbreaks.“There have been no new community outbreaks and the outbreaks at Fraser Valley Specialty Poultry and Superior Poultry have also been declared over. Public health teams are providing support for the six ongoing community outbreaks.“As we continue to slowly and thoughtfully ease restrictions, British Columbians are making plans for summer travel. Like other activities during our COVID-19 pandemic, summer holidays and travel will be different this year.“We encourage British Columbians to be respectful of the communities you plan to visit and be safe as you enjoy the many beautiful locations throughout our province.“When you hit the open roads this summer, you are not leaving COVID-19 behind. The precautions you take at home should also be taken when you are away.“Contact the local tourism association or Chamber of Commerce to find out what services are available and what may still be closed. Be as self-sufficient as possible to avoid putting an additional burden on smaller communities.“Like all of us, B.C.’s communities are doing what is best for them. Some towns and regions who rely on tourism are eager to welcome B.C. visitors with safety measures in place, while others who are challenged to support large numbers are asking visitors to keep their stays short.“Be understanding of those who may be coming to your community. A visitor may be travelling for work or needing to travel to provide care to a family member. Our circumstances are unique, but our efforts to keep our loved ones and our communities safe are shared.“We can all enjoy this summer safely. Let’s protect our province by protecting each other, while showing kindness, compassion and respect.”Learn More:The latest modelling presentation and information is available online: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/modelling-projectionsFor more information about BC’s Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/restartbcFor B.C.’s surgical renewal plan, visit:

A library renewal project at Coast Mountain College (CMTN) in Terrace will create construction-related jobs for regional businesses and tradespeople.A $4.4-million capital investment by government is expected to support work that will employ dozens of local tradespeople, from carpenters and electricians to plumbers and heating, cooling, ventilation and air-conditioning specialists who will be needed to complete the project.“In these challenging times, our government is working to ensure that we are doing everything possible to support British Columbians in every part of the province,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “The library renewal project at Coast Mountain College is a long-term investment that will give students dedicated spaces to study and learn and will also provide immediate, well-paying construction work for tradespeople in Terrace. The inclusion of Indigenous design and child-friendly spaces will guarantee a welcoming and inclusive building for generations to come.”Work to renew and refurbish the flood-damaged Spruce Building on the college’s main campus is expected to begin this summer. In addition to providing students with better access to learning supports, the renewal work will bring the building up to current code standards and improve accessibility for users, along with energy efficiency, air quality and comfort for occupants.“The library renewal is a very exciting project for our Terrace students who have been accessing library services from a smaller, temporary location since the flood in 2018,” said Justin Kohlman, president, Coast Mountain College. “The new space will not only reflect Indigenous ways of learning and knowing, it will give students and instructors a modern and comfortable space for study, teaching and learning.”The project design team worked with Coast Mountain’s First Nations Council and sought the input of students to design space that supported the college’s First Nations students in its function and reflection of local First Nations culture. The design includes an Indigenous reading circle crafted from local cedar. The wood ceiling design represents the Skeena river watershed.The new space will include informal learning spaces that will give students flexible technology-enabled work areas for collaboration, quiet study and research. In addition, it will feature a lab where students can attend non-credit workshops, such as career advising, research methods, resumé writing or receive peer-to-peer tutoring. A designated reading area for children will enable student parents to care for their children and continue to study.“I think it is really important for the success of students to have adequate places to study. I think it is important to support student success to have a child-friendly environment as well,” said Fawn Wightman, a social services worker, student and mother of three. “The library is where we study, research, have meetings, meet with instructors and/or tutors and get help from our wonderful librarians. I am happy for the students who are going to enjoy a new and much-needed place to study.”The Spruce Building was built as a classroom block in the 1970s, with a library in the basement. The loss of a dedicated library space after flooding affected the college’s ability to deliver library services, such as learning, technology and research support. Staff who normally work in the library were moved to other areas of the campus, including a temporary pop-up library in the campus’s Cedar Building common area.Learn More:For more information on Coast mountain College, visit: https://www.coastmountaincollege.ca/A backgrounder follows.

More than 157,000 kindergarten to Grade 12 students, representing nearly 30% of B.C.’s total school population, were back in classrooms during the first week of the province’s gradual return to schools for in-class instruction under new health and safety guidelines.""B.C. is fortunate to be in a position where we can welcome students and staff back to schools in greater numbers under the guidance of public health experts who have put in stringent and thorough health and safety measures that make it safe to do so,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “The opportunity for part-time in-class instruction between teachers, support staff and students has been welcomed by families who have exercised that choice.“And those connections have been valuable for a significant number of B.C. families. We value the collaborative approach with school districts, education unions, principals and vice-principals, parent organizations and WorkSafeBC all working together to keep schools safe for students and staff, now and into the future.” As of June 1, all kindergarten to Grade 5 students have the option to attend school half-time, while students in grades 6 to 12 can attend school the equivalent of one day a week. Students attending schools are limited to current density targets of 50% for kindergarten to Grade 5, and 20% for grades 6 to 12. Children of essential service workers and students who need additional support are still welcome to attend schools full-time this month.“Boards of education have made extraordinary efforts in every district to ensure a smooth return to in-class learning,” said Stephanie Higginson, president, BC School Trustees Association. “The stories from students who attended school last week are overwhelmingly positive with expressions of joy at being able to see friends and teachers. Staff have worked hard to implement health and safety protocols in every school. Parents and students can be confident that districts are following the best public health advice to ensure a safe learning environment for everyone.”All B.C. school districts have publicly available health and safety plans that reinforce the guidelines set out by B.C.’s provincial health officer, WorkSafeBC and the Ministry of Education.If families change their minds about in-class learning, they are asked to contact their child’s school as soon as possible so the school can plan to support the child.Learn More:Students, parents, guardians and teachers can find health and safety guidelines, learning resources and accurate, timely information about schools, programs and educational services, including regularly updated frequently asked questions, online: http://www.gov.bc.ca/SafeSchools/Parents and families are encouraged to access resources that support students learning from home: https://www.openschool.bc.ca/keeplearning/To find a local school district, visit: http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/schools/bcmap.htm

Sarah Lapp-Bourne is a dance artist who uses a power wheelchair. She is also a dance facilitator, a choreographer and a mentor in inclusive dance.Lapp-Bourne always wanted to be a dancer. She enjoys the process of memorizing choreography, keeping her mind and body alive and active. As she puts it, “Dancing is an expressive outlet for me to share meaningful stories with a viewing audience.”As a child, Lapp-Bourne started exploring creative ways to move alongside her peers in gym class by designing her own dance routines. Over the years and under her own initiative, she was able to find additional opportunities by attending conventional dance classes and adapting the movement.In 2014, Lapp-Bourne co-founded the Vancouver All Bodies Dance Project, an inclusive dance company that brings together artists of all abilities to explore creative possibilities.“Until All Bodies Dance was formed, consistent programming was not available to me. It has become my mission and career goal to implement sustainable and year-round inclusive dance programs throughout B.C.,” Lapp-Bourne said. “People with disabilities rarely get the chance to move their bodies in a creative way.”In 2018, she brought All Dance Bodies to Kelowna. “With a grant from Disability Alliance BC and the Province in 2019, I was able to continue facilitating local classes with dance studio owner Lucy Hazelwood. Our teaching team provides examples from the perspective of a standing body and a sitting body.”Her current project is Exploration Dance Kelowna, and anyone is welcome. The aim is to bring together people with and without disabilities to explore movement and create. “We strive to provide an open, safe and fun environment, where everyone can experience the joy of moving and creating within a diverse community. I am excited to be creating more opportunities for artistic activities that promote healthy and inclusive lifestyles in the Okanagan.”One of the dancers in Lapp-Bourne and Hazelwood’s classes has severe rheumatoid arthritis. “I never thought I’d be able to participate in a dance class,” Rachael Kimola said. “I always thought in order to dance, you had to be able to move a certain way, but Exploration Dance is about doing what you can and just enjoying movement in whatever form it takes for you. It’s very freeing.”When asked about classes during COVID-19, Lapp-Bourne said, “Like most community projects, it was difficult to move from an interactive group, working together, to then having to navigate keeping the project going while being physically distant in a field that is about creativity and connection.”In April and May, they took classes online. “Not only did our local participants join us through video conferencing, but it provided an opportunity for anyone to join us – no matter where they live. This pandemic has closed a lot of physical doors for our program, but it has also opened up many virtual opportunities to reach a broader group of participants and even audiences. We look forward to our next session in the fall when people can come together in person and virtually to create some unique dances.”All Bodies Dance Kelowna is one of 16 organizations funded by the Province last year to celebrate AccessAbility Week.In recognition of AccessAbility Week, May 31 to June 6, 2020, the B.C. government is highlighting some of the individuals and organizations that provide important services to people with disabilities.Learn More:B.C. government accessibility initiatives: www.gov.bc.ca/accessibilityAll Bodies Dance: http://allbodiesdance.caB.C.

Cooper Quinn is always looking for opportunities to help people experience the joy of mountain biking.A long-time mountain biking enthusiast and president of the North Shore Mountain Bike Association (NSMBA), Quinn typically hits the local trails three times a week to clear his mind and let the rest of the world fade away. Mount Seymour Provincial Park is one of his favourite places to ride.Seeing a need for more outdoor recreation opportunities for people with mobility challenges, the NSMBA approached BC Parks in 2018 with a proposal to make an existing trail loop, which partially runs through Mount Seymour Provincial Park, more accessible for adaptive mountain bikes, youth, families and beginners. Quinn was thrilled when parks staff jumped on board.“There are limited opportunities for beginners or adaptive mountain bikers in North Vancouver since most of the terrain around here is quite challenging. We want to build trails for the enjoyment of the whole community,” said Quinn. The NSMBA received $5,000 from the Park Enhancement Fund (PEF) for the project that began in the winter of 2018 and is nearing completion.  More than 200 volunteers have worked on the project, which includes a new hiking-only path to separate mountain bikers from hikers on a downhill section of the multi-use trail. The project focused on sustainability and reducing environmental impacts from the trail. All that’s left is a bit of work to meet trail standards for adaptive mountain biking.“The Park Enhancement Fund was really the catalyst to get the project off the ground and moving forward,” Quinn said. “It was a significant amount of work, but our volunteers are incredibly dedicated.”BC Parks is making $240,000 available this year for volunteer and other community-led projects that support conservation and recreation. Volunteers and community groups can apply for up to $5,000 per project for 2020-21. Each of the six BC Parks regions has been allocated $20,000 to support conservation projects and $20,000 to support recreation projects. In past years, funding has gone to projects that include controlling invasive species, gathering conservation data and installing interpretive signage, as well as building huts, docks and trails.Pamela Wright, with the Ecosystem Science and Management Program at the University of Northern British Columbia, has used PEF funding to restore private land that was returned to Eskers Provincial Park. This land is located 40 kilometres northwest of Prince George.What was a hay pasture filled with invasive species is being transformed into a diverse forest with a variety of trees donated by local nurseries and forestry companies, and planted by volunteers. The volunteers have built wildlife habitat structures like bat boxes and nesting boxes, a bridge over a stream and a permanent trail around the perimeter of the field.“It’s a good way to demonstrate restoration in a place that people can see and also do it in a climate-forward way,” said Wright. “We have increased recreation use in that area because people enjoy getting onto the trail. It’s nice to see the area making a change in that ecosystem.”The $240,000 is made available annually through PEF, which supports volunteer initiatives, ecological monitoring and research projects that enhance provincial parks or the services offered in them. Interested volunteers and community groups must submit a project proposal by June 26, 2020. Projects will be chosen in early July, with projects to be completed by March 31, 2021.Learn More:For more information, including criteria, deadlines and how to apply for a grant from the PEF, visit:

To help more lower-income British Columbians, people expecting children and seniors gain access to healthy, locally grown food, the Province has provided approximately $1.88 million in funding to the BC Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program.The funds were provided to the BC Association of Farmers’ Markets (BCAFM) to support the BC Farmers’ Market Nutrition Coupon Program throughout the province. The program provides coupons for lower-income households to purchase fresh, healthy, local food at B.C. farmers markets.

“Our government continues to support families and local farmers and producers as the demand for food programs has increased during this COVID-19 pandemic,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “This coupon program helps improve the health and well-being of British Columbians and builds a sense of community by encouraging people to buy nutritious B.C.-grown food from local farmers and producers. “Over this year, an additional 600 households, or approximately 1,800 individuals, will benefit from the weekly coupon program during the farmers market season.”In total, the coupon program is expected to benefit over 6,000 households and reach approximately 18,000 individuals in 2020. This is a 300% increase from when the program started in 2012.“Partnering with the BCAFM on this program promotes healthy eating and helps more people around the province share the amazing community atmosphere and fresh local products at farmers markets,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “Increasing the customer base and involvement at the markets also supports farmers, producers and processers, each of whom are part of B.C.’s growing agricultural industry and food security. This program truly benefits everyone involved.”The Farmers’ Market Nutrition Coupon Program is a healthy-eating initiative that supports farmers markets and strengthens food security throughout British Columbia. This year, the coupon program will run from June 8 to Nov. 15, 2020, at participating farmers markets in approximately 79 B.C. communities. Families and individuals will be able to use the coupons to make online purchases at 64 farmers markets.“The Farmers’ Market Nutrition Coupon Program has been a powerful food security tool over the years,” said Vickey Brown, president, BCAFM. “This year, the impacts of this program will be even more important. Both farmers and consumers are struggling through COVID-19 pandemic disruptions. Weekly access to healthy food via farmers markets will be a big help in getting healthy local food to the vulnerable folks in our communities. Farmers who are suffering the impacts of market disruptions because of COVID-19 will benefit from the reliable income that the nutrition coupons provide. We are always grateful to the ministries for their support of the Farmers’ Market Nutrition Coupon Program, and that appreciation has grown during this challenging time.”The program is run by community organizations provincewide. Eligible recipients receive $21 worth of coupons per week for 16 weeks to help them purchase local food, including vegetables, fruits, nuts, eggs, dairy, herbs, meat and fish.Guided by the provincial health officer, farmers markets are continuing to operate in B.C. using physical distancing, including cashless payment options and enhanced food handling and hygiene measures. BCAFM is also helping provide consumers with locally grown and prepared food products through a new online platform, with many farmers markets connected virtually to serve their communities.Learn More:For a list of all participating famers markets for the 2020 season, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.06.05_BG_Farmers_Market_Nutrition_Coupon_Program.pdfFor more information on the BC Farmers’ Market Nutrition Coupon Program or to locate a farmers market in a nearby community, visit: www.bcfarmersmarket.orgFor more information about the BC Farmers’ Market Trail, visit: https://bcfarmersmarkettrail.com/For more information about how farmers and local food companies can access provincial supports, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020AGRI0023-001022B.C. farmers markets online shopping options: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020AGRI0014-000569A backgrounder follows.

The Province is extending a temporary ministerial order until Dec. 31, 2020, to continue to allow health-care workers and other public sector staff to use communication tools not normally permitted for use during the COVID-19 state of emergency.On March 26, 2020, Anne Kang, Minister of Citizens’ Services, approved a ministerial order under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIPPA) to temporarily permit the use of vital software and technologies in the public sector that have proven useful in B.C.’s successful efforts to flatten the curve. The order allows:
patient-care teams to use multiple communication tools, including things like smartphones, text messaging, chat programs and other applications during their response to the public-health emergency. This has made it easier to communicate between teams and follow up with patients using virtual platforms;
people in self-isolation to communicate with public health officials using chat apps they are most comfortable with, rather than having to learn how to use something new; and
K-12 schools and post-secondary institutions to provide online and digital learning platforms, so students can continue their studies while gatherings of 50 people or more are prohibited.
British Columbia has the strictest privacy and data-residency laws in Canada. It is one of two provinces with legislation requiring the personal information of its citizens to be stored in, and only accessed from, Canada.These leading privacy protections also mean these common communication and collaboration software tools, which are routinely allowed in other provinces and are useful in the fight against COVID-19, are not normally permitted for use by B.C. public-sector staff.Renewing the ministerial order means health-care bodies like the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions and health authorities can continue to use software and technology that has proven useful in their life-saving efforts to protect British Columbians from the spread of COVID-19.The temporary measure also enables schools and post-secondary institutions to provide increased online learning opportunities for students who may be displaced or unable to attend in-person classes.The protection of privacy is a priority for the B.C. government. The Province will continue to work with the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner to either rescind or renew the order, depending on the pandemic landscape in December 2020.Quick Facts:
FOIPPA makes public bodies more accountable to the public and protects personal privacy by:
giving the public a right of access to records;
giving individuals a right of access to, and a right to request correction of, personal information about themselves;
specifying limited exceptions to the rights of access;
preventing the unauthorized collection, use or disclosure of personal information by public bodies; and
providing for an independent review of decisions made under this act. 

This act does not replace other procedures for access to information or in any way limit access to information that is not personal information and is available to the public.

Families and seniors with lower incomes will soon have access to new, affordable rental homes, with construction underway on a four-unit housing project in the community.The project is the result of a partnership between the Province, the Queen Charlotte Heritage Housing Society, the Gwaii Trust Society, M'akola Development Services and the Aboriginal Housing Management Association (AHMA).“Everyone deserves a safe, secure and affordable home and this project is another step forward in delivering housing for people on Haida Gwaii,” said Jennifer Rice, MLA for North Coast. “Thank you to all of the partners who are working to get this much-needed housing built as quickly as possible.”Located at 302 2nd Ave., the property is owned by the Queen Charlotte Heritage Housing Society. The property was rezoned in 2018 to allow for the conversion of an office building into four rental homes.“The Village of Queen Charlotte council and staff would like to send a heartfelt thanks to everyone involved in helping ensure our community has access to affordable housing,” said Kris Olsen, mayor, Village of Queen Charlotte.The society is receiving $1.2 million from the Province’s Building BC: Community Housing Fund – a $1.9-billion investment over 10 years to build more than 14,000 rental homes for low- to moderate-income families and seniors throughout the province. M’akola Development Service and AHMA also contributed equity funding to the project.Construction started in spring 2020 but stopped for approximately one month due to concerns about COVID-19. Work on the project has resumed and is expected to be complete by the end of August 2020.Monthly rents for the new homes will range from $375 for one bedroom and $570 for two bedrooms.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Greg Martin, chair, Queen Charlotte Heritage Housing Society –“We are very pleased that BC Housing and M’akola are supporting our townhouse development in Queen Charlotte. Affordable housing is in very short supply here on Haida Gwaii and this project will help those who need it most. Many thanks to Minister Selina Robinson, MLA Jen Rice, BC Housing and M’akola for making this a reality.”Kevin Albers, CEO, M’akola Development Services –“M’akola is proud to help support this project that will enhance the lives of families and seniors in the community. Projects like this are a step in the right direction of addressing the importance and need for affordable housing in all communities across British Columbia.”Margaret Pfoh, CEO, AHMA –“AHMA is honoured to be part of this new project with our members at M’akola Group of Societies, Queen Charlotte Heritage Housing Society and the Province. This development is more than just roofs over heads. It brings us closer to truly alleviating the housing challenges that our province’s most vulnerable communities face. We know it will bring positive and meaningful change for the future residents, and AHMA looks forward to welcoming them to our community.”Quick Facts:
Including these homes, the Province is working in partnership to build nearly 50 new affordable homes for people on Haida Gwaii:
four homes for families and seniors
24 on-reserve homes for Indigenous peoples, in partnership with Skidegate Band Council
19 supportive homes for people experiencing homelessness (modular housing project on Oceanview Drive)

Carole James, Minister of Finance, has issued the following statement on the release of Statistics Canada’s Labour Force Survey for May 2020:“The May labour force numbers show some encouraging signs amid a continuing volatile labour market across every sector and in all regions of British Columbia due to COVID-19.“I’m pleased B.C. created 43,300 jobs in the month of May as people shift back into the labour market, but we have a long road ahead of us in our recovery. Total job losses since the pandemic began stand at 353,200 and B.C.’s unemployment rate sits at 13.4%.“Behind the numbers, there are many thousands of families, young people and businesses struggling to make ends meet. That’s why we acted quickly to ensure supports are in place through our COVID-19 Action Plan and why we’re now focused on restarting our economy in a safe way.“To date, more than 510,000 people in B.C. have received the $1,000 BC Emergency Benefit for Workers. Additionally, we’ve worked with the federal government to expand the 75% wage subsidy and protected the hardest-hit businesses from evictions.“As more and more workplaces begin to reopen, there’s reason for increased confidence amongst consumers, which is critical to our recovery. Despite COVID-19 impacts, B.C. is an economic leader in Canada. This, together with people’s exceptional co-operation in managing the health-care crisis, puts us on a solid foundation for economic recovery.“Today’s survey reflects job and employment information that was collected during the week of May 10 to May 16, before B.C.’s gradual reopening had fully begun. In the coming months we hope to see further positive results as our economic recovery begins to take shape.“We will continue to assess the needs of people and businesses through the coming months and build on the relief and recovery programs as necessary.”Learn More:For information on services and benefits available to help people and businesses through the pandemic, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVIDgovernmentbenefitsFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/Covid-19

This week marks the 10th BC Child and Youth in Care Week.In 2011, two youth in care organized to combat stereotypes and stigma about youth in care by celebrating the talents and achievements of their peers. For too many years, former youth in care were set up to fail. For too many years, their voices weren’t heard. The fact is, youth in care are overlooked for their potential. There is often a culture of systemic complacency that sets the bar of expectations too low for these young people. Many youth in care face a lot of adversity. I grew up in the projects of East Vancouver with a single mom who struggled with mental health and addictions. I went to six high schools and was placed in government care. I advocated for my siblings while they were in care and eventually took over guardianship of my youngest brother, all while holding onto hope that one day my mom would sober up and leave her death sentence on the Downtown Eastside. I was groomed for hopelessness but managed to become the first in my family to graduate from high school, college and university. Later in life I learned that my grandparents attended residential school. Many things saved my life, but education was key.I know first-hand the resiliency of former youth in care and their ambition for change. After working in the Office of B.C.’s Representative for Children and Youth for almost a decade with Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, I couldn’t bear to hear any more tragedies. I entered politics in 2016 to disrupt the status quo and drive change for young people who need and deserve a fighting chance at success. On July 18, 2017, Premier John Horgan appointed me as minister of advanced education, skills, and training. I became the first First Nations woman to serve in B.C.’s cabinet, I am Nisga’a Gitxsan, Cree and Ojibway. On Sept. 1, 2017, we announced the Provincial Tuition Waiver Program (PTWP) for former youth in care to attend any of the 25 public post-secondary institutions in B.C. and Native Education College, tuition free. Within six weeks, our government delivered on a key mandate commitment and a promise to improve the education success of former youth in care. It was simply the right thing to do and one of the proudest moments of my life. Today, almost 1,300 former youth in care are walking through the doors of post-secondary education institutions around B.C. They’re attending some of the best colleges and universities in the country: places like Thompson Rivers University, Douglas College and the University of British Columbia. They’re writing a new chapter in their lives. They proudly tell me that they now have a new identity and sense of purpose.Our government will continue to improve conditions for former youth in care to succeed once they leave care, the same way that many parents support their children past the age of 19. We’ve partnered with the United Way to help post-secondary students with living expenses through the Youth Futures Education Fund. My colleague, the Minister of Children and Family Development, Katrine Conroy, has also championed significant changes to the Agreements with Young Adults program to continue opening doors to opportunity.It’s not a coincidence the minister responsible for the PTWP has lived experience as a former youth in care. This progressive public policy was driven by values and advocacy from people who believe in reconciliation in action. The PTWP is about investing in young people who deserve a chance to thrive. Make no mistake, this program’s success relies on young people doing the heavy lifting to succeed in the classroom. They’re smart and ambitious. For the first time in my memory, we are hearing stories of success about former youth in care. They are studying to become teachers, business managers, nurses, web designers, early childhood educators and heavy-duty mechanics. This provincial program was long overdue. We all know that it takes a village to raise a child to reach their full potential. This program is hitting the mark but there is more to do to empower former youth in care.As we celebrate this week, children and youth in care need to know that they are loved. We need to show up for them and support the organizations that help them overcome hurdles and support their aspirations. As the saying goes: A rising tide lifts all canoes. When we lift up and empower children and youth in care, we are helping to heal the wounds and end the cycle that brought them into care in the first place. To all current and former youth in care: Keep defying all odds.

Youth who have aged out of government care and are ready to pursue post-secondary education this fall will have an additional $250,000 from the Youth Futures Education Fund (YFEF) to help them with expenses beyond tuition, such as rent, utilities and groceries.“Students often turn to their parents for support with living expenses while they pursue their post-secondary education dreams. Former youth in care rarely have that option,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training.  “The Youth Futures Education Fund is about providing extra support to ensure former youth in care can focus on their studies to achieve their career ambitions. The fund shines a light on our government and private efforts working in partnership to empower former youth in care to cross the finish line and build a brighter future for themselves.”The fund is used for wraparound financial supports that could also include text books or emergency situations. The funding complements the Provincial Tuition Waiver program, which ensures youth who have aged out of care can attend a post-secondary institution tuition-free. The average amount students receive from YFEF is approximately $1,300.  Students who meet eligibility requirements for the YFEF funding must be using the Provincial Tuition Waiver Program while studying at one of the 25 public post-secondary institutions in B.C. or at the Native Education College.Eligible students, up to their 27th birthday, can also tap into the Agreements with Young Adults program as one more support to help with housing, child care, tuition and health care, while they return to school or attend rehabilitation, vocational or an approved life-skills program.“By working together across ministries, we can increase the level of support available to youth in care and help them pursue post-secondary education by reducing the barriers that many face,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “As BC Child and Youth in Care Week comes to a close, this investment is particularly timely, giving even more youth the opportunity to succeed now and into the future.”YFEF is an application-based program funded in part by the Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training, as well as organizational and private donations. The program is administered by the Vancouver Foundation.Since 2015, almost $2 million has been raised for the fund, with $1 million coming directly from government. Nearly $1.4 million has been distributed to more than 600 students attending college or university on a provincial tuition waiver.“At this unique time in history, the government’s $250,000 contribution has never been more necessary or more appreciated,” said Maureen Young, director of community leadership, Coast Capital, who serves as the interim chair of the Youth Futures Education Fund. “Youth Futures funding is vital to so many former youth from care studying across our province and with the challenges presented by COVID-19, this funding is needed more than ever. We are so grateful to the Province of B.C. for its ongoing commitment to youth from care and for its continued commitment to the Youth Futures Education Fund.”As of February 2020, 1,272 former youth in care have benefited from government breaking down barriers to post-secondary education as a result of implementing the Provincial Tuition Waiver Program.A backgrounder follows.

The Province is providing temporary relief to hospitality licensees who have had to suspend their operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.These licensees will be allowed to sell their existing liquor stock to other licensees who are still operating and/or to private liquor stores.These changes will provide immediate financial relief for licensees unable to meet the guidelines and mandates established by the provincial health officer by allowing them to liquidate some inventory.The temporary authorization from the Liquor Distribution Branch (LDB) was requested by the Business and Technical Advisory Panel, a group of liquor industry leaders, as a way of supporting the industry during the COVID-19 pandemic.This authorization is set to expire on July 15, 2020. However, as the pandemic is an evolving situation, LDB will review this and other temporary authorizations as necessary.Government has introduced other temporary actions in support of the hospitality industry, including authorizing all food-primary and most liquor-primary establishments to sell and deliver sealed, packaged liquor products for off-site consumption alongside the purchase of a meal, and allowing the expansion of service areas and patios so businesses can continue observing the provincial health officer's mandates as they begin to recover from the impact of COVID-19.Learn More:Read LDB’s policy directive here: https://wholesale.bcldb.com/sites/default/files/files/2020-06/Private%20Sale%20of%20Liquor%20During%20COVID19%20Pandemic%20Policy.pdfFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are announcing five new cases, for a total of 2,632 cases in British Columbia. Four additional epi-linked cases have been included in the Island Health and Vancouver Coastal Health region case reporting. ‘Epi-linked’ means that public health investigations have shown that cases meet the case definition for COVID-19 but may not have been tested for a number of reasons. In future reports, new tested and epi-linked cases will be included as one number.“There are 201 active cases of COVID-19 in the province, and 2,265 people who tested positive have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 26 individuals are hospitalized, six of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 909 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,334 in the Fraser Health region, 130 in the Island Health region, 195 in the Interior Health region and 64 in the Northern Health region.“There have been no new COVID-19 related deaths, for a total of 166 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There have been no new health-care outbreaks. In total, six long-term care or assisted-living facilities continue to have active outbreaks.“There has been one new community outbreak with three confirmed cases at the Beresford Warming Centre, a shelter in the Fraser Health region. Public health teams are providing support at the site and for the other seven ongoing community outbreaks.“Today, we shared our latest modelling to show British Columbians where we are in our COVID-19 pandemic and what we are watching for in the B.C. epidemic curve over the coming weeks.“We have seen the incredible work of our provincewide public health teams in action, which is allowing us to quickly identify and contain new clusters and outbreaks.“We have learned we need to stay on our path. The measures we have in place are working and so is the gradual easing of some restrictions. The modelling also shows that to keep our curve flat, we must continue to maintain our slow, thoughtful pace.“Moving forward, our approach is to ‘minimize, manage and modify’: minimize the number of new cases, manage cases and clusters with rapid contact tracing, and modify our measures as needed.“That means assessing your risks with every step and following the rules for safe physical distancing are key. These include always staying home when ill, keeping your number of contacts small and not having large gatherings where the risk for spreading COVID-19 is so much higher.“We know no one intends to pass on the virus. When this happens, it most often affects those we care about the most, so we must do all we can to keep our loved ones, our communities and ourselves safe.“We all have a role to play in our COVID-19 response. What we do today will make a difference tomorrow.”Learn More:The latest modelling presentation and information is available online: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/modelling-projectionsFor more information about BC's Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/restartbcFor B.C.'s surgical renewal plan, visit:

New and improved schools are on the way to better serve Surrey students and families.A brand-new elementary school is coming to the Sunnyside Heights area, while Morgan Elementary and White Rock Elementary are being expanded to provide better learning environments for more students.“Students throughout the Surrey School District are beginning to see the benefits of the new and expanded schools in their communities, and we must keep going if we’re going to meet the sustained growth in this vibrant community,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “These investments in Surrey and White Rock schools mean thousands more students will be learning in the inspiring and engaging environments they deserve for generations to come.”The Government of B.C. is providing $57 million for these three projects, meaning a total of $363 million has been invested in Surrey school capital projects in fewer than three years. Between September 2018 and 2023, nearly 8,700 new student seats will open in Surrey, eliminating the equivalent of nearly 350 portables throughout the district.“We’re pleased that government has made getting students out of portables and back into classrooms a reality in our district,” said Terry Allen, vice-chair, Surrey Board of Education. “This investment will help address the exponential growth our district has been experiencing in many of our South Surrey and White Rock neighbourhoods.”The new, $44-million, 655-seat Sunnyside Heights-area elementary school will be built at 20th Avenue and 165A Street in South Surrey, with $5 million from the Surrey School District, and is expected to be ready for students in fall 2023. It will be built on land purchased in 2019 with $31 million from the Ministry of Education, adding much-needed classroom space to the fast-growing Grandview Heights neighbourhood.Also adding more classroom space in Grandview Heights are a recently completed 300-seat addition at Pacific Heights Elementary, a new Edgewood Drive elementary, an addition at Sunnyside Elementary, a new Douglas-area elementary school and a new Grandview Heights Secondary school.“The Surrey Board of Trade, which has been an ongoing advocate for needed school investments in Surrey, thanks the B.C. government for investing in a new 655-seat elementary school in Sunnyside Heights, 195-seat addition at White Rock Elementary and 190-seat addition at Morgan Elementary,” said Anita Huberman, CEO, Surrey Board of Trade. “Quality education benefits students in Surrey, contributes to healthy communities and enables economic growth for our future workforce.”Adding 190 seats to Morgan Elementary, a $10.4-million project, means there will soon be no need for the five portables at the school. Construction on this addition is expected to be underway in fall 2021 for the new classrooms to be complete in December 2022.The new addition at White Rock Elementary, a $7.6-million investment from the Ministry of Education, will add 195 seats to the K-7 school, increasing capacity to 655 students and reducing the need for portables. Construction is expected to begin on the addition in spring 2021, and for the new classrooms to be ready for students in September 2022.These investments are part of government’s school capital plan to ensure students have safe, positive learning spaces, no matter where they live. In fewer than three years, the Province has announced nearly $2 billion for new and expanded schools, seismic upgrades and replacements, and land purchases for future schools. This includes the creation of nearly 12,400 new student seats at 31 new or expanded schools.There are many more new projects to come in Surrey, with three sites purchased for future schools and seven expansion projects supported for business case development. To continue this momentum, Budget 2020 included a record $2.8 billion for school capital projects to keep adding more classroom space in fast-growing communities throughout B.C.A backgrounder follows.

Indigenous children and youth in government care and former youth in care are entitled to consistent and reliable support at school, home and in their communities, to ensure they get the most out of their school years and are set up for success in life.The First Nations Children and Youth in Care Protocol, signed May 26, 2020, commits the Province and First Nations to work together to engage in dialogue and joint action on specific issues and initiatives, seeking to improve the educational outcomes and well-being of Indigenous children and youth in care, and former youth in care through legislative, policy and practice reform.“Indigenous children in government care deserve to have consistent, culturally relevant support and a close connection to their communities,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “We know that kids thrive when they feel a sense of belonging, and that’s why it’s so important for First Nations communities to be involved in how their children are educated and in what services they receive in school.”Work will include easing transitions into the school system, from grade to grade, and out of the school system to post-secondary or the workforce. The protocol is also intended to ensure supports and services are tailored to the needs of each child and their specific circumstances, in a way that connects them to their language and culture.“This protocol is a key milestone and we are confident that it will provide a strong foundation for our collaborative work to support improved education outcomes for current and former First Nation children and youth in care,” said Tyrone McNeil, president, First Nations Education Steering Committee (FNESC). “We look forward to working with First Nations leadership and the Province to create systemic shifts to achieve this.”While approximately 12% of the student population in B.C. is Indigenous, about 67% of youth in care identify as Indigenous. Indigenous children and youth in government care experience poorer education outcomes than students in the general population. For example, the 2016-17 six-year public school completion rate for Indigenous students in government care in B.C. was 44.1%, while the public school completion rate for all students in B.C. was 83.7%.“Our government is dedicated to providing Indigenous children and youth with the supports they need to succeed,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “That’s why we are working to improve their educational outcomes and well-being and to better address the over-representation of Indigenous youth in care.”This builds on broader government efforts to prioritize children and youth in care throughout their lives, including the post-secondary Tuition Waiver Program, a new K-12 education supplement, supporting Indigenous communities to exercise jurisdiction over Indigenous child welfare, and an increase this year of $5 million in funding to help children and youth in care connect to their culture and heritage as part of Budget 2020.“Indigenous children who have aged out of care now have the opportunity to attend any of the 25 public post-secondary institutions, Native Education College or 10 union trades-training providers tuition-free through the Provincial Tuition Waiver Program,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “This was a call to action from many Indigenous leaders and advocates. This new protocol recognizes that reconciliation is a key pillar to our government and that by working together, we can create more positive conditions for Indigenous children and youth to successfully graduate from high school and pursue their dreams and aspirations through the skilled trades or post-secondary education. Supporting youth in and from care to cross the finish line lifts up our families and communities. As the saying goes, ‘A rising tide lifts all canoes.’ ”  The new protocol commits all signatories to develop a strategic plan and meet twice a year to review progress toward the common goal of addressing systemic barriers facing Indigenous students who are either currently in care and or who have aged out of care.    Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, President of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs, said: “The education and child welfare systems have historically harmed our children and families in devastating ways. We are in a time of change and opportunity, with First Nations exercising self-determination in choosing the path forward and creating the systemic shifts that are necessary. Through the signing of this protocol, the Province has agreed to support that work moving forward. Now it is time to put talk into action.”To ensure programs and supports are reaching the children who need them, an information sharing agreement has also been signed between the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Children and Family Development to track the outcomes of children and youth in care. The information agreement will ensure school districts are able to identify children and youth in care who would benefit from additional supports in a way that respects their privacy and confidentiality. “This protocol presents an incredible opportunity for us to create meaningful changes in the lives of our children and youth and to breathe life into the UN Declaration by having Indigenous peoples guide and lead these changes”, said Lydia Hwitsum, First Nations Summit Task Group member. “This is long overdue, and I look forward to working together to ensure that our children are provided the best possible opportunity to grow and to succeed.” Two backgrounders follow.

Travellers will soon see crews working to further improve safety and efficiency through Salmon Arm, as government continues to move forward with major improvements on Highway 1 to the Alberta border to make life better for people who travel in the region.The tender has been issued for the 1st Avenue SW to 10th Avenue SW four-laning project, which will expand this section of Highway 1 and make it safer for all travellers, including commercial truck drivers.“Our historic investments in infrastructure are helping create jobs in the short term and build safer, more efficient roadways for years to come,” said Catherine McKenna, federal Minister of Infrastructure and Communities. “It’s great to see that this important work in Salmon Arm will be getting under way soon as part of B.C.’s initiative to improve traffic flow and safety on Highway 1 from Kamloops to the Alberta border. We look forward to continuing to work together to build a better, more prosperous British Columbia and Canada.”The pre-load for this segment was completed last year. Once the contract is awarded through an open bidding process, work is expected to begin in fall 2020.“It’s important we keep moving forward on major projects that will spur economic recovery,” said Claire Trevena, B.C.’s Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “This project is delivered under our Community Benefits Agreement and will ensure local workers are employed and that communities will benefit.”Provincial construction sites have protocols and policies in place following the requirements of the provincial health officer to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. These will include reducing in-person meetings or gatherings, holding meetings outdoors and ensuring physical distancing of workers throughout the work day. These measures, along with other work protocols, such as daily cleaning and sanitizing of common areas and surfaces, will help ensure worker and public safety.“As we deliver this project that will keep people and goods moving safely and efficiently, we continue to make working in a safe environment to prevent the spread of COVID-19 our priority,"" Trevena said.Along with widening 2.2 kilometres of Highway 1 to four lanes with concrete median barrier, work on this segment of the Salmon Arm West project will include:
replacement of the Salmon River Bridge;
construction of an interchange with frontage road connections at 1st Avenue SW;
construction of frontage roads to consolidate access to and from Highway 1; and
a multi-use pathway for pedestrians, cyclists and other non-motorized users.
""The City of Salmon Arm is pleased to see the TCH Salmon Arm West project move forward,” said Kevin Flynn, deputy mayor of Salmon Arm. “These improvements will provide increased safety and mobility as well as upgraded access for adjacent businesses. This project will also result in the much anticipated new bridge over the Salmon River. This project will greatly benefit Salmon Arm and the many individuals that travel the highway.""The project is being delivered under the Province’s Community Benefits Agreement, which prioritizes hiring local workers, including Indigenous peoples, women, people with disabilities and other under-represented groups who are qualified to do the work, in a safe, welcoming work environment. This project will help diversify and grow B.C.’s skilled workforce by providing opportunities for Red Seal apprentices to work on site and gain the experience they need to launch careers in the trades.""The Trans-Canada Highway corridor through Salmon Arm is critical to the economies of both B.C. and Canada,"" said Kelly Scott, president, BC Road Builders and Heavy Construction Association.  ""By increasing its capacity and improving safety, we are seeing an investment in our future that will ensure a safe and efficient movement of people and goods. This project is also supporting good paying jobs and training opportunities for the community.""Learn More:For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/

Barb Ward-Burkitt has been appointed as the new chairwoman of the Minister’s Advisory Council on Indigenous Women (MACIW).Ward-Burkitt is a member of the Fort McKay First Nation and originally joined the council in 2014. She has served as vice-chairwoman of MACIW since 2018 and is also the executive director of the Prince George Native Friendship Centre.Ward-Burkitt replaces Chastity Davis, a member of the Tla’amin Nation, who served as MACIW chairwoman since 2014.“I offer deep thanks to Chastity Davis for her dedication and invaluable contributions to the important work of the advisory council. She is leaving that legacy in the capable hands of Barb Ward-Burkitt, and I look forward to working with Barb and the whole council to build on those accomplishments,” said Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. “The guidance and direction that MACIW provides me, other ministers and all of government helps us to better meet the many opportunities and challenges facing Indigenous women in British Columbia.”Ward-Burkitt, also called Wahiyow Cawapata Scoo, has been actively involved in the friendship centre movement since 1972. She was invested into the Order of British Columbia in 2010.“Violence against Indigenous women and girls is a pandemic across our country, and it is continuing to grow. It is critically important for MACIW to continue to work in partnership with the Province to ensure that the voices and stories of Indigenous women and girls are being heard and action is taken as we work together collaboratively to improve the health, safety and wellness of Indigenous women and girls,” Ward-Burkitt said.MACIW provides advice to government on how to improve the quality of life for Indigenous women in British Columbia and continues to play a significant role in guiding provincial initiatives to improve outcomes for all Indigenous women and girls, with a focus on ending violence.MACIW has up to 10 members. Current members are Correen Child, vice-chair (Kwakiutl First Nation); Lorna Williams, Elder representative (Lil’wat First Nation); Sarah Robinson (Fort Nelson First Nations and Saulteau First Nation); Raven Lacerte, youth representative (Carrier First Nation); Patricia Barkaskas (Métis); Monique Gray Smith (Cree, Lakota); and Lauren Brown (Haida Nation).“It has been an incredible honour to serve as a volunteer member of MACIW since its inception in 2011 and as chairwoman from 2014 to 2020. The optimal safety, health and wellness of Indigenous women in British Columbia is highly important and should be at the top of the list of any provincial, federal or Indigenous government to invest in. Indigenous women are the heart of our Nations and when our women are healthy, so are our communities. The ripple effect of investing in the optimal safety, health and wellness of Indigenous women and girls will be felt not only in Indigenous communities where it is needed most, but across our broader society,” said outgoing chairwoman Davis. “More meaningful investment needs to be made in Indigenous women in B.C. and I wholeheartedly trust that Barb Ward-Burkitt, MACIW and the many Indigenous women advocates will continue to ensure that this is a top priority for the provincial government.”The Minister's Advisory Council on Indigenous Women was established in 2011 following the Collaboration to End Violence: National Aboriginal Women’s Forum, which was co-hosted by the Province and the Native Women’s Association of Canada.Quick Facts:
Ward-Burkitt has been a faculty staff mentor in field programs for northern B.C. at Simon Fraser University and a child care worker with Indigenous students and with special needs students for the Quesnel School District.
She has been the president of Prince George Nechako Aboriginal Employment and Training Association for many years and sits on several other local, regional and provincial working groups and committees.
MACIW is guided by a terms of reference and standards of ethical conduct, and reports to government through the minister of Indigenous relations and reconciliation.

A former youth in care since the age of 12, Savanna Helsdon has seemingly always had to be older than her years.Now 26, this proud mother of a thriving five-year-old boy was the recipient of last year’s Powerful Young Parent award.The award is one of several given annually during B.C. Child and Youth in Care Week (June 1-7, 2020) by a steering committee comprised of the Ministry of Children and Family Development, Federation of BC Youth in Care Networks and other youth-focused organizations.Now in its 10th year, B.C. Child and Youth in Care Week is an opportunity to celebrate young people like Helsdon for their diverse talents, accomplishments and resiliency, and show them there is a community that supports and stands with them.Resiliency is something Helsdon knows all about.“From the age of nine or younger, I have memories of the ministry coming to our house. I had to help raise my younger brother and sister, and I was considered to be ‘the parent.’ There was always food on the table, but my family struggled with drugs and alcohol, and there was physical abuse in the home.”When she was 12, the ministry placed Helsdon’s siblings in a temporary foster home, and since Helsdon was older, she was allowed to go to her aunt’s home. Her siblings joined her several weeks later, but the aunt, who had two of her own children, was eventually overwhelmed by the situation.All three children were placed in a foster home. As the eldest child, she would often babysit her brother and sister. When circumstances in this home changed, new foster homes had to be found. That was the last time Helsdon would find herself living under the same roof as her siblings.“At about 15 years old, I began rebelling. I was always smart enough to know who I wanted to be, regardless of how stupidly I was behaving. There was a line I would not cross.”Shortly before she turned 17, Helsdon settled into a new foster home.“They were great. I wish I’d been with them from the very beginning. They advocated and spoke up for me. Because of them, I even got the braces that I had needed for so long. Even after I aged out of care, they told me I was welcome to come back if I ever needed to.”At 20, a public incident of domestic violence with a long-term boyfriend resulted in an epiphany. “This was not the life I wanted. I was done with him.”These days, six years later, Helsdon is happily engaged to a young man who is finishing his teaching degree. Her pride and joy is her young son, and she is even managing to save for a registered education fund for his future.Although rocked by a cancer diagnosis in 2018 shortly after beginning the early childhood education program at Capilano University, she has been in remission since December.Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and her still-susceptible immune system, Helsdon has been away from her job as an early childhood education assistant at the local daycare where she runs the after-school program. When she’s ready, she may return and finish the early childhood education program, but Helsdon has bigger plans.“The goal for my life – and my fiancé is totally on board with this, which is awesome, is to own our own home and open a daycare.”Learn More:For information about Child and Youth in Care Week, visit: https://www.bcchildandyouthincareweek.com/For information about the Federation of BC Child and Youth in Care Networks, visit: www.fbcyicn.ca/Children and youth in care need diverse, loving and capable caregivers.

Toni’s brain injury changed her life.Eleven years ago, she was working as an operating room technician, a vocation that requires mental acuity and physical stamina. After she sustained a brain injury, her cognitive and physical challenges meant she was unable to return to her job.An acquired brain injury is damage to the brain caused by a traumatic event, such as a blow to the head, or a non-traumatic event, such as a stroke. Brain injury is one of the leading causes of disability and can completely alter the way people live their lives.“When I was ready to return to work, I needed to find something that would challenge my new mind and body,” Toni said. “One of the consequences of my injury was the loss of my sense of smell and taste. I had always been a good cook but now my injury meant that I had to learn how to cook by following a recipe and using exact measurements.”Toni enrolled in a food service skills training and employment program offered by the Cridge Centre for the Family in Victoria. It is one of 16 projects funded by the Province last year to celebrate AccessAbility Week. She received 12 weeks of training in all aspects of food services through a program that aims to remove employment barriers for individuals living with a brain injury.Working alongside eight other brain injury survivors, Toni describes how she had to learn to work in a commercial kitchen safely and efficiently.“I’ve learned how to supervise and be a part of a small crew of my brain injured brethren as we provide a hot lunch for secondary students four times a week. My crew and I work hard to make sure the kids have a hot meal and a warm smile to get through the rest of their day.” She said she also had to “trust in my new abilities and skills to make a tasty meal.”Programs like the food service skills training do not just teach important skills, promote confidence and build stamina, they also provide connection, community and purpose for people living with a brain injury.As Toni puts it, “I really don’t know what my life would have become without this program. It has literally saved my life and given me a purpose and reason to get up every day. I am challenged every day and use all the skills daily. I feel so happy and fulfilled and tired, all at the same time. I love going into the cold kitchen with my crew and transforming it into a warm, bustling space filled with laughter and love and lots of food.”In recognition of AccessAbility Week, May 31 to June 6, 2020, the B.C. government is highlighting some of the individuals and organizations that provide important services to people with disabilities.Learn More:B.C. government accessibility initiatives: www.gov.bc.ca/accessibilityCridge Centre for the Family: https://cridge.org/BC AccessAbility Week 2020: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020SDPR0031-000964Disability Alliance BC: www.disabilityalliancebc.org

Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 905 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,332 in the Fraser Health region, 127 in the Island Health region, 195 in the Interior Health region and 64 in the Northern Health region.“There has been one new COVID-19 related death in the Fraser Health region, for a total of 166 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks and two outbreaks have now been declared over at Cottage-Worthington Pavilion and The Cedars in Mission. In total, six long-term care or assisted-living facilities continue to have active outbreaks.“Public health teams also continue to provide support for the seven ongoing community outbreaks.“COVID-19 continues to bring challenges for all of us, and in the face of this hurdle, British Columbians have continued to stand together while staying apart.“Racialized communities face obstacles that others to do not, and we have seen British Columbians proudly stand up and speak out against racism.“Exercising our right to peaceful demonstration is extremely important, and equally important is keeping our communities, loved ones and friends safe during this pandemic.“Whether going to the grocery store, seeing friends on a patio or attending a peaceful demonstration, the same rules for safe physical distancing apply.“Be mindful of the risks you are taking and continue to follow the provincial health officer’s order to limit gatherings to no more than 50 people.“Consider alternative ways to peacefully demonstrate, as we have seen elsewhere. Gather in smaller numbers in multiple locations, maintain a safe physical distance from those around you and use a non-medical cloth mask for the brief periods when in closer contact to others.“Let’s stand united across our province, our nation and around the world. Let’s continue to work together and learn from others to keep our firewall strong and importantly, use this time to spread the message of respect and tolerance rather than spreading the virus.” Learn More:For more information about BC’s Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/restartbcFor B.C.’s surgical renewal plan, visit:

People and businesses in Keremeos will soon be able to enjoy the benefits of modern, high-speed internet, thanks in part to funding from the Connecting British Columbia program.“Now more than ever, high-speed internet is making a difference in B.C. communities,” said Anne Kang, Minister of Citizens’ Services. “During this time of physical distancing, a broadband connection helps students keep up with their studies, supports businesses to provide online services and brings families and friends together virtually.”The Keremeos fibre-to-the-home project from Telus is valued at approximately $3.2 million and includes a $750,000 contribution from the Connecting British Columbia program.“High-speed internet means that people and businesses have better access to safety, learning and productivity,” said Michelle Mungall, Minister of Jobs, Economic Development and Competitiveness. “COVID-19 has shifted the way we communicate, and regional communities need access to technology that will help them adapt to the new normal.”Construction is underway. Telus expects the work to be completed by the end of September 2020, making high-speed internet available to more than 900 homes and businesses in Keremeos and surrounding areas.“Telus is proud to make this generational investment in Keremeos, providing the technology to bridge geographic and socio-economic divides and connect citizens to the people, resources and information that matter the most to them,” said Darren Entwistle, president and CEO, Telus. “Importantly, Telus PureFibre offers the community a globally unmatched wireline network that ensures all citizens have access to the digital tools to drive improved health, social and economic outcomes. We look forward to connecting our fellow British Columbians in Keremeos and beyond to Telus PureFibre and supporting the community as it attracts new industries and innovators, supporting the jobs of today and those that have yet to be imagined.”The completion of this project means local families, students and entrepreneurs will soon be able to enjoy internet access at speeds comparable to what people in Victoria and Vancouver enjoy. The new technology will provide equally fast upload and download speeds, which will support the use of video conferencing, online learning and remote working at a time when residents need that most.“People and businesses in the Keremeos community are thrilled to have fibre-optic internet coming to the village,” said Manfred Bauer, mayor, Village of Keremeos. “The arrival of this technology will be an instant boost to services like emergency response, health care and education, and our residents are looking forward to having internet access at speeds that enable them to work from home, do business around the world and unwind after a long day. It will be an incredible advantage.”The Connecting British Columbia program helps internet service providers with the costs of building the infrastructure required to connect communities to broadband internet. The program is now accepting applications for funding, with a focus on improving internet connectivity in rural, remote and Indigenous communities in B.C.“Everyone at the trust is pleased to see high-speed internet arriving in Keremeos,” said Joel McKay, CEO, Northern Development Initiative Trust. “The goal of the Connecting British Columbia program is to move the province towards a future where everyone can enjoy the benefits of broadband, and the completion of this project represents another step towards achieving this goal.”Since 2017, projects funded through the Connecting British Columbia program benefit about 45,000 households in 479 communities, including 83 Indigenous communities, throughout the province.Quick Facts:
The Province announced a $50-million investment in the Connecting British Columbia program in Budget 2019.
In addition to funding large projects from the ground up, like the one in Keremeos, internet service providers can apply for a short-term, targeted intake under the Connecting British Columbia program to help upgrade existing equipment in response to the unprecedented network demands happening as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Province has purchased Paul’s Motor Inn, located at 1900 Douglas St., to provide more temporary accommodation for people experiencing homelessness in Victoria.

“The purchase of this site will help support vulnerable people in the community and provide a safe place for those who don’t have a home,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “Not only will this building deliver immediate relief and support to vulnerable people affected by the COVID-19 crisis, the site also offers permanent housing potential to help tackle the housing crisis and meet the needs of people in Victoria.”Over the long term, BC Housing plans to redevelop the site into a range of affordable housing, the details of which will be determined through engagement with the community. In the meantime, the building will provide approximately 75 temporary homes with wraparound supports for vulnerable people experiencing homelessness in Greater Victoria.In April 2020, the City of Victoria leased 35 rooms at the hotel, which are being used as temporary housing for vulnerable people to maintain physical distance during the COVID-19 pandemic. By purchasing the entire hotel, the Province can maintain these rooms and provide an additional 40 rooms for people as work continues with the City of Victoria and partners on long-term permanent housing solutions.“Purchasing this property allows us the opportunity to provide our most vulnerable people with sustainable places to stay and feel safe,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “This location holds a great deal of potential to create a community, complete with health, mental health, addictions and social supports for people who need them most.” In the coming weeks, once an experienced operator has been selected, BC Housing will begin transitioning people into the building. Residents will be selected through BC Housing’s co-ordinated access and assessment process. People will have access to services such as meals, health care, addictions treatment and harm reduction, storage for personal belongings and other supports. The site will feature 24/7 staffing to provide security to residents of the building and the surrounding neighbourhood.“The Province continues to be a strong partner as we work together to provide safety and security to our vulnerable populations in Victoria,” said Lisa Helps, mayor, City of Victoria. “This second motel purchase demonstrates the Province’s commitment to making long-term investments and to ensure that no one who has been housed during the pandemic ends up back on the street.”As it does with most of its supportive housing projects, BC Housing will set up a new community advisory committee that will oversee the supportive housing’s integration within the community and will address any concerns raised by people in the neighbourhood.The latest acquisition is part of the Province’s work to transition people from homelessness to stable housing and its commitment to continue supporting people after the COVID-19 pandemic. In Victoria, BC Housing and its partners are also operating the temporary Emergency Response Centre at the Save-On-Foods Memorial Centre and temporary housing at the newly purchased Comfort Inn, as well as various temporary housing options in hotels and shelter facilities, to serve vulnerable people during the COVID-19 pandemic.From April 25 to May 20, 2020, 344 people were moved from encampments on Pandora Avenue and in Topaz Park into safe, temporary accommodations with supports. These moves were part of an order under the Emergency Protection Act to ensure their health and safety during the overlapping COVID-19 and overdose crises.Quick Facts:
The B.C. government provided approximately $15 million to purchase the building.
The Province is working in partnership to build approximately 3,330 new affordable homes for people with a range of incomes in the Capital Regional District:
housing for people with middle incomes: 121 homes
housing for people with low to moderate incomes, including families, seniors and Indigenous people: 1,925 homes
housing for women and children leaving violence: 39 homes
housing for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness: 431 homes
housing for students: 782 beds at the University of Victoria

It means we can visit the store, enjoy a meal or have a workout with confidence.“An effective plan uses multiple layers of protection for employees and customers alike, incorporating such things as barriers for safe physical distancing, one-way pathways, employee training or non-medical cloth masks.“Businesses that may be considering COVID-19 testing and screening need to remember that testing does not replace the many steps that are required to keep everyone safe. Relying on one layer is not enough.“Testing will help to identify those who have COVID-19 so those individuals can isolate and public health can begin contact tracing, but can be unreliable for those who are asymptomatic.“Someone who is negative one day may be positive the next. That is why testing alone does not insulate your business from COVID-19. A reliable test and accredited diagnostic facility, and co-ordination with local public health teams, are also a necessity if you include testing in your safety plan.“We commend the many businesses that have worked hard to put the necessary safety measures in place. Your thoughtful planning will help us all to stay safe and keep our curve flat.”Learn More:For more information about BC's Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/restartbcFor B.C.'s surgical renewal plan, visit:

The Government of British Columbia reopened in-class instruction to all students on Monday, June 1, 2020, with about 30% of expected enrolment in attendance.At the high end were Grade 6 students at 48.3% of expected enrolment, while Grade 12 students were at the low end with 14.5%. These numbers reflect only the first day of the return to part-time, in-school learning. Other students will gradually be back in their classrooms over the course of this week.As part of Stage 3 of B.C.’s return to schools, all families have been given the option to have their children back in classrooms for the remainder of the 2019-20 school year.Kindergarten to Grade 5 students are limited to 50% of the school’s capacity, with a half-time or alternating schedule. Grade 6 to 12 classes are limited to 20% of the school’s capacity and approximately one day a week.Children of essential service workers and students who need more support will continue to be offered full-time classroom instruction.Families who choose not to send their children to school are still being supported by teachers remotely. Schools are designating specific time for teachers to focus on remote education.If families change their minds about in-class learning, they are asked to contact their child’s school as soon as possible so the school can plan to support the child.All school districts have health and safety plans approved by the Ministry of Education that follow strict guidelines provided by the provincial health officer and WorkSafeBC.Some of these health and safety measures include:
limiting the number of students in school, avoiding groups or gatherings of students in hallways or other common areas and taking students outside more often;
regular cleaning of high-contact surfaces like door knobs, toilet seats, keyboards and desks at least twice a day, and cleaning the school building at least once a day;
staggered drop-offs, lunch and recess breaks, with increased outside time; and
asking staff and students (or their parents/guardians) to assess themselves daily for symptoms of COVID-19, with clear policies not to come to school if unwell. If any student or staff member has even mild symptoms, arrangements will be made for that person to be returned home. 
Local safety plans are posted on each school district’s website for parents to access.Learn More:Students, parents, guardians and teachers can find health and safety guidelines, learning resources and accurate, timely information about schools, programs and educational services, including regularly updated frequently asked questions at: www.gov.bc.ca/SafeSchools/To find a local school district, visit: http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/schools/bcmap.htmFor a French translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.06.02_IB_Nearly_60000_Students_Return_to_In-class_Instruction-FR.pdfFor a traditional Chinese translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.06.02_IB_Nearly_60000_Students_Return_to_In-class_Instruction-TC.pdfFor a Punjabi translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.06.02_IB_Nearly_60000_Students_Return_to_In-class_Instruction-Punjabi.pdf

An order-in-council published Monday, June 1, 2020, will repeal and replace the provincial court family rules and improve how British Columbia families can resolve their legal issues in family court.The new family court rules come into force in May 2021. These rules include modernized court processes recognizing electronic communication, enabling electronic filing and giving judges more flexibility in determining the best use of court time. Some of these changes are particularly relevant in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.These rules focus on early resolution of family law cases, a new approach to case management including family management conferences, streamlined court processes and new forms that are easier to use and understand. The changes are aimed at enhancing the ability of the provincial court to resolve family disputes more efficiently and effectively, while creating a better experience for families resolving their legal disputes.Early resolution of family disputes keeps the focus on the best interests of children and families. The new rules will introduce a process that will be implemented by registry to enable mandatory assessment, including early screening for family violence. Assessments will also include determining suitability for dispute resolution and other referrals.The emphasis on early resolution services through assessment, referral, education and in some cases, mediation, will help families resolve their disputes in a more sustainable and holistic way. The case management and court process changes are aimed at making things easier for users with a more streamlined and managed court process.New court forms have been redesigned to use plain language and a conversational, question-and-answer approach that will be easier for court users to use and understand. The new forms will help people tell their story, especially those who are representing themselves in court. The new provincial court family rules follow a public consultation held in 2019 and have been developed through collaboration between the Ministry of Attorney General, the Provincial Court of B.C., members of the bar and a community advocate. Some parts of the rules will apply in certain registries that can be expanded as resources are available.Learn More:For more information about the order and the new provincial court family rules, visit: http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/oic/oic_cur/0287_2020

When flood waters rise, the Government of B.C. is ready to assist local governments by helping prepare communities and responding to flooding where necessary.Residents in many parts of the province have already experienced flooding. Emergency Management BC, the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development, and the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure are working together with regional districts, First Nations and local governments to keep people safe and minimize damage.  Emergency Management BC assists local governments in response to flooding. To date, provincial actions include:
deploying 1.3 million sandbags to local governments to protect homes and public infrastructure (2.9 million sandbags remain in the provincial stockpile);
deploying or pre-positioning 15 sandbag machines to areas of flood concern or potential flood concern throughout the province;
shipping 5.7 km of gabions (wall-like structures filled with sand) and 12.6 km of tiger dams (stackable orange tubes filled with water) to the central, southeast, and southwest regions (14 km of gabions and 27 km of tiger dams remain in the provincial stockpile);
more than 120 BC Wildfire Service employees supporting flood response across the province to assist with flood mitigation and sandbagging;
deploying search-and-rescue groups in the central and southeast regions to assist in distributing evacuation alerts to properties in the Central Kootenay and Okanagan-Similkameen over the past weekend;
the River Forecast Centre and regional operations are providing water flow expertise, as well as dam safety officers, geotechnical specialists and engineers in affected areas;
launching a digital registration system, through Emergency Management BC, for emergency support services to provide timely access to support and enable safe physical distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, which protects both volunteers and evacuees;
working with local accommodation providers and support suppliers to ensure goods and services are available to evacuees while helping to protect the safety of all those involved;
working with non-profit organizations, such as the Salvation Army and the Canadian Red Cross, to make sure the immediate needs of evacuees are supported; and
working with the First Nations Health Authority and Indigenous Services Canada to make sure First Nations in British Columbia have the supports they need.
Emergency Management BC asks residents in affected regions to take precautions to ensure personal safety, including developing a household plan, putting together emergency kits, connecting with neighbours and learning about the local government emergency response plan for their area. As well, British Columbians can take the following steps:

Protect your home: The public is advised to prepare for possible flooding of low-lying areas by moving equipment and other assets from these areas to higher ground, where possible. Clear perimeter drains, eavestroughs and gutters. Sandbags also help and can be made available through your local government.
Create grab-and-go bags: Assemble an individual emergency grab-and-go bag for each member of your household with the essentials needed if you are asked to evacuate.
Recognize the danger signs: If you live near a waterway, a change in water colour or rapid change in water level (especially a drop) could indicate a problem upstream. Call the local fire, police or public works department immediately if you suspect something out of the ordinary.

If you face a threatening flood situation, park vehicles away from streams and waterways, move electrical appliances to upper floors and anchor fuel supplies. Listen to local officials if you are asked to evacuate. In the event of flooding, here are some tips about what to avoid:

Steer clear of river shorelines:

​Keep away from river edges and shorelines. During periods of high flow, river banks may be unstable and more prone to sudden collapse. Stay well away and keep young children and pets away from the banks of fast-flowing streams and flooded areas or bridges.

Do not drive through flood water:
​Never attempt to drive or walk in flood water. Just 152 millimetres (six inches) of fast-moving water can knock over an adult. And 0.6 metres (two feet) of rushing water can carry away most vehicles, including SUVs and pickup trucks.

Landslide risk:
​Heavy rain and snowmelt may contribute to landslides and dangerous debris in creeks and waterways. Be safe and do not go down to watch the rushing water. If you notice trees beginning to lean or bend near your home, or cracks developing in the hillside, consult an engineer or contact local authorities.

British Columbians can find more details in the new Flood Preparedness Guide released by PreparedBC. The guide contains useful information that will help British Columbians better protect themselves and their homes and understand what to do if their home or community is at risk of flooding.Learn More:The Flood Preparedness Guide is available online: www.preparedbc.ca/floodsFor tips on how to prepare grab-and-go bags, visit: www.preparedbc.ca/emergencykitFor information on evacuation alerts and orders, visit: www.emergencyinfobc.gov.bc.ca

Community-based supports for vulnerable and low-income people throughout B.C. are being boosted through a series of local government poverty reduction initiatives.With grants from the Poverty Reduction Planning and Action Program, 54 local governments throughout the province, through 29 projects, will develop poverty reduction plans and projects that directly support people in their communities.“Poverty is a complex issue without a singular solution. It requires the co-ordination and partnership of all levels of government, organizations, businesses, communities and individuals,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “These projects will empower local governments to create on-the-ground solutions for poverty that are tailored to the needs of their communities.”The 29 projects are receiving $1.4 million, which is from a $5-million provincial grant to the Union of B.C. Municipalities (UBCM). The grant is part of the Province’s commitment to partner with local governments and communities in poverty reduction initiatives, as part of TogetherBC, B.C.’s first poverty reduction strategy.“The dynamics of poverty change from community to community. This provincial funding program supports local governments as they work with partners to develop strategies that address the unique dynamics of poverty in local communities,” said Maja Tait, president of UBCM. “The strong response to this program from all corners of the province demonstrates the need for community-based strategies that address the needs of low-income residents.” The funded projects include plans to develop local poverty reduction strategies, resources and related initiatives, including projects to improve food security, develop affordable housing and increase access to public transportation. The successful proposals involve key sectors of the community, including people with lived experience, poverty reduction organizations, businesses and local First Nations and Indigenous organizations. The initiatives in the first round of applications are anticipated to be completed within one year and a second intake is expected to be announced later in 2020.“Receiving this grant will provide several vital benefits to the community of Stewart. As we partner with UBCM and various community stakeholders, this unified approach will improve the social, nutritional and academic well-being of vulnerable families,” said Gina McKay, mayor, District of Stewart. “The funding received will assist to provide essential resources to people presently in need and will also enable training, education and support to empower sustainable healthy lifestyles in the future.”Delivering on the Poverty Reduction Strategy is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.A backgrounder follows.

As a former youth in care, I have realized that consistent support is one of the most important ingredients to a young person’s success.For myself, the negative perception of government care was the most intimidating factor of this journey. I was afraid of how people in my community would view me, how it would impact the relationship I had with my family and the effect it would have on my future. I am sure that many youth can attest to these feelings of uncertainty while entering care. I dealt with shame and low self-worth daily, and I would not have overcome these feelings without the guidance I received from trusted people in my life.Strong relationships are crucial as they provide support, opportunity, friendship and guidance. Youth in care need these to succeed, yet the main struggle they face is not feeling like they have personal support available. My life took a 180-degree turn for the best when I moved away from home and fully understood the benefit of support and love from my community. They pushed and challenged me onto a path of prosperity. I believe for many youth, the right relationship is key to starting paths that lead to personal growth and development.For some, this can be the relationships youth have with their social workers. Social workers are the front-line faces of the Ministry of Children and Family Development and can be excellent resources for youth in care. My experience with social workers is, overall, quite positive. They were able to provide me with all the information and assistance necessary to succeed, from the time I entered care to when I finished post-secondary. I have been privileged with amazing social workers, and it is because of the relationships I have formed with them that I have encountered incredible opportunities, like the Provincial Youth Advisory Council.I have worked as a provincial youth advisor for just shy of a year and regionally in the Okanagan since 2018. In this work, I have met numerous youth who demonstrate resiliency and drive. I believe that youth in care are just as, if not more, capable to take on life’s challenges, for we are able to adapt, persevere and surpass bad situations. With supportive relationships in our lives, we can use our struggles as landmarks of growth and show ourselves what we are truly capable of.I want to say thank you to everyone I have crossed paths with. You helped direct me into a position that I am incredibly proud to be in. Without your helping hands, I never would have received the opportunities that guided me into becoming a commercial pilot.My message to people who have the opportunity to connect with youth in care: do it. You have no idea the impact your presence will have on these kids. Reaching out will help crush the negative perception youth in care struggle with daily and give them the guidance and mentorship they need in order to succeed.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are providing case updates for two 24-hour reporting periods: May 30 to May 31, and May 31 to midday today.“In the first reporting period through May 31, we had nine new cases. In the last 24 hours, we have had a further 15 new cases.“This represents 24 new cases since we reported on Saturday, for a total of 2,597 cases in British Columbia.“There are 225 active cases of COVID-19 in the province and 2,207 people who tested positive have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 32 individuals are hospitalized, five of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 904 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,307 in the Fraser Health region, 127 in the Island Health region, 195 in the Interior Health region and 64 in the Northern Health region.“There has been one new COVID-19 related death in the Fraser Health region, for a total of 165 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks and the outbreak at The Residence at Clayton Heights has been declared over. In total, 12 long-term care or assisted-living facilities and one acute-care unit have active outbreaks.“Public health teams continue to provide support for community outbreaks at federal corrections facilities, the processing facilities in the poultry sector and for individuals connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.“As we continue to respond to our COVID-19 pandemic, we commend British Columbians for speaking out against racism and doing so peacefully.“As Canadians, we strongly believe in the importance of upholding our shared values of inclusion, tolerance and respect. Racism and hate in any form have no place in our province or nation.“Peaceful demonstration is our right, one that is important to all of us, and taking care of ourselves and each other is our responsibility.“We want to remind everyone of the importance of physical distancing and the public health order to limit gatherings to a maximum of 50 people. We encourage alternate forms of peaceful demonstration that respect these important pandemic safety measures.“Our Elders and seniors play an important role in the well-being of our communities. As our history and culture keepers, let’s take the time this week during B.C. Seniors’ Week to honour our seniors by doing all we can to care for and protect them.“Over 8,500 British Columbians are volunteering their time to help isolated seniors in their neighbourhoods and communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. We especially want to thank the United Way, bc211, B.C.’s seniors advocate Isobel Mackenzie and members of the all-party COVID-19 Seniors Working Group for their partnership in this initiative.“Today also marks the restart of significant Phase 2 activities. Our K-12 schools have reopened to in-class learning for the remainder of the school year, transit systems are fully operational and some provincial parks are now open to overnight camping.“The reopening of our schools was purposely timed for two weeks after the start of Phase 2 to make sure we could proceed safely. We have been monitoring our progress closely, precautions and safety measures are in place and we are ready for this.“Transit systems are now fully operational, and while there are limitations on how many people can be on a bus at one time, safe physical distancing may be challenging. As a result, transit users are encouraged to wear a non-medical mask.“The start of the B.C. camping season also means we can expand our time outside to include the many nearby and beautiful B.C. camping locations. No matter where your summer adventures may be, remember to stay home if you are feeling ill and take precautions to protect the communities you may be visiting along the way.“To keep COVID-19 at bay, we need to stay slow and low with fewer faces and bigger spaces. A slow and gradual return ensures we can continue to keep our curve flat and protect our loved ones and ourselves.“Now more than ever we need everyone in B.C. to be tolerant, kind, calm and safe in our schools, on the streets of our communities and while enjoying our beautiful province.” Learn More:For more information about BC’s Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/restartbcFor B.C.’s surgical renewal plan, visit:

As part of ongoing work to implement the historic Supreme Court of Canada Tsilhqot’in Nation decision, Chief and Council of Xeni Gwet’in First Nations Government (Xeni Gwet’in) and provincial government representatives held a working session on May 29 to reaffirm the commitment to a strong partnership for ongoing management of the Declared Title Area, which is being transitioned to Xeni Gwet’in and the Tŝilhqot’in Nation.“We are working hard together to be able to provide clarity and certainty for all those living and working in the Declared Title Area, and we are committed to transparency in this work to keep everyone who is affected informed about progress,” said Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. “As the first declaration of Aboriginal title awarded in Canada, the Tŝilhqot’in decision raised unique and complex new questions, and there is no question that over the past six years this has been a challenging transition in uncharted waters for all of us.”A landmark 2014 Supreme Court of Canada ruling confirmed Aboriginal title over Tŝilhqot’in Nation lands now known as the Declared Title Area. The Tŝilhqot’in National Government, Xeni Gwet’in and the provincial and federal governments continue to work together to create long-term certainty for everyone affected by the decision.“Xeni Gwet’in has made huge sacrifices over the past five years to try and make sure that the declaration of Aboriginal title did not disrupt people’s livelihoods, or access to parks and campsites. We have met extensively with our non-Indigenous neighbours and operators to understand their interests and explain our intentions for the Declared Title Area. We hope these working sessions reflect a true commitment from B.C. to support Xeni Gwet’in as we manage the Declared Title Area and work together to find practical solutions for residents, operators and users. But, we are also ready to move beyond these issues to establish the Declared Title Area as a world-class showcase of Indigenous governance, according to our laws, our values and our aspirations as Tŝilhqot’in peoples,” said Chief Jimmy Lulua of Xeni Gwet’in First Nations Government.Friday’s session was the first in a series of high-level meetings to strengthen partnerships and achieve long-term certainty and clarity for the Tŝilhqot’in Nation, Xeni Gwet’in, residents and businesses about management of the Declared Title Area. Senior provincial officials from the Ministry of Forests, Lands, and Natural Resource Operations and Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation have been working with Xeni Gwet’in leadership in charting the next steps as the transition of governance continues.Since the Supreme Court of Canada decision, B.C. has been working with the Tŝilhqot’in on an orderly transfer of the practical management, benefit and control of title lands. This work included addressing existing provincial tenures in the Declared Title Area in the short term through bridging agreements. These agreements allowed people with tenures for tourism and ranching operations, on what was formerly Crown land, to continue their business as usual until longer term plans for Xeni Gwet’in management of the Declared Title Area are developed and in place. The bridging agreements expired May 31, 2020.“We recognize the extraordinary circumstance and opportunity we have in front of us as the bridging agreements expire,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations. “Both our governments and tenure holders are now coming together to advance this important work. It may not be an easy path, but through respectful partnership, I am confident we can build lasting clarity for those who live and work in the Declared Title Area.”The working session held on May 29, 2020, addressed topics on the practical considerations of Tŝilhqot’in management of the Declared Title lands, with a particular focus on tenure management transition.In August 2019, the Tŝilhqot’in Nation and the governments of Canada and B.C. signed the Gwets’en Nilt’i Pathway Agreement (Towards it, We are Striving). This first-of-its-kind tripartite agreement supports the Tŝilhqot’in Nation in its path to self-determination and includes specific commitments on transition planning for Xeni Gwet’in’s management of the Declared Title Area.Learn More:Link to the Gwets’en Nilt’i Pathway Agreement news release:

B.C. businesses eligible for rent support from the federal government will be protected from evictions as the B.C. government issues a new order under the Emergency Program Act (EPA).“The federal launch of the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) program has been a welcome step in B.C., but we heard from small businesses that they need us to help fill a gap that has left some of them unable to get the support they need,” said Carole James, Minister of Finance. “We’re listening to small businesses and have their backs. Preventing landlords who are eligible for CECRA from evicting tenants can encourage landlords to apply for the program and give some temporary relief to businesses who have been hardest hit by the pandemic.”Eligible businesses whose landlords choose not to apply for the federal CECRA program will be protected from evictions due to unpaid rent payments through to the end of June 2020, as determined by the federal program timelines.The EPA order restricts the termination of lease agreements and the repossession of goods and property.The CECRA program provides relief for small businesses experiencing severe financial hardship due to COVID-19. It offers forgivable loans to eligible commercial property owners to reduce the rent owed by their impacted small business tenants and to meet operating expenses on commercial properties.Property owners must offer a minimum of a 75% rent reduction for the months of April, May and June 2020. The CECRA loans to landlords will be forgiven if the landlord complies with program terms and conditions, including an agreement to not recover forgiven rent amounts when the program is over.The emergency order restricting evictions is effective immediately.This latest measure also aims to put B.C. businesses in a stronger position to participate in the Province’s restart and recovery plan.Quick Facts:
Launched on May 24, 2020, the CECRA program was designed by the federal government and is delivered by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.
As determined by the federal government, qualifying commercial tenants are those who have seen a 70% reduction in their revenue, have rent under $50,000 a month and generate no more than $20 million in gross annual revenues. 
A 75% reduction in monthly rent for small businesses affected by COVID-19 is achieved by providing forgivable loans to landlords. The loans cover 50% of the rent payments for eligible small business tenants for April, May and June. The commercial tenant is responsible for covering 25%, the property owner 25%, while the federal and provincial governments share the remaining 50%.
Restricting evictions for CECRA-eligible businesses in B.C. is one of latest measures taken to support B.C. businesses through the COVID-19 pandemic, including:
an average 25% reduction in property tax bills
deferral of tax payments for EHT, PST, carbon tax and others through September
BC Hydro bill relief for small businesses that had to close

To help people in B.C.’s music industry continue to create and operate during the pandemic, the B.C. government is investing $7.5 million through Creative BC for Amplify BC.“The important role that music plays in our culture and well-being has only been highlighted during this pandemic,” said Lisa Beare, Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture. “Our government is stepping up to support people in the industry to continue creating music and bringing it to our homes.” Amplify BC strengthens and supports B.C.’s music industry. The Province’s music fund is delivered by Creative BC. The suite of programs will focus on relief, recovery and renewal for B.C. artists, live music presenters and music companies in four areas:

Industry initiatives: supporting the development of B.C.’s music industry, including up-and-coming talent, training, business development, export and research
Career development: focusing on emerging and established artists
Live music: providing support for B.C.-based live music events and the businesses that run them
Music company development: focusing on innovation and supporting the sustainability of B.C.’s music companies

In April and May 2020, Bob D’Eith, MLA for Maple Ridge-Mission, led industry consultations on needed supports during the pandemic. The government and Creative BC made changes to the live music and music company development programs based on this feedback.
“I want to thank all of the business owners, organizations and artists that I’ve worked with over the past few weeks for their insight and passion,” D’Eith said. “Their creativity helped us collaborate on solutions. I’m confident that the measures we’re announcing today will help the sector move towards recovery.”
The B.C. government established Amplify BC in 2018 after consultations with the music industry. Creative BC also has established partnerships with Music BC and the First Peoples’ Cultural Council to design and deliver targeted funding through their respective activities. This is the third year in a row the B.C. government has invested in Amplify BC.
Quotes:
Prem Gill, CEO, Creative BC –
“Over the last two years, Amplify BC has played an essential role in galvanizing B.C.’s music industry around creation, collaboration and competitiveness. This year, renewed funding comes at a time when this hard-hit sector needs it most. This support will contribute to help businesses, companies and creators endure and adapt in challenging times.”
Lindsay MacPherson, executive director, Music BC –
“This provincial investment is what we need right now. Amplify BC has been supporting our music ecosystem for the past two years and this renewal means ongoing support for studios, live venues, festivals and development for artists and companies. An investment now fosters the creativity and collaboration our industry needs as we work collectively on building a stronger future in the months ahead.”
Tracey Herbert, CEO, First Peoples’ Cultural Council (FPCC) – 
“We are thrilled the Amplify BC program will continue to uplift the careers of Indigenous music industry professionals in B.C. Our strong partnership with Creative BC honours the principles of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and reinforces FPCC’s capacity to deliver quality music programming, including professional development retreats and Indigifest, elevating the role of Indigenous music professionals within the industry.”
Tarun Nayar, executive director, 5X Festival – 
“As a festival, we’re facing an uncertain time ahead for our staff, our artists and our communities. Working with the B.C. government and Creative BC to address our needs gives us the assurance we need that we’ll get through this together.”
Quick Facts:

Including this year’s funding, the B.C. government has invested a total of $22.5 million through Amplify BC. This year’s investment is from existing 2019-20 funds.
To date, through Creative BC the program has helped:
66 music companies expand and diversify their activities;
352 artists with career development projects;
374 recipients via Music BC;
20 Indigenous artists and industry professionals through the First Peoples’ Cultural Council;
141 live music events, festivals and concert presenters expand performances throughout the province; and
64 industry-building events and initiatives.

To support B.C.’s lowest paid workers, the general hourly minimum wage is increasing to $14.60, and the minimum wage rates for liquor servers, resident caretakers and live-in camp leaders are also increasing, effective Monday, June 1, 2020.In 2018, to help make life more affordable for people, government committed to raising the minimum wage following a path of annual increases that are regular, measured and predictable.Effective June 1:
General minimum wage increases 5.4% to $14.60 per hour, an increase of $0.75 per hour.
Liquor server minimum wage increases 9.8% to $13.95 per hour, an increase of $1.25 per hour.
Resident caretaker minimum wage, per month, increases 5.4% to $876.35 for those who manage nine to 60 units (an increase of $35.12/unit), or $2,985.04 for 61 or more units.
Live-in camp leader minimum wage, per day, increases 5.4% to $116.86.
These increases for low-wage workers are the third of four planned increases scheduled to take place on June 1 of each year since 2018. The increases are the result of recommendations from the independent Fair Wages Commission, established in 2017 to advise government on an approach to raising provincial minimum wages.Establishing a pathway to a minimum wage of at least $15 per hour is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Learn More:For more information, visit the Employment Standards Branch website: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/employment-standards-advice/employment-standards/wages/minimum-wageTranslations:For a Chinese translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.06.01_IB_Minimum_Wage_Increase-Chinese.pdfFor a Punjabi translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.06.01_IB_Minimum_Wage_Increase-Punjabi.pdfFor a Tagalog translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.06.01_IB_Minimum_Wage_Increase-Tagalog.pdfA backgrounder follows.

People travelling through Bear Pass have experienced enhanced safety and fewer avalanche-related road closures since the start of the 2019-20 avalanche season, thanks to the new automated avalanche detection system.Bear Pass is an avalanche-susceptible stretch of Highway 37A between Stewart and Meziadin Junction.“British Columbia has one of the world’s most-challenging avalanche management areas, and we have highly trained professionals who manage avalanche risk with timely preventative closures and targeted avalanche control,” said Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “We use innovative technology wherever possible to support their work, helping to keep people safe and to shorten the time provincial roadways are closed due to avalanches.”Over the last 35 years, the average of preventative and unscheduled road closures along Bear Pass was approximately 88 hours per year. Since the automated avalanche detection system started operation in November 2019, the avalanche team has been able to reduce avalanche-related road closures by over 40%.“I have personal experience on how deadly avalanches can be in this area,” said Doug Donaldson, MLA for Stikine and Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “This technology helps manage avalanche risk in the Bear Pass, improving safety and access for workers, Stewart community members and visitors. This is good news for residents and rural economic development.”The high-tech system gathers data about moving snow and ice masses, sending real-time avalanche notifications, data and imagery to B.C.’s avalanche professionals through their cellphones. This quick-moving technology helps them monitor avalanche activity day or night and in any weather condition, supporting their work managing avalanche risk.“As B.C. begins to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, the efficient movement of goods remains a vital priority for rebuilding our economy,” said Dave Earle, president and CEO, British Columbia Trucking Association. “The Automated Avalanche Detection System helps B.C.’s avalanche experts to continuously monitor avalanche activity day or night, in any weather condition, and ensures our members can safely traverse the Highway 37A corridor. We applaud the provincial government’s commitment to increasing transportation reliability and highway safety.”As of May 30, 2020, the automated avalanche detection system will have completed the first year of a three-year pilot project, made possible through a $1.8-million investment through the ministry’s Intelligent Transportation Systems program. This investment included two self-powered radar detection stations with high-definition cameras and communications equipment.Learn More:More information about the automated avalanche detection system: https://www.tranbc.ca/2020/05/29/avalanche-control-gets-an-intelligent-radar-boostImages of the Automated Avalanche Detection System: https://www.flickr.com/photos/tranbc/albums/72157714492634898For the most up-to-date highway travel information, check @DriveBC on Twitter or visit: DriveBC.ca

Premier John Horgan and Ronna-Rae Leonard, Parliamentary Secretary for Seniors, have released the following statement in recognition of B.C. Seniors’ Week 2020:“B.C. Seniors’ Week is an opportunity to honour an important group of people – seniors who have spent their lives building our province and shaping our communities.“The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected seniors. Our hearts go out to families and friends of seniors who have lost their lives to this virus. We know it’s incredibly hard for people who are unable to visit their loved ones and can only imagine what a lonely and frightening time this is for elders and those who care for them. Finding new ways to connect and following provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry’s orders are ways to show we care.“Today, people who are over 65 make up about 20% of British Columbia’s population, and this number will grow in the coming years. Our government is working to make sure seniors can live safe, active and socially engaged lives, whether independently at home or in assisted care. We are investing more than $1 billion over three years to improve the quality of care for seniors.“To support seniors during COVID-19, B.C. is funding added supports through local community service agencies and the expansion of bc211 to the North and Interior. Now, seniors throughout the province can dial 211 to connect with local volunteers who are ready to help with things like picking up groceries and prescriptions, meal delivery, friendly phone calls and virtual social visits.“This week, we encourage British Columbians to reach out to a senior in their life. If you’re not already doing so, think about how you can offer a helping hand to elders in your community. Doing our part to keep B.C.’s COVID-19 curve flat is one of the best ways we can honour seniors.“During this challenging time, making sacrifices to help protect the most vulnerable are acts of compassion. Coming together to support each other is how we will get through this crisis and be stronger than before.”For a Chinese translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.06.01_STMT_Seniors_Week-Chinese.pdfFor a French translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.06.01_STMT_Seniors_Week-FR.pdfFor a Punjabi translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.06.01_STMT_Seniors_Week-Punjabi.pdf

Former youth in care Jessy Neal took part in the creation of the first BC Child and Youth in Care Week (BCCYICW) in 2010. A decade later, she is still working to change the way we view people who have spent time in foster care.Her work has helped emphasize the importance of addressing the barriers and stigma that come from being in the care system. Running this year from June 1-7, 2020, BCCYICW is shining a light on the achievements of former youth in care.Supported by the Federation of BC Youth in Care Networks (FBCYICN), Neal joined a delegation of youth who travelled to Ottawa in 2010 to report on key issues affecting youth across B.C., including the social stigma many face in their daily lives. Out of this goal, the first BCCYICW was born.     “We wanted to change the portrayal and perception of those who have been through the care system, to celebrate their resilience and achievements despite the trauma and barriers they have faced,” said Neal.Her involvement with FBCYICN stretches back to her early teens, when a foster parent drove her to one of its conferences. From that first meeting, she went on to become a youth member and a volunteer on the board. She is grateful for all the federation does to help youth reach their potential.“The federation is like the positive family that I never had, a place where there is an understanding of who I am as a person,” she said. “It really helped to fuel the fire of advocacy that I felt, and drove me to new goals and expectations for myself that I didn’t realize I could have.”This new-found support led her to complete her schooling and pursue a degree in social work. She is now working at FBCYICN to create culturally safe connections with Indigenous youth and co-ordinate programming in 13 communities across B.C., giving many youth the same access and opportunities through the federation that she had.She is also helping create more virtual programming so youth in rural and remote areas of the province have somewhere to turn. This has been particularly timely as people reach out for mental health supports in the wake of COVID-19.“It’s great to be a support to young people in a virtual environment through the current pandemic, though it doesn’t replace face-to-face contact,” said Neal.Reflecting on a decade of BCCYICW, she has seen it grow since it was first proclaimed by the provincial government. Now, the week brings together youth-serving organizations from across B.C. to plan and celebrate children and youth in care in their communities. Neal hopes the coming years further transform perceptions of youth in care, not just by the media and community, but in the way young people see themselves.“I’m happy to be celebrating ten years of awareness of all the good things that youth can achieve,” she said. “From graduation to the first job, to being the best player on your sports team, everybody has things that are worth celebrating.”For those who are struggling, she says, “Reach out when you feel alone – there are lots of people who will support you. Don’t think you’re not worthy. You are the future.”Learn More:For more information about the Federation of BC Child and Youth in Care Networks, visit: www.fbcyicn.ca/

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are announcing 11 new cases, for a total of 2,573 cases in British Columbia.""There are 228 active cases of COVID-19 in the province, and 2,181 people who tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered.""Of the total COVID-19 cases, 35 individuals are hospitalized, five of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.""Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 902 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,285 in the Fraser Health region, 127 in the Island Health region, 195 in the Interior Health region and 64 in the Northern Health region.""There have been no new COVID-19 related deaths in the last day, for a total of 164 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.""There have been no new health-care outbreaks and two outbreaks have been declared over at Haro Park and at Evergreen House. In total, 13 long-term care or assisted-living facilities and one acute-care unit have active outbreaks.“Public health teams continue to provide support for the community outbreaks at federal corrections facilities, food processing facilities, in the poultry sector, and for individuals connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.“On Monday, our K-12 schools will re-open to in-class learning for the remainder of the school year. We are ready for this and are re-opening schools because it is safe to do so.“We have learned a lot about COVID-19 – where the greatest risks are, and the measures we can take to protect ourselves and our loved ones.“We know that COVID-19 has a very low infection rate in children, and children have milder symptoms. We also know that transmission in children, and between adults and children mostly occurs in household settings, not in schools, or playgrounds.“We have purposely timed the re-opening for two weeks after the start of phase two to make sure we could proceed safely. Had there been a significant increase in new cases, schools would not be opening.“Restarting in-class instruction now is a cautious approach that gives teachers and other education staff the tools and experience to prepare for the larger return to school in the fall, while supporting those children and families who need it.“Much thought and consideration has gone into this decision; to provide the best protection to everyone in our schools – students, teachers, learning assistants, and administrators.“This is the right time to make this happen, and precautions and safety measures are in place.“While we are proceeding with the re-opening of in-class learning, as we look ahead to the summer months, a new Provincial Health Officer order has been put in place restricting the operation of overnight camps for children and youth. Such camps often have large numbers of people, making safe physical distancing a challenge.“We must remember that large gatherings are a significant risk for transmission. This is because someone can be asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms, and data has shown us that the more people you are around, the higher the likelihood that someone has COVID-19.“Inside or outside, a family get-together, a workplace meeting or religious service – the risk of transmission increases the larger the gathering.“Let’s not put at risk the sacrifice of so many and undo the progress we have made so far. To keep COVID-19 at bay we need to stay slow and low, moving slowly with thoughtful consideration and keeping our curve flat.” Learn More:For the Your story, our future survey, visit: www.bccdc.ca/covid19survey

As British Columbians get used to a new normal brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, child care providers like Susan Ellis knew she and her staff would have to find creative ways to provide comfort and care for the children who were no longer attending their centre in person.Ellis is the manager of Skidegate Early Childhood Development Center, located in Skidegate First Nation on Haida Gwaii. When the pandemic first hit, the entire community went into lockdown to protect its Elders and residents.“When I first brought up the idea of recording ourselves and posting it to our centre’s Facebook page, there was a little nervousness,” Ellis said. “I hate cameras myself, but had to lead by example.”May is Child Care Month in B.C., and government is sharing stories like this one, recognizing the work of thousands of child care professionals throughout the province.“After we first closed the centre, we delivered bagged lunches to families of the students in our Aboriginal Head Start Program,” Ellis said. “The next delivery was just before Easter and included chocolate, Easter crafts, books, a co-op gift card and some dress-up clothes. Almost immediately, we got lots of pictures on our Facebook page with the kids in their dress-up clothes.”Ellis has continued to deliver “good food boxes” to families, but still wanted to do something to directly support the children.“The kids were asking why they can’t come to daycare. Children may seem fine, but they’re trying to figure these things out. I wanted the children to be able to see and hear us and feel supported, so I asked our staff to each pick a day and post three things on our Facebook page. These can be isolation activities, reading stories, singing songs or just fun things to do. There are seven ECE/ECAs (early childhood educator/early childhood assistant) on staff and I had to go first. That’s how I ended up doing Mondays.“Families make comments on the posts and the kids can watch as many times as they want. I’ve had a great deal of feedback from parents. The kids are saying, ‘I wanna see Sue or I wanna see Jenny or I wanna see Janine,’ and all they have to do is go to the Facebook page and press play.”When the centre is operating, one of the advantages of living on Haida Gwaii is the natural beauty of the environment.“We have two minivans,” Ellis said. “As soon as the weather is nice, we are never in the building.”One of the ECEs creatively incorporated a field trip idea into one of her Facebook posts. “She filmed herself going to the beach and gathering sand, rocks, shells and seaweed into separate containers. She brought it all home and built a ‘beach in a box’ in her yard. The children saw it and did the same thing! It encouraged getting out and promoted fine and gross motor skills for the children through the activity.”With her staff staying safely at home and Ellis the only one going into the office, she finds there is more administrative work and the days longer than usual. But she has found an effective way to care for her own mental health.“After I’ve finished doing the paperwork and all the rest of the jobs for the day, I come home, sit in my chair and watch Marvel movies. I’ve seen them all, but now I’m watching them in order.

Saturday, May 30, 2020, will mark the third anniversary of the signing of the Confidence and Supply Agreement (CASA) that formed the basis of British Columbia’s minority government.Although the agreement did not anticipate a pandemic, it has provided British Columbians with a strong, stable government at a critical time and has positioned the province to face the challenges ahead.“Over the past few months, British Columbians have seen their elected representatives work together and focus on getting things done for people,” said Premier John Horgan. “I’m proud to lead a government that has taken an evidence-based approach to containing the pandemic, and now to carefully restarting the economy.“CASA is the foundation of a strong working relationship between the government, the BC Green Party caucus and independent MLA Andrew Weaver, that has provided British Columbians with a strong, stable government at a critical time.”Commitments in CASA led to historic investments in public health care, child care and housing – critical services that are serving British Columbians through the crisis.CASA has also provided a foundation on which to build back better. A key commitment CASA fulfilled in the last year was to enshrine in law United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. This landmark legislation was passed unanimously in fall 2019, ensuring that reconciliation with Indigenous peoples will be central to an economic recovery plan that leaves no one behind.CleanBC, B.C.’s comprehensive plan to address climate change, is another key CASA commitment and will guide B.C.’s approach to clean economic development across the province, taking full advantage of the province’s abundant clean electricity.CASA also included commitments to appoint an innovation commissioner and create an Emerging Economy Task Force. For the past two years, both the commissioner and the task force conducted in-depth studies of B.C.’s economy and recently submitted recommendations on how to position B.C. for success over the long term. These reports provide government with productive policy options to rebuild an economy that will create the next generation of shared, sustainable prosperity for people in B.C.An expert panel to study universal basic income was created, fulfilling another CASA commitment. The panel’s final report is expected this summer and will provide the Province with a comprehensive evaluation at a time when many are considering how government can best provide help to the many people who have seen their incomes negatively impacted by COVID-19.“COVID-19 has brought us to a critical juncture,” said Adam Olsen, third-party interim Leader. “The pandemic has brought great stress and economic upheaval, and we now face significant choices as we begin to rebuild. CASA has provided us with a strong foundation, if we look to CleanBC, the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the reports of the innovation commissioner and the Emerging Economy Task Force. We are well positioned to rebuild towards a more innovative, more equitable and more sustainable future.”Weaver said, “Bringing more voices to the political landscape has offered a balancing of perspectives that benefits all British Columbians. CASA has provided new frameworks and ideas for how to solve the challenges of today through an economic vision that is founded in the sustainable, innovative and collaborative potential of all this great province has to offer.”Premier Horgan said, “In the past three years, we’ve shown how much can be accomplished when we have a government that puts people first. COVID-19 has challenged all of us in ways we could not have imagined when we formed government, but our principles remain the same. We’re going to keep working together to make life better for people.”

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, has issued the following statement on the Delta Hospice Society (DHS):“Fraser Health will stop funding DHS on Feb. 25, 2021, having provided the required 365 days notice to end its service agreement without cause.“The contract had provided DHS approximately $1.5 million annually. This covered 94% of the society’s costs to operate 10 beds at the Irene Thomas Hospice — a facility on land Fraser Health owns.“This decision to end this contract is final and will not change.“DHS can continue to provide hospice services until Feb. 25, 2021, if it complies with the existing contract.“The hospice is regulated under the Community Care and Assisted Living Act (CCALA) and is required to act in accordance with that act. The CCALA requires licensees to operate community care facilities in a manner that will promote the health, safety and dignity and rights of persons in care, make the rights of persons in care known to residents and their families, and to ensure residents' choices are respected and supported. (Sec 2 (a); Sec 7(1)(b)(i)(ii))“Anyone who believes that an operator is not acting in accordance with the CCALA or its regulations may make a complaint to the medical health officer in their region, who is required to investigate the allegations. (Sec 15 (1)(B)(ii))“I have heard concerns from the community about the internal governance of the society. Anyone concerned about governance issues of the society may have remedies available to them under the Societies Act and should consult a lawyer for advice on options available to them. You can read more about these options here: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/business/not-for-profit-organizations/societies/resolving-internal-disputes“This is a time when our communities have come together in remarkable ways to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Access to hospice services are fundamental to people. That’s what I hear regularly from people in Delta and across B.C. That is why there is strong support for the decision we have taken. I think this commitment to hospice can and should bring us together as communities.“Fraser Health’s job, and my job, is to ensure that Delta residents continue to have access to hospice services upon the termination of the contract with DHS. We continue to be committed to this and are working to make it happen.”

270,2020-05-29 11:45:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020MAH0060-000973,Government Website,Province strengthens protection for renters experiencing violence,"

Changes to B.C.’s tenancy law will provide greater protection to renters who are experiencing violence inside or outside of their home by allowing them to end their tenancy early.“Everyone should feel safe in their home,” said Mitzi Dean, Parliamentary Secretary for Gender Equity. “With these changes, anyone who experiences violence can make decisions about their housing that are right for them and their loved ones without having to worry about paying extra rent. This change is another step forward for protecting renters in British Columbia and helps people who have experienced violence move to a home where they are safe.”There are existing provisions under the Residential Tenancy Act (RTA) that allow a renter, or their dependent, who has been a victim of family violence to end a tenancy agreement early without financial penalty. Changes are being made to the RTA to include all renters experiencing violence within or outside of the home. If staying in the rental home threatens their own safety or the safety of another occupant, such as a roommate, they will now be eligible to end their tenancy.These changes are the result of a private member’s bill that was passed in 2019 and comes into effect on Saturday, May 30, 2020.“I was pleased to bring this private member’s bill forward,” said Andrew Weaver, independent MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head. “This change will have a significant impact on the people who need it – vulnerable members of our society facing violence in their homes. The unanimous passage of this bill exemplifies how members of the legislature can work across partisan lines to deliver real results for British Columbians.”Under the new legislation, violence includes activities that have or are likely to have a negative effect on the security, safety or physical well-being of a renter, their dependents or other occupant, if they remain in the rental homes. For example, a person living in a rental home who is being harassed or threatened by someone they know, or a stranger, may be able to end their rental agreement without financial penalty.“The BC Green Party caucus is proud to have advanced such an important bill in collaboration with the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing,” said interim third-party Leader Adam Olsen. “A safe home is essential to the well-being of survivors of violence – nobody should have to live in close proximity to their perpetrator. These changes are particularly timely, as the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of household violence and limited the social and financial supports available to people needing to leave an unsafe situation. Thank you to the stakeholders who guided and supported our work throughout the drafting process.”Secure housing and ensuring fairness for renters and landlords are shared priorities between government and the BC Green Party caucus and are part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:
The change to the Residential Tenancy Act builds on actions taken by government to improve B.C.’s rental housing system, including:
closing the fixed-term lease loophole and eliminating the geographic rent increase clause;
cutting the annual allowable rent increase by 2%, limiting it to inflation;
changing the laws to increase compensation for renters for bad-faith evictions;
making it easier for renters to receive their security and pet deposits back in a fair and timely manner;
improving the Rental Assistance Program and Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters to give families and seniors on fixed income a break from rising costs; and
investing $6.8 million in new funding to the Residential Tenancy Branch to reduce wait times for tenancy disputes and to establish a new compliance unit to take action against serious offenders.

The Government of B.C. has purchased a new building to help people who were displaced by the recent fire at the Pacific West complex in Campbell River.“We know that finding affordable housing is challenging, even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Claire Trevena, MLA for North Island. “This purchase and resulting new units will provide security, stability and peace of mind for people in Campbell River who lost their homes during the April fire, while we continue to work with our partners to build more affordable housing for others in need of a place to call home.”The Province, through BC Housing, has purchased the former Heritage River Inn, located at 2140 Island Highway in Campbell River. With the purchase of the Heritage River Inn, BC Housing is now able to provide 41 units of stable, long-term, affordable rental housing for low-income individuals displaced by the fire.Over the past month, some households have been able to secure new housing, but the remaining households will soon begin moving into the former inn. The building has a mix of one- and two-bedroom apartments. All units are expected to be occupied in the coming weeks.Since April, BC Housing has provided temporary housing at a local hotel and daily meals to people displaced by the fire. The John Howard Society, Sasamans Society and the City of Campbell River also have provided daily support and assistance to help people find alternate housing. “From the beginning, provincial resources and community social service agencies have been key in helping people feel safe and secure following the fire and the loss of their homes,” said Andy Adams, mayor, City of Campbell River. “With BC Housing purchasing this property and making affordable rental housing available to these people, some of the urgent need for shelter in Campbell River’s extremely limited rental market will be relieved. On behalf of council and our community, we are very appreciative of the support and quick action and look forward to continuing to work closely with BC Housing on other long-term solutions to meet the demand for local supportive and affordable housing.”In the coming weeks, a service provider will be selected to operate the new site and oversee day-to-day management of the building. Residents will gradually start moving in over the coming weeks. BC Housing may consider redeveloping the site in the future, but at this time does not have a proposal or timeline in place. If that were to occur, BC Housing would engage the community and go through the municipal approval process.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:
The Province purchased the Heritage River Inn for $4.08 million through funding from the Building BC program.
Residents will pay monthly rent, which will be set at 30% of the household’s income.
In addition to this project, the Province has invested in two other new housing projects, totalling 76 new units, which are underway in Campbell River. Those projects include:
49 units for women and children leaving violence; and
27 units for low- to moderate-income households.

In recognition of the significant role the province’s honey bees and native pollinators play in B.C.’s agricultural industry and the lives of British Columbians, May 29 is proclaimed Day of the Honey Bee.“Honey bees and native pollinators may be small in size, but their everyday role in the lives of British Columbians is big and can be seen throughout the province,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “Whether they’re pollinating crops for our agricultural sector or providing B.C. honey, bees are important to each and every one of us. Through programs like Bee BC, we are ensuring the health of honey bees for future generations.”The Bee BC program provides funding to regional and community-based projects that support the health of B.C.’s bees. The fund provides support to research, explore, field test and share information about best management practices associated with bee health, with the latest funding supporting 15 new projects throughout B.C.""The support of the grant from Bee BC allows us to cultivate 2.5 acres of our grass covered farm land into diverse forage for bees, which is really needed in the Powell River region,” said Darcy Kaltio, affiliate member, Blueberry Commons Farm Cooperative. “It's going to be beautiful! The educational signage will be an easy way for visitors to our farm to learn how they, too, can plant bee forage plants at home.""Blueberry Commons Farm Cooperative in Powell River is planting one hectare (2.5 acres) with diverse forage crops for pollinators, and holding tours and engaging with schools and community groups to promote the importance of increasing forage for honey bees and pollinators. The funding will also help support a mentoring program for beekeeping in their community.   In Victoria, beekeeper Evan Machin is comparing the overwintering survival rate between a Langstroth hive, a hive constructed by stacking rectangular boxes with removable frames for the bees to build comb in, and a natural-style hive made by bees. Machin is building a Langstroth hive that will closely resemble the natural hives that native bees use in the wild and he will share his findings with the beekeeping community.The Bee BC program is administered by the Investment Agriculture Foundation of BC on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture.Quick Facts:
As crop pollinators and honey producers, honey bees and native pollinators have a critical role in B.C.’s sustainable food system, contributing an estimated $538 million to the provincial economy.
Across Canada, honey bees and native pollinators have an economic contribution estimated at over $3.2 billion.

Construction crews will start work in the coming weeks on a $5.4-million project to build two steel bridges along Highway 16 on Haida Gwaii.The bridges will ensure people can continue to travel safely and efficiently between the communities of Port Clements and Tlell.The new Gold Creek Bridge will be a two-lane, 21-metre-long bridge, eight kilometres southeast of Port Clements. The new Geikie Creek Bridge No. 1 will be a two-lane, 21-metre-long bridge, 3.5 kilometres northwest of the village of Tlell. Both bridges will be constructed of concrete and steel, replacing timber bridges that were at the end of their serviceable life.The construction contract was awarded to Formula Contractors Ltd. of Prince George, which will work to minimize traffic disruptions. Construction is expected to be complete in fall 2020.Geikie Creek Bridge No. 2 and Geikie Creek Bridge No. 3 were built last year to replace bridges of similar construction and lifespan. These bridges are also located along Highway 16 between the communities of Port Clements and Tlell.Highway 16 runs over 100 kilometres from Masset to Skidegate. It is the only provincial highway on Graham Island and is part of the Yellowhead Highway connecting Western Canada.The ministry is working closely with the contractor, the Council of the Haida Nation, local municipalities and WorkSafeBC to ensure health and safety are maintained for all residents and workers.B.C.’s provincial health officer has directed construction employers to take all necessary precautions to minimize the risks of COVID-19 transmission and illness to themselves and their employees.

The restrictions on food handling, safe physical distancing, following hand hygiene and signage at these markets are still in place.“This slow and thoughtful approach is our new normal. It is grounded in what we know about COVID-19 today, and will continue to be adapted as we learn more in the weeks and months ahead.“What we do know is that the impact of COVID-19 is far-reaching and has affected us all.“Yesterday, the BC Coroners Service reported a notable and disheartening increase in overdose deaths so far this year, with 117 people who died in April. For many people, especially those who are homesless and living with mental health and addiction issues, COVID-19 is yet an additional challenge. We have not forgotten you and continue to work with the Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions to respond to the two public health emergencies. “The provincewide survey, Your Story, Our Future, is important to better understand everyone's experiences with COVID-19 so far.

Working with the judiciary and other justice and public safety-sector stakeholders, government is moving to safely support increased in-person hearings.“COVID-19 has brought unprecedented challenges for court users and justice sector partners,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “Working with the judiciary, we are assessing courthouses to determine the best approach to protect the health of court users. Each courthouse is different, but this might mean measures such as marking floors to indicate distances in lines at registry, elevators, washrooms and inside courtrooms, and disinfecting courtrooms after use.”Courthouses and courtrooms throughout the province are being assessed to ensure they meet the health and safety requirements established by the provincial health officer and WorkSafeBC. Assessments will also determine what additional physical distancing and hygiene measures will be required to stop the transmission of COVID-19, prior to resuming in-person appearances. Plans may differ by location and courthouse configuration.As part of these assessments, additional health and safety measures being considered include, but are not limited to:
reconfiguring and removing furniture to open space in courtrooms and to keep people physically distant from one another;
adjusting maximum occupant levels to account for physical distancing requirements;
marking floors to indicate the directional flow of movement and places to stand while maintaining appropriate physical distancing at the registry, in elevators and washrooms, and inside courtrooms and courthouses;
posting clear and visible signage throughout the courthouse and courtrooms to ensure court personnel and users are aware of and are able to follow health and safety protocols;
verbally screening court personnel and users for COVID-19 symptoms or exposure prior to entering court environments;
establishing protocols for handling documents and evidence;
installing hand sanitizer stations at courthouse entrances, outside courtrooms and in elevator lobbies;
placing hand sanitizer bottles in courtrooms at the dais, counsel desks, the witness stand and the clerk's desk;
disinfecting courtrooms after use; and
frequent cleaning of high-touch surfaces in courtrooms and in public areas throughout the courthouses.
The ministry is in the process of meeting with stakeholders, including judges, counsel, court managers and others, to make recommendations and implement changes necessary to keep the public safe when attending court. This work is occurring now, with the expectation that within the next few weeks, a limited number of courtrooms will be available throughout the province for in-person hearingsThe ministry has also been working to increase technology enhancements outlined in the Court Digital Transformation Strategy. This includes continued expansion of technology for virtual hearings in cases where it is deemed appropriate.In addition, the Province has also established two advisory groups to help government support courts and tribunals in delivering services as effectively as possible during the pandemic, and in minimizing its impact on the justice system.Learn More: For more information on the justice system advisory groups:

British Columbians are now able to access a new online resource that will make it easier to learn about jobs and careers in agriculture, while providing farmers, seafood businesses and food processors with a one-stop shop to support their hiring and planning needs.The new B.C. Farm, Fish and Food Job Connector will showcase current job vacancies throughout the province, including those for crop and seafood harvesters, food processing and farm workers, agrologists, large machinery operators and marketing specialists. The site also has sector-specific information and guidance to support businesses as they adapt their recruitment and human resource management in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.“Many British Columbians are passionate about buying local and are looking towards careers in the agricultural, seafood and food processing sectors. We are making it easier for employers and employees to connect so we can fill vacancies and get more British Columbians working to put fresh and local food on our tables,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “At the same time, we recognize the workforce challenges brought on by COVID-19 and are helping to address the need to establish a secure agricultural labour force so we can generate economic activity and maintain food security in our communities.”The connector site will also provide information and context about the opportunities that exist within the different regions of B.C.’s agriculture, seafood and food processing businesses and will highlight the available jobs.“Farmers in B.C. are in a tough spot because of COVID-19, and our need for labour is at the top of the list,” said Jason Smith, owner of Fraser Berry Farms Ltd. “I appreciate the B.C. government’s efforts in responding to those concerns through this website, which I’m hoping will introduce my farm and family to people looking to join our business and help us share our great tasting, healthy berries with British Columbians this season.”Parm Bains, owner, Westberry Farms, said: “B.C. berry growers are facing a serious labour shortage this season due to COVID-19, and this website is a good idea to let people know we are hiring and looking for their help. The berry industry urgently needs seasonal workers interested in harvesting and packing jobs. Many farms also have longer-term positions available in field and crop management and quality control, and this site could connect us to those people.”The site will connect to agriculture, food processing, aquaculture and marine fisheries jobs posted on Work BC, industry sites and the BC Food and Beverage websites. It will also be a centralized source to find information and tools provided by B.C.’s industry groups.“Local labour has always been a critical part of British Columbia’s food system. Jobs in agriculture provide countless opportunities to grow your skills, expand your experiences and contribute to our sustainable food system,” said Rhonda Driediger, president, Western Agriculture Labour Initiative. “We appreciate the work that the Province is doing to help farmers and ranchers connect with those looking for employment opportunities during these changing times.”The B.C. Farm, Fish and Food Job Connector site can be found at: www.bcagjobs.gov.bc.caQuick Facts:
Jobs are available in more than 30 communities in the Fraser Valley, Okanagan, Metro Vancouver and Vancouver Island, as well as in the Kootenays, Cariboo and northern B.C.
There are close to 600 jobs posted on WorkBC in the agriculture, seafood and food and beverage sectors.
B.C. farms, ranches, seafood and food processing companies generated a record $15 billion in revenue in 2018.

British Columbia kicks off its third annual AccessAbility Week with $500,000 in grants to not-for-profit organizations for local accessibility projects.The grants, which range from $10,000 to $40,000 depending on a project’s size and scope, will be distributed by Disability Alliance BC (DABC).“AccessAbility Week is an opportunity for everyone to celebrate diversity and inclusion, and to highlight the importance of accessibility,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “As a government, we’re working to identify and remove barriers that prevent people with disabilities from participating in daily life. This new funding supports that work.”A call for proposals will be posted on the DABC website in summer 2020, and grants will be awarded by the end of the year. Last year, 14 organizations received funding for accessibility projects in their communities.“Disability Alliance BC is thrilled to be distributing another round of grants to community organizations across B.C. to promote accessibility and inclusion in the province,” said Justina Loh, executive director of DABC. “In the past two years, we have seen some very innovative and creative projects come to life, and we have seen the number of people impacted by these community projects. We look forward to supporting more organizations across the province and hope that new organizations apply for funding this year.”Projects can include accessible education and learning, sports and recreation, arts, culture and tourism, community participation, emergency planning and response, and accessible employment.The Province proclaimed May 31 to June 6, 2020, as B.C.’s third AccessAbility week to promote inclusion and accessibility, and to recognize the people and organizations who are working to make B.C. a more inclusive and welcoming province for people with disabilities. The dates are the same as national AccessAbility week.Quick Facts:
AccessAbility week highlights the efforts of people, communities and workplaces that are actively removing barriers so people of all abilities have a better chance to succeed.
This is the third year these grants are being made available.
As of 2017, there are more than 926,000 British Columbians over the age of 15 with some form of disability.

The exceptional citizens being recognized today are role models for us all. Let us be inspired by their actions by condemning racism when we witness it and building inclusive communities where everyone can feel safe. B.C. is stronger and more resilient when we come together and treat each other with respect.”This year’s B.C.

The provincial state of emergency is being extended an additional two weeks to support continued co-ordination of B.C.’s COVID-19 response.  “We are now in the longest state of emergency in our province’s history, and British Columbians everywhere have shown we have what it takes to persevere through these challenging times,” said Premier John Horgan. “As we slowly turn the dial on our social and economic activity, we must work together to do so in a way that keeps our communities and loved ones safe in the weeks and months to come.”Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, is extending the state of emergency as B.C. begins to safely and carefully restart the province. B.C. is now in Phase 2 of its Restart Plan, which lays out a series of steps and principles that everyone must follow to protect people and ensure the province can come back from COVID-19 stronger than before.“As businesses work hard to safely reopen their doors and friends and families carefully expand their social bubbles, we are beginning to see what this global challenge will look like in B.C.,” Farnworth said. “Our government is committed to supporting people and businesses for the long road ahead, and we will continue to find ways to keep the economy moving and keep people safe.”The current state of emergency is being extended through the end of the day on June 9, 2020. During the past two weeks of the provincial state of emergency, government has taken action to support British Columbians by:
welcoming the release of the initial set of WorkSafeBC guidelines that will help businesses and organizations develop their plans to reopen safely during Phase 2 of BC’s Restart Plan;
helping the province’s hospitality sector by temporarily authorizing the expansion of service areas, such as patios, to support physical distancing requirements and industry recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic;
supporting people working on the front lines in B.C.’s health-care system, social services and corrections by providing temporary COVID-19 pandemic pay as part of a cost-shared program with the federal government;
announcing that parents will have the choice to bring their children back to class on a part-time basis this school year as part of BC’s Restart Plan, with the goal of returning to full-time classes in September 2020; and
supporting people who were living in encampments in Victoria at Topaz Park and on Pandora Avenue to move into secured temporary accommodations, with wraparound supports to protect their health and safety.
The extension of the provincial state of emergency is based on recommendations from B.C.’s health and emergency management officials. Farnworth made the original declaration on March 18, 2020, after Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, declared a public health emergency the previous day.Quick Facts:
Declarations of provincial states of emergency may be issued by the minister responsible under the Emergency Program Act.
The provincial government can extend the period of a declaration made by the minister responsible for further periods of up to 14 days at a time.
The current state of emergency is the longest in B.C.’s history, surpassing the 2017 wildfire season when the province was in a state of emergency for 10 weeks from July 7 to Sept. 15.

People living in Surrey will now have better access to same-day urgent and primary care with the opening of a second new urgent and primary care centre (UPCC) in Newton.“The new Surrey urgent and primary care centre will connect people who don’t have a family doctor with the health care they need,” said Premier John Horgan. “This is one of 17 urgent and primary care centres opened in communities around the province, along with new and upgraded hospitals and primary care networks that will deliver better, faster health care to all British Columbians.”The Surrey-Newton Urgent and Primary Care Centre, located at 6830 King George Blvd., is operated by Fraser Health. It was developed in close collaboration with the Surrey-North Delta Division of Family Practice, which assisted in the clinic’s design and planning.Whalley is the home of Surrey’s first urgent and primary care centre, which opened in November 2018.The Surrey-Newton Urgent and Primary Care Centre will offer same-day care for people who need health care within 12 to 24 hours but do not require an emergency department, such as people with sprains, cuts, high fevers and minor infections.The centre is initially open Monday to Friday from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m., and 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends. Beginning in July, it will provide both long-term planned primary care services and urgent primary care services, 12 hours a day, seven days a week, like other UPCCs in the province.Starting in July, the centre will support regular, day-to-day care for people who do not have a primary care provider. It will also help residents who lack a primary care provider to easily access services and find ongoing primary care through a regular family doctor or a nurse practitioner. “We are listening to people in B.C., and that is why we are delivering on our primary care strategy to meet the health-care needs of a rapidly growing and aging population,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “With this new centre, we are helping thousands of people who do not have a family doctor get their daily health-care needs met and help secure a primary care provider.”Dr. Victoria Lee, president and CEO, Fraser Health, said, “Fraser Health is excited about improving access to care for more people in the region. This second Surrey urgent and primary care centre will provide patients with much-needed comprehensive and team-based care services close to home.”A team of health-care workers will join the centre, including family physicians, nurse practitioners and registered nurses, as well as allied health providers (pharmacist, social worker and clinical counsellor) and support staff.This is the 17th urgent and primary care centre to be announced under the government’s primary care strategy and is the fifth in the Fraser Health region, following North Surrey, Burnaby, Ridge-Meadows and Abbotsford.Quotes:Harry Bains, MLA for Surrey-Newton – “Surrey is one of the fastest growing communities in B.C. This new urgent and primary care centre will help take demand off Surrey Memorial Hospital’s emergency department.”Jinny Sims, MLA for Surrey-Panorama – “As a resident of Surrey, I’ve heard families say they need more options for their daily health-care needs. I am confident this centre will provide convenient access to health care when and where residents need it.”Dr. Kathleen Ross, president, Doctors of BC –“We look forward to the new urgent and primary care centre to provide Surrey residents with more timely access to health-care services while supporting important long-term relationships and continuity of care that result in better health outcomes for patients.”Dr. Elaine Jackson, co-chair, board of directors, Surrey-North Delta Division of Family Practice –“The Surrey-North Delta Division is supportive of this provincewide effort to improve access to quality health care and values the opportunity to partner with Fraser Health in the co-design of the service delivery model for this UPCC. This Surrey UPCC will serve patients who have difficulties accessing primary care, particularly after hours. It will strengthen the existing network of primary care services in the community and will create an alternative employment opportunity for family physicians and health-care teams willing to provide care in Surrey.”Jacqollyne Keath, board chair, Nurses and Nurse Practitioners of BC –“Nurses and Nurse Practitioners of BC are pleased to see that a team-based approach to care taps into the expertise of all health-care staff. We believe that this approach is key to ensuring B.C. families can access timely health-care services when they need them, and we are excited about the opening of another urgent and primary care centre in B.C.""Quick Facts:
Primary care is the day-to-day health care given by a health-care provider.
Urgent primary care is the care that people need within 12 to 24 hours for non-life-threatening conditions such as sprains, urinary problems, ear infections, minor cuts or burns.
Urgent and primary care centres are part of a comprehensive strategy to transform B.C.’s health system by bringing together and co-ordinating with health-care providers, services and programs to make it easier for people to access care, receive followup and connect to other services they may need.

The BC Coroners Service has published updated reports on illicit drug toxicity deaths and fentanyl-detected drug deaths to the end of April 2020.The reports show an average of 3.2 illicit drug toxicity deaths per day in the first four months of this year.“We remain in a public health emergency, with more than three British Columbians dying each day from illicit drug toxicity deaths,” said Lisa Lapointe, chief coroner. “Illicit drug toxicity death rates in B.C. are still the highest for any jurisdiction in Canada. Every region in B.C. has been impacted.“Recent efforts to improve access to safe supply in B.C. are encouraging, and the BC Coroners Service supports continued enhancement of this critical life-saving measure. We continue to recommend a regulated, evidence-based, supportive treatment and recovery system as an important pillar in preventing future deaths.“The BC Coroners Service continues to work with our partners to collaboratively share information to better understand the situation.”The illicit drug toxicity death totals for March and April 2020, 112 and 117 deaths respectively, mark the first time B.C. has recorded over 100 illicit drug toxicity deaths in back-to-back months since November and December 2018.Key findings of these drug death reports, based on preliminary data, include:
In April 2020, there were 117 suspected illicit drug toxicity deaths. This represents a 4% increase over the number of deaths in March 2020 (112) and a 39% increase over the number of deaths in April 2019 (84).
In total, there have been 382 illicit drug deaths to date in 2020 in B.C.
The townships experiencing the highest number of illicit drug toxicity deaths in 2020 are Vancouver, Surrey and Victoria.
The Northern Health Authority has the highest rate of illicit drug toxicity deaths (28 deaths per 100,000 individuals) followed by Vancouver Coastal Health Authority (26 deaths per 100,000 individuals) in 2020. Overall, the rate in B.C. is 22 deaths per 100,000 individuals in 2020.
In 2020, 71% of those dying were aged 19 to 49, and males accounted for 79% of deaths in this year to date, both increases from 2019.
In 2020, 83% of illicit drug toxicity deaths occurred inside and 12% occurred outside.
No deaths have been reported at supervised consumption or drug overdose prevention sites.

Like many businesses around the world, Chad Wetsch and his team at Harbour Air have been monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic daily.They have been evaluating their businesses and making difficult and necessary decisions to support the health and safety of their staff and communities who rely on their services.“We have seen the impact COVID-19 has had on the communities we service,” said Wetsch, executive vice-president, Harbour Air. “We didn’t want to leave anyone stranded, so we responded quickly, changing how we operate to get people and supplies where they needed to go.”Harbour Air has introduced a number of protocols to help prepare its business for the new post COVID-19 world. To assist with travel for essential service workers and freight services, and to support the supply chain process, including deliveries of food, materials and products to neighbours, businesses and facilities in need, it has:
adjusted its fleet scheduling and reduced available aircraft seating to allow for on-board physical distancing;
provided passengers with gloves and masks. Passengers are asked to sign a health declaration form that is required before travel and may also have their temperature checked using a no-touch thermometer;
ensured all ground and flight crew have their temperature checked upon arriving and departing at the workplace; and
continued to follow the stringent cleaning and sanitation protocols in place and will provide ample access to hand sanitizer in all terminals, as well as pre and post flight.
For a complete list of the adjustments made, visit: https://www.harbourair.com/covid-19-flight-update/With the safety of its passengers, team and communities at the forefront of all of the decision-making, Harbour Air changed its service model to exceed both Transport Canada and Health Canada’s recommendations. It has introduced vigilant cleaning and physical distancing protocols and reduced operations throughout the province.“We had to look at every aspect of our business with a new lens, from the time people booked, to the onboard experience and then getting them where they need to go on the other end,” Wetsch said. “We did come across some road blocks along the way in accessing supplies like masks and plexiglass and ensuring staff could retain benefits. It took our entire team working around the clock to come up with innovative solutions on how to ensure health and safety of everyone while getting people where they need to go.“We know that returning to operations is not a return to normal. As we begin to look towards the future, we are working hard to ensure that we are providing the safe, essential travel services people have counted on for the past 38 years.”In recognition of Tourism Week, May 24 to 30, 2020, the B.C. government is highlighting the many individuals and organizations that work in the tourism industry who have shifted their businesses to adapt to the new public health orders and advice as a result of COVID-19.​

The next round of funding for the Hazelnut Renewal program is now available, helping B.C. hazelnut growers replace trees and establish new orchards with disease-resistant varieties.“We are now in third year of this successful program and it has been very popular with hazelnut growers looking to replace their orchards with eastern blight resistant varieties,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “Our goal from the beginning was to offer a program that provides accessibility and flexibility for farmers, and the results are encouraging.”In the first two years of the Hazelnut Renewal program, 18,444 new trees were planted over 34 hectares (94 acres). At the same time, 4,795 infected trees were removed over 17 hectares (42 acres). In B.C., commercial production of hazelnuts is centred in the eastern Fraser Valley, mainly around Chilliwack and Agassiz, though there are orchards in the southern Interior and on Vancouver Island.In 2018, the B.C. government provided the BC Hazelnut Growers Association with $300,000 over three years to help growers expand hazelnut acreage in B.C. by replacing dead and diseased orchards with new, eastern filbert blight resistant trees. The program is accepting new applications until Sept. 15, 2020, for fall planting and removal.“The Hazelnut Renewal program has supported the renewal of our industry as we continue to work towards sustainability,” said Neal teBrink, president, BC Hazelnut Growers Association. “From the Fraser Valley to the Okanagan and on Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands, we are continuing to plant new, healthy hazelnut trees and are excited for the future.”Ned Bell, an executive chef, said: “When I create and build my dishes with B.C. hazelnuts, I know that it represents the end of a valued and valuable farm-to-table journey that begins in the orchard with the hard work of our local growers. B.C. hazelnuts are an incredible product, and I love showcasing locally grown, fished and harvested food in my recipes.”Hazelnuts are a species of tree in the Corylus family and are often referred to as filberts. There are several native species in North America but the European hazelnut is the primary species grown commercially.Quick Facts:
The B.C. hazelnut industry is comprised of approximately 40 growers with about 141 hectares (350 acres).
The Hazelnut Renewal program allows a maximum eligible acreage planting of four hectares (10 acres) for double (maximum 269 trees/acre) or single density planning, and eight hectares (20 acres) exclusively for single density planting (maximum 132 trees/acre) per farm operation.
The hazelnut is a small brown oval nut that varies in size depending on the variety.
Hazelnuts grow in clusters of one to six nuts, each covered by a shell and a husk that encases the nut. When the nut is ripe, the husk of some species and varieties releases the nut, while in others the husk must be picked and mechanically separated from the nuts.
The kernel of the nut is edible and used raw or roasted, and as an ingredient in many commercial, baked and culinary products.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are announcing 11 new cases, for a total of 2,541 cases in British Columbia.“There are 258 active cases of COVID-19 in the province, and 2,122 people who tested positive have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 37 individuals are hospitalized, seven of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 897 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,261 in the Fraser Health region, 127 in the Island Health region, 194 in the Interior Health region and 62 in the Northern Health region.“There have been no new COVID-19 related deaths in the last day. There has been a total of 161 deaths in British Columbia and we offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There have been no new health-care facility outbreaks and the outbreak at Richmond Hospital is now declared over. In total, 14 long-term care or assisted-living facilities and one acute-care unit have active outbreaks.“Public health teams continue to provide support for community outbreaks at federal corrections facilities, the processing facilities in the poultry sector and for individuals connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.“We know that COVID-19 continues to be in all of our communities and will be for some time. We also know that transmission occurs when in close contact with others, so the measures we have in place are the best things we can do to slow the spread of the virus.“While we have worked hard to flatten our curve, as we increase our social interactions and spend more time with others, we may see an increase in new cases. This is because the illness often can be mild or asymptomatic in the early stages, which means people may not realize they are sick.“The faster we can identify and trace new cases, the better we will all be – especially as we ease restrictions.“Public health contact tracing follows the transmission trail to quickly alert close contacts to take precautions and break the chain.“We can help our public health teams and support each other by keeping our household bubbles small. We can also do our own ‘contact tracing’ by paying attention to where we are going each day and who we are seeing.“As we go forward, our ‘new normal’ is different and will be for some time. We all have a role to play to be successful in B.C. and it relies on our shared commitment and effort. Bigger spaces with fewer faces will keep all of us safe.”Learn More:For a Chinese translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.26_New_ExistingCasesCOVID-19_CN.pdfFor the Your Story, Our Future survey, visit: www.bccdc.ca/covid19survey

Downtown Eastside (DTES) residents will use their knowledge of the community, while gaining valuable skills and paid work experience to support their fellow residents, though $200,000 from the Canada-BC Workforce Development Agreement.Known as “peers”, these resident trainees will benefit from a new grassroots approach to peer support.“Community-driven support for the well-being of our most vulnerable residents is one way we are responding to a call to action from advocates and residents in the Downtown Eastside,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “Our government knows that ‘peers’ are best equipped to use their lived experience and understanding to meet residents where they’re at and link them to the services they need to stay healthy during these unprecedented times. By working with a respected grassroots organization like EMBERS, we are building on existing skills training for employment programming and making sure peers have the resources they need to succeed.”  The group of peers will provide support to other members of the DTES community, including services such as physical distancing support on cheque-issue days, information about government supports and other available resources, and sanitation.“Peer support workers have overcome adversity to build a better life for themselves and their families,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “By developing skills that draw on their lived experience to support people in overcoming those same hardships, they play a valuable role on the front lines of the fight against poverty and homelessness in British Columbia.”The Eastside Movement for Business and Economic Renewal Society (EMBERS) delivers a variety of skills training for employment programs in the DTES and will work with several DTES peer network organizations that have been successful in the pilot to identify peers who could be included in the project.“Peers helping peers is a way to create employment for people who do not fit mainstream jobs. Peer work recognizes the value of life experience itself, which can be drawn upon to support others who may face similar barriers and life challenges,” said Marcia Nozick, CEO of EMBERS. “Peer employment provides more than income. It builds self-esteem, creates a sense of purpose and gives people skills and work experience that can help move them toward a better future.”Up to 40 peers will be supported over six months, with the goal of moving them to more permanent training opportunities and employment. Peers will be encouraged and supported to leverage their community experience to empower them to find employment opportunities that resonate with who they are.EMBERS will also gather valuable community insights of residents to understand the lived experiences of people in the Downtown Eastside. This will help inform government about other tools needed to support vulnerable people to stay safe, strengthen community connections and build their capacity for employment readiness.Quick Facts:
Peers were first identified and trained through a pilot project funded by the City of Vancouver and co-ordinated by the Community Impact Real Estate Society, working with more than 40 DTES charities and not-for-profit organizations.
Peer support workers have shared life experiences, culture, identities and perspectives on mental health, substance use, homelessness, poverty, sex work and intergenerational trauma. Peers can provide safe, welcoming and more culturally responsive supports to vulnerable DTES residents.
EMBERS is a social enterprise and registered community economic development charity located in the DTES.

Crews start work in the coming weeks to build new and improved traffic lanes on Highway 16, west of Burns Lake.This project will improve safety and efficiency for people travelling this segment, which includes a grade that can slow heavy vehicles.“Our ongoing work in northern B.C., including this project near Burns Lake, will keep our transportation network running safely and efficiently,” said Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “Our investments in the North are investments in our communities. This helps create good jobs for people, which is especially important as we move into the recovery phase of COVID-19.”The $15-million project will include construction of a two-kilometre westbound passing lane, extension of the eastbound passing lane by 400 metres, and improvements to the entry and exit lanes to the brake check and chain off areas at 6 Mile Summit. The new lanes are expected to be complete and open to traffic in fall 2021.""The Highway 16 corridor has seen a significant increase in transport truck traffic in recent years, leading to congestion on the steeper sections of the highway,” said Dolores Funk, mayor, Village of Burns Lake. “We strongly support this project, which will improve traffic flow and highway safety between our northern communities.”Highway 16 is a vital and high-profile transportation corridor between the Prince Rupert-Alberta border, connecting remote and Indigenous communities.While work is ongoing, drivers can expect some delays with single lane alternating traffic and are reminded to check DriveBC.ca for the most up-to-date information.The ministry is working closely with the contractor and WorkSafeBC to ensure health and safety are maintained for all workers on site.The B.C. provincial health officer has directed construction employers to take all necessary precautions to minimize the risks of COVID-19 transmission and illness to themselves and their employees. Anyone exhibiting COVID-19 like symptoms, such as sore throat, fever, sneezing or coughing, will be directed to self-isolate at home for at least 10 days.Learn More:For travel restrictions and precautions due to COVID-19, visit: http://ow.ly/jBGu50yVMROFor guidance to construction sites operating during COVID-19, visit: http://ow.ly/P7WS50z8hNTFor the most up-to-date highway travel information, visit: www.DriveBC.ca

John Horgan, Premier of British Columbia; Brian Pallister, Premier of Manitoba; and Sandy Silver, Premier of Yukon; have issued the following joint statement regarding a proposed national sick leave program:“We’re pleased that the federal government is looking at a sick leave program that protects people and businesses, and we look forward to advancing this initiative. Paid sick leave is crucial for the safe restart of our economy.

“Yukon has already implemented a paid sick leave program for employers. A national program would ensure people can stay home from work when they are sick without fear of not being able to pay their bills. It will also give the public confidence that the businesses and workplaces they visit are safe.

“We will continue to work with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and other provinces and territories, to move forward and ensure all Canadians have the protection they need during this pandemic.”

There is more help on the way for survivors of sexual assault through a three-year, $10-million grant program to support the delivery of co-ordinated emergency sexual assault response services in regions throughout B.C.“Gender-based violence, including sexual assault, can increase during times of crisis, and that’s why our government continues to prioritize services and supports for survivors of these devastating crimes,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “This grant program will help organizations throughout the province provide sexual assault survivors with swift access to compassionate and comprehensive care.”The Ending Violence Association of BC (EVA BC) has received the funding to administer the grant program, in collaboration with the Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General, the Ministry of Finance - Gender Equity Office and the Minister’s Advisory Council on Indigenous Women (MACIW). This grant program will help organizations deliver community-based emergency sexual assault response services that are trauma informed and culturally appropriate. The services will meet the needs of sexual assault survivors around the province, including the unique needs of Indigenous communities and survivors.Sexual assault disproportionately impacts women, girls and LGBTQ2S+ people. Indigenous women and girls are especially at risk of being targeted.EVA BC is a longstanding anti-violence organization, supporting community co-ordination in responding to violence against women. It also provides information, training and support to community-based victim service programs, Stopping the Violence counselling programs and outreach and multicultural outreach programs throughout the province. Given its expertise and knowledge of the victim service and anti-violence sector, along with the relationships the organization has with service providers, EVA BC is well positioned to administer this grant program.The Province funds a range of services to support victims of sexual violence and provides more than $40 million in annual funding to support over 400 victim service and violence against women programs throughout the province. In addition, the Province recently introduced amendments to the Employment Standards Act to provide up to five days paid leave for people facing domestic or sexual violence, improving on the supports for working people introduced in 2019 that gave employees 10 days unpaid leave.Quotes:Mitzi Dean, Parliamentary Secretary for Gender Equity – “Sexual assault strikes at the heart of a person’s sense of safety and autonomy. It can cause lifelong trauma if people can’t access the supports they need to heal. I’ve worked supporting people who have faced violence for most of my career and I know first-hand that it’s essential for people who have been sexually assaulted to have the services they need when they need them.”Tracy Porteous, executive director, EVA BC – “For the past 18 years, EVA BC has been in dialogue with the Province about the status of sexual assault response in B.C. and the need for specific services for survivors. Sexual assault is considered the most under-reported, violent crime in Canada, and while other violent crime is on the decline, sexual assault is on the rise. Early intervention, as well as emotional and practical support for survivors, have proven to be lifesaving. This move today by our government will provide survivors with the emergency care they need to begin to heal, and we look most forward to working with community anti-violence services, Indigenous communities and the Province to further the network of support for survivors in B.C.”Elba Bendo, director of law reform, West Coast Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF) –“Community-based sexual assault programs play an essential role in supporting survivors of sexual assault – especially those who face barriers to accessing health care, justice and other government supports. West Coast LEAF, alongside partner organizations EVA BC, YWCA Metro Vancouver, Women Against Violence Against Women and Victoria Sexual Assault Centre, have long been advocating for these essential services to receive dedicated, sustainable and adequate funding. Today’s funding announcement is a welcome step in the right direction and has the potential to significantly improve access to justice for survivors of sexual assault.”Barbara Ward-Burkitt, chair, MACIW – “A recent survey and consultation by the Native Women’s Association of Canada suggests that many Indigenous women and girls have indicated they are more concerned about gender-based violence during the COVID-19 pandemic than the virus itself. This ongoing violence against Indigenous women and girls compromises the health, safety, well-being and self-respect of its victims. Violence against Indigenous women and girls in itself is a pandemic across our country and it is continuing to grow. It is critically important for MACIW to continue to work in consultation with the Province to ensure that the voices of Indigenous women and girls are being heard as we work collaboratively to improve the health, safety and wellness of Indigenous women and girls.”Learn More:To learn more about EVA BC, visit: https://endingviolence.org/To learn more about West Coast LEAF, visit: http://www.westcoastleaf.org/

A new program to restore dormant and inactive wells, and bring support to B.C. workers in oil and gas service companies has seen significant interest from applicants.“The applications we have received in a single day propose upwards of $152 million worth of reclamation work, which, if completed, will reclaim over 2,400 inactive wells,” said Bruce Ralston, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources. “The extraordinary interest in the program is great news as we work to get our economy moving again and help clean up the environment.”The first application to the Dormant Sites Reclamation program was received within 15 minutes of opening on May 25, 2020, and by the end of the day the Province had received over 1,100 applications from more than 80 service companies and contractors. It is estimated that the program could support up to 1,200 jobs for British Columbians, many of them within the northeast region of the province.On April 17, 2020, the Government of Canada announced $120 million in funding for B.C. to support the clean up of oil and gas sites. The Province rolled out three new programs on May 19, 2020, to bring this funding to B.C. industry.The $100 million in funding allocated to the Dormant Sites Reclamation program will provide successful applicants with up to $100,000, or 50% of total costs, whichever is less, for dormant site clean up projects. The program is split into two phases of $50 million each. Applications for the second half will open on November 1, 2020. Of the remaining federal funding, $15 million is going to the B.C. Oil and Gas Commission’s (BCOGC) Orphan Sites Supplemental Reclamation program, and $5 million to the Legacy Sites Reclamation program.These programs are open to oil and gas field service companies and contractors based in B.C., with registration, office and operations in B.C.Learn More:For information on the Dormant Sites Reclamation program, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/natural-gas-oil/responsible-oil-gas-development/dormant-sites-reclamation-programTo find out more about the BCOGC’s management of Orphan Sites in B.C., visit: https://bcogc.ca/public-zone/orphan-site-management

The tourism industry is a major economic engine and job creator for people in British Columbia.Despite the deep and sudden impacts of COVID-19 on the sector, B.C.’s tourism leaders were quick to put the greater good of our communities above anything else.To assist in the pandemic response, many hotels throughout the province swiftly transitioned from welcoming guests to creating safe shelter for front-line workers and people without a place to call home. Workers at the Vancouver Conference Centre sprang into action and transformed that facility into a temporary hospital. Destination marketing organizations pivoted to showcase their communities online and encouraged people to visit later.It’s this kind of leadership that has allowed our province to quickly get the pandemic under control and to start laying the groundwork for recovery.As minister responsible for tourism, I know that every corner of B.C. has incredible places to enjoy and explore – and that it’s the people who work in the tourism and hospitality industry who make travel experiences so special.To help the industry be ready for recovery, we’re providing $10 million in grants to 59 community destination marketing organizations to support their efforts to show British Columbians the amazing travel opportunities available right here at home.In 2018, British Columbians spent an estimated $6.7 billion on international travel, excluding day trips to the United States. This is almost as much as the $6.9 billion international travellers spent in B.C. that same year. Redirecting what we spend abroad toward the tourism sector in B.C. can be a strong first step towards recovery that will create jobs, support local economies and allow the sector to get back to being one of our province’s biggest economic drivers.Destination BC is also working hard to help the tourism sector recover through its three-phased marketing recovery plan: Response, Recovery and Resilience. Its #explorebclocal campaign invites people to explore local experiences and visit businesses close to home.We’re already seeing a groundswell of support from British Columbians to support local businesses – from choosing to shop main street via storefront pickup, to ordering made-in-B.C. products online, to cooking more at home using local ingredients.As we mark the beginning of Tourism Week, let’s all make a commitment and a plan to support B.C.’s tourism industry in 2020 and rediscover the beauty in our own backyards. You will be amazed at what’s right around the corner.

Fifty-nine B.C. community destination marketing organizations (DMOs) severely impacted by COVID-19 travel restrictions will be supported with a $10-million grant from the Province.B.C.’s community DMOs are not-for-profit organizations that promote tourism to their regions. They rely on funds generated by the municipal and regional district tax (MRDT), which is charged to visitors by hotels and other types of accommodation. Without this relief funding, community DMOs would be unable to operate and support economic recovery efforts in the tourism sector.“The tourism industry is a major economic engine and job creator for people in B.C., but the impacts of COVID 19 have left the industry struggling,” said Lisa Beare, Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture. “We are supporting the tourism industry today to make sure we can welcome visitors to explore Super, Natural British Columbia when it is safe to do so.”Community DMOs play an important role connecting visitors to B.C.’s communities, representing both large metropolitan centres and towns of a few hundred residents. Investments in the tourism sector’s recovery now will help create jobs and spur economic growth throughout the province.“As we look onwards to reopening and restarting the visitor economy, community DMOs are well placed to create effective marketing and development campaigns that will drive visitors to their communities across our beautiful province,” said Nancy Small, chair, BC Destination Marketing Organization Association. “This welcomed funding accouncement will give many of us that ability to remain operating and plan for the future. It is excellent news.”This funding will help MRDT-supported community DMOs retain crucial staff positions and offset fixed expenses from May to October 2020.“Destination BC is eager to support our community partners on tourism’s road to recovery,” said Marsha Walden, president and CEO, Destination BC. “From marketing, to destination development and industry learning, we’re here to help restart the tourism industry as we slowly begin opening our doors again.”Quick Facts:
In 2018, tourism contributed over $20.5 billion in revenues to B.C.'s economy.
B.C. tourism supports families in communities and rural areas throughout the province, and 59 community DMOs use the MRDT for tourism marketing projects and programs in British Columbia.

301,2020-05-25 07:30:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020ENV0027-000936,Government Website,"Most campgrounds, recreation sites opening throughout the province","

The 2020 summer camping season has arrived, giving people in B.C. more opportunities to get outside and connect with nature as most provincial campgrounds and recreation sites open June 1, along with more parks for day-use activities.To ensure British Columbians have access to camping opportunities close to home during the summer, new reservations can only be made by B.C. residents. People can now reserve a site two months in advance of their arrival date instead of four – a temporary measure to spread out the demand during the busy summer months.“Spending time appreciating nature is one of the best things we can do for our health and well-being,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “Camping provides the ideal opportunity to connect safely with family and friends in BC Parks beauty. We want to ensure British Columbians have access to summer vacation opportunities close to home, so we are limiting new reservations to B.C. residents. Our plan is to safely open as many parks as possible so that B.C. campers and day visitors can rediscover the wilderness beauty close to home.”Opening campgrounds safely to support public health guidelines means it will not be business as usual in some campgrounds. To allow physical distancing, fewer sites will be available in some campgrounds, there may be some changes to services and communal facilities, and some campgrounds will open at a later date. Hot springs, backcountry communal cabins and campgrounds that require visitors to use shared cooking facilities will remain temporarily closed, along with group campsites.As part of the ongoing campsite expansion program, the Province has also added 180 new campsites to BC Parks and recreation sites. Since 2017, more than 1,200 campsites have been added.“COVID-19 changed a lot of our travel plans this summer, but camping locally in BC Parks or recreation sites might be the break you need,” said Joss Penny, chair of the Camping and RVing Coalition BC. “I welcome the news of 180 new campsites in provincial parks and recreation sites to boost capacity and to help ease some of the pressure of locating places to stay in high-demand locations.”As of May 25, the Discover Camping reservation system is back online to accept new reservations. Most existing reservations for dates after June 1 will be honoured, so campsites in popular campgrounds may already be booked. Some reservations may need to be cancelled due to reduced capacity at certain campgrounds. Those who are impacted will be advised of their cancelled bookings over the coming weeks. A list of changes to campgrounds will be posted on the BC Parks website.On June 1, additional parks will reopen for day-use activities. Playgrounds, halls and picnic shelters remain closed in all provincial parks. The remaining parks that attract the largest crowds will only reopen when it is safe to do so, taking into consideration the safety of visitors and staff, impact on nearby communities and the protection of the environment.To ensure parks stay open and safe for everyone, visitors are expected to follow physical distancing requirements and will need to manage their own safety. If a park is too busy and physical distancing cannot be maintained, visitors using parks for day-use activities are asked to find another outdoor space to enjoy close to home.Parks that remain temporarily closed are listed on the BC Parks website. People are advised to check the website often, as services and openings may change to align with the status of the COVID-19 response.Quick Facts:
BC Parks is one of the world’s biggest and most diverse parks systems, with 1,035 provincial parks, recreation areas, protected areas, conservancies and ecological reserves covering more than 14% of the province’s land base.
During the last three years, 1,205 new campsites have been added to provincial parks and recreation sites throughout the province. A total of 594 new sites were added last year in regions with the highest demand – the Lower Mainland, Thompson-Okanagan, Kootenay Rockies and Mount Robson.
Of the 10,700 campsites BC Parks manages, approximately 55% are reservable and 45% remain available on a first-come, first-served basis.

Drivers on the North Shore are advised that Exit 22, the Fern Street eastbound off-ramp, will be permanently closed effective Sunday, May 31, 2020.The closure of the Fern Street exit off Highway 1 eastbound is necessary to accommodate the new Mountain Highway eastbound on-ramp merge lane. This will allow drivers to safely join Highway 1 eastbound from the Mountain Highway interchange and avoid conflict with exiting motorists.With the closure of Exit 22, eastbound drivers travelling to Lillooet Road and Mount Seymour Parkway will need to use Exit 21, the Mountain Highway eastbound off-ramp, and take Keith Road.When complete, the Highway 1/Lower Lynn interchanges project will improve safety, traffic flow during peak times, provide better links between municipalities and support active transportation and transit use.Learn More:For more information on the Highway 1/Lower Lynn interchanges project, including construction updates, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/lowerlynninterchanges

Public health teams are providing support and the company has closed the plant as a precaution.“Public health teams continue to provide support for community outbreaks at the federal corrections facilities, at the Oppenheimer Group, those in the poultry sector and for individuals connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.“Finding new outbreaks tell us three things: first, gatherings of any kind, including workplaces, increase the risk of transmission; second, public health surveillance is working to quickly identify new cases; and third, we must continue with our restrictions in Phase 2.“We are on the right track and must keep going. The faster we can identify new cases, the easier it is to prevent the spread to others.“In every community in the province, our public health teams – our expert virus hunters – are working to test, trace and track the spread of COVID-19 and other illnesses. These medical health officers, public health nurses, environmental health officers and licensing officers are integral to our COVID-19 response.“These teams work together to support us in our businesses and our homes, finding and isolating hot spots, and making sure people get the care and support they need, and do not inadvertently pass the virus on to others.“The risks of COVID-19 are clear, and so are the steps we need to take to protect ourselves, our loved ones, our elders and our communities.

For many British Columbians, daily life has changed significantly because of COVID-19.As the province moves further towards a new normal, Heather Briese, an early childhood educator (ECE) at Rainbow Parent Participation preschool in Burnaby, is looking back at how she found new ways to support children and families during the height of the pandemic.“These children and their families have become part of my family, so it was important to me that they knew I was still thinking about them,” Briese said, who mailed “missing you at preschool” cards and stickers to children when they started staying home.May is Child Care Month in B.C., honouring the work of thousands of child care professionals throughout the province.When parents texted her photos of their children holding the cards and sharing their own “I miss you Ms. Heather” messages, Briese knew she had to find more ways to continue connecting with the children.“I first started with recording myself reading stories and shared the videos on Facebook and YouTube for the children to listen to. I wanted to be able to talk to them though, and have them talk to their friends too, so I set up video calls with all the children and their families, which we do twice a week now.”Briese said these video calls helped bring a routine that children were used to at school to their homes, which helped them feel more comfortable and less anxious during an uncertain time.“Every morning at preschool, we had a group meeting, like circle time, where we talked about if we were having a thumbs-up day or thumbs-down day. If a child was having a thumbs-down day, the other children come up with ideas for how they can make it better. They like being helpers and this encourages them to be there for each other. We have this group meeting on all our video calls now, followed by singing songs, discussing the weather and having show and tell once a week.”As they continued to practise safe distancing, Briese decided to reach out to parents to set up a time to surprise each child at their home and provide them with activity packages.“I would ring the doorbell then walk back to my car to keep distancing in place. The children would always be so excited to see me, and I was just as excited to see them. I visited in the evening so they could share what they have been up to, and then we would celebrate essential workers at 7 p.m. together.“I’ve dropped off a couple of activity packages so far, including a special one for Mother’s Day that had a separate sealed package for fathers to do with their children and then gift to mothers. I had to warn the fathers in advance about that package so they could hide it. I’ve tried to include lots of different activities to help parents keep their children busy throughout the day.”As children and families begin to find a new normal, Briese said she hopes to bring the tradition of graduation to them in a new way with a graduation themed activity package. The materials included will allow children to create their own graduation cap, which they can wear to their virtual graduation ceremony attended by parents and grandparents online.“At the end of the day, I want to do what is best for children and families.”For Briese and many other child care professionals, this includes making sure the children they care for know how important and special they are.Learn More:Childcare BC is committed to keeping parents, child care providers and partners informed about steps government is taking to address the COVID-19 outbreak: http://gov.bc.ca/ChildCareCovid-19ResponseEveryday Anxiety Strategies for Educators (EASE) at Home provides resources and activities for parents and caregivers to do with children to help build routine and help them understand and manage anxiety in simple and fun ways: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/managing-your-health/mental-health-substance-use/child-teen-mental-health/easeFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/

Premier John Horgan has released the following statement in recognition of the anniversary of the Komagata Maru's arrival in British Columbia on May 23, 1914:“Today marks the 106th anniversary of the Komagata Maru’s arrival on the shores of British Columbia. On board were 376 Sikh, Muslim and Hindu people, hoping to build a better life for themselves and their families. Instead, they were blocked from completing their journey because of discriminatory laws that banned South Asians from immigrating to Canada.“When I look out the window from my Vancouver office, I can see the exact spot where the Komagata Maru was moored for two months as its passengers endured cruel conditions. After being forced to leave Canadian waters, 19 people were killed, and others were imprisoned upon return to India.“On this day, I think of the people who were on that ship and how they must have felt. I wonder how they would have enriched our country if given the opportunity. Some were students and labourers, others were ex-soldiers from the British Indian regiments. All of them shared the dream of making British Columbia their home.“Racism is part of our history in British Columbia, and our work continues to right the wrongs of the past. The Province of British Columbia formally apologized in the legislative chamber in 2008 for its role in the Komagata Maru tragedy. This event stands as a reminder for how racism, discrimination and hate have hurt generations of people. But it also reminds us of the incredible resiliency in our province – including all those who stand up against injustice and work to make B.C. a place where everyone is welcome and safe.“As we live through the COVID-19 pandemic, racism has tarnished our community’s response. People have been attacked and assaulted. Racism has no place in our province. We must stand firm against hate and learn from our past as we build a better, more inclusive future.”For a French translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.23_STM_Komagata_Maru-FR.pdfFor a Hindi translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.23_STM_Komagata_Maru-Hindi.pdfFor a Punjabi translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.23_STM_Komagata_Maru-Punjabi.pdf

Separate NAFTA appeals of the Department of Commerce’s countervailing duty and anti-dumping duty determinations have also been initiated.“We will continue to defend the 57,000 hard-working people whose livelihoods depend on B.C.’s forest industry against these unfair and unjustified tariffs.“We will fight alongside Canada, on behalf of British Columbians and the communities that rely on the forest sector, as we continue to challenge these unfair tariffs through the appeals processes.”

We offer our condolences to the family, friends and caregivers of these individuals, as well as to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There have been no new health-care outbreaks, and the outbreak at Lions Gate Hospital has been declared over. In total, 14 long-term care or assisted-living facilities and two acute-care units have active outbreaks.“Public health teams continue to provide support for community outbreaks at the Mountain Institution and Mission Institution – both federal corrections facilities, at the Oppenheimer Group, facilities in the poultry sector and with those connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.“We are finding our new balance between protecting our health and reopening many of the businesses and activities that are important to all of us.“Phase 2 of our BC's Restart Plan is about pausing before moving forward; being thoughtful and cautious to keep everyone safe, while COVID-19 remains in our communities.“While Phase 2 is now underway, the provincial health officer order restricting mass gatherings to no more than 50 individuals remains in place. Further, the order has been amended to also include no more than 50 vehicles for outdoor drive-in events, with a restriction on the sale of refreshments. Anyone attending these events must stay in their cars unless they have to go to washrooms, which must be serviced with running water for proper hand hygiene.“This week, we have seen British Columbians throughout the province using the WorkSafeBC public health guidelines and the rules for safe social interactions to increase their activities while protecting employees, customers, friends and family.“This approach – moving slowly, with patience and care – is our way forward. We have made great strides to flatten our curve, and we must continue with our efforts.

The First Nations Summit and the governments of British Columbia and Canada are pleased to announce the reappointment of Celeste Haldane to another three-year term as Chief Commissioner of the BC Treaty Commission and look forward to continuing to work with her on the innovative approaches she brings to treaty policy.Haldane was first appointed to guide the treaty process in B.C. on April 12, 2017. One of her most important accomplishments has been advocating for Indigenous rights recognition to be more firmly entrenched into the treaty negotiation process. Her tenure has also overseen the advancement of several First Nations to Stage 5 treaty negotiations, including the historic signing of both the Ditidaht and Pacheedaht First Nations’ Agreements in Principle in June 2019.The BC Treaty Commission is an independent, impartial body responsible for facilitating treaty negotiations between the provincial and federal governments and First Nations in British Columbia. Its primary role is to oversee the negotiation process to ensure parties are making effective progress in negotiations.Haldane is a practising lawyer and holds a master of laws degree in constitutional law from Osgoode Hall Law School at York University. Haldane is a member of the Sparrow family from Musqueam and is Tsimshian through Metlakatla.Quotes:Celeste Haldane, Chief Commissioner, BC Treaty Commission – “I am honoured to be reappointed by Canada, British Columbia and the First Nations Summit and to continue serving as Chief Commissioner. Although these are challenging times, negotiations of treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements must be a priority. Investing in reconciliation and Indigenous self-governance empowers healthy and prosperous regions throughout British Columbia. There have been significant milestones in negotiations, including the new rights recognition policy, and the Treaty Commission looks forward to supporting this momentum. I also want to recognize the hard work of all the parties to pivot during these times and maintain progress towards reconciliation.”Carolyn Bennett, federal Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations – “Over the last three years, Celeste Haldane has helped facilitate treaty negotiations in a fair and neutral manner. We are pleased that she will continue to lead the BC Treaty Commission in this important work in British Columbia. We look forward to continuing to work together with the commission and our partners, the Province of British Columbia and the First Nations Summit, to advance reconciliation and support treaty negotiations in B.C. for the benefit of those who live in Canada.”Scott Fraser, B.C.'s Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation –“The BC Treaty Commission serves a vital role in this province, particularly as an independent, impartial party to the treaty process. On behalf of the Province of British Columbia, I congratulate Celeste Haldane on her reappointment as Chief Commissioner and look forward to continuing our shared journey on the path to reconciliation.”Cheryl Casimer, First Nations Summit Task Group –“Canada, British Columbia and the First Nations Summit passed the Recognition and Reconciliation of Rights Policy for Treaty Negotiations in British Columbia in the fall of 2019. This new policy is founded on the recognition of Indigenous title and rights and provides for co-development of mandates. We are confident that Chief Commissioner Haldane’s extensive background in, and knowledge of, the B.C. treaty process will help guide us through uncharted waters as Canada, British Columbia and the First Nations Summit work towards implementing this transformative new policy.”Robert Phillips, First Nations Summit Task Group –“The First Nations Summit congratulates Celeste Haldane on her reappointment as Chief Commissioner of the BC Treaty Commission. We look forward to working with Chief Commissioner Haldane and have every confidence in her ability to work together with other Commissioners to ensure fair and equitable treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements are negotiated in British Columbia.”Lydia Hwitsum, First Nations Summit Task Group –“The experience and continuity that Chief Commissioner Haldane brings to the role of Chief Commissioner will assist Canada, British Columbia and First Nations in continuing to advance treaty negotiations in the face of technological and other challenges resulting from the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures.”

To help save more lives and ensure people who use drugs alone have access to the supports they need, the Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA), in partnership with regional health authorities and Lifeguard Digital Health, is launching a new made-in-B.C. resource called the Lifeguard App.The App is another tool in the province’s tool box to ensure a comprehensive response to the overdose crisis in British Columbia.“The launch of this new resource couldn’t have come at a better time,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “As we face down two public health emergencies – the overdose crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic – we must ensure that people who use drugs have the resources they need, when and where they need them. Knowing that the majority of people who use drugs use alone in shelters, hotels, or at home, in addition to the challenges of physical distancing, the Lifeguard App is a new and innovative approach that can directly link people to emergency responders if an overdose does occur.” The App is activated by the user before they take their dose. After 50 seconds the App will sound an alarm. If the user doesn’t hit a button to stop the alarm, indicating they are fine, the alarm grows louder. After 75 seconds a text-to-voice call will go straight to 9-1-1, alerting emergency medical dispatchers of a potential overdose.The Lifeguard App is now being added to the list of essential health and social sector interventions as part of the Overdose Emergency Response Centre’s comprehensive response to the sustained and widespread overdose activity in BC. The App will be launched in regional health authorities in a phased approach between now and early June.“This is a tool that specifically supports those who are most at risk of overdose death – people who use alone” said Susan Wannamaker, PHSA’s Executive Vice President of Clinical Service Delivery. “PHSA is working hard with all our harm reduction experts and partners in government and regional health authorities to identify and implement innovative solutions to reduce the heartbreaking loss of life caused by this ongoing crisis.”PHSA, BC Emergency Health Services, Vancouver Coastal Health, the Overdose Emergency Response Centre and other regional health authorities have been working closely with Lifeguard Health during the past two years to test and pilot the App in controlled environments.“We have been working on this life-saving application for over two years to ensure it will effectively help to reduce some of the harm caused by the overdose crisis by enabling drug users to be active participants,” said Jeff Hardy, CEO and founder of Lifeguard Digital Health.“BC Ambulance paramedics and their firefighter first responder partners are often first on the scene when people overdose alone, and they see the devastating impact, so that’s why we said an enthusiastic yes to testing out this App during the past two years,” said BCEHS’ project lead Neil Lilley.People who use drugs are encouraged to use with a friend and to use overdose prevention services and supervised consumption sites where they are available. The Lifeguard App is an integral part of A Pathway to Hope, B.C.’s roadmap for making mental health and addictions care better for people in British Columbia. Implementing A Pathway to Hope is a shared B.C. government priority with the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.The Lifeguard App can be downloaded at both the App Store (apps.apple.com)  and Google Play. (play.google.com) The Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA) plans, manages and evaluates selected specialty and province-wide health care services across BC, working with the five geographic health authorities to deliver province-wide solutions that improve the health of British Columbians.

The effects of COVID-19 have been far reaching. Everybody in our province has been impacted, as well as everybody across Canada and around the globe. We have learned a lot about the virus, how it spreads and how nations around the world are managing outbreaks.However, there are still many questions that we need to answer and understand, including the impacts of the measures that we have taken to control COVID-19 in B.C. and flatten the curve. This is why we recently launched a provincewide survey, Your story, our future, to gather feedback from British Columbians on your experiences and actions you have taken so far in the COVID-19 pandemic in B.C.This is a collaboration of B.C. public health experts, our health authority medical health officers, the BC Centre for Disease Control and Provincial Health Services Authority, as well as the provincial health officer. The information you share with us will help inform the public health decisions that we make in the weeks and months ahead.As part of the survey, there is also an opportunity for you to express your interest in participating in further studies, including a serology blood test study to determine immunity within our province.So far, over 275,000 British Columbians have completed the survey, which is an outstanding response, and we would like to hear from even more: younger, older, in the north, south, east and west. It is only a few minutes of your time, but it will make a huge difference.And, if you have already completed the survey, help someone else to do the same. If you know of a senior who may have difficulty completing the survey, reach out and provide some assistance. If English is not your first language, you can complete the survey by phone in 150 languages.Your feedback and your story will help us understand how the pandemic has affected you so far and make decisions on our future here in British Columbia.For the Your story, our future survey, visit: www.bccdc.ca/covid19survey

Work will soon begin at the intersection of highways 93 and 95 to replace the existing four-way stop with a roundabout, improving safety and traffic flow through the area.“We are making historic investments in good projects that create jobs in the short term and help communities such as Radium Hot Springs build safer and more efficient roadways,” said Catherine McKenna, federal Minister of Infrastructure and Communities. “We are pleased to see this important project get underway as soon as possible and look forward to continue working together to build a better, more prosperous and more resilient British Columbia and Canada.”Several times a year – particularly on long weekends and during the summer – this junction experiences high traffic volumes, resulting in lengthy delays and queues in excess of two kilometres. Replacing the four-way stop with a new roundabout will help keep traffic moving more efficiently and will cut down on delays.“BC’s Restart Plan is the first in a series of steps that we will take together to protect people and ensure that our province can come back from COVID-19 stronger than before,” said Claire Trevena, B.C.’s Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “This includes good construction-based jobs for people and investing in key projects that will help stimulate economic recovery for British Columbia. We are moving forward with several important highway projects this summer, including this roundabout for Radium, which will improve safety and prevent delays during the usually busy summer months.”Work is expected to get underway in June, and the project is slated for completion by the end of 2020. A contract for the construction has been awarded to Copcan Civil Ltd. of Nanaimo. During construction, every effort will be made to minimize disruption and impacts to local traffic, and updates will be provided via DriveBC.Businesses will remain pedestrian and vehicle accessible throughout project construction, either through existing or temporary access ways.B.C.’s provincial health officer has directed construction employers to take all necessary precautions to minimize the risks of COVID-19 transmission and illness to themselves and their employees. This includes ensuring workers maintain physical distance with a minimum of two metres apart from each other, both in the course of their duties as well as during breaks. Anyone exhibiting COVID-19 like symptoms will be directed to self-isolate at home for at least 10 days.This project is cost shared. The federal contribution of up to $4.8 million is part of a $17.9-million suite of projects under the New Building Canada Fund’s Provincial-Territorial Infrastructure Component-National and Regional Projects. The B.C. government is providing $7.1 million toward this intersection improvement.Quick Facts:
The intersection of highways 93 and 95 sees more than 9,000 vehicles daily, increasing to more than 14,000 every day during summer months.
An open house and online engagement were held in September 2019, giving people an opportunity to provide input on the project.

Government has taken action to support the province’s hospitality sector by temporarily authorizing the expansion of service areas, such as patios, to support physical distancing requirements and industry recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic.“This pandemic has hit our hospitality sector hard. Our government has been working with industry on ways to support the more than 180,000 British Columbians who work in pubs, restaurants and other parts of the sector,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “Speeding up the process will help restaurants, pubs, breweries and other licensees, and give British Columbians more options for safely eating out this summer, while continuing to follow Dr. Henry’s directions.”To support businesses in their reopening efforts, the Liquor and Cannabis Regulation branch (LCRB) will now permit food-primary, liquor-primary and manufacturer licensees, such as wineries, breweries and distilleries, to apply through a simplified online process to temporarily expand their service areas until Oct. 31, 2020.The temporary authorizations are focused on expanding a licensed service area’s footprint only and will not permit an increase in an establishment’s overall occupancy. Licensees must comply with all local bylaws and liquor-primary and manufacturer licensees must also receive the approval of their local government.There are no fees associated with the temporary expansion applications, which will be reviewed in the order they are received using an expedited approval process for faster processing times. While there will not be a site inspection prior to approval of the permit, inspectors will conduct regular compliance inspections.“This is excellent news that will be welcomed by all of our members and by businesses throughout B.C.,” said Ian Tostenson, president and CEO, B.C. Restaurant and Foodservices Association. “This pandemic has created unprecedented challenges for all of us, and it has been invaluable for government and industry to work together as they have, as we take these important steps toward recovery.

Close to 40 new supportive homes are coming to Surrey as construction has begun on Peterson Place, providing permanent homes for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness.“When people have housing and the supports they need, it makes our community safer and healthier,” said Bruce Ralston, MLA for Surrey-Whalley. “Everyone deserves good, secure housing and this project will provide permanent homes for people to call their own.”Located at 13245 King George Blvd., Peterson Place will consist of 38 studio units, each with a private washroom and kitchen. The building will also include a commercial kitchen, dining and lounge areas, storage and amenity space, laundry and a medical room.Peterson Place is part of a commitment between the Province and the City of Surrey to deliver 250 permanent supportive modular homes to replace the current temporary sites in the community. Peterson Place is the first project under construction as part of this commitment.“With construction beginning today on Peterson Place, we are on our way to providing permanent, safe and meaningful housing to our most vulnerable residents,” said Doug McCallum, mayor of Surrey. “This project illustrates the dedication of various levels of government and organizations working together to end the cycle of homelessness. I want to thank everyone involved for bringing this project from idea to reality.”  Fraserside Community Services Society (FCSS) will operate the new housing with supports. It will provide residents with 24/7 on-site staff and support services, including meal programs, life and employment skills training, health and wellness support services and opportunities for volunteer work.""We are thrilled that even during these uncertain pandemic times, this project is moving ahead,” said Lynda Edmonds, CEO of FCSS. “We are thankful that the Province and the City of Surrey recognize the importance of safe and secure housing for people experiencing homelessness. The addition of 38 new units and the expansion of on-site services, including access to daily meals and counselling, will have a significant and positive impact on the lives of residents at Peterson Place and in creating broader communities of belonging for all people in Surrey.""Construction is expected to be complete by the end of summer 2020, with residents moving in during the fall.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:
The Province will provide $11.3 million to the project as part of the Homelessness Action Plan, as well as a startup budget of $100,000 and an annual ongoing operating subsidy of $732,000.
In addition to these homes, the Province has worked with partners to open 161 supportive homes for people experiencing homelessness in Surrey over the last two years. An additional 330 supportive homes are currently underway.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we have 12 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 2,479 cases in British Columbia.""There are 307 active cases of COVID-19 in the province, and 2,020 people who tested positive have recovered.""Of the total COVID-19 cases, 43 individuals are hospitalized, eight of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.""Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 887 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,223 in the Fraser Health region, 126 in the Island Health region, 183 in the Interior Health region and 60 in the Northern Health region.""We are saddened to report three new COVID-19 related deaths, one in the Vancouver Coastal Health region and two in the Fraser Health region, for a total of 152 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to the family, friends and caregivers of these individuals, as well as to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.""There have been no new health-care outbreaks, and the outbreak at the Windermere Care Centre has now been declared over. In total, 14 long-term care or assisted-living facilities and three acute-care units have active outbreaks.“The Mountain Institution, a federal corrections facility, has one confirmed case of COVID-19 in an inmate who had recently transferred from the Matsqui Institution. Fraser Health public health teams are investigating and assisting at both facilities.“The outbreak at United Poultry has been declared over. Public health teams continue to provide support at the remaining community outbreaks, including at the Oppenheimer Group, those in the poultry sector, at the Mission Institution and with those connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.“Our priority is the health and safety of British Columbians. Our personal circumstances are unique, but the actions we can take to protect each other and ourselves are the same.“As we progress safely into Phase 2 of BC's Restart Plan, we can all learn from the many people who have been working so hard to provide essential services, while keeping themselves and their households safe.“One example is the use of non-medical masks or cloth face coverings. As we have seen on public transit or in a barbershop, a non-medical mask keeps our droplets in and provides an extra layer of protection for people around us when it is difficult to keep a safe physical distance or when services require people to be in close contact for periods of time.“We must also continue to move slowly and with caution, and this is the approach that is being taken as child care centres reopen and schools resume some in-class learning.“Schools have strict protocols for enhanced infection prevention and workplace health and safety. Safe physical distancing measures will be in place, and anyone who is ill will not be allowed into any school.“Like all illnesses that can be transmitted through close contact, school communities are notified as part of active public health contact tracing when someone in the school community has a confirmed case. Any close contacts who are susceptible are also required to stay home and self-isolate.“If you are unsure or have questions, contact your family physician or 811 to help determine the best steps for you and your family.“The provincewide survey, Your story, our future, is an opportunity to share your personal experience with COVID-19 so far.

The Government of B.C. is inviting non-profit and Indigenous housing societies, First Nations, housing co-operatives and municipalities to propose new affordable housing projects for the second intake of the Building BC: Community Housing Fund.Announced in 2018 as part of the Province’s 10-year, $7-billion housing plan, the Community Housing Fund is an investment of $1.9 billion to build more than 14,000 mixed-income rental homes for middle- and low-income families and individuals. In less than two years, more than 5,200 homes have been completed, are under construction or in development through this program in more than 40 communities.The Province, through BC Housing, is opening the next request for proposals (RFP) for the Community Housing Fund. This RFP is the next step forward in the Province‘s 10-year plan and will fund approximately 3,000 new affordable homes.“During these extraordinary times, it is clearer than ever that safe, secure and affordable housing is critical for all British Columbians,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “These new projects will deliver urgently needed rental homes for people, while also creating good jobs and supporting B.C.’s economic recovery.”The Community Housing Fund supports mixed-income buildings where 20% of the units are for households with very low incomes (including those on income assistance), 50% of the units are for households with incomes up to $64,000 and 30% of the units are for households with incomes up to approximately $74,000.Organizations are invited to submit project proposals to BC Housing beginning on May 27, 2020. The RFP will remain open until mid-January 2021. However, organizations are encouraged to apply early as an initial round of projects will be approved in fall 2020.Funding is available to groups that applied for the first round of funding though the Community Housing Fund and to those who have applied for other Building BC funds. All Building BC funding programs are open to First Nations.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Jill Atkey, CEO, BC Non-Profit Housing Association –“We applaud the Government of B.C. for prioritizing affordable housing in the midst of a global pandemic that has demonstrated just how critical housing is to our individual and collective health. These investments matter more than ever, and the community housing sector is ready and willing to partner on delivering these affordable homes in communities right across the province.”Thom Armstrong, CEO, Co-operative Housing Federation of B.C. –“This is very welcome news, and not a moment too soon. There is no better tonic for an economy in recovery mode than good jobs and affordable homes. This announcement promises both, and the community housing sector will be pleased to partner with the Province in delivering thousands of affordable homes for people who need them most.”Margaret Pfoh, CEO, Aboriginal Housing Management Association (AHMA) –“AHMA is confident in the innovation, determination and creativity that our members will submit in their RFPs for the Community Housing Fund. Our members make up one-third of all Indigenous housing providers in Canada, and together we look forward to continuing our work with the Province to create culturally appropriate and affordable housing so that every Indigenous person in B.C. can have a place to call home.”Learn More:Information about the Building BC: Community Housing Fund can be found here: http://www.bchousing.org/CHFA map showing the location of all announced provincially funded housing projects in B.C. is available online: https://www.bchousing.org/homes-for-BCTo learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/A backgrounder follows.

Construction of a new bridge to replace the existing three culverts under 8th Street in downtown Dawson Creek will start in early June. The bridge is designed to make travel safer and more efficient for people who live and work in the region, especially during freshet season.“The 2016 floods caused a lot of hardship for people in the Peace District, and we want to make sure our infrastructure can withstand future flooding,” said Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “I am proud of the work we have done throughout the province to safeguard our communities.” The contractor, Brocor Construction Ltd., will begin by relocating municipal water and sewer lines to a location below the creek. Bridge construction will begin after the utilities are complete and functioning.Once built, the new 45-metre-long bridge will maintain the existing road configuration, with five lanes for traffic and sidewalks on both sides of the road for pedestrians. The project, budgeted for $28 million, is expected to be complete in 2023.“We are extremely excited to see the construction of the 8th Street bridge begin this year,” said Dale Bumstead, mayor of Dawson Creek. “The project has been an important piece of the infrastructure improvement for our community and region to assist in the overall flood mitigation work the City of Dawson Creek has been focused on for our city. The importance of the 8th Street bridge project cannot be overstated, and we appreciate the support of the Province of B.C. in completing this important project.”During construction, two lanes will remain open on the existing structure to allow traffic to flow along Highway 2. Drivers are advised to follow instructions of traffic control personnel and obey the construction zone speed limit.The ministry is working closely with the contractor and WorkSafeBC to ensure health and safety are maintained for all workers on site.The B.C. provincial health officer has directed construction employers to take all necessary precautions to minimize the risks of COVID-19 transmission and illness to themselves and their employees. Anyone exhibiting COVID-19 like symptoms, such as sore throat, fever, sneezing or coughing, will be directed to self-isolate at home for at least 10 days.Learn More:For travel restrictions and precautions due to COVID-19, visit: http://ow.ly/jBGu50yVMRO For guidance to construction sites operating during COVID-19, visit: http://ow.ly/P7WS50z8hNTFor the most up-to-date highway travel information, visit: www.DriveBC.ca

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we have 21 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 2,467 cases in British Columbia.“There are 317 active cases of COVID-19 in the province, and 2,001 people who tested positive have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 43 individuals are hospitalized, 10 of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 885 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,214 in the Fraser Health region, 126 in the Island Health region, 182 in the Interior Health region and 60 in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report three new COVID-19 related deaths: one in the Vancouver Coastal Health region and two in the Fraser Health region, for a total of 149 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to the family, friends and caregivers of these individuals, as well as to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.“There has been one new health-care outbreak at The Cedars in Mission assisted-living facility. Both outbreaks at Ridge Meadows Hospital have now been declared over. In total, 15 long-term care or assisted-living facilities and three acute-care units have active outbreaks.“Public health teams continue to provide support for community outbreaks at the Oppenheimer Group, those in the poultry sector, at the Mission Institution and with those connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.“Every step in BC’s Restart Plan has been given careful thought and consideration to ensure the health and safety of British Columbians comes first.“Our ‘new normal’ is different from the way we have done things before, but we can reopen our schools and our businesses, and increase our connections in a way that is safe for everyone.“Today, the federal government spoke to the use of non-medical masks or cloth face coverings in public settings. When it is difficult to keep a safe physical distance for an extended period of time - for example, when you are on transit - this is a good way for you to protect those around you.“We have to remember that face coverings keep our droplets in and don’t prevent transmission from others. The best ways for us to stay safe is to wash our hands, maintain a safe physical distance from others and keep our ‘rules’ for social interactions top of mind.“The provincewide Your story, our future survey is an opportunity to share your personal experience with COVID-19 so far.

The Government of B.C., the City of Kelowna and Canadian Mental Health Association Kelowna are working in partnership to build close to 40 new urgently needed supportive homes for people experiencing homelessness in Kelowna.“The need for safe and secure housing has never been clearer, and these new homes will give more people a place to call their own,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “We are working quickly and urgently with our partners to protect all British Columbians during the COVID-19 crisis, including our province’s most vulnerable – because when people have housing, it’s good for everyone in the community.”Located at 1055 and 1063 Ellis St., the three-storey modular apartment building will include 38 self-contained studio units with private washrooms, showers and kitchens. The building will also include a commercial kitchen, dining and lounge areas, storage and amenity space, laundry and a medical room.To help people move from the streets and shelters into this safe and secure housing, the city and the Province are working together to expedite the building process and removing the requirement of municipal rezoning. The current lease is for 10 years, and the property will go through the municipal rezoning process if the lease is extended beyond that.“Homelessness is an evolving, dynamic crisis in our community, and these kinds of partnerships go a long way towards creating solutions,” said Colin Basran, mayor, City of Kelowna. “This is a strategic land investment that will not only create much needed solutions in the short term, but also has long-term potential with a future land use designation for multi-storey residential housing. In addition to being close to downtown, this property is ideally located adjacent to existing municipal park space and could fulfil many different civic objectives after expiry of the lease.”BC Housing supports the city in its commitment to the Journey Home Strategy, focusing on ending chronic and episodic homelessness, introducing measures to prevent homelessness in the first place and implementing a co-ordinated systems approach to homelessness.“To provide people with the support and services they need to begin their recovery journey, they first need a place to call home,” said Stephanie Ball, executive director, Central Okanagan Journey Home Society. “This is a welcome addition to the over 100 units of housing with supports already planned to come on stream over the next two years as we work to meet the goals of Kelowna’s five-year plan to address homelessness.”The Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA) Kelowna will operate the new housing. It will provide residents with 24/7 on-site staff and support services, including meal programs, life and employment skills training, health and wellness support services and opportunities for volunteer work.“Access to safe and stable housing is a crucial first step needed for anyone who experiences homelessness so they can begin to get their feet back under them,” says Shelagh Turner, executive director, CMHA Kelowna. “We are proud to be the operators of this building and our other supportive housing in Kelowna so we can be there to help end the cycle of homelessness.”Site preparation work will start in June, with construction expected to be complete in fall 2020.Quick Facts:
The Province will provide $9.5 million to the project through the Supportive Housing Fund, as well as an annual operating subsidy of $1.3 million.
In addition to these homes, the Province has worked with partners to open 136 supportive homes for people experiencing homelessness in Kelowna over the last two years. This includes 50 homes at Samuel Place, 40 at Heath House and 46 at Hearthstone. An additional 138 supportive homes are currently underway.
More than 2,700 spaces in hotels, motels and community centres across B.C. have been secured to help vulnerable people during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Kelowna, BC Housing has secured 80 spaces to date for vulnerable people in the community.

Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction, has issued the following statement regarding tent encampments in Victoria at Topaz Park and Pandora Avenue:“Since April 25, 2020, 308 people experiencing homelessness in Victoria’s Topaz Park and Pandora corridor have been moved into safe temporary housing. The housing provided includes wraparound services such as daily meals, support with mental health and addictions challenges, and help with finding more permanent housing solutions.“All 360 people who were camped at Topaz Park and along Pandora Avenue as of April 25 have been offered indoor accommodation. People continue to actively move into temporary accommodation today, and we will co-ordinate with the City of Victoria as we move people out and close the sites over the coming days.“I want to thank the dozens of people who have been involved in this partnership, including staff from BC Housing, the City of Victoria, Island Health, the Province, service providers, peer support workers and outreach workers. All have approached this massive effort to house people with compassion and care, providing people with choices that best suit their individual needs.“These actions were taken to protect the health and safety of people living in the encampments as well as the front-line workers supporting them. Moving people from these encampments to temporary safe and secure housing is a major step in the Province’s effort to support our most vulnerable people during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.“We also continue to work with the additional people who have since moved into the area to provide them with shelter and housing options. Outside of the encampments, there are still many people in Victoria who need housing and support services. Outreach workers continue to register people on the housing registry. A resource guide has also been developed so people have information on safe places to shelter, access hygiene, harm reduction, health care and food services.“In Victoria, as in communities around the province, our work is not done. Throughout B.C., we have more than 23,000 homes already underway or complete as part of our 10-year housing plan, and there are more to come. As part of that, we are working towards creating longer term and permanent housing solutions with ongoing supports so that after the pandemic, people do not return to homelessness but instead are able to build a better and more comfortable life. This work will continue in the months and years ahead.”

In a world where we are isolated at home, what happens when home is a place of violence, intimidation, threats and fear?We know that in times of crisis, domestic violence can increase.That’s why our government has secured nearly 300 additional spaces in communities throughout British Columbia for people leaving violent situations during the pandemic, with more spaces to come. Most are women, two-spirit people and children.Domestic violence is sadly commonplace and occurs behind closed doors in all communities and cultures. Sometimes it starts with insults or verbal abuse and unwanted sexual demands. It can escalate to punching walls, throwing objects, threatening children, physical violence and death.From volunteering at a women’s transition house, to my role as a child protection worker, as a national manager at the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, and then an executive director in British Columbia, I have always served families, women and others impacted by abuse.Having worked in the social sector for over 30 years, I have heard too many stories from women about the horrors that can happen at home. Every story is different, but everyone in these situations needs to know help is available. Every person facing domestic violence needs to know it is not their fault.Abusers often use threats and violence, while others use money, as their means of control.A young mom I knew through my work was in an abusive relationship. He did massive damage to her home before she was able to get him out. Repairs cost her a fortune. What was even more difficult to repair was the psychological impact of his violence.I know another woman who was never allowed by her husband to have her own bank account. As part of her safety plan, she began to secretly save money so she could leave. Her abuser found this out and took her cash so he could maintain his control.I recently met a woman whose partner put a gun up to her head in front of their children. She survived that night. Some do not.Hundreds of women are admitted to B.C. hospitals each year with severe injuries caused by their partners. In an average year, 12 lives are tragically lost to domestic violence.As government, it’s our job to make sure that when people ask for help in leaving violence, we provide a safe place for them to go. In 2018, we made the first significant investment in transition housing in over two decades.Through the Women’s Transition Housing Fund, the Province is investing in creating 1,500 new transition house beds, safe homes and second-stage homes so that there are places for women and children to sleep safely at night. Unfortunately, we are playing catch-up because of years of unmet needs.The COVID-19 virus has forced us to stay home and keep our distance from friends and family, creating a perfect storm for the escalation of abuse. More than ever, people facing violence or abuse – many with children – need our help to find a safe place to stay.If you are in immediate danger, please call 911 immediately.If you or someone you know is being abused, or if you are concerned about someone’s safety, contact VictimLink BC through its toll-free 24/7 confidential, multilingual telephone service at 1 800 563-0808
Or by email: VictimLinkBC@bc211.caVictimLink BC’s trained victim service workers can provide immediate crisis support for victims of family or sexual violence. They can also connect you to safe housing, provide information and referral services for all victims of crime.Domestic and sexual abuse is not a private matter to be kept behind closed doors. Violence against women should never be tolerated – not during this pandemic, not ever.As government, we will be there for people who need our help and a safe place to go, day or night.

Government has issued two emergency orders that temporarily suspend in-person execution requirements for wills and personal planning instruments, including representation agreements and enduring powers of attorney.The emergency orders address concerns raised by the legal community, including the regulatory bodies and representative associations for lawyers and notaries public, as well as by members of the public, regarding the requirement that such legal documents be executed and witnessed in person.The new orders benefit both legal professionals and their clients, particularly seniors and immuno-compromised people who may be hesitant to travel into more populated areas during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as British Columbians who live in rural and remote areas and are trying to limit travel outside of their communities.Under the orders, which are effective as of May 19, 2020, careful safeguards will be established to reduce fraud, including ensuring legal professionals (lawyers and notaries public) are involved in remote execution; prescribing the circumstances in which documents can be executed remotely; and providing strict parameters and requirements around remote execution.The emergency orders are tied to the provincial state of emergency and will expire when it is lifted.Learn More:Read the emergency orders here:http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/mo/mo/2020_m161http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/mo/mo/2020_m162For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit:  http://www.bccdc.ca/

The design for the Highway 14 Realignment Project has been updated following feedback from people who live and work in the Sooke area, and the Consultation Summary Report has been released.The project design was open for public feedback from Dec. 3, 2019, to Jan. 15, 2020. On Dec. 3, 150 people attended an open house in Sooke to look at proposed designs and provide feedback. The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure also received 200 submissions online, by email and letter.Public input has led to the following updates to the design of the Connie Road to Glinz Lake Road portion of the project:
A new pedestrian underpass will be added to Highway 14 just east of Glinz Lake Road/Polymede Place to support active transportation in the region.
New eastbound and westbound bus bays will be added to Highway 14 at Glinz Lake Road/Polymede Place to better serve transit users.
The proposed Cooper’s Cove U-turn has been removed. Instead, a connector road between Manzer Road and Gillespie Road will allow Manzer Road residents access and egress from the highway via the new Gillespie Road grade-separated intersection.
This connector will provide an alternative emergency detour connection for Highway 14 between Glinz Lake Road and Gillespie Road. 

Culvert sizes will be increased to accommodate crossings of amphibians and mammals.
Median barriers with road-level holes will be strategically placed to help keep small mammals from being trapped on the highway.
Approximately 30 streetlights will be added near side-road intersections to improve visibility for drivers. 
Updated project designs and the Consultation Summary Report are available on the project web page: www.gov.bc.ca/highway14The Highway 14 Improvement Project includes:
widening and realigning approximately 1.5 kilometres of road between Glinz Lake Road and Connie Road;
a new ""park and ride"" lot on Gillespie Road; and
pavement resurfacing and shoulder widening along over 10 kilometres between Otter Point Road and Woodhaven Road. 
The portion of the project from Otter Point Road to Woodhaven Road will be tendered this spring. Following completion of the final design, the Highway 14 realignment will go to tender this summer.These corridor improvements total $85.7 million, with the Government of Canada contributing up to $30,233,000 through the New Building Canada Fund and the Government of British Columbia providing up to $55,482,000.

Health and social service workers delivering in-person, front-line care to some of B.C.’s most vulnerable people will receive a financial boost through temporary COVID-19 pandemic pay.“From care aids to domestic violence workers, to people working in corrections and others delivering essential addictions and mental health supports, our front-line workers are providing vital support to people who are most vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Carole James, Minister of Finance. “Temporary pandemic pay recognizes all that our health and social service workers do to help keep people healthy, our communities running and deliver important care and services to the most vulnerable during this challenging time.”As part of a cost-shared program with the federal government, temporary pandemic pay will support people working on the front lines in B.C.’s health-care system, social services and corrections. This includes workers delivering a range of health and social services to people most vulnerable to COVID-19.More than 250,000 eligible front-line workers will receive temporary pandemic pay, a lump-sum payment of about $4 per hour for a 16-week period, starting on March 15, 2020. Eligible workers will receive the payment directly through their employer and do not need to apply.“People at the front lines of the pandemic are working tirelessly to keep us and our loved ones healthy, while also delivering services to the most vulnerable in our community,” James said. “This cost-shared program with the federal government will benefit thousands of British Columbia’s front-line health and social service workers.”Temporary pandemic pay is part of government’s $5-billion COVID-19 Action Plan to provide relief to people, communities and businesses in British Columbia. It builds off the planned minimum wage increase set for June 1, 2020, and existing supports for people during the COVID-19 pandemic, including the B.C. Emergency Benefit for Workers and the enhanced B.C. Climate Action Tax Credit boost in July 2020, which doubles the annual benefit for low- and middle-income people.Learn More:To learn more about temporary COVID-19 pandemic pay, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/pandemicpayTo learn more about the supports and services available for people, businesses and communities through the pandemic, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVIDgovernmentbenefitsFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are providing case updates for two 24-hour reporting periods: May 16 to May 17, and May 17 to midday today.“In the first reporting period through May 17, we had eight new cases. In the last 24 hours, we have had a further eight new cases.“This represents 16 new cases since we reported on Saturday, for a total of 2,444 cases in British Columbia.""There are 335 active cases of COVID-19 in the province, and 1,966 people who tested positive have recovered.""Of the total COVID-19 cases, 47 individuals are hospitalized, 12 of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.""Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 882 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,195 in the Fraser Health region, 126 in the Island Health region, 181 in the Interior Health region and 60 in the Northern Health region.“We extend our heartfelt sympathies to the family and friends of Capt. Jennifer Casey, of the Royal Canadian Air Force. Our thoughts are also with Capt. Richard MacDougall. We wish him a swift recovery from his injuries.“Canada’s Snowbirds bring Canadians together, and the loss that felt by all us is great. We thank the Snowbirds and the Canadian Armed Forces for all that you do, and we stand beside you in sorrow and in strength.“In addition to this tragic loss, we are saddened to report two new COVID-19 related deaths, one in the Vancouver Coastal Health region and one in the Fraser Health region, for a total of 143 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to the family, friends and caregivers of these individuals, as well as to everyone who has lost their loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic.""There have been no new health-care outbreaks and the outbreak at the Dufferin Care Centre has now been declared over. In total, 14 long-term care or assisted-living facilities and five acute-care units have active cases.“Public health teams are also continuing to provide support for community outbreaks at the Oppenheimer Group, those in the poultry sector, at the Mission Institution and with those connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.“The physical, financial and emotional strain of the COVID-19 pandemic is difficult for everyone. The transition into Phase 2 brings both anticipation and further apprehension as our businesses and schools look to re-open.“We are all learning the new ways of safe social interaction – doing things that we have never had to do before – and we ask you to show patience with yourself and with those around you as we enter this new phase.“The stress of this can be challenging and the impact harmful. For people exeriencing family or intimate-partner violence, support is available 24/7 through VictimLinkBC and 1 800 563-0808.“For youth who may be struggling, the Kids Help Phone is available by phone, text and online at 1 800 668-6868 or Kidshelpphone.ca to get the help you may need.“Every day, we can and must do our part to hold the line on COVID-19. Every day, pause and think about how you’re going to keep yourself and those around you safe.“If you are using transit, or going into a smaller store, consider using a cloth face mask to protect others. Simple things can make a big difference.“Only you know your own risks and the precautions you need to take. Our well-being and our future is in our hands, so let’s continue to wash them.”Learn More:For the Your Story, Our Future survey, visit: www.bccdc.ca/covid19survey.

Premier John Horgan has released the following statement about racist activity in British Columbia during the COVID-19 pandemic:“Everyone has a right to live without fear of violence or discrimination. Yet we are hearing disturbing stories of a rise in anti-Asian racist behaviour since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.“People are being targeted as they go about their daily lives. It is unacceptable. I have said it before: hate has no place in our province and it will not be tolerated. Our strength is in our diversity and we reject all forms of racism, discrimination, intolerance and bigotry.“Racism is also a virus. Through challenging times, British Columbians must stay united. We are always stronger and more resilient as a province when we treat each other with kindness, generosity and respect. To do so, we must all stand together to call out racism and discrimination when we see it.”

We also recognize that young people growing up queer, trans and two-spirit are still at a higher risk of experiencing abuse and homelessness.“Our government is working to make sure our services are delivered in a way that is inclusive and respectful of people of all genders and sexual orientations. We support sexual orientation and gender-identity education in schools, have re-established the human rights commission and implemented a gender-X option for provincial identifications.“We have also expanded gender-affirming surgeries throughout the province – because every person deserves access to health-care services that meet their needs. As we work together on our COVID-19 pandemic response plan, we recognize that there are transgender people who have had gender-affirming surgeries delayed. We know this is very difficult for those who have been waiting for this important care.“Together, we will get through this, and together we will build a province where everyone can live without fear of violence or discrimination because of who they are or who they love.”For a French translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.17_STM_Day_Against_Homophobia_Transphobia_Biphobia_FR.pdf

B.C. child care professionals are finding creative ways to stay connected and support the children and families in their community during the COVID-19 pandemic.It's a good example of why May is Child Care Month in B.C., honouring the work of thousands of child care professionals throughout the province.When Coast Mountain Children’s Society in Terrace decided to stay open to care for the children of essential service workers, staff knew they also needed to find ways to care for the children at their centre who would be staying home with their parents during the pandemic.“That’s how our busy bags began,” says Cindy Hall, manager and early childhood educator. Busy bags is a unique program where parents from across the community drop by to pick up free activity bags that are pinned to the fence each weekday.“What started off as a project to help our children feel happy at home and connected to their friends and teachers has morphed into something pretty awesome,” says Hall.With over 60 busy bags created every week, Hall and her small team of busy bees change the contents by combining simple ideas with supplies from a well-stocked art room, so children always have something new to make.“So far, our bags have included beading activities; make-your-own book projects; create-your-own whiteboard with reusable activity sheets; colour-matching games made with popsicle sticks; and some birdseed and a pinecone to make bird feeders. We even made over 8,000 batches of playdough to go along with playdough tools. And we always include a little note to let children know we are thinking of them,” says Hall.For Easter, the educators delivered over 200 special activity bags directly to the children who attend the centre. It gave them a chance to see the children in person, at a safe distance. “This is so fulfilling for us. We’re missing the kids just as much as they miss us and their friends,” says Hall.The response from the community has been overwhelming. “This is a challenging time for everyone,” says Hall. “Parents have told us how stressed they’ve been with children who are bored and longing for their buddies. These busy bags have provided kids with hours of entertainment and joy knowing that we’re thinking of them. We’ve received a ton of positive feedback, with dozens of messages of appreciation and photos. It’s wonderful to see our students and how they are using their creativity with the supplies provided to them.”It’s not just the centre’s child care professionals who are working to spread happiness and share community spirit. Inspired by their teachers, children from the centre are tapping into their own creativity to help brighten the days of those in a nearby seniors’ home. They’ve been busy decorating paper hearts and adding jokes, something they came up with by themselves, to provide a bit of laughter at a time of uncertainty.The centre is now thinking of other ways to keep children connected. Hall says, “We’ve had parents call and ask, ‘What song is that my kid is singing?’ and, ‘How do we do this certain activity?’ We’re looking at new opportunities for children to virtually connect and set up livestreaming activities like circle time and science experiments.” Learn More:In response to COVID-19, government has developed a child care referral system to help parents in essential service roles find licensed child care nearby.

The Government of B.C., the City of Prince Rupert and North Coast Transition Society (NCTS) have partnered to purchase a building that will provide new, permanent, supportive housing for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness. “Homelessness affects not only those experiencing it, but also the community as a whole,” said Jennifer Rice, MLA for North Coast. “We’re excited to work with our partners to convert this building into new supportive homes for people in Prince Rupert. These homes with supports will help people experiencing homelessness to regroup and recover, and the benefits will extend into the community.”The Province, through BC Housing, has purchased the former Raffles Inn motel at 1080 3rd Ave. and will convert it into a permanent supportive housing building with up to 48 units, each with private washrooms, showers and mini kitchens. The building will include a commercial kitchen, dining and lounge areas, storage and amenity space, laundry and a medical examination room.Once complete, this building will have the capacity for a 35-space temporary shelter or an extreme weather response shelter.“These new units of supportive housing will offer 24/7 support to our community's most vulnerable, including achieving economies of scale by integrating a temporary shelter as well,” said Lee Brain, mayor, Prince Rupert. “When the first supportive units opened at Crow’s Nest, they were immediately full, proving that the need exceeded the supply of available units. We are happy to be working with the Province to make this happen in Prince Rupert.”NCTS will operate the supportive housing building and will provide residents with 24/7 on-site staff and support services, including meal programs, life and employment skills training, health and wellness support services and opportunities for volunteer work.“We are very excited about this opportunity and much needed project that serve the needs of the most marginalized members of our community,” said Christine White, executive director, NCTS. “The people of Prince Rupert have been so generous and supportive of those living on the streets. We know that this will benefit the community as having a home and a safe place is a start for life-changing opportunities. BC Housing and MLA Jennifer Rice have been a huge support in this project, in addition to all our other community partners. We look forward to moving on with the project.”NCTS operates a 35-space temporary shelter at Fisherman’s Hall at 869 Fraser St. Once renovations at 1080 3rd Ave. are complete, all guests from the shelter will be transitioned to the new supportive housing. Construction will begin in fall 2020. The shelter portion of the building is expected to open in early 2021, with the supportive homes ready by fall 2021.Quick Facts:
The Province will provide $11.8 million to the project through the Supportive Housing Fund, as well as an annual operating subsidy of $1.2 million.
The Province worked with its partners to open the Crow’s Nest, a 36-unit modular supportive building for people experiencing homelessness in Prince Rupert in March 2019.
In response to COVID-19, more than 2,400 spaces in hotels, motels and community centres throughout B.C. have been secured for vulnerable people to reside. In Prince Rupert, BC Housing has identified one site with 35 spaces as temporary accommodation for vulnerable people in the community.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, has issued the following statement about travel during the May long weekend.“The May long weekend is the unofficial start of summer that we look forward to throughout the year. It’s often the start of road trips, camping and spending more time outside with our friends and families.“This long weekend is different. A global pandemic puts us all at risk – and we all must stay in our local communities and stay at a safe physical distance from others when outside.“The good news is because of your efforts and sacrifice so far, you can now start to expand your circle slowly, but keep your group small, always keeping in mind ‘fewer faces and bigger spaces.’ Outside is ideal.“You can have a backyard barbecue with another family, or a few close friends spread throughout the yard. Just remember not to share drinks or reach into the same chip bowl. Instead, prepare individual servings. You can also go for long walks and to local parks.“Spending a long weekend away from people we care about is difficult, but what we are doing matters to ensure more travel and freedom later. We will be able to enjoy fun spring and summer recreational activities again together, and they will come sooner if we just stay the course. Together, we are helping slow the spread of COVID-19.“Let me be clear. Staying in your local community this long weekend means no leisure road trips to cabins or to go boating – especially across our borders. Instead, I encourage everyone to reach out safely to local friends or families in your neighbourhood and to connect virtually with close ones living in other communities.“Please, continue to make every effort to protect loved ones, our Elders and our health-care workers.“Now, more than ever, we need to stay 100% all in.”

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are reporting 15 new cases, for a total of 2,407 cases in British Columbia.""There are 359 active cases of COVID-19 in the province, and 1,908 people who tested positive have recovered.""Of the total COVID-19 cases, 51 individuals are hospitalized, 12 of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.""Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 878 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,164 in the Fraser Health region, 126 in the Island Health region, 181 in the Interior Health region and 58 in the Northern Health region.""We are saddened to report five new COVID-19 related deaths, four in the Fraser Health region and one in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, for a total of 140 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to the family, friends and caregivers of these five individuals, and to everyone who has lost their loved ones.""There has been one new acute-care outbreak at the Abbotsford Regional Hospital. In total, 15 long-term care or assisted-living facilities and five acute-care units have active cases.“There has also been one new community outbreak with two confirmed cases at the Oppenheimer Group, a fruit and vegetable processing plant in Coquitlam. The public health investigation is ongoing, active contact tracing is underway and the plant remains open at this time.""Public health teams are also continuing to provide support for community outbreaks in the poultry sector, at the Mission Institution and with those connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.“We must continue to be measured and thoughtful with each step forward in our COVID-19 recovery. The new outbreaks demonstrate that there continues to be risk of COVID-19 in our communities.“We want a strong start, and to do that we need to stay local, stay apart and stay 100% committed to working together.“Our provincial parks are now open for day use. Spending the day in a nearby park is a great way to stay close to home this weekend and put our safe social interaction ‘rules’ into action.“Today, education and child care guidance was also released to allow schools to once again begin in-class learning on June 1 and prepare for a full return in September.“Our schools and daycares will look and feel different, but they will operate in the safest way possible for everyone – for staff, students and families.“From the start of this pandemic, British Columbians have demonstrated incredible compassion and care for our health-care workers, seniors, Elders and our communities. The result has been the flattening of our curve.

As British Columbia prepares to enter Phase 2 of its economic restart plan, the Province welcomes the release of the initial set of WorkSafeBC guidelines that will help businesses and organizations develop their plans to reopen safely in the coming days and weeks.“These guidelines are an important step in B.C.’s economic restart process, as they will support businesses and organizations developing their individual COVID-19 safety plans and measures to keep employees and customers safe,” said Harry Bains, Minister of Labour. “All employers must work with their employees to develop their safety plan to protect everyone as they prepare to reopen.”WorkSafeBC has released industry-specific guidelines and resources for the following sectors:
restaurants, cafes and pubs;
salons and personal services;
museums, art galleries and libraries, real estate;
education;
health services;
retail;
in-person counselling;
parks and outdoor spaces; and
office space.
Businesses in all sectors are required to use these guidelines and resources to develop their COVID-19 safety plans and post those plans for employees and customers as they resume operations. Additionally, businesses in sectors under health orders limiting service (such as restaurants, pubs, salons and personal services) will not be able to open until those orders are lifted or modified.“We all have a shared responsibility to build confidence amongst workers and customers, so everyone feels safe accessing businesses and services,” Bains said. “We know that businesses will open at their own pace, and I encourage them to proceed in a careful way ensuring safety measures are in place, effective and understood.”Outreach with all sectors continues in order to support the production of sector standards, which will provide additional guidance for businesses and help the sharing of best practices.WorkSafeBC indicated additional sector-specific guidelines will be available in the coming days for child care, health services, and recreation and sports.Learn More:Industry-specific guidance and resources are available online: https://www.worksafebc.com/en/about-us/covid-19-updates/covid-19-returning-safe-operationFor non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/Covid-19

Parents will have the choice of bringing their children back to class on a part-time basis this school year as part of BC’s Restart Plan, with the goal of returning to full-time classes in September 2020, provided it is safe to do so.“British Columbians have worked hard to flatten our curve. As we move into the next phase of our pandemic plan after the May long weekend, the science shows us that we’re ready to bring students back to school safely on a gradual and part-time basis,” said Premier John Horgan. “This will be welcome news for many families who have struggled to adjust to remote and online learning, and for parents who are going back to work. At every step, we will move slowly and make health and safety our top priority. B.C. has done well under the guidance of our provincial health officials, and now is the time to take this next step together.”To make sure schools are safe for students and staff, the number of students in school each day will be reduced, with most receiving in-class instruction part time. School districts will determine scheduling for classes and transportation arrangements. For kindergarten to Grade 5, this means most students will go to school half time (such as alternating days), while grades 6 to 12 will go to school about one day a week. Children of essential service workers and students needing additional supports will have the option to attend school full time. Families that decide not to send their children to class may continue learning from home.“School is the place where kids learn how to connect with others and grow together, and it’s incredibly important for students who need extra support to get more time with their teachers and support workers,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “We’ve looked at what measures other jurisdictions are putting in place and we’re taking direction from our provincial health officials, so students, educators and staff know we’re taking every precaution to protect their health and safety.”Health and safetyAll boards of education and independent school authorities will be required to implement strict provincial health officer and WorkSafeBC health and safety measures to reduce the risk COVID-19 transmission, including:
desks spaced apart and avoiding groups or gatherings of students in hallways or other common areas;
regular cleaning of high-contact surfaces like door knobs, toilet seats, keyboards and desks at least twice a day, and cleaning the school building at least once a day;
students, educators and staff will be required to clean their hands before entering school property, and there will be more hand-sanitizing and cleaning stations available, with well-stocked supplies;
staggered drop-offs, lunch and recess breaks, with increased outside time;
staff and students (or their parents/guardians) must assess themselves daily for symptoms of COVID-19. If any student or staff member has even mild symptoms, arrangements will be made for that person to be returned home;
one student per seat on school buses, unless children are from the same house. Consider using plexiglass to separate the bus driver from students; and
students or employees should not share food or personal items like phones, pens or pencils. Clear protocols also need to be in place for the safe and healthy handling of all food items. 
Gradual approachThe Ministry of Education has developed a five-stage approach to operate schools, depending on risk of transmission. Schools will also have plans in place for each stage, ensuring they are ready to make changes if there is a risk of transmission, a second wave or a community outbreak.Each school district and independent school must have its return-to-class and safety plans approved by the ministry before moving to the next stage. The plans will be posted on each district’s website for families to access. The ministry will support boards of education and independent school authorities in building these plans, and operations during the pandemic will be regularly monitored.   Since returning to class is voluntary and most students will be attending part time, school leaders will contact families to make arrangements for children to return to in-class instruction. If parents have not heard from their schools by May 22, 2020, they are asked to contact their principal. Parents and caregivers are advised to follow the schedule provided for their child to ensure a safe and orderly restart.Child careMany child care centres have continued to operate safely throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to support essential service workers in communities across B.C.Updated health and safety guidelines for child care settings released by the provincial health officer will support child care centres that were closed to reopen safely as they are able, and will reassure parents as they return to work that their children will be cared for in a safe environment.Information from the BC Centre for Disease Control states the COVID-19 virus has a very low infection rate in children. As well, children are not the primary drivers of COVID-19 spread in child care facilities, schools or in community settings. Like schools, child care centres will need to take additional precautions to maintain the health and safety of their employees and the children they care for.“We know that parents will continue to make the right child care decisions for their family, based on their individual circumstances, and providers will do the same for their centres and the child care professionals who work there,” said Katrina Chen, Minister of State for Child Care. “While we are giving the necessary tools to child care centres to operate safely, it is ultimately the choice of parents and providers.”New provincial health officer's guidelines for safely providing child care include:
maintaining the physical space requirements set out in the Child Care Licensing Regulation. Child care centres have sufficient space to support physical distancing between staff without reducing the number of children in care at any one time.
organizing children into smaller groups and/or spreading children out to minimize direct physical contact.
cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces at least twice a day. General cleaning of the centre should occur at least once a day with common cleaning and disinfectant products.
setting up hand-hygiene stations at the entrance, so children can clean their hands when they enter. If a sink with soap and water is not available, provide hand sanitizer but keep out of children’s reach and supervise its use. Additional hand-hygiene opportunities should be built into the daily schedule. 
staggering the timings of pickup and drop-off. A daily check at drop-off may be conducted by asking parents and caregivers to confirm their child does not have symptoms of common cold, influenza, COVID-19 or other respiratory disease. There is no role for screening children or staff for specific symptoms, checking temperatures or COVID-19 testing. Such activities are reserved for health-care professionals.  
having children outside often, including for learning activities, snack time and play time.
ensuring each child has their own individual meal or snack. Reusable utensils must be cleaned and sanitized after each use.
asking parents and caregivers to only bring personal comfort items (e.g., stuffies) if they are clean and can be laundered at the end of each day.
These guidelines will be complemented by WorkSafeBC guidelines for child care providers, which will be released next week.Working togetherAs B.C. takes steps towards a recovery by removing some of the restrictions, employers are encouraged to be flexible when it comes to arrangements for parents of school-age students.The Ministry of Education is working with all 60 school districts, independent school authorities, First Nations schools, teachers, school leaders, support staff, public health officials and all its education partners to co-ordinate the next steps for accommodating more students in class.“As we look to create our new normal, reopening our schools to in-class learning is an important step,” said Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer. “It will look different, but will be done in way that is safe for everyone. I want to assure all the staff, students and families that we will face the challenges that come with this transition together – and we will do it in a measured and thoughtful way.”Quick Facts:
There are about 5,000 students already in classrooms, including children of essential service workers and those who require extra support.
Government has invested over $90 million to support more than 2,600 child care centres to remain open and more than 1,400 centres that have closed so they can reopen in the future.
Science and research show that children under 19 are at low risk of transmitting COVID-19 and suspending schools only has modest impacts in minimizing the spread of the virus. 
The Ministry of Children and Family Development is providing temporary emergency funding to assist licensed child care centres to stay open, even with reduced enrolment, and to assist centres that temporarily close with fixed costs so they can reopen and serve families when able. 
Temporary emergency funding will continue to be in place and assessed on a go-forward basis, as schools and businesses reopen.

The Province has purchased the Comfort Inn Hotel, located at 3020 Blanshard St., to provide more affordable homes for people in Victoria.“Everyone deserves to have safe, stable housing they can afford, and this site offers great potential to deliver a mix of permanent housing to meet the needs of people in Victoria,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “This will further add to the significant efforts underway with community and local government partners in the Capital Regional District to tackle the housing crisis and build the homes people need.”The long-term use of the site will be determined through engagement with the community. In the short term, the building will provide approximately 65 rooms of temporary accommodations with wraparound supports for people currently living in encampments on the Pandora Avenue corridor and Topaz Park.“Often people experiencing homelessness are not able to access the support and services they need,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “The purchase of the Comfort Inn, combined with medical and social supports, will help people make the transition from the street to permanent housing.”BC Housing is partnering with Our Place to operate the building, which will start to receive people – referred by Island Health and BC Housing – in the coming days.“This is a substantial investment in our community and will provide housing for those who need it most,” said Lisa Helps, mayor, City of Victoria. “This site has significant redevelopment potential to provide a range of affordable housing in the long term. I look forward to working with the community and with BC Housing to determine the long-term use of this site.”People will have access to services, such as meals, health-care services, addictions treatment and harm reduction, storage for personal belongings and other supports, including 24/7 staffing to provide security to residents of the building and the surrounding neighbourhood.“Our Place is looking forward to partnering with BC Housing in this bold initiative to provide indoor accommodations for our street family during this health crisis,” said Grant McKenzie, director of communications, Our Place Society. “We intend to serve this vulnerable population with dignity while striving to be a good neighbour to the community.”BC Housing will set up a new community advisory committee that will include representatives from the Hillside Quadra and Burnside Gorge community associations and the surrounding community. This committee will oversee the supportive housing’s integration within the community and will address any concerns raised by people in the neighbourhood.From April 25 to May 13, 2020, 208 people from encampments on Pandora Avenue and in Topaz Park have moved into safe, temporary accommodations with supports to protect their health and safety in the overlapping COVID-19 and overdose crises.Quick Facts:
The B.C. government provided approximately $18.5 million to acquire the building.
The Province is working in partnership to build approximately 3,330 new affordable homes for people with a range of incomes in the Capital Regional District:
Housing for people with middle incomes: 121 homes
Housing for people with low to moderate incomes, including families, seniors and Indigenous peoples: 1,924 homes
Housing for women and children leaving violence: 39 homes
Housing for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness: 431 homes
Housing for students: 782 beds at the University of Victoria

Agriculture, seafood, and food processing businesses in British Columbia can begin to access consulting and planning services to help with COVID-19 response and recovery, through a program offered by the federal and provincial governments.The latest intake of the B.C. Agri-Business Planning Program is open to applications and has been expanded to include aquaculture and seafood companies in developing COVID-19 business recovery plans.“The Government of Canada is working around the clock, along with the provinces and territories, to respond to the impacts of COVID-19 on farmers and food businesses,” said Marie-Claude Bibeau, federal Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. “This investment will help B.C. farmers and processors who are experiencing income loss steer the course to recovery and continue to put high-quality food on our grocery store shelves and kitchen tables for years to come.”B.C. agriculture, seafood and food processing business owners are encouraged to apply if their revenues have decreased by at least 30% as a result of COVID-19. The funding available includes up to $5,000 in business planning services and coaching for individuals, and up to $20,000 for groups, from a qualified business consultant, to develop an immediate and long-term recovery plan. Eligible applicants may also apply to the specialized business planning stream of the program to further strengthen their business.“This a difficult time for all Canadians and that includes B.C. farmers, ranchers, seafood and food processors,” said Lana Popham, B.C.’s Minister of Agriculture. “I have been working with my federal colleague on ways to help people who are experiencing income loss through the pandemic, and the expansion of the B.C.

Anne Kang, Minister of Citizens’ Services and responsible for Multiculturalism, has issued the following statement in response to the increase in hate crimes and incidents towards people of Asian heritage in B.C.:""I am deeply saddened by the recent rise in racially motivated physical and verbal attacks and vandalism against people of Asian heritage in our province since the COVID-19 outbreak. The Vancouver Police Department reported an increase in hate crimes and hate-motivated incidents for March and April, and the majority of those disturbing incidents had an anti-Asian element.“I cannot remain silent. As someone who moved to Canada from Taiwan, I am outraged that anyone would engage in acts of discrimination, hate or violence. I am compelled as a government representative, immigrant and British Columbian to speak out against these vicious acts.  “COVID-19 is impacting all of us. These are unprecedented challenging times, but I want to be clear – acts of violence and aggression will not be tolerated. There is absolutely no place for hate in our society.“Chinese Canadians have deep roots in this province. Over many generations, Chinese Canadians have worked alongside all British Columbians to build the vibrant, multicultural society we enjoy today. Now is a time to stand together and condemn these actions that seek to divide.“Kindness will bring us through this global health crisis stronger than ever as we work to build a more inclusive and welcoming province. Our communities get stronger when we treat each other as we want to be treated. More than ever, it is critical we are intentional about being supportive, understanding and respectful to one another. We must speak up when we witness racism.“Our government has created new programs to protect, defend and uphold B.C.’s multicultural society. We recently established the Resilience BC anti-racism network, a hub and spoke model designed to connect communities throughout the province with information, supports and training to assist them in addressing racism, intolerance and hate.“We are investing $540,000 annually in Resilience BC. Earlier this month, we selected the Victoria Immigrant and Refugee Centre Society as the hub provider, and any community organizations interested in leading anti-racism and anti-hate efforts as a Resilience BC community spoke are encouraged to submit proposals by May 19, 2020.“If you are a victim or witness a hate activity, I encourage you to report the incident to your local police. We must look out for each other, show kindness and demonstrate through our words and actions that hate has no place in B.C.”For a Chinese translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.15_STMT_Hate_Crimes-CN.pdfFor a French translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.15_STMT_Hate_Crimes-FR.pdfFor a Punjabi translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.15_STMT_Hate_Crimes-Punjabi.pdfFor an Arabic translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.15_STMT_Hate_Crimes-Arabic.pdfFor a Farsi translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.15_STMT_Hate_Crimes-Farsi.pdfFor a Japanese translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.15_STMT_Hate_Crimes-Japanese.pdfFor a Tagalog translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.15_STMT_Hate_Crimes-Tagalog.pdfFor a Vietnamese translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.15_STMT_Hate_Crimes-Vietnamese.pdf For a Korean translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.15_STMT_Hate_Crimes-Korean.pdf

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are reporting 15 new cases, for a total of 2,392 cases in British Columbia.""There are 372 active cases of COVID-19 in the province, and 1,885 people who tested positive have recovered.""Of the total COVID-19 cases, 58 individuals are hospitalized, 12 of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.""Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19.

While many of us would look to plan our summer activities well in advance, this year, with the risks of COVID-19 around us, we need to take things week by week.“Less travel right now is what we are asking of everyone. There are so many activities and places for us to safely enjoy – close to home. Rain or shine, we can get outside and enjoy some of the best of B.C. right in our backyards.“Top of mind for all of us needs to be: fewer faces, smaller groups, shorter time together and bigger spaces.

Today, Wet’suwet’en Hereditary Chiefs and the provincial and federal governments signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that recognizes Wet’suwet’en rights and title throughout the Yintah and sets out a process to negotiate an agreement on how to implement them.“With this MOU, we will now begin to work toward a better understanding between Canada and British Columbia, and we will be able to strengthen better relationships and establish strong economies. Wet’suwet’en People, regardless of political views and opinions can now visualize certainty. Wet’suwet’en traditions and culture will always remain with the confines of Wet’suwet’en language. Our priorities are to: mobilize safety measures for all Wet’suwet’en People, promulgate Wet’suwet’en existence and sanctify our inviolable Wet’suwet’en traditions,” said Wet’suwet’en Dinï’ze Woos, (Frank Alec), Cas Yihk, Gitdumt’en (Bear Clan).Wet’suwet’en Hereditary Chiefs; Scott Fraser, B.C.’s Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation; and Carolyn Bennett, federal Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations, signed the MOU on May 14, 2020, via videoconference. The MOU was signed virtually to respect guidelines from public health officials to protect the health and well-being of people and communities during the COVID-19 pandemic.“The MOU is the start of a negotiation process. We have a great deal of work ahead of us to determine how we will implement rights and title together, and reunification within Wet’suwet’en Nation is key to this work moving forward successfully. We are approaching these negotiations with respect and recognition, and have committed to working together with transparency and openness for the benefit of all people who live in the Yintah,” said Fraser.The MOU commits Wet’suwet’en Hereditary Chiefs and the provincial and federal governments to negotiate a series of agreements that will resolve matters of rights and title outstanding for decades since the 1997 Supreme Court of Canada Delgamuukw-Gisday’wa ruling. Any formal agreements reached as a result of negotiations will require approval by each of the parties.“The signing of this MOU marks an important step in our work to rebuild our relationship with the Wet’suwet’en and towards affirming and implementing their rights and title. As negotiations begin, a comprehensive, inclusive and transparent engagement process will support the parties so they can work together towards a final agreement on the affirmation and implementation of Wet’suwet’en rights and title. These discussions are breathing life into the 1997 Delgamuukw-Gisday’wa decision, which is part of our country’s work on the path of reconciliation,” said Bennett.As outlined in the MOU, the three parties will now begin negotiating an agreement on a path to implement Wet’suwet’en rights and title. Topics to be discussed will include Nation reunification, revenue-sharing, compensation, land and resources, child and family wellness, water, fish, land-use planning and decision-making.Planning is currently underway to establish both internal Wet’suwet’en and external engagement processes to ensure transparency and openness throughout the negotiations. Wet’suwet’en clan members and elected representatives, neighbouring First Nations, municipal governments and other interested parties who live and work in the Yintah, will be included.The MOU and all future agreements will uphold the Aboriginal rights and title recognized and affirmed by Section 35 of the Constitution and align with B.C.’s Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act.Quotes:Dinï’ze Madeek (Jeff Brown), Gitdumt’en (Bear) –“This is a historic event. Our ancestors wanted this for 33 years and now it will come to our Nation. Our work starts to get tougher. We are ready now.”Dinï’ze Gisday’wa (Fred Tom), Gitdumt’en (Bear) –“It’s a wonderful day. We have a lot of catching up to do – 150 years. We called upon our ancestors to be here with us. I would like to thank all our supporters, around town, in Moricetown, Tse Kya, Lake Babine, all the students, and those that came out to the Yintah.”Dinï’ze Lay’oh (James Namox), Gilseyhu (Big Frog) –“I would like to thank all the signatories, and I agree that this should have been done a long time ago. My late mom Lucy, (previous) Goohlaht, participated in the Delgamuukw-Gisday’wa court case, for our kids, for our future. We are here to continue on with that work.”Dinï’ze Kloum Khun (Alphonse Gagnon), Laksamshu (Fireweed and Owl) –“It’s a long time coming, in my lifetime since the early 1970s when we felt ok to start defending ourselves. We have had many Chiefs that were ahead of us, and I would like to thank them. The plaintiffs in the Delgamuukw-Gisday’wa case were very passionate about the Yintah, about our ownership and rights and title. We have tried negotiations before and it didn’t work well. It’s important to thank all the people that supported us, the Mohawks, Gitxsan, and all across Canada, and the youth especially. We have a lot of work ahead of us.”Dinï’ze Smogelgem (Warner Naziel), Laksamshu (Fireweed and Owl) – “For 200 years, colonization came through our lands in many deadly and detrimental ways. We have survived those deadly waves of disease and harmful colonial laws. Throughout these generations of dehumanizing racist policies, we have always conducted ourselves in the selfless and respectful ways according to our ancient laws. Our Nation deserves to experience true sovereignty and we can finally teach our children a new history from this day forth.”Elder Christine William, on behalf of Dinï’ze Hagwilnegh (Ron Mitchell), Laksilyu (Small Frog) –“We are so proud and humbled by the wisdom and determination of my late mother Madeline Alfred, and all that hard work in the Delgamuukw-Gisday’wa court case. It wasn’t about her; it was for our people, it was for all our grandchildren and Yintah.”Dinï’ze Knedebeas (Warner William), Unistot’en (Big Frog) –“Signing this thing doesn’t mean it’s a done deal. For my mother-in law, cousin and all those that participated in the court case – in the time to come, we need to participate in this to work, for all of us, for those yet to come.”Dinï’ze Na’Moks (John Ridsdale), Tsayu (Beaver) –“We are doing this for everyone. The past cannot be changed, but the future can.”Quick Facts:

347,2020-05-14 10:15:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020AG0035-000880,Government Website,Impacts of COVID-19 on ICBC report released,"

A review of ICBC’s financial situation since the start of the provincial state of emergency shows both positive and negative financial impacts on ICBC’s bottom line.  With almost no capital reserves to withstand fluctuations and volatility in the markets, it is too early to determine whether the pandemic will result in benefits to pass on to drivers.“ICBC is in a challenging position due to the pandemic, faced with uncertain and unprecedented turmoil in the markets, combined with no financial buffer as a result of the old government’s mismanagement,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “There are more than 10 months to go in the fiscal year and many unknowns, but if ICBC’s bottom line ends up better than expected, any surplus will be used to benefit B.C. drivers. In the meantime, we’re focused on supporting people through payment deferrals and making it easier for people to cancel or change their insurance, and on bringing in Enhanced Care coverage next year to save people an average of $400 on their insurance.”If ICBC’s net income results are better than forecast for 2020-21, any additional net income will benefit customers. Any decisions on the use of additional net income of ICBC for the year due to lower claims resulting from the pandemic will be made at the end of the fiscal year. Options could include rebuilding the financial capital health of ICBC to reduce longer-term pressure on rates, providing a one-time direct relief to customers or any combination thereof.     ICBC’s report on the impacts of COVID-19 examined a period of about six weeks after the provincial state of emergency was declared and people were advised to stay home (March 15 to May 2). It found that over that time:
ICBC opened 46% fewer accident claims (including claims for both damage to vehicles and for injuries) compared to the same time last year, with an average weekly reduction of 7,200 claims. This drop in the number of claims amounts to approximately $158 million in savings for ICBC. However, claim numbers are on the rise again as more vehicles return to B.C. roads;
more than 150,000 customers changed their insurance policies by cancelling their policy (103,700) or lowering their rate class (57,561), resulting in a projected $283-million decline in written insurance premiums compared to what would normally be received for that period; and
ICBC has seen a decrease in the value of its investment portfolio due to the unprecedented downturn in the financial markets, putting pressure on its bottom line. Some of this has already been seen at the end of ICBC’s 2019-20 fiscal year, and early indications suggest the impact could exceed $1 billion in fiscal 2020-21, depending on the length and scope of the global market downturn. The final impact will be determined at the end of fiscal 2020-21.
“ICBC waiving cancellation and re-plating fees alone during the pandemic has saved customers around $5 million, and we will continue to work with those drivers facing financial hardship,” said Nicolas Jimenez, ICBC president and CEO. “We’re committed to delivering essential services and ensuring the safety of our customers, employees and partners. And given these uncertain times, we have a responsibility to consider many factors when making long-term decisions that could adversely affect ICBC’s bottom line – and customers’ insurance premiums – in the future.”ICBC remains focused on the longer-term goal of implementing enhanced care coverage and delivering an average 20% rate reduction in 2021 should the legislation be passed. As ICBC transitions to this new care-based model, no basic rate change was needed this year. The 0% basic rate change that took effect on April 1, 2020, is the lowest in nearly a decade.ICBC has taken a number of steps to support its customers during this challenging time. It has waived cancellation and re-plating fees, provided 90-day deferrals and helped customers to cancel or change their coverage at no charge, among many other initiatives designed to ease the financial burden people may be facing.Learn More:Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic on ICBC report: http://www.icbc.com/about-icbc/newsroom/Documents/COVID19-impacts-report-May2020.pdfICBC waives cancellation and re-plating fees: https://www.icbc.com/about-icbc/newsroom/Pages/2020-apr16.aspxICBC defers payments by 90 days: https://www.icbc.com/about-icbc/newsroom/Pages/2020-mar24.aspxInsurance renewable by phone: https://www.icbc.com/about-icbc/newsroom/Pages/2020-mar18.aspxICBC reinstates some knowledge tests by appointment: https://www.icbc.com/about-icbc/newsroom/Pages/2020-apr27.aspxICBC suspends road tests: https://www.icbc.com/about-icbc/newsroom/Pages/2020-mar17.aspxTranslations:For a Chinese translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.14_NR_ICBC_Covid_Finances-CN.pdfFor a French translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.14_NR_ICBC_Covid_Finances-FR.pdfFor a Punjabi translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.14_NR_ICBC_Covid_Finances-Punjabi.pdf

As the May long weekend approaches, government reminds people to avoid all non-essential travel in the province to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and instead stay local if you do decide to enjoy the outdoors.Though some restrictions are expected to ease next week, it remains vital for everyone to maintain physical distancing and take other important measures to limit the spread of COVID-19. This includes staying home if you have any symptoms of illness, washing your hands frequently with soap and water, and not touching your face. Here are some tips to help you enjoy the long weekend while following the public safety guidelines set by the provincial health officer (PHO):Have fun close to homeNow is not the time to travel for tourism or recreation. By continuing to avoid non-essential travel, British Columbians can do their part to protect vulnerable people in communities from COVID-19. Things to keep in mind over this long weekend include:
Do not visit vacation properties:
Now is not the time to camp, or to travel to secondary homes or vacation properties in other communities. Access to resources and health care may be more challenging in smaller communities if someone should become ill or if there’s a community outbreak. By staying home and maintaining physical distancing, British Columbians can take pressure off the already strained resources in these smaller areas.
Do not go pleasure boating right now
Recreational mariners are reminded to avoid non-essential trips on the water and stay close to home. Each call search-and-rescue specialists respond to puts them at risk of exposure to COVID-19, as well as requiring them to use precious supplies of personal protective equipment. As well, boaters should be aware that some small coastal First Nations communities have closed their villages to visitors to protect themselves from COVID-19, so boaters may not have access to fuel, supplies and other services.
BC Ferries service is reduced on many routes
BC Ferries is reminding people that ferries are available for essential travel only this long weekend. If you are required to travel right now, remember that BC Ferries service has been reduced on many routes, and COVID-19 screening is a Transport Canada requirement for sailings over 30 minutes in duration. Before you travel, check sailing schedules. Reservations are strongly recommended. To support physical distancing, people can remain in their vehicles on both upper and enclosed lower decks.
Only visit your local provincial park or recreation site 
As of May 14, 2020, all provincial campgrounds remain closed and most provincial parks, recreation sites and trails are open for day-use only. Access to beaches, trails, most picnic areas and washroom facilities, and boat launches is permitted. However, in keeping with public health guidelines around non-essential travel, people are urged to only visit parks and recreation sites close to their home and avoid travelling to small communities.Some parks will remain closed due to potential challenges with high numbers of anticipated visitors. If you get to your favorite park and find it busy, come back another time.
Check out your local farmers market 
Supporting local producers and food suppliers, choosing to Buy BC is as important as ever. Under the public health officer’s orders and guidelines, farmers markets can and are continuing to operate in B.C. at this time. The BC Association of Farmers’ Markets is also helping to provide customers with locally grown and prepared food products through a new online platform. More than 40 farmers markets are connected virtually to serve their communities.
Enjoy the outdoors safely 
Placing extra attention on staying safe in the outdoors will support the health and safety of everyone, including first responders such as BC Wildfire staff, search-and-rescue volunteers, paramedics and other emergency staff.
Small campfires are allowed but other burning prohibitions remain in place
Responding to unnecessary, human-caused wildfires could increase the risk of BC Wildfire Service staff being exposed to COVID-19 and potentially affect their response capability at the height of the wildfire season.Campfires are currently allowed within the BC Wildfire Service’s jurisdiction but they must not be larger than 0.5 metres in height or width. People who plan to light a campfire as they enjoy day-use activities at provincial parks and recreation sites must remember to fully extinguish it and ensure the ashes are cold to the touch before leaving the area.Prohibitions remain in place for Category 2 open fires, Category 3 open fires, Resource Management Open Fires and other activities (e.g., use of fireworks, sky lanterns, burning barrels and burning cages). In collaboration with provincial public health partners, the Province has extended its own open burning restrictions for all High Smoke Sensitivity Zones in the province until June 15, 2020.  
Plan ahead and stick to well-marked trails 
During the pandemic, there is also higher risk for B.C.’s 2,500 search-and-rescue volunteers as there is a risk of virus transmission during a call to help those who are lost, stranded or injured in B.C.’s outdoors. British Columbians are asked to do their part: do not venture into the wilderness at this time. If you must go outdoors, plan a day trip, stick close to home on well-marked trails, and make sure to pack the right provisions and clothing for the weather.
Conservation officers will be monitoring activity
Throughout the long weekend, conservation officers will continue patrols to ensure public safety and protect B.C.’s environment, fish and wildlife resources. Help them stay safe and do their work by sticking to the rules and report suspected violations to the 24/7 poachers and polluters hotline at 1 877 952-7277.Learn More:For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/

Work is underway to improve brightness and visibility in the George Massey Tunnel.“We continue to move ahead with our work to replace the George Massey Tunnel, but in the meantime, we are making immediate safety improvements inside the tunnel for drivers who use this route every day,” said Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “Plans for the new, future crossing are underway with a business case expected to be ready for the fall.”The existing lights on the tunnel walls and ceiling will be converted to an LED standard to increase visibility and better illuminate the tunnel for drivers, save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Other work includes improving tunnel drainage to prevent ice build-up and water from pooling at tunnel entrances. The ventilation and electrical systems will also be upgraded. These additional safety improvements are already underway and are scheduled to be completed by spring 2021.Black & McDonald Limited of Vancouver has been awarded a contract valued at $19 million for this work, which is part of a $40-million suite of interim safety and reliability improvements.To minimize delays for drivers, the majority of work will be done at night. Drivers and cyclists are advised to watch for night-time lane closures and obey all traffic-control personnel, construction speed limits and signs. The ministry will let the public know in advance when lane closures are scheduled so they can plan their trip accordingly. People should continue to check DriveBC.ca and @DriveBC on Twitter for the most up-to-date highway travel information.The ministry is working closely with all contractors and WorkSafeBC to ensure health and safety are maintained for all workers on site.B.C.’s provincial health officer (PHO) has directed construction employers to take all necessary precautions to minimize the risks of COVID-19 transmission and illness to themselves and their employees. This includes ensuring workers maintain physical distance with a minimum of two metres apart from each other, both in the course of their duties as well as during breaks. Anyone exhibiting COVID-19 like symptoms will be directed to self-isolate at home for at least 10 days.While highways and roads remain open, the PHO recommends people stay close to home and avoid any non-essential travel.Learn More:For more information, visit: https://engage.gov.bc.ca/masseytunnel/For guidance to construction sites operating during COVID-19, visit: http://ow.ly/P7WS50z8hNTFor travel restrictions and precautions due to COVID-19, visit: http://ow.ly/jBGu50yVMROFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/

Boat inspection stations are opening at various locations throughout the province to prevent harmful zebra and quagga mussels from hitching a boat ride and entering B.C. waterways.From now until late October, inspectors with the B.C. Conservation Officer Service (COS) will check boats for aquatic invasive species and educate people about the importance of Clean, Drain and Dry – a preventative step that all boaters should practise when moving between lakes in B.C.While most provincial boat launches are now open, the Province reminds people that now is not the time for non-essential travel and to stay close to home. Due to current travel restrictions, the risk for invasive mussels entering B.C. is expected to be lower.“We recognize people are eager to get outside and many are ready to head to their favourite lake, but we need to avoid non-essential travel during these unprecedented times and stay close to home,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “We are fortunate there have been no reports of quagga and zebra mussels so far in B.C., and we need to make sure it stays that way by ensuring the necessary resources are in place to protect our economy, our infrastructure and our sensitive ecosystems.”Piloted in 2015, the Invasive Mussel Defence program consists of three main components: watercraft inspections, lake monitoring, and public outreach and education. The COS enforces the program and has two detection dogs, Kilo and Major. The dogs are primarily on the road searching for invasive mussels at the inspection stations.Last year, more than 52,000 inspections were conducted that resulted in 22 mussel-fouled boats coming from Ontario, Michigan, Utah and North Carolina and were destined for the Lower Mainland, Vancouver Island, Kootenays, Thompson-Nicola and Skeena regions. The program received advanced notification of 17 of the 22 mussel-fouled boats either from another jurisdiction or by Canada Border Services agents.“While we are all protecting ourselves during this unusual time, each of us can take simple actions to protect our waters from invasive species,” said Dave Bennett, chair of the Invasive Species Council of BC. “This weekend kicks off the Clean, Drain, Dry week for Invasive Species Action Month in B.C. Whether you are a paddler, boater or a fisher, let’s continue to work together and make sure all of our equipment and vehicles are clean, drained and dry before going to a new waterbody.”The COS reminds people that it is mandatory for anyone transporting a watercraft (sailboats, motorboats, car toppers, kayaks, canoes and paddle boats) in B.C. to stop at an open inspection station. Failing to stop can result in a $345 fine. Last year, 116 violation tickets were issued to motorists failing to stop at inspection stations.People are encouraged to report watercraft suspected of transporting invasive mussels to the Report All Poachers and Polluters (RAPP) line at 1 877 952-7277. To determine if a boat is high risk and should be decontaminated, contact: COS.Aquatic.Invasive.Species@gov.bc.caPeople can also report other potential invasive species through the provincial Report Invasives App at: www.gov.bc.ca/invasive-speciesQuick Facts:
Quagga and zebra mussels have been found in Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec, as well as dozens of states in the United States.
Unlike B.C.’s native mussels, zebra and quagga mussels attach to hard surfaces, allowing them to move between waterbodies by boats and equipment. The mussels multiply rapidly and are extremely difficult to eradicate once they become established in an area.
The economic impact of invasive mussels to hydropower, agricultural irrigation, municipal water supplies and recreational boating could cost the province an estimated $43 million per year if introduced into B.C. This does not include additional impacts on commercial and recreational fisheries.
In 2019, approximately 892 water samples were collected from 79 lakes across the province. All samples have come back negative for invasive mussels.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are reporting 16 new cases, for a total of 2,376 cases in British Columbia.“There are 385 active cases of COVID-19 in the province, and 1,859 people who tested positive have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 59 individuals are hospitalized, 14 of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 877 in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,137 in the Fraser Health region, 125 in the Island Health region, 180 in the Interior Health region and 57 in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report one new COVID-19 related death in the Fraser Health region, for a total of 132 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to the family, friends and caregivers of this individual, and to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“There have been no new long-term care or assisted-living facility outbreaks. In total, 15 facilities and five acute-care units have active cases.“Public health teams are continuing to provide support for community outbreaks in the poultry sector, at the Mission Institution and with those connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.“Yesterday, the provincewide survey, Your story, our future, was launched to gather insights about your experiences and actions in the COVID-19 pandemic so far.

As B.C. moves toward its new normal, Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, is extending the provincial state of emergency to support continued co-ordination of the pandemic response.   ""Because of our determination and sacrifices over the past months, we’re now in a position to carefully move toward the next chapter in our response to COVID-19, but we must not lose sight of the challenges that are ahead,” said Premier John Horgan. “At each and every step forward, your government will continue in its commitment to keep our communities safe and support people through this difficult time.”Government recently announced BC’s Restart Plan, laying out a series of steps and principles that everyone in B.C. will take together to protect people and ensure that the province can come back from COVID-19 stronger than before.""As we look forward to increasing our social and economic activity in B.C., we must remember that the fight against COVID-19 is far from over,"" said Farnworth. “Our province continues to be in a state of emergency, and we will continue in our co-ordinated response to keep people safe, support our health-care system and ensure our supply chains are secure.”The current state of emergency is being extended through the end of the day on May 26, 2020. During the last two weeks of the provincial state of emergency, government has taken action to support British Columbians by:
supporting over 400 people’s transition from unsafe encampments in Oppenheimer Park in Vancouver, and Topaz Park and the Pandora corridor in Victoria, into safer, temporary accommodation as a first step toward more secure housing;
opening applications for the B.C. Emergency Benefit for Workers, a one-time tax-free payment of $1,000 for eligible British Columbians;
making more supports available for communities following a rise in racist incidents targeting Asian people during the COVID-19 pandemic; and
building on measures to help the forest sector by deferring stumpage fees for three months to help people, communities and forest companies.
The extension of the provincial state of emergency is based on recommendations from B.C.'s health and emergency management officials. Farnworth made the original declaration on March 18, 2020, after Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, declared a public health emergency the previous day.The Province has created 1 888 COVID-19 (1 888 268-4319) to connect British Columbians needing non-medical information about COVID-19. This includes the latest information on travel recommendations and physical distancing, as well as access to support and resources from the provincial and federal governments. The call line is available seven days a week, from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. (Pacific time), in 110 languages. People with questions related to their health and COVID-19 should call 811.Quick Facts:
Declarations of provincial states of emergency may be issued by the minister responsible under the Emergency Program Act.
The provincial government can extend the period of a declaration made by the minister responsible for further periods of time for 14 days at a time.
During the 2017 wildfire season, the province was in a provincial state of emergency for 10 weeks from July 7 to Sept. 15.

The Province is supporting jobs for B.C. workers in oil and gas service companies to clean up the environment and help restart the economy.“With the support of the federal government, B.C. is taking action to accelerate the restoration of more than 2,000 orphan and inactive wells,” said Premier John Horgan. “This program will support upwards of 1,200 jobs, helping B.C. workers, the environment and our economy during these challenging times.”On April 17, 2020, the Government of Canada announced $120 million for B.C. to support cleaning up oil and gas sites. Subject to reaching final agreement with Canada, the Province intends to invest this funding in three new programs:
The Dormant Sites Reclamation Program will provide $100 million to reclaim dormant oil and gas sites, which are wells that have been inactive for five consecutive years and are unlikely to be returned to service. This program will provide up to $100,000, or 50% of total costs, whichever is less.

The Orphan Sites Supplemental Reclamation Program will provide $15 million to reclaim orphan oil and gas sites where the operator is insolvent, no longer exists or cannot be located. This program will be administrated by the BC Oil and Gas Commission (BCOGC) and will be in addition to $27 million in planned BCOGC clean up of such wells for 2020-21.

The Legacy Sites Reclamation Program will provide $5 million to address the legacy impacts of historical oil and gas activities that continue to have environmental impacts, such as on wildlife habitat or on the traditional use by Indigenous peoples.
These programs will be open to oil and gas field service companies and contractors based in B.C., with registration, office and operations in B.C.“Through these three programs, we are accelerating the cleanup of thousands of orphan and inactive wells,” said Bruce Ralston, B.C.'s Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources. “This allows us to restore lands of important environmental and cultural relevance, while also supporting local jobs and local economies in B.C.’s northeast.”Indigenous communities, local governments and landowners will be able to nominate dormant, orphan and legacy sites for priority consideration for decommissioning, reclamation or restoration.“Thanks to the co-operation between the governments of Canada and British Columbia, this program will mean a cleaner environment and much needed jobs for workers in B.C.,” said Seamus O’Regan, Canada’s Minister of Natural Resources.Applications for the Dormant Sites Reclamation Program will be accepted beginning May 25.Quotes:Chief Trevor Makadahay, Doig River First Nation – “Doig River is pleased that the Province of B.C. is making steps to further manage the impacts of development on our territory through reclamation and restoration programs. We are committed to cleaning up our land base and look forward to exploring the opportunities these programs create for our band membership, our company Uujo Developments and our environmental partner Tervita Corporation.”Chief Sharleen Gale, Fort Nelson First Nation (FNFN) –  ""The Fort Nelson First Nation is pleased to hear the announcement from the B.C. government about the new dormant and orphan well restoration programs. This is a win-win for the oil and gas sector and the environment. It will bring much needed local employment for former oil and gas workers and clean up dormant, legacy and orphan wells. We look forward to continuing our collaboration with B.C. to reclaim old wells to the highest standards using innovative techniques that the FNFN and the BCOGC have been piloting over the past two years.”Chief Ken Cameron, Saulteau First Nations –  “We have been working with B.C. and the BCOGC on developing new approaches to restoration, and we welcome new programs that will support reclamation projects and job creation. We are ready to share our traditional knowledge, technical expertise and project management skills. We believe that by working together with government and industry, we can create long-term sustainable economies and restore landscapes to their natural state, after oil and gas activities are completed.”Chief Roland Willson, West Moberly First Nations –“These funds can help restore some of the impacted areas of Treaty 8 territory and provide economic opportunities to West Moberly people.”Elizabeth Aquin, interim president and CEO of the Petroleum Services Association of Canada (PSAC) – “The funding program announced today will provide much needed jobs for the oil and gas services sector companies that PSAC represents while also generating positive environmental outcomes. The services sector is instrumental in developing new technologies and innovation to improve environmental performance. PSAC is pleased that this funding aligns with our advocacy for a mechanism to close orphan and inactive wells to create jobs during this unprecedented downturn. This will also help to retain key skills and expertise for Canada’s responsible energy development and stewardship of the land.”Karen Tam Wu, regional director, British Columbia, Pembina Institute –  “Amid these difficult times, today's announcement represents a welcome opportunity to get people back to work quickly and to take action on dormant, legacy and orphaned gas wells in British Columbia. Going forward, it's essential to enforce the polluter-pays principle to prevent taxpayers from bearing the cost of future cleanup for these wells. Strengthening British Columbia’s liability management program could ensure the risks posed by neglected infrastructure doesn't keep growing.”Quick Facts:
Of about 25,000 oil and gas well sites in B.C., approximately 357 are considered orphan. In addition, there are currently 7,685 dormant well sites in B.C.
The decommissioning and restoration of oil and gas sites in B.C. is regulated by the BCOGC, which last year developed a Comprehensive Liability Management Plan.
When a site is designated an orphan, the BCOGC can use the industry-funded Orphan Site Reclamation Fund to decommission and restore the land.
On April 16, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the BCOGC announced it is postponing invoicing of the Orphan Liability Levy. The Levy will still be charged for the 2020-21 year, but invoicing will be deferred until Sept. 1.

Harry Bains, Minister of Labour, has issued the following statement on the death of Ralph McGinn, board chair of WorkSafeBC: “I am deeply saddened by the sudden passing of Ralph McGinn. He was a man of integrity, who had a joy for life and a commitment to leave the world a better place.""Ralph cared very much about the safety of workers, and over the span of a long career, he was ambitious and energetic when it came to protecting those in the workplace. Ralph’s legacy spans the globe — he made a tremendous difference in mining safety, health and environmental protection as far away as Australia, South America and Africa.""Closer to home, Ralph held many leadership roles at WorkSafeBC. One of his greatest achievements was overseeing the revision of B.C.’s Occupational Health and Safety Regulations, which came into effect in 1998. His work resulted in systemic improvements that we still benefit from today. It was this leadership in workers’ compensation that led me to appoint him as chair of the board of directors of WorkSafeBC in 2017, where he was driving work to achieve our vision to make workplaces the safest in Canada. I appreciate his dedication to this goal, which I commit will continue.""On behalf of the Ministry of Labour, I offer my heartfelt condolences to his family, friends and all his colleagues who are mourning his passing. Ralph will be missed.”

Low- to moderate-income families, individuals, seniors and adults with disabilities in Saanich will soon have access to over 70 new affordable homes thanks to a partnership between the Province, the Capital Regional District (CRD) and the Capital Region Housing Corporation (CRHC).“Affordable housing is needed in our community now more than ever,” said Lana Popham, MLA for Saanich South. “These 73 new homes will make a big difference and provide security and peace of mind for the people who will call this building home.”Located at 3816 Carey Rd., Westview is a four-storey, wood-frame building with 73 homes. The building provides studio, one-bedroom, two-bedroom and three-bedroom apartments. Fifteen of the homes will be for people with very low incomes (rented at the provincial income assistance rate); 29 will be rent-geared-to-income units (where people with low to moderate incomes will pay 30% of their income); and 29 will be rented at affordable rates. Westview is located near community facilities, retail areas and transit.The CRHC will own and operate the building and is partnering with the Independent Living Housing Society to provide five fully accessible ground-floor units, as well as an office for the society’s programming. The society will select residents for the five designated accessible units. The CRHC is also partnering with Threshold Housing Society to provide two units to youth at risk of homelessness.Residents will begin moving into their new homes on May 15, 2020. To ensure resident safety during the COVID-19 pandemic, move-in dates and times are staggered to ensure residents have minimal contact with each other in hallways and elevators.Quotes:Lisa Helps, chair, CRHC – “As the largest social housing provider in the region, the CRHC is proud to deliver affordable housing and services to almost 3,500 residents. We are a strong community partner that works collaboratively with stakeholders and tenants to build safe, vibrant and accessible communities like Westview.”

Fred Haynes, mayor of Saanich –“The District of Saanich is delighted to be stepping up again with BC Housing and the CRD to enable more affordable homes. Saanich is already home to many supported, assisted and affordable homes. From the wonderful opportunities for co-op housing right through to homes, we are proud to be part of providing this support.”Heidi Bada, board of directors president, Independent Living Housing Society –“We are delighted to see Westview reaching the occupancy stage and are grateful for the opportunity to again collaborate with Capital Region Housing. Finding a place to live can be particularly challenging for people with disabilities especially when accessible housing is a necessary requirement. The Independent Living Housing Society believes that good living starts with home, and this housing development provides an opportunity for us to support more people with disabilities to make a home in this community.”Colin Tessier, executive director, Threshold Housing Society –“We are excited to partner with the Capital Region Housing Corporation on the Westview housing project. There is a desperate need for safe and affordable housing options for at-risk youth in our community, and this project is helping to address that critical need. Youth housed at Westview will receive robust support services and access to positive community through the Threshold support program. Access to safe housing and appropriate supports for at-risk youth is a key strategy to preventing future instances of adult homelessness.”Quick Facts:
The Province provided $8.5 million in construction financing and $7.1 million in grants.
The Capital Regional District provided the land for the project and $1 million in cash equity.
The Capital Region Housing Corporation is a wholly owned non-profit subsidiary of the CRD with a housing portfolio of 1,491 affordable housing units.  
Including these 73 homes, the Province is working in partnership to build more than 3,330 new affordable homes for people with a range of incomes in the CRD.

A resurfacing project on highways 6 and 97 near Vernon and Falkland is underway, one of several in the southern Interior that will cover more than 300 kilometres of highways and side roads in 2020.“All these paving projects will make a big difference to residents as well as those who travel through the region,” said Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “Moving forward with highway improvement projects means we are providing jobs for British Columbians, but in all of these projects, safety comes first.”B.C.’s provincial health officer (PHO) has directed construction employers to take all necessary precautions to minimize the risks of COVID-19 transmission and illness to themselves and their employees. This includes ensuring workers maintain physical distance with a minimum of two metres apart from each other, both in the course of their duties and during breaks. Anyone exhibiting COVID-19 like symptoms will be directed to self-isolate at home for at least 10 days.This first project involves hot-in-place asphalt recycling for a total of 43 kilometres, including one segment of Highway 6 between Vernon and Lumby, two segments of Highway 97 near Vernon and two segments of Highway 97 near Falkland. Work on this $7.2-million project is underway and is expected to be complete this summer.Hot-in-place resurfacing is a made-in-B.C. process that involves repurposing the existing asphalt by heating, softening and blending it with a small amount of new asphalt before reapplying it to the road surface. This method extends the life of the surface, is faster, saves resources and lowers greenhouse gas emissions.Other major resurfacing projects for the region this spring and summer include:
Highway 3 near Castlegar – sealcoating approximately 25 kilometres of Highway 3, Bombi Pass between the Ootischenia weigh scales and Beaver Creek bridge;
Highway 5 near Barriere - resurfacing approximately 16 kilometres of Highway 5 from McLure Ferry Road to Louis Creek Bridge;
Highway 97A and side roads near Salmon Arm – approximately 13 kilometres of resurfacing on Highway 97A from Enderby to Grindrod, along with portions of Mabel Lake Road, Trinity Valley Road and Springbend Road; and
side roads near Creston – approximately 24 kilometres of side road resurfacing in the Lister area, as well as some of Highway 21, including patch paving for five kilometres near the Canada-U.S. border.
More than $85 million is being invested in highway and side road improvements in the southern Interior in 2020. The following projects make up the rest of what will be resurfaced in the region this year:
Highway 1, 93/95 near Radium Hot Springs and Golden (23 kilometres) – hot-in-place resurfacing from Windermere to Radium and in the Golden area;
Highway 3A near Nelson (20 kilometres) – resurfacing from Kootenay Lake Bridge to Taghum Bridge and side roads;
Highway 5 near Merritt (10 kilometres) – resurfacing from Great Bear Snowshed to Dry Gulch Bridge;
Highway 20 near Williams Lake (28 kilometres) – sealcoating from the Sheep Creek Brake Check to Hodgson Road;
Highway 95A near Cranbrook (18 kilometres) – resurfacing from Cranbrook to Marysville including some side roads;
Highway 97 near Quesnel (33 kilometres) – intermittent resurfacing between McLeese Lake and Dale Lake;
Highway 97 near Vernon (10 kilometres) – highway resurfacing from north of 43rd Avenue to College Way and along Old Kamloops Road; and
Highway 97C near Merritt (12 kilometres) – mill-and-fill resurfacing from the Highway 5A Junction (Aspen Grove) to Pothole Creek Bridge.
While highways and roads remain open, the PHO recommends people stay close to home and avoid any non-essential travel.As these resurfacing projects are taking place, drivers can expect minor delays and, at times, single-lane alternating traffic. The ministry appreciates people’s patience during this resurfacing work. Drivers are reminded to obey construction zone speed limits and the direction of traffic control personnel.

Testing for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases is a core tenet of public health.It tells us the what, who and where of disease transmission, but we need to understand the limitations of testing to do this right.  Many have asked and many continue to ask about who is getting tested for COVID-19 in B.C. and why we don’t just “test, test, test everyone.” What I can tell you is we adapted our testing approach as we learned more about the virus and the test, and as more tests became available, and we will continue to adapt as we progress through our pandemic response.Scientists at the BC Centre for Disease Control were some of the first in the world to develop a COVID-19 test – the “what” in our testing strategy. This test detects the genetic material of the virus in a sample (usually a swab taken from the back of the nose) from someone who is sick. It is used across Canada and around the world to determine if someone is infected.Initially, B.C.’s testing strategy was based on identifying the source of transmission to understand who was getting and spreading the virus to guide our response.That’s why we first focused on returning travellers, in combination with leveraging our annual active influenza surveillance testing. This allowed us to put in place the necessary precautions, orders and restrictions we have today.As the pandemic progressed in B.C. and we had evidence of community transmission, we adapted our testing strategy to focus on those most vulnerable to serious illness from COVID-19.We did this because we knew the “where” of transmission was now potentially “everywhere.” We also knew that many people with mild illness don’t need tests and can safely self-isolate and recover at home.So, we concentrated on the sickest patients, health-care workers, those in long-term care homes and those connected to an outbreak. This gave us an understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on hospitals and care homes.Of course, testing is not the only public health strategy. Step in step with testing is the contact tracing that our public health teams always do and will continue to do as we transition to Phase 2 in BC’s Restart Plan. This is vital to setting up a firewall around every case and breaking the chains of transmission.As our rate of new cases slowed into mid-April, we adapted our strategy again to broader community testing. This means anyone with symptoms of COVID-19 can now be tested.It’s still important to remember not everybody needs a test and the tests we have are not perfect. If someone tests negative, it may mean they are too early in the illness for the test to detect it yet – a false negative.When we have a small number of people who actually have COVID-19 in the population, the number of false positives can also be very high. That means we are telling people they are infected and maybe immune to COVID-19 when they aren’t.What’s next? Soon we will introduce a ""serology"" test that can tell us if someone has been infected with COVID-19 in the past and has developed antibodies to the virus. Once the serology test has been validated for accuracy, the test results will be used to get a better sense of where the virus has been and how to further prevent its spread as we move into the next phase of our pandemic.Understanding the limitations of the tests, our strategy has never been about just testing everyone, but rather using the tests we have to understand who is or has been infected, so we can best protect our families, health-care system and communities.Our strategy is working, even as we develop it further to meet our evolving needs. It is adapted to our pandemic experience that is helping all of us to hold the line and get through this storm. It will continue to support us as we move through the next phases of this challenging pandemic.

Halalt First Nation will benefit from immediate and future economic opportunities with the purchase of two commercial properties in North Cowichan, supported through funding from the provincial government.“Halalt has been part of the treaty process for more than 25 years,” said Chief James Thomas of Halalt First Nation. “So the transfer of these lands is more than an economic opportunity. It’s a commitment that this government is serious about reconciliation with Halalt and going all the way with us toward a treaty.”The purchase of Crofton Corners, a business and residential complex, and Chemainus River Storage, a commercial property, both close to Halalt’s main reserve lands, advance treaty negotiations between the Nation and the Province. Halalt First Nation took ownership of the properties on March 20 and April 27, 2020, respectively.“The Halalt people have been stewards of these lands for millennia,” said Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. “Acquiring land to support the Nation’s goals for self-government, strong, healthy communities and economic prosperity is one of the ways we can advance reconciliation – and that work will bring benefits to the entire region.”These properties will allow Halalt First Nation to explore new business partnerships and create economic opportunity along the well-travelled route between Crofton, Chemainus and the Salt Spring Island ferry terminal. The Province provided $2.16 million for the land purchases under an Incremental Treaty Agreement (ITA). ITAs offer First Nations within the treaty process an opportunity to take advantage of early treaty benefits, such as purchasing a property of interest.Halalt First Nation is the third of five Nations in the Hul’qumi’num Treaty Group to advance treaty negotiations through ITAs with B.C. in the past six months.In January 2020, Penelakut Tribe acquired the former 49th Parallel General Store in Chemainus through an ITA with the Province. The store is located on the traditional lands where Penelakut’s village once stood and is immediately adjacent to the BC Ferries terminal serving Penelakut and Thetis islands. It is a popular spot with travellers and presents Penelakut with future economic development opportunities.Cowichan Tribes purchased the 153-hectare Genoa Bay Farm property through an ITA in October 2019, restoring a significant piece of Cowichan Tribes traditional land base and cultural history. It is a mix of farmland, forest and beachfront, and is connected to Cowichan Tribes reserve lands, providing road access to land previously accessible only by water.Quick Facts:
Halalt First Nation has more than 200 members and is located on southeast Vancouver Island, between Crofton and Chemainus.
Halalt First Nation purchased Crofton Corners for $1.05 million and Chemainus River Storage for $1.117 million.
Crofton Corners is located at the junction of Crofton and Chemainus roads, which connect Chemainus, Crofton and the Salt Spring Island ferry terminal. The property includes a commercial tenant, three two- and three-bedroom apartment suites, and a smaller commercial building with workshop. Chemainus River Storage is currently used for vehicle and boat storage, and offers future commercial development potential.
Halalt First Nation is one of five member Nations of the Hul’qumi’num Treaty Group, which moved into the final stage of treaty negotiations with the provincial and federal governments in September 2019. The group includes Cowichan Tribes, Penelakut Tribe, Halalt First Nation, Lyackson First Nation and Ts'uubaa-asatx (Lake Cowichan First Nation).

New Buy BC e-commerce funding is available to help the province’s farmers and food and beverage processors overcome some lost sales during the COVID-19 pandemic by moving their products online.The B.C. government is providing $300,000 to support industry-led Buy BC e-commerce activities. The funding is under the Ministry of Agriculture’s Buy BC Partnership Program. It helps farmers, ranchers and food and beverage processors market their products as locally grown, raised, harvested or produced, making it easy for British Columbians to Buy BC.“British Columbians have come together during these difficult times and continue to show their strength and support for each other. With the new Buy BC e-commerce funding, farmers and food and beverage processors can create a new avenue to sell their products directly to consumers all over the province, while maintaining physical distancing and safe practices,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “Moving to online sales gives customers the opportunity to continue to Buy BC and enjoy fresh food, while supporting families in our communities.”The program provides financial support to access and develop websites that accommodate online sales and helps cover the costs of marketing and shipping products to consumers throughout the province.“As a farmer, I’ve felt the impact of these uncertain times,” said Cammy Lockwood, Lockwood Farms. “The need to transition to online sales is necessary as farmers can’t rely on traditional methods to get their products to customers, and customers need a way to be able to access the local goods they depend on to feed their families. The support the Buy BC e-commerce funding is providing to help move online, market and get products to consumers is greatly appreciated, especially since this is a very busy season for farmers.”Online applications are accepted on a first-come, first-served basis, from May 15 to May 29, or when the funding is fully subscribed. The provincial government's Buy BC Partnership Program is delivered by the Investment Agriculture Foundation of British Columbia. For Buy BC application details, visit: https://iafbc.ca/buy-bc/Quick Facts:
The funding is available to B.C. farmers, and food and beverage processors of all sizes.
To be eligible, an applicant must have at least two years of business revenues, be licensed to do business in B.C. and be growing or processing one or more products in the province.
Each successful applicant is eligible to receive up to $5,000.

Vulnerable people, including people experiencing homelessness, will have better access to services through smartphones distributed by the social service organizations that support them.“The need for internet connectivity has never been as important as it is right now. For people who are experiencing homelessness, the closing of public spaces like libraries due to COVID-19 has reduced connectivity options and created barriers to supports and services,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “Providing smartphones for people on the street will help create easier access to those services, help people maintain physical distancing, and support people in staying connected to family and friends during this time.”Through the Homelessness Community Action Grant program and a partnership with 7-Eleven, the Social Planning and Research Council of BC (SPARC BC) has been able to secure 3,500 smartphones to be distributed by community organizations who provide services and support for vulnerable people.The smartphones can connect to Wi-Fi and include a pre-loaded $10 7-Eleven data card, so people have instant access to internet. The smartphones provide vulnerable people better access to vital online resources and services, including arranging medication and safe supply delivery and virtual doctor meetings.To date, 1,000 smartphones have been distributed, 200 of which will help ensure that people who transitioned from Oppenheimer Park in Vancouver and are transitioning from Pandora Avenue and Topaz Park encampments in Victoria have access to basic communication and the connections they need as they move into safer temporary accommodations. SPARC BC will distribute the additional 2,500 smartphones to organizations and community response networks throughout the province.“Access to basic communication plays a central role in how individuals are able to practise the physical distancing needed under COVID-19,” said Lorraine Copas, executive director, SPARC BC. “Through our partnerships with communities, it became clear that this was a gap in the system – a gap that we were able to fill in partnership with 7-Eleven, who helped us to secure the smartphones at cost.”The Downtown Eastside SRO Collaborative received 500 of the smartphones for low-income residents living in one of the 4,500 single room occupancy (SRO) hotel units in the area. Through DTES Response and Central City Foundation, many of these smartphones have been paired with SIM cards donated by TELUS to provide $0 rate plans including unlimited nationwide talk and text and three GB of data per month. In addition to these smartphones, Wi-Fi providers have opened up their existing Wi-Fi networks to the public, including in the Downtown Eastside, to better connect vulnerable people with support.“These smartphones are lifelines and a long-term asset for people living in the Downtown Eastside and SROs. With the smartphones, we are also able to co-ordinate the drop-off of thousands of bars of soap, food and hygiene supplies to people and connect with people about COVID-19 symptoms and testing,” said Wendy Pedersen, coordinator of the Downtown Eastside SRO Collaborative. “We shared the smartphones with other front line organizations and groups in the DTES Response effort who work with people on the ground to provide vital services in the neighbourhood.”In June 2019, the Province provided SPARC BC with $6 million for the Homelessness Community Action Grant program. To date, 53 grants for a total of $1,648,000 have been issued with the average grant amount of $31,094.Homelessness Community Action Grants help groups address homelessness in their towns and cities. SPARC BC is distributing the Homelessness Community Action Grants to groups and organizations over three years as a one-time grant to successful applicants. The chosen projects will build on local resources and knowledge about homelessness and its causes, increase public awareness and support, and respond to gaps in services for people experiencing homelessness.Learn More:Find out more about Homelessness Community Action Grants online at: https://www.sparc.bc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Homelessness-Community-Action-Grants-Application-Form.pdfFor more information about the DTES Response, visit: https://dtesresponse.ca/For more information and the latest medical updates on COVID-19, follow the BC Centre for Disease Control on Twitter

Premier John Horgan has released the following statement in recognition of International Nurses Day:“Today is International Nurses Day, and in appreciation of B.C. nurses, the Province is proud to proclaim May 11 – 17 as Nursing Week to recognize the extraordinary contributions of licensed practical nurses, registered psychiatric nurses, registered nurses and nurse practitioners.“This year, British Columbians join people from around the world in raising our hands to the nurses working tirelessly to help people in need during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has reminded us all of the selflessness, dedication and leadership it takes to be a nurse.“May 12th also marks the 200th anniversary of Florence Nightingale’s birth. As a nurse, she helped lay the foundation for safe, sanitary medical practices in the 19th and 20th centuries, and continues to inspire those who follow in her footsteps to help ease people’s pain and suffering through compassionate care. Nightingale was famously quoted as saying, ‘How very little can be done under the spirit of fear,’ and I think these words can inspire us all to act with courage and determination during the COVID-19 crisis.“On behalf of British Columbians, thank you to B.C.’s nurses for moving heaven and earth to help people with COVID-19 and all the other medical needs that don’t stop during a pandemic. We recognize that you are being pushed to the limit, which is why we must all keep doing our part to protect and support B.C.’s front line workers and our health care system.“Like so many British Columbians, I have been standing on my front porch every evening to bang pots and pans in your honour. I continue to feel sincere gratitude each time. Thank you for everything you do.”For a French translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.12_STM_International_Nurses_Day-FR.pdfFor a Chinese translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.12_STM_International_Nurses_Day-TC.pdfFor a Punjabi translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.12_STM_International_Nurses_Day-Punjabi.pdfFor a Tagalog translation:  https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.12_STM_International_Nurses_Day-Tagalog.pdfFor a Korean translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.12_STM_International_Nurses_Day-Korean.pdf

Government has released the final report of Alan Winter, B.C.’s first innovation commissioner.The report, Putting Innovation to Work for British Columbia: Growing B.C. Companies, outlines five recommendations focused on helping innovative B.C. companies thrive and grow, while supporting more innovation across all sectors of the economy.The recommendations are as follows:

fund the establishment and operation of “innovation precincts” across B.C.;
support the development of emerging technology clusters;
use the CleanBC plan as an economic driver;
incent and protect intellectual property; and
invest in leadership talent development strategies.

“I welcome this report and I thank Dr. Winter for his commitment to making B.C.’s economy more resilient and innovative. His observations reflect the voices of the many people with whom he spoke during his term, and his recommendations come at an important time,” said Michelle Mungall, Minister of Jobs, Economic Development and Competitiveness. “Our government is committed to building B.C. back from COVID-19. This report will inform our work as we support an economic recovery that creates family-supporting jobs across British Columbia.”
The innovation commissioner is a key component of the Confidence and Supply Agreement with the BC Green Party caucus to champion B.C.’s tech sector and help it access talent and capital, as well as the national and international connections it needs to succeed.
Quotes: 
Adam Olsen, interim leader, BC Green Party —
“As we rebuild our economy from COVID-19, we have an opportunity to become more resilient to future challenges. Dr. Winter’s report provides clear advice for how we can harness innovation to grow businesses in B.C. and strengthen sectors across our economy.”
Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head —
“Dr. Winter’s recommendations will be invaluable in helping B.C.’s tech sector to advance and are of particular importance, given our collective challenge of economic recovery in the wake of COVID-19. B.C. is well placed to support and apply technology and innovation as we build a sustainable, low-carbon economy that will benefit all British Columbians.”
Alan Winter, former innovation commissioner —
“I appreciated the opportunity to be B.C.’s first innovation commissioner over the past two years, and in particular the many discussions I have had throughout B.C., federally and internationally. My recommendations are focused on helping to grow B.C. companies and are intended to be affordable, actionable in the short term and reflect the advice I have heard repeatedly. These steps will help position B.C. to prosper in the post COVID-19 economy.”
Raghwa Gopal, president and CEO, Innovate BC —
“Our goal is to ensure that the benefits of our thriving tech sector are felt by people in all regions of the province. We will continue to work with stakeholders to develop and deliver programs and services that help tech companies start, scale and stay in British Columbia.”
Quick Facts:

Winter completed his term with the B.C. government on Feb. 4, 2020.
The Putting Innovation to Work for British Columbia: Growing B.C. Companies report is the innovation commissioner’s final report and a follow up to his 2018 progress report, Observations on Innovation in British Columbia.
Mungall's mandate letter outlines actions to support and advance tech and innovation. These actions align with the recommendations outlined in the final report.
The B.C. government has acted on many of the recommendations from the innovation commissioner’s 2018 progress report, including:
A new Quantum Algorithms Institute at Simon Fraser University’s Surrey campus that will be the first step to grow the Surrey Innovation Corridor.
Leading an Emergency Management Innovation Cluster initiative, which aims to match government emergency management problems with innovative, made-in-B.C. tech solutions that are scalable and exportable.
Releasing the Technology and Innovation Policy Framework in 2019, which is informed by the observations of the innovation commissioner. The framework is being used as a guide when developing new programs, reviewing existing programming or making new funding decisions.

B.C. is in a better position to chart a long-term vision for the province according to the final report of the Emerging Economy Task Force.The 14-member task force has made 25 recommendations to help B.C. navigate global trends and technological advancements over the next 10 to 25 years. The report will also be a valuable resource to help inform the province’s COVID-19 pandemic economic recovery.The recommendations are presented within five key strategic priorities:
embracing technology and innovation
leveraging B.C.’s green economy
building a highly skilled and adaptable workforce

demonstrating public sector leadership
“The Emerging Economy Task Force looked at the most current innovations, consumer behaviour and economic sectors to identify where B.C. is going in the future,” said Michelle Mungall, Minister of Jobs, Economic Development and Competitiveness. “This important work allows us to prepare for the opportunities that lie ahead – and this report can’t come at a better time. As we plan to build B.C. back from COVID-19, our economic recovery needs this forward thinking so we can create family-supporting jobs across British Columbia.”The task force’s objective was to take a long-term view on how global trends will affect B.C.’s economy and to identify emerging opportunities across all sectors of the province.The Emerging Economy Task Force is a central part of the B.C. government’s Confidence and Supply Agreement with the BC Green Party caucus.“The Emerging Economy Task Force is clear that we must think long term if we are to position B.C.’s economy for success in these uncertain times,” said BC Green Party interim leader Adam Olsen. “As we build back from COVID-19, we must ensure that our recovery efforts help us build a sustainable and resilient economy that provides prosperity for all. This report is a valuable resource to guide that effort.”​""An Emerging Economy Task Force was proposed as a means of addressing how technology, innovation and global trends are changing business and society,"" said Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head. ""To stay competitive, B.C. must anticipate the challenges and opportunities associated with change and how they impact the many sectors of our economy, from forestry and mining to tourism and clean technology.”The task force, led by chair Kathy Kinloch, president of the BC Institute of Technology, was brought together in July 2018 to provide a better understanding of how global conditions and emerging technological advancements will shape the future of B.C.’s economy.“The work of the Emerging Economy Task Force provided a venue to explore future economic opportunities and identify challenges for B.C.,” said Kinloch. “There is a need to shift how we approach our economy in multiple dimensions, and we have offered initial recommendations in five strategic priorities. Undoubtedly, this work will need to continue and is particularly accentuated in a post COVID-19 world. On behalf of the task force, I would like to thank the B.C. government for the opportunity to hear from industry, academic and community leaders, where it became clear that the commitment to a stronger economy is a shared goal.”The final report is available at: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/about-the-bc-government/emerging-economy-task-force

The Province is further investing in B.C.’s North to support healthy community growth during major resource development and build infrastructure to meet the needs of people in the region.“Northern B.C. is rich in natural resources, but its strongest asset is its people,” said Premier John Horgan. “We are proud to work in partnership with northern communities. These funds will help address the social and infrastructure needs that arise out of the many exciting economic developments underway in those communities. We are investing in northern jobs, roads and public services – and most importantly, in northern people.”The Province is investing a total of $75 million through two programs:
The 2020 Northern Capital and Planning Grant provides $50 million directly to local governments to help address their infrastructure needs and as they prepare for major resource and economic development.
Another $25 million will be available to communities as they prepare for major economic development through the B.C. Northern Healthy Communities Fund, which will be administered through the Northern Development Initiative Trust. The fund will be available to local governments, First Nations and non-profits in the region to support local delivery of critical services, such as health and mental health care, housing and child care. 
“The need to invest in northern B.C.’s infrastructure and community services is vital, and this funding has a new and significant role to play in contributing to our province’s economic recovery, especially in light of COVID-19’s impacts on B.C.’s people, communities and economy,” said Carole James, Minister of Finance.This funding is in addition to $100 million provided through the Northern Capital and Planning Grant to communities in the northwest in 2019. It is part of ongoing dialogue between the Province and B.C.’s northwest and north-central communities on how to support the region over the longer term.“People are at the heart of strong, resilient communities and this funding is part of our continued commitment to invest in the hard-working people of the North,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “We have been listening to northern communities about their need to be ready to seize the opportunities presented by expected growth and resource development. With this funding, they will be able to plan to tackle both the infrastructure and socio-economic needs their communities are facing.”  The Northern Capital and Planning Grant and the B.C. Northern Healthy Communities Fund will contribute to a resilient B.C. economy and will complement the $1.5 billion set for economic stimulus as part of B.C.’s COVID-19 Action Plan. Quick Facts:
Through the Northern Capital Planning Grant, eligible local governments can expect to receive the following based on their populations and base assessments:
Municipalities with more than 8,000 people will receive between $5.2 million and $6.6 million.
Municipalities with fewer than 8,000 people will receive between $300,000 and $3.7 million.

Regional districts will receive between $400,000 and $1.6 million.
The B.C. Northern Healthy Communities Fund will be distributed by the Northern Development Initiative Trust through an application process.

The Nisg̱a’a Final Agreement, British Columbia’s first modern treaty, came into effect 20 years ago today.The governments of Canada, British Columbia and the Nisg̱a’a Nation commemorate this major milestone on the path of reconciliation.For the Nisg̱a’a people, May 11, 2000, marked the end of a 113-year journey and the first steps toward a brighter future. The Nisg̱a’a Final Agreement is the first treaty in British Columbia to provide constitutional certainty in respect of an Indigenous people’s Section 35 right to self-government. The Treaty recognizes Nisga’a Lands (2,000 square kilometres), secures Nisg̱a’a hunting and fishing rights in the Nass Wildlife Area and Nass Area respectively, and has opened the door for joint economic initiatives in the responsible, sustainable development of the Nisg̱a’a Nation’s natural resources — benefiting the Nisg̱a’a, as well as their fellow British Columbians and Canadians. An example of hope, trust and co-operation, the Nisg̱a’a Final Agreement is being studied by governments and Indigenous peoples the world over.Today, the Nisg̱a’a Nation includes more than 7,600 people residing primarily in the Nisga’a villages of Gingolx, Laxgalts’ap, Gitwinksihlkw and Gitlaxt’aamiks (formerly New Aiyansh) on British Columbia’s northwest coast, as well as in Terrace, Prince Rupert/Port Edward and throughout the Lower Mainland.With the land question settled and their rights secure, the Nisg̱a’a have been busy building their government and institutions, as well as facilitating development, including BC Hydro’s 335-kilometre, 287-kilovolt Northwest Transmission Line; the Long Lake Hydroelectric Project, a 31-megawatt power generation facility; and the Brucejack Mine, an underground gold and silver mine operated by Pretium Resources Inc. Each of these projects has generated employment, business opportunities and revenue.While the 20th anniversary gathering has been postponed due to the COVID-19 crisis, the governments of Canada, British Columbia and the Nisg̱a’a Nation — partners in the Treaty — seek to remind the world of what can be achieved together.Quotes:Carolyn Bennett, federal Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations – “The 20th anniversary of the implementation of the Nisg̱a’a Treaty is a major milestone in our shared history. Although a great deal has changed in the world around us, the Nisg̱a’a vision for creating a better future for their people has not. The Treaty is a living and breathing example of reconciliation in action and what we can accomplish when we work together and recognize and respect Indigenous people’s right to self-determination.”John Horgan, Premier of British Columbia – “Twenty years is a significant milestone. An entire generation of Nisg̱a’a young people have grown up as members of a self-governing treaty nation. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic means we can’t be together to recognize this special day for the Nisga’a community and the Province, but in honour of Nisg̱a’a Day and the government-to-government relationship we’ve built together over two decades, the Nisga’a flag is flying in the Hall of Honour at the B.C. Parliament Buildings. I thank the Nisg̱a’a Lisims Government for its leadership and congratulate all Nisga’a people on this anniversary.”Scott Fraser, B.C.’s Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation – “Two decades ago, the Nisg̱a’a people charted a new path on their journey of self-governance. At the same time, B.C. and Nisg̱a’a reset our relationship to focus on reconciliation, supporting an even-better life for Nisga’a communities and people. I congratulate the Nisg̱a’a leadership on the social, cultural and economic successes of the past 20 years, and look forward to the good work we will do together in the future.”Eva Clayton, President, Nisg̱a’a Lisims Government – “On this special milestone day, may we remember the generations of Nisg̱a’a men and women who worked tirelessly over 113 years for the just and honourable settlement we achieved on May 11, 2000. May we continue to work steadfastly for the prosperity and improved quality of life of Nisg̱a’a for generations yet to come.”

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are announcing 15 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 2,330 cases in British Columbia.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 871 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,098 are in the Fraser Health region, 125 are in the Island Health region, 180 are in the Interior Health region and 56 are in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report two new COVID-19 related deaths in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, for a total of 129 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“In the last day, there have been no new long-term care or assisted-living facility outbreaks. In total, 15 facilities and five acute-care units have active cases. Outbreaks have been declared over at 19 care facilities, including at Cedarbrook Chateau.“Public health teams are also providing support for community outbreaks in the poultry sector, at the Mission Institution and with those connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.“To date, 1,659 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 69 individuals are hospitalized and 21 of those are in intensive care.

The nature of COVID-19, with its greater impact on our older citizens, means the best thing you can do to protect yourself is to minimize your contact with others.“For our Elders in long-term care and assisted-living facilities, we are working hard to find innovative ways to allow for that important social connection in a safe way.“ ‘Few faces in big spaces' will be the key to our shared success.

After working in child care for more than three decades, Lorraine Trulsen thought she had seen it all, but six weeks ago the COVID-19 pandemic changed the way the world works for the director at Heritage Park Childcare Centre in Mission.“Child care is essential. Families can’t function if they don’t have access to child care they can trust,” Trulsen says.May is Child Care Month in B.C., honouring the work of thousands of child care professionals throughout the province.With only one hospital in Mission, Trulsen reached out to the families who attend her centre to see what their child care needs were and how she could help parents who are working on the front lines, fighting COVID-19.When two nurses responded saying they needed child care, Trulsen didn’t hesitate to keep her doors open.“This is the right thing to do, to be there for the first responders, nurses and other essential service workers who need care for their children,” Trulsen says.She did, however, change the way the centre cares for kids, establishing new processes to ensure children, parents and staff stay healthy.The morning drop-off routine now includes hand washing, complete with a 20-second song to make sure the kids have fun while stopping the spread.While those processes help to ensure the physical health of the children at her centre, Trulsen wants to make sure she is also looking after their emotional health, saying child care is about the whole connection, including the social one.She started a private Facebook group for families at her centre so kids and parents who are no longer attending in person can say hi, share photos and videos, and keep in touch with their friends and educators.Trulsen says its been valuable for her staff, too. They love coming into work and feel like they are part of a big family. As a community-based centre, those enrolled at Heritage Park are part of that family. Staying connected, even virtually, is important for all of them.“I think this situation has shown parents how tough child care can be,” Trulsen says. “It seems like everyone has realized that child care is essential. My staff, they’re the heroes.”Trulsen says it’s been heartwarming to see the community come together during these challenging times and wants essential service workers in Mission to know, “If you need care, we are here. Our centre is your centre.”Quick Facts:
In response to COVID-19, the Province has developed a child care referral system to help parents in essential service roles find licensed child care nearby. Parents can fill out a form to identify their need for urgent care at: www.gov.bc.ca/essential-service-child-care
	     Or by calling 1 888 338-6622 and selecting Option 4.
Parents who are not in an essential service role are asked to care for their children at home if possible, or to complete the above form to find an available space nearby after priority has been given to essential service workers.
In November 2018, Heritage Park Childcare Centre was selected to deliver low-cost child care as a Childcare BC Universal Prototype Site, including 12 infant/toddler spaces and 25 spaces for children aged three to five years.

With temperatures rising throughout the province, British Columbians are urged to take steps to prepare for the possibility of flooding.B.C.’s most severe floods usually occur in spring and early summer when melting snow and rain combine. Floods can also be caused by storm surges, ice jams or damage to structures like dikes and dams.Here are some tips to help you and your family prepare for potential flooding:

Protect your home: The public is advised to prepare for possible flooding of low-lying areas by moving equipment and other assets to higher ground, where possible. Clear perimeter drains, eavestroughs and gutters. Sandbags help and can be available through your local government.
Create grab-and-go bags: Assemble an individual grab-and-go bag for each member of your household with the essentials they will need if asked to evacuate.
Recognize the danger signs: If you live near a waterway, a change in water colour or rapid change in water level (especially a drop) could indicate a problem upstream. Call your local fire, police or public works department immediately if you suspect something out of the ordinary.

If you face a threatening flood situation, park vehicles away from streams and waterways, move electrical appliances to upper floors and anchor fuel supplies. Listen to local officials if you are asked to evacuate. In the event of flooding, here are some tips about what to avoid:

Steer clear of river shorelines: 

Keep away from river edges and shorelines. During periods of high flow, river banks may be unstable and more prone to sudden collapse. Stay well away and keep young children and pets away from the banks of fast-flowing streams and flooded areas or bridges.

Do not drive through flood water: 
Never attempt to drive or walk in flood water. Just 15 centimetres (six inches) of fast-moving water can knock over an adult, and 61 centimetres (two feet) of rushing water can carry away most vehicles, including SUVs and pickup trucks.

Landslide risk:
Heavy rain and snowmelt may contribute to landslides and dangerous debris in creeks and waterways. Be safe and do not go down to watch the rushing water. If you notice trees beginning to lean or bend near your home, or cracks developing in the hillside, consult an engineer or contact local authorities.

British Columbians can find more details in the new Flood Preparedness Guide released by PreparedBC. The guide contains useful information that will help British Columbians better protect themselves and their homes, and understand what to do if their home or community is at risk of flooding.Learn More:The Flood Preparedness Guide is available online: www.preparedbc.ca/floodsFor tips on how to prepare grab-and-go bags, visit: www.preparedbc.ca/emergencykitFor information on evacuation alerts and orders, visit: www.emergencyinfobc.gov.bc.ca

People following the provincial health officer’s advice to stay home to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 are encouraged to take action now to prevent house fires and save lives.The Office of the Fire Commissioner has seen an increase in reported fire-related fatalities since January 1. Between January 1 and April 30, 2020 there were 15 fire-related fatalities in British Columbia. Over the same period last year, there were five fire-related fatalities.“My thoughts go out to the families and communities impacted by these tragic deaths,” said Jennifer Rice, Parliamentary Secretary for Emergency Preparedness. “We all have a role to play in keeping each other safe. This week is Emergency Prepardness Week, and as people remain close to home during COVID-19, it’s an opportunity to test our smoke alarms and practise our home fire escape plans. It could save a life.”“It’s up to each of us to make sure these types of tragedies do not happen,” said Brian Godlonton, Fire Commissioner. “In a typical home fire, you may have as little as one to two minutes to get out safely from the time the smoke alarm sounds. There are simple things that we can do to prevent a fire from happening and be prepared to react if a fire starts.”Here are some tips to help keep yourself, your family and your loved ones safe at home:Reduce fire risks
Unattended cooking is a leading cause of home fires. Always stay in the kitchen when cooking.
Always extinguish candles before leaving the room.
Encourage smokers to smoke outside the home and outside the garage. Thoroughly extinguish all smoking materials in water or sand.
Avoid overloading electrical outlets.
Make sure smoke alarms work
Test smoke alarms monthly by pressing the test button. Replace batteries according to manufacturer's instructions.
Only working smoke alarms can give you the early warning needed to safely escape a fire in your home.
Make and practise a home fire escape plan
Make your home escape plan.
Make sure everyone knows two ways out of each room, if possible. 
All exits must be unobstructed and easy to use.
Determine who will be responsible for helping young children, older adults and anyone who needs assistance to escape.
Choose a meeting place outside, such as a tree or a lamp post, where everyone can be accounted for.
Call 911 or a local emergency number from outside the home, from a cellphone or a neighbour’s home.
Once out, stay out. Never re-enter a burning building.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:
“Today we are announcing 29 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 2,315 cases in British Columbia.
“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 866 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,089 are in the Fraser Health region, 125 are in the Island Health region (note: two cases were removed from yesterday’s Island Health total due to a data error), 180 are in the Interior Health region and 55 are in the Northern Health region.
“We are saddened to report one new COVID-19 related death in the Fraser Health region, for a total of 127 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.
“In the last day, there have been no new long-term care or assisted-living facility outbreaks. In total, 16 facilities and five acute-care units have active cases. Outbreaks have now been declared over at 18 care facilities.
“Public health teams are also providing support to a number of community outbreaks, actively contact tracing those who may be directly affected and their close contacts.
“There has been no change in the number of confirmed positive cases at Fraser Valley Specialty Poultry, United Poultry in Vancouver or at the Mission Institution federal correctional centre.
“There are now 61 positive cases at Superior Poultry in Coquitlam and 17 connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.
“To date, 1,579 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered.
""Of the total COVID-19 cases, 73 individuals are hospitalized and 20 of those are in intensive care. The remaining people are recovering at home in self-isolation.
“We must continue with what we have been doing, because it is working. We have flattened our curve and must keep it there.
“Until we move into Phase 2, the orders, restrictions and guidance remain in place.
“Our go-forward principles are our playbook for where we are today and how we will move forward. They are the rules to help us decide what is safe for ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. These principles will not change until COVID-19 is no longer a risk to any of us.
“Physical distancing is here to stay. We must continue to keep a safe physical distance from anyone outside of our household.
“There are no exceptions to staying home if you are ill. Even if it seems to be seasonal allergies, a cold or potentially COVID-19. And if you do have symptoms of COVID-19, contact 811 or your health-care provider to be assessed and tested.
“Travelling anywhere increases the likelihood of making us an unintentional carrier for COVID-19. While essential travel must continue, personal travel needs to be minimized, wherever possible.
“Our playbook for the pandemic has the ‘rules’ all of us must learn and follow. Keeping these top of mind will allow us to keep progressing through BC’s Restart Plan:

Maintain physical distancing outside your household. For example, no handshaking or hugging, keeping your number of contacts low and keeping a safe distance.
Practise good hygiene – hand hygiene, avoid touching your face and respiratory etiquette.
Stay at home and away from others if you are feeling ill. That means staying home from school, work or socializing.
Make necessary contact safer with appropriate controls, e.g., using plexiglass barriers or redesigning spaces.
Increase cleaning of frequently touched surfaces at home and work.
Consider using non-medical masks in situations where physical distancing cannot be maintained, such as on transit or while shopping.
Continue to minimize non-essential personal travel.
Stay informed, be prepared and follow public health advice.

“This weekend is Mother’s Day and a time to celebrate and honour someone important to us. We can all do something special for our mothers, whether they are near or far, in your household bubble or not.
“For now, avoid any close physical contact, unless your mother is in your immediate household. And if your mother is older, awaiting surgery or has an underlying illness, celebrate at a safe distance. Give your mother the gift of staying safe and healthy.
“Let’s continue to stand together in spirit as we stay apart and move forward together.”

Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction, has issued the following statement regarding tent encampments in Victoria and Vancouver:“This is a challenging time for everyone in British Columbia, especially those facing homelessness. Early in the pandemic it became clear that COVID-19, coupled with the ongoing overdose crisis, has created significant health and safety concerns for our province’s vulnerable people living in encampments, the professionals and volunteers who support these groups and the communities we all share.“On April 25, 2020, the Province took the necessary steps to support people’s transition from unsafe, dense encampments in Oppenheimer Park in Vancouver, and Topaz Park and the Pandora corridor in Victoria, into safer, temporary accommodation as a first step toward more secure housing.“Action needed to be taken for the health, safety and well-being of campers, and the front-line workers who support them. For those who were living in encampments, the wraparound health and other supports our government is providing will drive lasting, positive change for many individuals fighting hardship or addiction. The co-operation between the Province and the cities of Victoria and Vancouver, and the compassionate approach of BC Housing, service providers and the health authorities, has been remarkable.“From the beginning, we committed to a compassionate, supportive approach, putting people’s housing and support needs first, to manage this transition. I’m encouraged our approach has been working. As of May 7, at 4 p.m., over 320 people have moved into safe, temporary accommodations in both Vancouver and Victoria, with wraparound supports to protect their health and safety.“We have worked to ensure those who were living in Oppenheimer Park are moving into safe, temporary accommodations with wraparound supports by May 9.“While we have been working with the hotel sector and service delivery partners toward the May 9 target in Victoria, it is now clear that more time is needed to ensure each person leaving Topaz Park and Pandora Avenue is moved into the accommodation that best meets their needs.“To this end, the Province, in consultation with the City of Victoria, has extended the deadline from May 9 to May 20, 2020, to move people from Topaz Park and Pandora Avenue into safe, temporary accommodations. No one will be asked to leave these encampments without being offered a suitable temporary housing option.“The Province is also developing plans for longer term permanent housing solutions for this population, with ongoing supports. These plans will build on the 23,000 homes already underway or complete through our 10-year housing plan and will include strategies to provide the right combination of housing and supports to mitigate the chances of a return to homelessness. That work will continue in the weeks and months ahead, but the priority now is on the immediate health and safety of people experiencing homelessness in these public health emergencies.“Homelessness and affordable housing continue to be concerns throughout British Columbia. People and communities are suffering as a result. Over the last few years, we have taken urgent action to provide supportive housing for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness throughout the province, opening more than 2,100 new supportive homes for people experiencing homelessness with a further 900 underway around the province, toward a goal of 4,900 over 10 years. This includes 21 units nearing completion in Victoria and 784 complete in Vancouver.“We knew this would be a challenging transition for people, but I am proud of the significant steps we have taken to provide safer and more secure options for people. While this pandemic has been an unprecedented challenge, it is heartening to know that hundreds of people, and the communities they inhabit, will be healthier and safer through this initiative.”Learn More:For daily updates on the number of people being moved from the encampments, visit: https://twitter.com/bc_housing

David Eby, B.C.'s Attorney General, has accepted an invitation to participate as the provincial representative on the federal government’s Action Committee on Court Operations in Response to COVID-19.Chaired by the Chief Justice of Canada, and co-established by the Attorney General of Canada, the committee has had its first meeting by teleconference.The committee will focus primarily on the immediate need to restore and stabilize court operations, including the resumption of in-person judicial processes and hearings. It will also facilitate information sharing and identification of common principles and best practices.“I’m honoured to help facilitate the participation of all of the provinces and territories in the committee’s work, and to share what we learn in British Columbia as we support our chief justices and chief judge to get our courtrooms to a new normal,” Eby said. “While it will not be easy, it is urgent that we meet the twin demands of justice and public health. Our response will be better and stronger if we work together, and this committee will assist in the national effort.”The Ministry of Attorney General has established two advisory groups to help the B.C. government support courts and tribunals in delivering services during the pandemic and in mitigating the pandemic’s impacts on the justice system. On April 24, 2020, the Province established the provincial Justice COVID-19 Response Group and the Cross Jurisdictional Technical Advisory Group. Both groups are currently active.Learn More:For more information about the work of the Ministry of Attorney General and British Columbia’s courts and tribunals to respond to the pandemic, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/justice/covid-19Provincial justice system advisory groups established: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020AG0032-000747

People in Metro Vancouver can rest assured that they will be able to get back to work as the Province of B.C. and TransLink announced their commitment to ensure transit service is available as British Columbians safely restart the province and its economy in the coming weeks and months.The Province and TransLink are working on a comprehensive solution to address the major financial impacts that TransLink, like many transit agencies across the country, has incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Given the progress in these discussions, TransLink and its operating companies will suspend the service reductions planned to begin on May 18 and rescind layoff notices issued to approximately 1,500 employees. The Province and TransLink will also continue to call on the federal government for a national solution to the challenges facing transit systems.With the release of British Columbia’s Restart Plan, TransLink will review all transit service levels to ensure it is balancing the need to help people get around the region, with the need to maintain and respect enhanced safety protocols. Further service and safety-related announcements will be made in due course.Quotes:Selina Robinson, Minister for Municipal Affairs and Housing –    “As we begin to restore the economy through BC’s Restart Plan, services like TransLink will be key to British Columbia’s transition and recovery success.  We remain committed to working with and supporting TransLink through this difficult time and into recovery to find solutions that will benefit Metro Vancouver and British Columbia, and continue to call on the federal government to join us in this support.”Jonathan X. Coté, chair, Mayors’ Council on Regional Transportation –“Today’s commitment by the Province of B.C. to help TransLink keep transit service running on Day 1 of the BC Restart Plan is an important first step towards returning TransLink to financial sustainability in the long term. I look forward to working with Minister Robinson and her team through the summer to address the pandemic’s impacts on TransLink finances so that TransLink is equipped to help rebuild our region’s sustainable, innovative economy.”Kevin Desmond, CEO, TransLink –“This is another important step forward for re-starting British Columbia and Metro Vancouver’s economy. The transit service provided by TransLink is essential to the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in our region. We will be ready to provide safe, reliable transit service as people return to work. We are proud to be partnering with the Province of B.C. to ensure transit service is there as the economy recovers.”

The first aerial-spraying treatment to eradicate invasive gypsy moths from 167 hectares of rural land in Raspberry, north of Castlegar, will occur next week, weather permitting.The gypsy moth is destructive to native and urban forests and orchards. Without treatment, it could spread to other parts of the province and put at risk hundreds of species of trees and shrubs, including those in endangered Garry oak ecosystems.Spraying will take place north of Broadwater Road, and extend east of Pass Creek road and west of Marshall Road.Spraying will start shortly after sunrise (approximately 5:20 a.m.) and should be completed by 7:30 a.m. daily. Up to four separate treatments are required this spring. Unless delayed by poor weather, each treatment is expected to take one to two mornings to apply. The ministry aims to complete the spraying by mid-June.The spray area will be treated with Foray 48B, which contains Bacillus thuringiensis var kurstaki (Btk). Btk is an organic, natural agent that has been approved for the control of gypsy moth larvae in Canada since 1961. Foray 48B and other Btk formulations received certification for acceptable use on certified organic farms by the Organic Materials Review Institute of Canada in April 2018.Btk is naturally present in urban, forest and agricultural soil throughout the province. It does not harm humans, mammals, birds, fish, plants, reptiles, amphibians, bees or other insects and affects caterpillars only after they have ingested it.The spray will be applied by a low-flying plane. Residents within and adjacent to the treatment area will likely hear the aircraft at some point during the treatment. The spray equipment is GPS-calibrated and controlled. Spraying will occur only when the plane is immediately over the treatment area.Anyone wishing to minimize contact with the spray material may choose to remain indoors with their windows and doors closed during the treatment, and for at least 30 minutes after. Pets and livestock that may be frightened by the aircraft should be secured or brought indoors.Poor weather or wind may cause treatments to be postponed with little advance notice, and the treatment will resume the next suitable morning.A telephone line is staffed during business hours, and provides up-to-date spray schedules and recorded information 24 hours per day toll-free, at 1 866 917-5999.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are announcing 33 new cases of COVID-19 for a total of 2,288 cases in British Columbia.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 865 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,064 are in the Fraser Health region, 126 are in the Island Health region, 179 are in the Interior Health region and 54 are in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report two new COVID-19 related deaths, one in the Fraser Health region and one in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, for a total of 126 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“In the last day, there have been no new long-term care or assisted-living facility outbreaks. In total, 16 facilities and five acute-care units have active cases. Outbreaks have now been declared over at 18 care facilities, including the Swedish Canadian Manor.“Public health teams are also providing support to a number of community outbreaks, actively contact tracing those who may be directly affected and their close contacts.“There are seven confirmed positive cases at Fraser Valley Specialty Poultry, 56 at Superior Poultry in Coquitlam and 35 at United Poultry in Vancouver.“There are also 134 inmates and staff confirmed positive at the Mission Institution federal correctional centre, as well as 16 positive cases of COVID-19 connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.“To date, 1,512 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 76 individuals are hospitalized, 20 of whom are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“We are in Phase 1 of our four-part COVID-19 B.C. Restart Plan, which means we must continue doing what we have been doing since the orders and restrictions were put in place a few weeks ago.“Yesterday, the Premier announced we will be ready to move to Phase 2 after the May long weekend. This is something we can all look forward to, but we are not there yet.“Staying home as much as possible and being respectful of those around us when we do go out are still very much a necessity for all of us. These principles will not change, even as we move to the next phase: Safe physical distancing, washing our hands and avoiding non-essential personal travel.“It will be a slow and thoughtful restart. As we shift to the next phase, not everyone will be ready to increase their social connection or to restart their business at the same time.“Whether an individual or business, each of us must use the principles we have set out to guide our actions moving forward.“If you are senior, or someone with an underlying illness, your increased risk has not lessened. This means that as you look ahead and consider how you may safely increase your social connections, this needs to be top of mind.“For businesses, public health and WorkSafeBC will outline the specific requirements that must be followed for your business sector and workforce. Template plans and checklists for businesses are being developed for you to follow.“Businesses can make decisions for themselves, based on their ability to meet the requirements that are set out. While individual plans will not need to be submitted for approval, you will need to ensure your plan is publicly posted for everyone to see.“This approach will give your employees and customers the assurance and confidence that you are doing all you can to protect them.“Underpinning the Restart Plan is our COVID-19 health system response.“Today, the surgical renewal plan was announced to significantly increase the number of surgeries and clear the backlog created by COVID-19. “The renewal plan will see our health-care system maximize every available operating room, allowing new capacity, and hiring and training staff to ensure we can provide care for patients while maintaining capacity for a potential surge of COVID-19 patients.“Testing remains in place for anyone who has symptoms of COVID-19. Additionally, public health teams will continue to be on high alert, monitoring and contact tracing new cases of COVID-19.“This renewal plan and our approach moving forward is about ensuring we are operating our health-care system in the safest way possible to protect patients and our health-care workers.“Like everyone around the world, this is a new challenge for all us. Our future is in all of our hands. We must continue to stand together in spirit as we get through this pandemic together.”Learn More:For more information on B.C.'s Restart Plan, visit:

Surgeries that were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic are starting back up as part of a massive surgical renewal plan.“British Columbians have stepped up to the challenge of COVID-19 by making sacrifices, including thousands of people who have waited for postponed elective surgeries. This has been very difficult for people and their families,” said Premier John Horgan. “But these sacrifices have helped flatten the curve in B.C., and now we can move forward, safely, getting people the surgeries they’ve been waiting for.”Beginning this month, the Province will launch an extensive surgical renewal plan that will include calling patients, adding new capacity, and hiring and training staff.“On March 16, we made the difficult decision to postpone surgeries to prepare our health-care system for a potential surge of COVID-19 patients,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “Our commitment is now to get patients through their surgery safely. It is a massive undertaking, but we are giving the same 100% effort to the task that we’ve made to flattening the curve in B.C.”By May 18, 2020, an estimated 30,000 non-urgent scheduled surgeries will have either been postponed or left on a waitlist due to COVID-19. A further 24,000 patients could also be without a referral to a waitlist. This presents a unique and unprecedented challenge never faced by B.C.’s health system. The demands placed by COVID-19 have meant decreased productivity in operating rooms, meaning fewer surgical cases can be completed in the same time.The 30,000 non-urgent elective postponed surgeries, combined with the 24,000 new surgeries are a substantial backlog to address. The impact is greater than anything faced by B.C.'s health system.The actions taken under the plan will ensure the health system can keep up with demand for new surgeries and clear the existing COVID-19 backlog in the next 17 to 24 months.The timeline demonstrates the Province’s ongoing commitment to have British Columbians access much-needed surgeries.Learn More:For recommendations on protecting families and communities from COVID-19, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/For non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid-19

 The BC Coroners Service has published an updated report on illicit drug toxicity deaths to the end of March 2020.Key preliminary findings of these drug death reports are below. Data are subject to change:
In March 2020, there were 113 suspected illicit drug toxicity deaths. Exceeding 100 deaths in a month has not occurred since March 2019. These 113 deaths represent a 3% decrease in the number of deaths seen in March 2019. This is a 61% increase over the number of deaths in February 2020.
Compared to the January and February 2020 average, the increase in March occurred in every health authority, notably in Fraser (91% increase) and Island health (80% increase). The March 2019 average (117) was also higher than the January and February 2019 average (89).
To date, males accounted for 76% of deaths in 2020,  similar to 2019 with 76%, and slightly lower than in 2018 with 80%.
In 2020, 73% of those dying were aged 19 to 49. In 2019 and 2018, 68% were in this age range.
By health authority, Northern Health has the highest rate of illicit drug toxicity deaths, followed by Interior Health in 2020.
From 2018 to March 2020, the rates of illicit drug toxicity deaths are highest in Hope, Fort Nelson, North Thompson, Lillooet and Arrow Lakes.
No deaths have been reported at supervised consumption or drug overdose prevention sites.

Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions; Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development; and Rob Fleming, Minister of Education; have released the following statement in recognition of National Child and Youth Mental Health Day:“Every child has the right to mental-health care when and where they need it. And it is our responsibility, as the adults in their lives, to ensure they get it. Today is Child and Youth Mental Health Day – a day for parents, educators, caretakers and the community as a whole to come together to talk about child and youth mental health and to connect with young people about their mental health. The theme for this year is ‘caring’ and the message is simple: ‘I care about you.’“It could not be a more-perfect message for these unprecedented and uncertain times. Up to 84,000 children in British Columbia are experiencing a mental health challenge at any given time. Even before COVID-19, B.C. faced an increased demand for child and youth mental health services. Last year alone, 28,000 children and youth received help. This year, that number is expected to be much higher.“While the pandemic is challenging all of us, it presents unique issues for young people who are missing their friends and social connections, wrestling with new ways of learning and feeling anxious and unsure about what the future holds. Many have seen abrupt endings to things they have worked toward, or anticipated, for years.“But the pandemic has also shown us that people have an incredible ability to come together – to create community and lift each other up in times of crisis. We are reminded that it does, indeed, take a village to raise a child and that raising a child means caring for the whole child – their physical health and their mental health.“We have seen that remarkable caring for children from so many people. Teachers are reaching out to students to see how they are doing while also supporting remote learning. School staff are planning creative ways to recognize graduates. Counsellors and support workers are checking in regularly with vulnerable young people. Parents and caregivers are doing everything they can to strengthen caring and social connections because they know that mental well-being is the primary goal right now and well into the future.“And, across government, it is a goal we share to ensure that every young person is able to build a solid foundation for long-term mental health. A year ago, we launched A Pathway to Hope – our roadmap to creating a system of mental health and addictions care that works for everyone. Prevention and early intervention, catching emerging problems before they become larger, was a main focus.“Since announcing the pathway, we have made big strides to provide better mental health care and supports for children, youth and their families. We have increased the number of Foundry locations in the province to nine up and running, and the tenth is on the way. We are building child and youth mental health teams in our school districts. We are expanding the Erase (Expect Respect and Safe Education) program in our schools, and we are working to hire an additional 120 child and youth mental health workers over three years.“Recognizing the mental health challenges brought on or exacerbated by COVID-19, we have also worked with our partners to launch Foundry Virtual Clinic and to expand access to BounceBack and Living Life to the Full programs. To give parents and caregivers practical advice and strategies to help children deal with anxiety, we have adapted the Everyday Anxiety Strategies for Educators (EASE) at Home program, making it available free online for everyone. We have minimized face-to-face contact at our walk-in clinics and are offering supports and resources virtually using Skype and telephone. Mental health clinicians throughout the province continue to be available to help children and families at no cost, should they require additional support or guidance.“These extraordinary times have challenged our children in ways they have not seen in their lifetimes – in ways few people have seen. But where there is challenge, there is also the opportunity to make lasting change and to come back better and stronger. More than ever, young people are talking openly and honestly about their mental health.“As the adults in their lives, we must continue to applaud and encourage these courageous conversations while providing the supports they need. By doing that, we send a very clear message when it comes to the mental health of our children: ‘We care about you.’ Each and every one of you.”Child and Youth Mental Health Resources:Child and Youth Mental Health intake clinics:

390,2020-05-06 16:35:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020PREM0026-000826,Government Website,Premier outlines plan to restart B.C. safely,"

British Columbians will move forward with safely restarting their province beginning in mid-May, according to a plan announced by Premier John Horgan.Under BC’s Restart Plan, government will work closely with public health officials, businesses and labour organizations to lift restrictions in phases, gradually allowing for more social and economic activity, while closely monitoring health information to minimize the risk to the public.“Our plan puts safety first. British Columbians have made enormous sacrifices so far, and it’s thanks to them that we’re able to begin to lift some restrictions,” Horgan said. “We’ll allow activities to resume as the evidence and experts tell us it is appropriate to do so. By moving carefully and deliberately, we will help British Columbians get to a ‘new normal,’ where more of our social and economic life can resume.”Restarting economic activity will look different in B.C. than in other jurisdictions, because only a small number of sectors in the province were closed by public health order. Many other provinces are just now reaching the level of safe operations B.C. has been able to maintain throughout the pandemic.B.C. is currently in Phase 1 of the restart plan. Phase 2, which will begin in mid-May, includes:
small social gatherings;
a resumption of elective surgeries and regulated health services like physiotherapy, dentistry, chiropractors and in-person counselling;
provincial parks open for day use;
opening more non-essential businesses in keeping with safe operations plans;
recalling the provincial legislature for regular sittings.
Essential businesses that have remained open during the pandemic, so far, have done so safely with the support of WorkSafeBC. Government will build on this successful experience by supporting all businesses as they take steps toward a successful reopening. Sectors that were ordered closed will be asked to work with WorkSafeBC to develop plans to reopen safely. WorkSafeBC is developing industry-specific guidance to help employers bring workers and customers back safely. Any business restarting operations must ensure it is in compliance with the provincial health officer’s orders and in accordance with occupational health and safety guidance provided by WorkSafeBC.The target date for the start of Phase 3, which will include opening up of additional businesses and services, is between June and September 2020, if transmission rates remain low or in decline.Phase 4 will only be achieved when the threat of COVID-19 has been significantly diminished through widespread vaccination, broad successful treatments, evidence of community immunity, or the equivalent.Most provincial parks will reopen, starting May 14, for day-use only. On June 1, many remaining facilities, including campgrounds, will reopen. A small number of parks that attract large crowds, or where reopening would pose a health risk to nearby communities, will remain closed.A strong emphasis on personal hygiene for all British Columbians, including hand washing, physical distancing and staying at home if you are sick, will be crucial for the success of every phase of the plan.While B.C. already has sufficient testing and tracking capacity, by continuing to increase these, government will be able to identify any flare ups in COVID-19 case numbers and address them. This approach will support public safety and confidence.“Today, we’ve unveiled our plan for a slow and safe restart. We need to be vigilant, to make sure we keep flattening the curve of transmission,” Premier Horgan said. “There is much more to do. But we will get through this pandemic to better days by working together and keeping each other safe.”For a WorkSafeBC backgrounder, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/BG_Support_for_Workplaces_Resuming_Operation.pdfFor backgrounders on schools and parks, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/BG_Parks_and_Sites_and_In-Class_Learning.pdfLearn More: For more information about BC's Restart Plan, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/restartbcFor a Chinese translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.06_NR_Premier_Outlines_Plan_to_Restart_BC_Safely-TC.pdfFor a Punjabi translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.06_NR_Premier_Outlines_Plan_to_Restart_BC_Safely-Punjabi.pdfFor a French translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.05.06_NR_Premier_Outlines_Plan_to_Restart_BC_Safely-FR.pdf

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today we are announcing 23 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 2,255 cases in British Columbia.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 852 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,046 are in the Fraser Health region, 124 are in the Island Health region, 179 are in the Interior Health region and 54 are in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report three new COVID-19 related deaths: one in the Island Health region and two in Vancouver Coastal Health region, for a total of 124 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“In the last day, there were no new long-term care or assisted-living facility outbreaks. In total, 17 facilities and five acute-care units have active outbreaks, with outbreaks now declared over at 17 care facilities.“Public health teams are also providing support to a number of community outbreaks, actively contact tracing those who may be directly affected and their close contacts.“There are seven confirmed positive cases at Fraser Valley Specialty Poultry, 56 at Superior Poultry in Coquitlam and 35 at United Poultry in Vancouver.“There are also 134 inmates and staff confirmed positive at the Mission Institution federal correctional centre, as well as 16 positive cases of COVID-19 connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.“To date, 1,494 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 74 individuals are hospitalized, and 19 of those are in intensive care. The remaining people are recovering at home in self-isolation.“We are not yet ready to make any changes to the measures we have in place – just this week, new outbreaks have emerged. Without continued vigilance, hot spots will quickly flare.“We must chart a safe path forward together – one that will protect our province and give us the confidence that we can stay safe while increasing our social connections.“As Premier John Horgan has said, finding the right balance in this next phase of COVID-19 requires all of us to work together, to follow our playbook principles and remember the basics of keeping a safe physical distance from others, with fewer faces and open spaces.“We must also continue to show kindness and compassion to those around us, as we remain 100% committed. It is in all of our hands. Let’s remember to wash them.”Learn More:For the slides presented at the May 4 media briefing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/modelling-projectionsFor mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca

More supports for communities will be available following a rise in racist incidents targeting Asian people during the COVID-19 pandemic.“It is very concerning that we are seeing an increase in racially motivated attacks toward people of Asian heritage since the COVID-19 outbreak,” said Anne Kang, Minister of Citizens’ Services and responsible for Multiculturalism. “These incidents are completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated. We are acting now to address racism at the community level and ensure all British Columbians are free from discrimination and intimidation.”Following a competitive bidding process, the Province has selected the Victoria Immigrant and Refugee Centre Society (VIRCS) to serve as a provincial hub to help communities address hate activity and take on systemic and institutionalized racism throughout the province.The provincial government launched Resilience BC, a multi-faceted, provincewide approach in challenging racism at a local level in November 2019.“VIRCS is very proud to lead the important work being done in B.C. communities to stop the spread of racism and end the recent spikes in hate crimes,” said David Lau, executive director, VIRCS. “We look forward to collaborating with community leaders across the province to create innovative local resources to advance multiculturalism, support reconciliation with Indigenous communities and fight prejudice to provide a fully inclusive province for all British Columbians.”Resilience BC will connect communities with a network of information, supports and training to help them respond to incidents of racism and hate. The program is one of many actions the B.C. government is taking as part of its commitment to stand up for diversity, end racism and all forms of discrimination, and support multiculturalism in British Columbia.The Province has begun a competitive bidding process to establish community-based Resilience BC spokes to work with the provincial hub to address racism and hate at local and regional levels. Community organizations interested in leading anti-racism and anti-hate efforts in their communities are encouraged to submit proposals by May 19, 2020.  Quick Facts:
The development of Resilience BC was informed by input gathered during a community consultation led by Ravi Kahlon, former parliamentary secretary for sport and multiculturalism, in 2019.
VIRCS is a non-profit organization founded in November 1989 by three former refugees and is regarded as a leader in anti-racism work in Greater Victoria.
As the appointed hub service provider for Resilience BC, VIRCS has been awarded $240,000 for activities in the fiscal year 2020-21.
The total investment in Resilience BC is $540,000 annually. This funding is being provided through the ministry's existing budget.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today we are announcing eight new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 2,232 cases in British Columbia.""Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 849 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,031 are in the Fraser Health region, 124 are in the Island Health region, 177 are in the Interior Health region and 51 are in the Northern Health region.""We are saddened to report four new COVID-19 related deaths, three in the Fraser Health region and one in Vancouver Coastal Health region, for a total of 121 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.""In the last day, there has been one new long-term care facility outbreak at Evergreen House in the Vancouver Coastal Health region and two outbreaks at acute-care units at Ridge Meadows and Richmond Hospitals. In total, 17 facilities and five acute-care units have active outbreaks, with outbreaks now declared over at 17 care facilities.""Public health teams are also providing support to a number of community outbreaks, actively contact tracing those who may be directly affected and their close contacts.""There are seven confirmed positive cases at Fraser Valley Specialty Poultry, 55 at Superior Poultry in Coquitlam and 35 employees confirmed positive at United Poultry in Vancouver.""There are also 134 inmates and staff confirmed positive at the Mission Institution federal correctional centre, as well as 15 positive cases of COVID-19 connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.""To date, 1,472 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered.""Of the total COVID-19 cases, 78 individuals are hospitalized, and 21 of those are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“We have to be prepared that it will take some time for a vaccine to be developed and broadly available for everyone. Our current understanding is that it could be up to 18 months. Until that time, we must continue to hold the line on COVID-19, even as we gradually ease some restrictions. This is the balance that we must find together.“We have put the brakes on COVID-19, but new cases and outbreaks persist. As the modelling has shown, moving too quickly can only cause harm to us all.“Our ‘new normal’ practices apply to every person and every situation with no exception. They are our playbook for the weeks and months ahead. These include:
staying informed, being prepared and following public health advice;
practising good hygiene – hand hygiene, avoid touching face and respiratory etiquette;
no exceptions to staying at home and away from others if feeling ill – whether for school, work or socializing;
maintaining physical distancing outside your household, for example, no hand shaking or hugging, keeping your number of contacts low and keeping a safe distance;
making necessary contact safer with appropriate controls, e.g., using plexiglass barriers or redesigning spaces;
increasing cleaning of frequently touched surfaces at home and work;
considering the use of non-medical masks in situations where physical distancing cannot be maintained, such as on transit or while shopping; and
continuing to reduce non-essential personal travel. 
“Keep this top of mind in everything you do. They are the guideposts for our path forward.“Our shared health and well-being relies on all of us to be threads in a rope; side-by-side and far stronger all together, when we are physically apart.""Learn More:For the slides presented in today’s media briefing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/modelling-projectionsFor mental health and anxiety support visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca

The Province is opening a 45-bed emergency response centre with wraparound supports and services at Save-On-Foods Memorial Centre, the first site in B.C. to feature pop-up pods that provide privacy for people staying there.The new temporary accommodation site will house people living in encampments on the Pandora Avenue corridor and Topaz Park in Victoria.“This is a challenging time for everyone, especially for people experiencing homelessness. In Victoria, we have seen encampments at Topaz Park and the Pandora corridor grow into unsafe, dense encampments that are compounding existing health, well-being and safety challenges,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “The centre offers a temporary and secure place with wraparound support services to help people stay safe during this time.”The temporary emergency response centre is scheduled to open in the coming days, once all staff are in place. GSL Group, the developer and operator of the facility, is extending the use of the arena to BC Housing to provide shelter to vulnerable people in the community during the COVID-19 pandemic.“From the beginning of the crisis, we've said we could make our arenas throughout B.C. available for medical purposes, if needed,"" said Graham Lee, president and CEO of GSL Group. “We are pleased to support the Province's effort to provide an emergency response centre and the ongoing efforts from the Province and the City of Victoria to support those in need.”BC Housing is partnering with PHS Community Services Society to operate the emergency response centre, which will receive people referred by Island Health and BC Housing. The centre will accommodate couples and groups of people who wish to stay together, where possible.BC Housing is partnering with Staples Business Advantage to provide pop-up pods that are being rapidly installed in the arena to provide privacy. The advantage of this pop-up solution is the speed at which the pods can be assembled. The Province has plans to expand their use at other emergency response centres.In addition to a space of their own, people will have access to services such as meals, washroom facilities, health-care services, addictions treatment and harm reduction, storage for personal belongings and other supports.“We are grateful to GSL for working with BC Housing and the Province to make this facility available to help those in Victoria in need of temporary sheltering, meals or specialized health services,"" said Lisa Helps, mayor, City of Victoria. ""Moving into the arena in the short term is a step closer for people to have safe, secure long-term housing.”BC Housing has also partnered with the Aboriginal Coalition to End Homelessness to open 12 temporary shelter spaces at a different location to provide culturally supportive services to Indigenous peoples who are experiencing homelessness in the community.From April 25 to May 4, 2020, 92 people from encampments on Pandora Avenue and in Topaz Park have moved into safe, temporary accommodations with wraparound supports to protect their health and safety in the overlapping COVID-19 and overdose crises.Learn More:For an overview of BC Housing’s work to monitor and respond to COVID-19, visit: https://www.bchousing.org/COVID-19For more information and latest medical updates on COVID-19, follow the BCCDC on Twitter @CDCofBC or visit its website: http://www.bccdc.ca/For more information on non-medical issues like travel recommendations and how to manage social isolation, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID-19

With annual flood and wildfire seasons approaching in British Columbia and physical distancing restrictions in place due to COVID-19, the Province is launching a digital registration system for Emergency Support Services (ESS).The new platform will be available for communities to provide evacuee self-registration, digital registration and referrals, and basic reporting.“Following the 2017 wildfire season, our government began working to modernize the delivery of ESS,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “Moving from an archaic paper-based system to a digital platform will ensure safe and timely access to services for those who need help during some of their hardest moments. During the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual delivery of ESS is more important than ever to ensure safe physical distancing for volunteers and evacuees.”Modernizing the registration system ensures evacuees have quick access to the supports they need, such as lodging, food and clothing. On average, approximately 30,000 people use ESS each year. The digital registration system will allow volunteers to concentrate on the needs of the most vulnerable people during an evacuation, while enabling safe physical distancing measures to protect both volunteers and evacuees.“The new virtual registration system for emergency supports allows us to keep all our ESS volunteers,” said David Trawin, chief administrative officer, City of Kamloops. “The majority of these volunteers are seniors, and more than half said they would not be available if registration was paper-based and face-to-face interaction was required. It would have crippled us if we needed evacuations for floods and fire.”The digital system was successfully piloted in four communities during the spring and summer of 2019: Prince George, Kamloops, Tk’emlups te Secwepemc and the Regional District of Central Okanagan. As communities work to implement and train on the new system, the Province will continue to work with communities to ensure it runs smoothly. Continued improvements will be made throughout the next year, so it will be able to support direct payment to evacuees and suppliers.Learn More:For information on non-medical issues like travel recommendations and how to manage social isolation, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community, including for employers, businesses and schools, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/coronavirus-(novel)For more information and latest medical updates on COVID-19, follow the BCCDC on Twitter @CDCofBC or visit its website: http://www.bccdc.ca/

perimeters of wildfires for the current season (April 1 through March 31 of the following year)
boundaries of B.C.’s six regional fire centres
BC Parks closures and recreation site closures
wildfire search tool (search by active fire name, fire number or location)
Drive BC events (e.g., advisories and closures)
The app also offers a “Near Me” function. When users select the “Near Me” option, the app will only display information within a 50-kilometre radius of their current location, allowing them to more easily focus on wildfire activity within that area.2. Latest news and advisoriesThe BC Wildfire Service mobile app allows users to view the latest informational tweets directly from the BC Wildfire Service’s Twitter feed. A personal Twitter account is not required to view this feed. The latest advisories (related to open burning bans and prohibitions, area restrictions, evacuation alerts and evacuation orders) are also available on the app.3.

a rolling total of all active wildfires
a rolling total of all wildfires (active and extinguished)
the number of wildfires detected in the last two days
the number of wildfires detected in the last seven days
All of these statistics can be filtered by fire centre, suspected cause, stage of control, current year fires or active fires.4. Fire reporting toolThe BC Wildfire Service relies on the public to report wildfires and irresponsible behaviour that could start a wildfire. The app features a “Report a Fire” function that will automatically generate map co-ordinates of your current location. Provincial Wildfire Reporting Centre staff will ask for these co-ordinates when the user reports a wildfire. This feature also indicates what sort of questions a person may be asked when reporting a wildfire.Available for download nowThe BC Wildfire Service mobile app is available for Apple (iOS) and Android devices and is free to download in the App Store and Google Play.

The first aerial-spraying treatment to eradicate invasive gypsy moths from 231 hectares of residential and municipal park land in Lake Cowichan will occur next week, weather permitting.The gypsy moth is destructive to native and urban forests and orchards. Without treatment, it could spread to other parts of the province and put hundreds of species of trees and shrubs at risk, including endangered Garry oak ecosystems.Spraying will take place from the forest south of Hammond Road, north to the Cowichan Valley Highway, west to Fen Road and east to Boundary Road.Spraying will start shortly after sunrise (approximately 5:50 a.m.) and should be completed by 7:30 a.m. daily. Up to four separate treatments are required this spring. Unless delayed by poor weather, each treatment is expected to take one to two mornings to apply. The first treatment will take two mornings. The ministry aims to complete spraying by mid-June.The spray area will be treated with Foray 48B, which contains Bacillus thuringiensis var kurstaki (Btk). Btk is an organic, natural agent that has been approved for the control of gypsy moth larvae in Canada since 1961. Foray 48B and other Btk formulations received certification for acceptable use on certified organic farms by the Organic Materials Review Institute of Canada in April 2018.Btk is naturally present in urban, forest and agricultural soil throughout the province. It does not harm humans, mammals, birds, fish, plants, reptiles, amphibians, bees or other insects and affects caterpillars only after they have ingested it.The spray will be applied by a low-flying plane. Residents within and adjacent to the treatment area will likely hear the aircraft at some point during the treatment. The spray equipment is GPS-calibrated and controlled. Spraying will occur only when the plane is immediately over the treatment area.Anyone wishing to minimize contact with the spray material may choose to remain indoors with their windows and doors closed during the treatment, and for at least 30 minutes after. Pets or livestock that may be frightened by the aircraft should be secured or brought indoors.Poor weather or wind may cause treatments to be postponed with little advance notice, and the treatment will resume the next suitable morning.A telephone line is staffed during business hours and provides up-to-date spray schedules and recorded information 24 hours per day, toll-free, at 1 866 917-5999. Individuals subscribed to gypsy moth email updates will receive automatic program updates.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are providing case updates for two 24-hour reporting periods: May 2 to May 3, and May 3 through to midday today.“In the first reporting period through May 3, we had 34 new cases, for a total of 2,205 cases in British Columbia.“In the last 24 hours, we have had a further 19 new cases, for a total of 2,224 cases in British Columbia.“This represents 53 new cases since we reported on Saturday.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 845 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 1,027 are in the Fraser Health region, 124 are in the Vancouver Island Health region, 177 are in the Interior Health region and 51 are in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report three new COVID-19 related deaths, two in the Fraser Health region and one in Vancouver Coastal Health region, for a total of 117 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“In the last day, there have been no new long-term care or assisted-living facility outbreaks. In total, 19 facilities and three acute-care units have active outbreaks, with outbreaks now declared over at 14 care facilities.“Public health teams are also providing support to a number of community outbreaks, actively contact tracing those who may be directly affected and their close contacts.“There are seven confirmed positive cases at Fraser Valley Specialty Poultry, 54 at Superior Poultry in Coquitlam and 35 employees confirmed positive at United Poultry in Vancouver.“There are also 134 inmates and staff confirmed positive at the Mission Institution federal correctional centre, as well as 15 positive cases of COVID-19 connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.“To date, 1,417 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 77 individuals are hospitalized, and 20 of those are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“As we look at the epidemiology of COVID-19 over the past four months, we can see how the virus has affected people in British Columbia. What we know is that every region of the province has been impacted. We also know that severe illness is most prevalent with our seniors and Elders, men over 50 and those with chronic underlying health conditions.“Our health system transformed in a matter of weeks to prepare and respond to COVID-19 and remains ready for all critical care patients, including those with COVID-19. At the same time, we have increased our provincial critical care and portable ventilators to sustain an enhanced level of readiness.“Our dynamic modelling shows us that we have been able to put the brakes on COVID-19, but we haven't stopped the car. It also highlights that we must maintain safe physical distancing to keep our curve flat.“The toll of COVID-19 has been felt by all of us. This week, as Canadian Mental Health Week, is a reminder that we must also continue be vigilant about our mental health.“Many are concerned that we are not moving quickly enough to reopen our province, and just as many are fearful that moving too quickly will set us back to untenable levels. It is a careful balance and one that we are working hard to achieve. And, it will require every one of us to fully participate to make our ‘new normal’ a success.“Until we have a vaccine available for everybody, COVID-19 is going to be in B.C. This means our ‘new normal’ must continue to protect our health and well-being, protect our health-care system, create opportunities for increased social interaction and allow for the rebuilding of our economy with the cautious easing of restrictions.“Our ‘new normal’ is based on principles that apply to every person and every situation. These principles are the foundation of how we need to move forward with our B.C. plan and will remain in place in the weeks and months ahead.“These principles include:
staying informed, being prepared and following public health advice;
practising good hygiene – hand hygiene, avoid touching your face and respiratory etiquette;
staying at home and away from others if you are feeling ill – not ever going to school or work;
maintaining physical distancing outside the household, e.g., no handshakes or hugs, and keeping your number of contacts low and keeping a safe distance;
making necessary contacts safer with appropriate controls, e.g., using plexiglass barriers or redesigning spaces;
increasing cleaning of frequently touched surfaces at home and work;
considering the use of non-medical masks in situations where physical distancing cannot be maintained, such as on transit or while shopping; and
continuing to reduce personal non-essential travel. 
“As you think about your personal go-forward plan, think of your connections as the rings on a tree. One additional connection or ring makes for a much bigger risk of exposure and transmission.“Adding just one person into your circle adds all of the people from their circle – from their home, their work or others they have close contact with. If you or someone in your household is high risk, the less interaction you have with others, the better you can protect them. “We are nearing the end of our beginning. We have learned, we have prepared and we have done our best to break the chain of transmission. We are now entering a new phase where we must be equally vigilant and equally committed to protecting our loved ones, our seniors and Elders, our health-care workers and our communities.“It is in our hands, as long as we do not forget to wash them, to make this summer the B.C. summer of renewal.”Learn More:The latest modelling presentation and information is available online: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/modelling-projectionsFor guidance and information on self-isolation and self-monitoring, including how to isolate if you live with others, visit:

401,2020-05-04 09:30:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/factsheets/getting-real-about-mental-health,Government Website,Getting real about mental health,"

The COVID-19 pandemic has changed almost every aspect of our lives.Many of us are living with isolation and loneliness, financial worries, the challenges of home-schooling our kids and working from home, and the fear of becoming sick with COVID-19. We’re experiencing increased anxiety, stress and depression – and sometimes grief and loss. And many of the things that traditionally bring us joy have been put on hold.Simply asking, “How are you doing?” has taken on a much deeper meaning than it did before phrases like “self-isolation” and “physical distancing” came into our lives. We care about one another and are looking out for each other in thoughtful and compassionate ways. Many of us are talking about our individual and collective mental health like never before.Each year, one in five Canadians will experience a mental health challenge. But in the last few months, that number is much, much higher. A recent Angus Reid survey indicates that half of Canadians say their mental health has declined during the COVID-19 pandemic and 16% describe themselves as depressed.May 4 to 10, 2020, marks Mental Health Week in Canada – a week to celebrate, protect and promote mental health. The theme this year is “social connection,” and it couldn’t be more timely.This year, during Mental Health Week and beyond, Canadians are being asked to get real about mental health – to tell others how they are really feeling and to reach out for help and connection when they need it. If we take the time to hear what people are really saying when they reply with a simple “fine” or “okay,” we will connect in ways that make a real difference to the well-being of someone who is struggling.Long before COVID-19 and physical distancing, our government recognized how important it is to expand and strengthen mental health supports in British Columbia. That’s why we launched A Pathway to Hope, B.C.’s roadmap to creating a system of mental health and addictions care that works for everyone. We’ve made big strides when it comes to mental health, including increasing access to low- or no-cost community counselling, expanding the network of Foundry youth centres throughout B.C. and getting started on building child and youth mental health teams in our school districts.As we face this pandemic, we also know that people who experience social isolation are at increased risk of experiencing stress, anxiety and depression. That’s why we moved quickly to provide $5 million for virtual mental health supports for people around the province, with a focus on our heroic front-line health care workers, unsettled young people and their families, and isolated seniors who are seeking connection and help with day-to-day activities.These initiatives include BounceBack – a free program for people experiencing low mood, depression or anxiety, Foundry Virtual Clinic for youths aged 12 to 24 and their families, low- and no-cost community counselling available in many languages, and the mobile response team supporting health-care workers on the front lines of two public health emergencies: COVID-19 and the continuing overdose crisis.These unprecedented times are challenging our mental health. But where there is uncertainty and instability, there is also an opportunity to make lasting change, and to come back better and stronger.More than ever, people are talking openly and honestly about their mental health – sharing their stories, acknowledging their challenges and reaching out for help. And by talking about our mental health, we are creating the vital connections that will help us through this pandemic and beyond. I encourage everyone to do their part and get real about mental health – because the only way to get through this is together.And remember, when someone asks you how you are, it’s okay to say, “I’m not okay.”Learn More:Government of British Columbia mental health supports: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19Canadian Mental Health Association: https://cmha.bc.ca/covid-19/ Foundry: https://foundrybc.ca/For non-health related information, including financial, child care and education supports, travel, transportation and essential service information, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19

To ease financial hardship on businesses and to keep employees connected with their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic, government has extended the temporary layoff period to 16 weeks for COVID-19 related reasons.Previously under the Employment Standards Act, a temporary layoff longer than 13 weeks in any 20-week period (or about three months in a five-month period) was considered a permanent layoff. With a permanent layoff, employers are required to provide employees with written working notice of termination and/or pay severance to qualifying employees, based on their length of service. Now, temporary layoffs relating to the COVID-19 pandemic can be extended to 16 weeks, if the employee agrees.This change to the Employment Standards Act aligns B.C.’s temporary layoff provisions with the federal Canada Emergency Response Benefit period. The federal period provides 16 weeks of financial support, allowing employees to take full advantage of those benefits.It also allows employees to keep their job, even if they are not working, for 16 weeks of temporary layoff. Employers will be able to quickly resume operations should the public health emergency end within that time.The COVID-19 emergency temporary layoff provisions are not intended to be permanent and will be repealed when no longer needed.  Learn More:For information on employment standards around temporary layoffs, visit: www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/employment-standards-advice/employment-standards/termination#laying-offFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: www.bccdc.ca

Following an investigation, the BC Wildfire Service has determined the cause of the 2017 Elephant Hill wildfire.This wildfire started on July 6, 2017, about 2.5 kilometres southwest of Ashcroft. It eventually burned 191,865 hectares in B.C.’s south-central Interior region, including parts of both the Kamloops Fire Centre and Cariboo Fire Centre.The BC Wildfire Service’s fire origin and cause specialists investigated the Elephant Hill wildfire, and their report indicated that the most likely cause of the Elephant Hill wildfire was smoking or smoking materials. The “smoking materials” classification includes matches, cigars, pipe tobacco, cigarettes and/or marijuana.Other potential causes of the fire were eliminated as part of the investigation, including:
lightning;
escaped campfire;
Category 2, Category 3 or Resource Management Open Fire activity;
arson/suspicious; juvenile fire setter/fire use; equipment use;
railroads;
vehicles; and
electrical transmission/utility line/pole.
The BC Wildfire Service’s fire origin and cause report was completed in fall 2017 and submitted as part of a larger RCMP investigation into the Elephant Hill wildfire. The RCMP recently concluded its investigation, so the BC Wildfire Service can now share its information regarding the cause of this wildfire.The BC Wildfire Service and RCMP investigations did not uncover sufficient evidence to identify the person whose actions started the Elephant Hill wildfire. Therefore, it was not possible to lay charges or pursue cost recovery for damages caused by this fire. The BC Wildfire Service’s investigation into the Elephant Hill wildfire is now complete and no further action will be taken at this time.To report a wildfire, unattended campfire or open burning violation, call 1 800 663-5555 toll-free or *5555 on a cellphone.Follow the latest B.C. wildfire news:

404,2020-05-03 09:00:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020EDUC0034-000804,Government Website,"Teachers, students playing virtually before Music Monday","

Music Monday will be very different this year for students and teachers, but for Karen Withers’ class, their Monday lesson will start the way it always does - whether in school or virtually - with a joke:What kind of soap did the composer use? Anti-BACH-terial soap!It is one of the ways Withers, a music teacher at Nanaimo’s Ecole Pauline Haarer elementary, is helping her students continue to feel a sense of routine and normalcy while in-class learning is suspended and school lessons happen remotely.“Bringing music to students and creating lifelong lovers of music has always been a passion of mine,” said Withers. “In this unusual situation we find ourselves, I really wanted to be a source of connection and comfort for my students, the majority of whom I have taught for many years. At this same time, I wanted to create some normalcy in the school lives by continuing with programs we do on a regular basis.”Music Monday, celebrated this year on May 4, is one of the world’s largest single events dedicated to raising awareness about music education. Normally, this event is a series of live concert performances at venues across the country. This year, however, it is moving online to help people maintain physical distancing during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Students from over 100 B.C. schools are joining hundreds of thousands of people from across Canada #TogetherInHarmony to celebrate. The event will be livestreamed for 12 hours on YouTube and on Facebook.“Music is an integral part of any student’s education, and I’m heartened to see it continuing as much as possible,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “Teachers, students and parents are using creative and innovative ways of bringing music from their classrooms into homes. What a great way to celebrate Music Monday during an unprecedented time.”At Vancouver’s Van Horne Elementary, music teacher Bev Williams is asking her students to celebrate Music Monday by making musical connections.“Whether it’s going on FaceTime to sing for a grandparent, sharing a piece of music with a family member, interviewing a relative and finding out what music means to them or a little bit about their family’s musical heritage and traditions, or creating a joint playlist with their friends and listening to the same music, I want them to feel the power of music to bring people together,” said Williams.The positive connection between music teachers and their students is being noted and appreciated by parents.Yukari Peerless, whose son is in Grade 6 and plays cello at Victoria’s Lansdowne Middle School, was put at ease when her son’s music teacher gave her son a little more time to breathe. Rather than having to meet a regular practice schedule at home, he now sends a video assignment and participates in optional Zoom sessions. Peerless said that small gesture went a long way in her household, reducing stress in what is a challenging time.“When the music teacher’s email came in and said, 'This is a time to have fun,’ I got a little choked up – and that was at the end of March,” said Peerless. “I think my son also felt the same way, I could tell when I saw his face sort of light up. It was so important to us.”In North Vancouver, Argyle Secondary band director Diana Chan tasked her students to explore different ways to make music away from school. She then put together a video highlighting how some of her students have used this time to practise, improvise, record and produce their own music: https://youtu.be/hagmWeyNoSI“I am very lucky to be part of such a talented and creative community,” said Chan. ""There was no shortage of cool projects that students shared with me.”These are some of the many ways teachers and students are responding to new and creative ways to learn music in B.C. schools, on Music Monday and beyond.“Now more than ever, Canadians understand the vital role that music plays within our culture,” said Eric Favaro, chair of the Coalition for Music Education. “Music Monday brings us together to demonstrate our immense love for music and the important role it plays in the shaping of young lives.”Learn more: For more information about Music Monday, and to watch online, visit: https://coalitioncanada.ca/musicmonday/en/Watch livestreaming content from B.C. artists at: https://showcasebc.ca

Anne Kang, Minister of Citizens’ Services and responsible for Multiculturalism, has issued the following statement in honour of Asian Heritage Month in British Columbia:""May is Asian Heritage Month, a time dedicated to honour and recognize the many contributions of people of Asian ethnicity to B.C.’s rich cultural society.  “Throughout our history, there have been many inspirational individuals of Asian heritage whose accomplishments have played a vital role in B.C.’s social and economic success. This includes: David Lam, the 25th lieutenant governor of British Columbia; Asa Johal, a Sikh immigrant who founded Terminal Forest Products, B.C.’s largest independent lumber company; and Masumi Mitsui, a Canadian soldier decorated with the Military Medal for bravery during the Battle at Vimy Ridge. Following his return to B.C., Mitsui helped establish the Japanese Canadian war memorial in Stanley Park.“As someone of Chinese heritage who immigrated from Asia myself, I know the courage it takes for people to uproot their lives in search of new opportunity and a better life, and I have a deep respect for the many people who have made a similar journey. As Minister of Citizens’ Services and responsible for Multiculturalism, I am proud of the many government supports and services available for newcomers.“Asian Heritage month is also a reminder that our multicultural society makes this province such an amazing place to live. I have seen the rise of anti-Asian racism and hate crimes in our province due to the COVID -19 pandemic. Any act of racism is unacceptable and everyone deserves to feel safe. In this time of global crisis, we must remember that our communities are richer because of the contributions of all British Columbians. More than ever, we need to stand together, show kindness and demonstrate through our words and actions that hate has no place in B.C.“In honour of B.C.’s cultural diversity and in recognition of the contributions of people of all backgrounds, I encourage everyone to take this opportunity to learn more about the culture, traditions and history of Asian British Columbians. Increasing our understanding of B.C.’s multicultural heritage fosters intercultural connections and lays the foundation for a more welcoming and inclusive B.C., creating a better future for everyone.”Translations:For a Punjabi translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/STMT_Asian_Heritage_Month-Punjabi.pdfFor a traditional Chinese translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/STMT_Asian_Heritage_Month-TC.pdfFor an Arabic translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/STMT_Asian_Heritage_Month-Arabic.pdfFor a Farsi translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/STMT_Asian_Heritage_Month-Farsi.pdfFor a Japanese translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/STMT_Asian_Heritage_Month-Japanese.pdfFor a Korean translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/STMT_Asian_Heritage_Month-Korean.pdfFor a Tagalog translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/STMT_Asian_Heritage_Month-Tagalog.pdfFor a Vietnamese translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/STMT_Asian_Heritage_Month-Vietnamese.pdfFor an Indonesian translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020_Statement_Asian_Heritage_Month_INDONESIAN.pdf

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are announcing 26 new cases, for a total of 2,171 cases in British Columbia.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 832 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 992 are in the Fraser Health region, 123 are in the Island Health region, 175 are in the Interior Health region and 49 are in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report two new COVID-19 related deaths in the Fraser Health and Vancouver Coastal Health regions, for a total of 114 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.""In the last day, there have been no new long-term care or assisted-living facility outbreaks. In total, 21 facilities and three acute-care units have active outbreaks, with outbreaks now declared over at 12 care facilities.""Public health teams are also providing support to a number of community outbreaks, actively contact tracing those who may be direcly affected and their close contacts.“There is a new outbreak at Fraser Valley Specialty Poultry, with three confirmed cases to date. Fraser health is on site and investigating.""There are 52 employees confirmed positive at Superior Poultry in Coquitlam and 35 employees confirmed positive at United Poultry in Vancouver.“There are now 133 inmates and staff confirmed positive at the Mission Institution federal correctional centre, as well as 15 positive cases of COVID-19 connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.“To date, 1,376 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 72 individuals are currently hospitalized, 23 of those are in intensive care, and the remaining people are recovering at home in self-isolation.“The outbreak at the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta continues to impact us here in B.C. It is vitally important that anyone who has been at the site since March 24 follows the B.C. requirements when at home.“This includes self-isolating on your return, your entire family being diligent about physical distancing, monitoring yourself and your family closely for symptoms and contacting heath-care providers or 811 for testing, as necessary.“All of us must be extremely cautious to protect our loved ones and our communities when we are connected to any outbreak. It is far too easy to tip the scales against us and undo the hard work and sacrifice that we have made to flatten the curve, especially as we look to ease restrictions.“We are all feeling the fatigue of maintaining safe physical distance – of not seeing friends and needing to make social connections in other ways. This is expecially challenging for our youth. “You may feel overwhelmed or anxious, but know that you are not alone. And know this is not forever, but for now. If you need help, contact the Kids Help Phone at 1 800 668-6868.“We also encourage you to stay healthy by getting outside and staying active, washing your hands regularly and asking your parents and teachers for help, if you need it, and to keep learning and stay connected with friends.“To the graduating class of 2020, the traditional ceremonies and celebrations will be different this year, but take heart that teachers, adminstrators and parents are all working to to make this a memorable experience for you.“You are and will always be a unique graduation class. Very few of us have ever known the experience of graduating during a global pandemic, and we commend the new and creative ways young people are finding to commemorate this important occasion in a safe and virtual way.“We know parents are doing their best to support their kids and provide ongoing learning opportunities. Do what you can, with the assurance that we are all in this together and will make sure our kids, who are our future, are given the necessary tools and support to catch up from this necessary pause.“School is different right now, but learning – whether in the classroom, at home or outside – doesn’t stop.“This is also the start of Child Care Month. Let’s recognize our early childhood educators and child care professionals for continuing to provide the important foundation and care to our province’s youngest.”Learn More:For guidance and information on self-isolation and self-monitoring, including how to isolate if you live with others, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/self-isolationFor the provincial health officer’s orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, follow @CDCofBC on Twitter or visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/To learn where, when and how people with symptoms can be tested, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testingThe COVID-19 self-assessment app, which includes details about where, when and how to get tested, can be downloaded here: https://bc.thrive.health/For information on how returning travellers can submit self-isolation plans, visit: gov.bc.ca/returningtravellers  To learn more about Fair PharmaCare, including coverage, how to request an income review, and the Monthly Deductible Payment Option, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Register_for_Fair_PharmaCare.pdfFor mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca

The Province is continuing to support local governments by allowing them to hold public hearings electronically during the current provincial state of emergency.“Local governments will be a key partner in our recovery effort,” said Selina Robinson, Minister Municipal Affairs and Housing. “Construction and development activities are expected to be a key part of B.C.’s recovery efforts – and building housing, in particular, affordable housing, will contribute to our goal to provide affordable housing for all British Columbians. Amending this order will allow local governments to continue their work on land-use decision-making and keep building their communities for the people they serve.”Under the Emergency Program Act, the Province has repealed and replaced Ministerial Order M083 with M139 to expand the authorities given to local governments under M083. The new order will help local governments, improvement districts and the Islands Trust continue to make important decisions for their communities during the COVID-19 pandemic, including allowing local governments to hold public hearings electronically.As public input is an essential part of land-use decision-making, even for those decisions that do not require a public hearing, local governments are still expected to find ways to encourage public participation.Local governments are required to hold public hearings for some development applications before making a decision. A significant delay in processing development applications could result in cost increases or cancelled projects, and could negatively impact the province’s economic recovery.Local governments are still expected to find ways to encourage public participation during this time and continue to be as transparent as possible by keeping the public informed on any decisions and procedural changes through their websites and social media.Each local government will need to determine what electronic method works best for it. At the time of public notice, the local government will be expected to provide information on how people can participate in the hearing. Options local governments may consider include calling in and video conferencing. Local governments will also continue to be required to accept written submissions for public hearings, whether in-person or electronic.The new order gives the Islands Trust the authority to hold meetings electronically without in-person public participation, allows for bylaws to be read and adopted in a single day and allows the use of electronic options for its public hearings.In addition, the order authorizes improvement districts to hold trustee board meetings electronically to make financial decisions for their community and allows them to postpone their annual general meetings and elections until COVID-19 is no longer a public health threat.Learn More: Provincial guidance for local governments during COVID-19:

Government has temporarily deferred renewal fees for those liquor licensees experiencing financial hardship due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.In response to the significant challenges that some in the liquor industry are facing due to COVID-19, the general manager of the Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch has authorized the temporary extension for liquor licences expiring between March 31 and June 30, 2020, to ease the financial burden of upcoming renewal fees. As government focuses on those businesses that have been most affected by the provincial health officer’s orders, this extension will be applicable to most liquor licences, with the exceptions of licensee retail stores, special wine stores and wine stores with wine on shelf in grocery stores.This temporary extension to current licences is not a licence renewal. Extended licences must still be renewed prior to their new expiry dates. Renewal fees will be deferred until Sept. 30, 2020, and will continue to be calculated in accordance with Schedule 1 of the Liquor Control and Licensing Regulation (LCLR) and, if applicable, s.204 of the LCLR. Eligible licensees whose licences fall within the time period noted above, and who find themselves in financial need, may ask for support by emailing a request to: LCRB_COVID19@gov.bc.caLicensees who can renew their licence and pay the associated renewal fees in accordance with their current expiry date are encouraged to do so, so those most directly impacted can benefit.As this is an evolving situation, government will review this temporary provision as the public health crisis progresses.Learn More:For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/

People who travel along the Trans-Canada Highway through Chase will soon see crews working to further improve safety and efficiency.The tender has been issued for the Chase Creek Road to Chase West four-laning project. This section of Highway 1 is being expanded, making it safer for travellers, including commercial truck drivers.""It’s important we keep moving forward on major projects that will spur economic recovery and help build out of this pandemic,” said Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “This project, delivered under our Community Benefits Agreement, will ensure that local workers are employed and that communities will benefit during the COVID-19 pandemic.”Provincial construction sites have protocols and policies in place that follow the requirements of the provincial health officer to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. These include reducing in-person meetings and gatherings, holding meetings outdoors and ensuring physical distancing of workers throughout the work day. These measures, along with other work protocols such as daily cleaning and sanitizing of common areas and surfaces, will help ensure worker and public safety.“Our government’s priority is keeping workplaces safe as we continue to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” Trevena said. “We’re ensuring crews will be working in a safe environment as we deliver this project that will keep people and goods moving safely and efficiently.”Along with widening 3.3 kilometres of Highway 1 to four lanes with a central median barrier, work on this project also includes:
at-grade protected T-intersection at both Chase Creek Road and Shuswap Avenue;
a grade separated pedestrian crossing and multi-use pathway to link the Neskonlith Indian Band and the Village of Chase communities;
a cattle underpass to comply with Agricultural Land Commission requirements; and
conversion of the existing highway to frontage road to consolidate access.
Once the contract is awarded through an open bidding process, work is expected to begin late this summer.The project is being delivered under the Province’s Community Benefits Agreement, which prioritizes hiring local workers, Indigenous peoples, women, people with disabilities and other under-represented groups to do the work in a safe, welcoming work environment. This project will help diversify and grow B.C.’s skilled workforce and support well-paying careers in local communities.   Learn More:For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit:  http://www.bccdc.ca/

The Government of British Columbia has proclaimed May as Motorcycle Safety Awareness Month, and asks all drivers to pay special attention when sharing the road with motorcyclists.As the weather turns warmer and drier, motorcycle riders are tuning engines, shining chrome and heading out on scenic rides.It is important for all drivers to be aware of more motorcyclists on the road and to watch carefully, especially at night or in bad weather conditions.To safely share the road with motorcyclists, drivers are asked to allow at least three to four seconds of following distance when behind a motorcycle and give plenty of lane space when passing. Motorcycles are often closer than they seem. Since it can be difficult to tell how fast they are moving, be prepared to yield.The majority of crashes involving motorcycles happen at intersections. Drivers should scan intersections carefully, especially when turning left. Riders should adjust their lane position and reduce speed when approaching an intersection, so there is time to stop if needed.Motorcyclists can take steps to better protect themselves. Motorcycle riders and their passengers should wear “all the gear, all the time” in all weather conditions. This includes a helmet with a full-face visor, leather or heavy fabric jacket and heavy, over-the-ankle boots. Wearing proper motorcycle safety gear is key to preventing severe injuries if a crash occurs.Spring weather can mean more wildlife wandering on or near highways and roads. All drivers and riders are reminded to watch carefully for wildlife, especially when animals are most active from dusk to dawn.Loud motorcycle exhausts can be disruptive to others, in both urban and rural areas. The Province asks all motorcyclists to enjoy their rides, while respecting regulations around excessive exhaust noise.Road safety is everyone’s responsibility. Whether driving a motorcycle, a passenger vehicle or commercial truck, or walking or riding a bike, people are asked to respect the rules of the road and consider the safety of other road users.Learn More: Motorcycle Safety Awareness Month proclamation: http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/oic/OIC_CUR/MotorcycleSafetyAwarenessMonth2020Visit ICBC’s “all the gear, all the time” page: https://www.icbc.com/road-safety/sharing/motorcycle-safety/Pages/motorcycle-safety-gear.aspx

Wet’suwet’en Hereditary Chiefs, B.C. Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation Scott Fraser and federal Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations Carolyn Bennett have issued the following statement:“We welcome the confirmation that the Wet’suwet’en clans have completed their review of the memorandum of understanding (MOU) we reached together on Feb. 29, 2020, to affirm and implement Wet’suwet’en title and rights, and have given their support to sign it. We look forward to advancing this important work to implement Wet’suwet’en rights and title as three equal governments.“We have the health and well-being of our communities, families and friends at the forefront of all of our minds in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The collective response to the COVID-19 pandemic across the country has created extraordinary circumstances throughout Canada.“Given the recommendations from the provincial health officer and the First Nations Health Authority to continue physical distancing measures and avoid non-essential travel, we are working out the details for the next steps, including signing the MOU and sharing it publicly.“The Wet’suwet’en have invited Minister Fraser and Minister Bennett to sign the MOU on May 14, 2020. This time allows all three governments to organize a virtual meeting to sign. It comes just after the 33rd anniversary of the start of the Delgamuukw/Gisday’wa case in Smithers in which the late Gisday’wa opened the trial. “The Wet’suwet’en Hereditary Chiefs, the Province of B.C. and Canada remain committed to implementing the rights and title of the Wet’suwet’en people through the MOU.   “There is a great deal of work ahead of us in the negotiation process agreed to in the MOU, to lay out how we will implement rights and title and how our three governments will work together into the future. As negotiations proceed on the affirmation and implementation of Wet’suwet’en rights and title, we will move forward with transparency and openess, and will be further engaging with Wet’suwet’en house groups, neighbouring Nations, local governments, stakeholders and the public.“This is an important step forward in rebuilding our government-to-government-to-government  relationship based on the affirmation of rights, respect, co-operation and partnership.”

419,2020-04-30 09:30:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020FLNR0026-000786,Government Website,Government takes action to help forest sector keep doors open,"

The B.C. government is deferring one of the fees it charges to help people, communities and forest companies navigate through the COVID-19 crisis.Stumpage, the fee operators pay the Province to harvest, buy or sell trees from Crown land, is being deferred for three months.“As government, we had already taken a number of steps to help forest communities and the industry because they were facing tough times even before the COVID-19 crisis came along,” said Premier John Horgan. “Now, we’re deferring stumpage fees so companies can maintain their financial liquidity, which will not only benefit them, but ideally, forest workers and communities as well.”The deferral with interest is available to Tree Farm Licence, Replaceable Forest Licence and First Nations’ Woodlands Licence holders who are in good financial standing with the Province. They also must be following through on their reforesting obligations.The deferral will leave eligible companies with an estimated $80 million so they can pay employees, pay contractors and pay other bills needed to keep their doors open or reopen them faster.“We’re building on other measures we’ve taken to help the forest sector navigate this crisis,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “What we’re announcing today may allow some companies to get back online sooner rather than later when we get through the situation we’re in now – or it may save other companies from having to shut down altogether.”Ravi Kahlon, Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development, said: “COVID-19 just added to the challenges facing our forest sector. In conversations with the forestry industry, the deferral of stumpage was a key ask, and I am pleased our government has been able to deliver support to companies, contractors and workers.”Kahlon added that the $69 million fund announced last fall to support British Columbia forest workers affected by mill closures and shift reductions in several B.C. Interior communities included new supports to make sure people have access to the services they need. This includes everything from training, to work placement, to early retirement. It also includes community support grants for communities that have been hardest hit by a mill closure or curtailment.On March 26, 2020, government announced a list of health and non-health services that are essential, as part of its ongoing response to COVID-19. These include businesses that ensure global continuity of supply of primary and value-added forestry/silviculture products (e.g. lumber, pulp, paper, wood fuel, etc.), including soft-pulp products, such as protective masks, gowns, drapes, screens and other hospital supplies, as well as household paper products.Government also acted quickly to deliver relief and support in response to COVID-19, including a $1,000 boost to anyone approved for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. It’s also why legislation was tabled that will mean no one can be fired for taking time off work to follow the advice of the provincial health officer.As well, major industries like pulp and paper mills and mines, will have the opportunity to defer 50% of their BC Hydro bill payments for three months.Quotes:Stephen Hunt, director, United Steel Workers, District 32 Western Canada –“We’ve been hard hit by a variety of factors that have presented challenges to our forest workers. I am pleased that this government is taking steps to help our industry and forest communities in general.”Susan Yurkovich, president and CEO, Council of Forest Industries –“The deferral of stumpage fees is an important short-term measure to help alleviate some of the unprecedented financial pressure brought on by the COVID 19 crisis. It will help B.C.’s forest companies put people back to work in communities as markets come back and we move towards economic recovery.”Quick Facts:
The stumpage system in B.C. is called the market pricing system.
Stumpage is calculated every three months, ensuring companies that harvest on Crown land are paying a fair market rate and the people of B.C. are getting fair value.
Unlike Alberta’s tenure system, B.C. does not have a universal stumpage rate because B.C.’s forests are more diverse. Stumpage is based on volume of timber, species and grade.
The money raised by stumpage funds vital social services.

Crews are doing investigative fieldwork in the Kicking Horse Canyon over the next several weeks as part of the preparation for major highway improvements to begin late this year.Beginning Thursday, April 30, 2020, crews are collecting physical data in the Dart Creek area, as well as other locations near the highway alignment. This fieldwork will help to inform the ongoing engineering design of the four-laning improvements to the Trans-Canada Highway through the canyon. Workers will practise safe physical distancing and use personal protective equipment. Every effort will be made to minimize any environmental disturbance to the local area. Minimal traffic impacts are anticipated as this work is carried out.B.C.’s provincial health officer (PHO) has directed employers to take all necessary precautions to minimize the risks of COVID-19 transmission and illness to themselves and their employees. This includes ensuring workers maintain physical distance with a minimum of two metres (6.5 feet) apart from each other, both in the course of their duties, as well as during breaks. Anyone exhibiting COVID-19 like symptoms will be directed to self-isolate at home for at least 10 days.While highways and roads remain open, the PHO recommends people stay close to home and avoid any non-essential travel.A design-build contract for the fourth and final phase of the Kicking Horse Canyon Project is expected to be awarded in late summer or early fall 2020, with initial construction to begin in the fall. It will bring the last remaining 4.8 kilometres of narrow, winding two-lane highway up to a modern four-lane, 100 km/h standard.The project is being delivered under the Province’s Community Benefits Agreement (CBA). It prioritizes hiring local workers, Indigenous peoples, women and other under-represented groups, and provides more training opportunities for apprentices, so they can complete their certification. The CBA ensures competitive, transparent wages with fair working conditions that foster a workplace free of discrimination and harassment and honours the cultural differences of all involved on the project.Learn More:For more information on this project, including flyover footage and a virtual reality simulation, visit: www.kickinghorsecanyon.caFor job opportunities for the Kicking Horse Canyon four-laning project, visit: https://www.bcib.ca/For guidance to construction sites operating during COVID-19, visit: http://ow.ly/P7WS50z8hNT

The provincial state of emergency is being extended for the third time, to support the extraordinary measures taken by the Province under the Emergency Program Act to keep people safe during the COVID-19 pandemic.“British Columbians have shown great leadership in our efforts to flatten the curve, but we can’t take our foot off the gas now,” said Premier John Horgan. “As we look toward the future and our ‘new normal,’ we must remember what got us to this point and continue to stay the course now to keep our communities and our loved ones safe.”Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, has officially extended the state of emergency through the end of the day on May 12, 2020.“I want to relay our government's gratitude to the large majority of people who are doing their part to slow the spread of COVID-19 in B.C.,” Farnworth said. “By extending the state of emergency, we will continue to take action to keep our communities safe through this challenging time, and make sure we stay on the right path in the weeks and months ahead.”During the last two weeks of the provincial state of emergency, government has taken action to support British Columbians by:
working with the cities of Vancouver and Victoria to transition people living in encampments in Oppenheimer Park, Topaz Park and on Pandora Avenue into safe, temporary accommodations with wraparound supports to protect their health and safety in the overlapping COVID-19 and overdose crises;
developing a new collaborative framework that will help ensure people living in rural, remote and Indigenous communities in B.C. have access to critical health care they can count on to meet their unique needs during the COVID-19 pandemic;
partnering with the federal government on the federal-provincial Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance Program, which will reduce monthly rent for thousands of small businesses in British Columbia;
giving police and other enforcement officers the ability to issue $2,000 violation tickets for price gouging and the reselling of medical supplies and other essential goods during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;
distributing up to $35.6 million over three months through Community Living BC to ensure people with developmental disabilities stay supported and safe during the pandemic; and
providing enhanced relief for businesses by reducing most commercial property tax bills by an average of 25%, along with new measures to support local governments facing temporary revenue shortfalls as a result of COVID-19.
These actions are part of government's COVID-19 Action Plan, which includes $5 billion in income supports, tax relief and direct funding to support people, businesses and services.The extension of the provincial state of emergency is based on recommendations from B.C.’s health and emergency management officials. Farnworth made the original declaration on March 18, 2020, after Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, declared a public health emergency the previous day.The Province has created 1 888 COVID-19 (1 888 268-4319) to connect British Columbians needing non-medical information about COVID-19. This includes the latest information on travel recommendations and physical distancing, as well as access to support and resources from the provincial and federal governments. The call line is available seven days a week, from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. (Pacific time), in 110 languages. People with questions related to their health and COVID-19 should call 811.Quick Facts:
Declarations of provincial states of emergency may be issued by the minister responsible under the Emergency Program Act.
The provincial government can extend the period of a declaration made by the minister responsible for further periods of time for up to 14 days at a time.
During the 2017 wildfire season, the province was in a provincial state of emergency for 10 weeks, from July 7 to Sept. 15.

Mitzi Dean, Parliamentary Secretary for Gender Equity, has issued the following statement on the Province’s ongoing support for women and children experiencing violence during the COVID-19 pandemic:“Home should be a safe place for everyone, but for many, that is not the case. Women, children and non-binary people are often at a higher risk of domestic and targeted violence, and this danger has only increased during this stressful time. As this pandemic requires us to stay home and keep our distance from friends and extended family, people facing violence or abuse – many with children – need our help more than ever to find a safe place to stay.“As of today, the Province has secured nearly 300 additional spaces in communities throughout B.C. for people leaving violent or unstable situations, with more spaces to come. These are in addition to more than 100 transition houses and safe homes that the Province funds on an ongoing basis.“If you or someone you know is experiencing violence or abuse, please contact VictimLinkBC at 1 800 563-0808 or by email: VictimLinkBC@bc211.ca“They can connect you to these supports and are available to help 24/7 with service in multiple languages.“Domestic and sexual abuse is not a private matter to be kept behind closed doors. Violence should never be tolerated – not during this pandemic and not ever. It’s wrong, and we will be there for people who need our help and a safe place to go, day or night.”Learn More:Information on safe homes is also available on the BC Housing website: https://www.bchousing.org/housing-assistance/women-fleeing-violence/transition-houses-safe-homesFor a French translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Safe-Spaces_COVID_Traditional-FR.pdfFor a Chinese translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Safe-Spaces_COVID_Traditional-Chinese.pdfFor a Punjabi translation: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/COVID_Update_Punjabi.pdf

High-quality care for animals in B.C.’s shelters, BC SPCA facilities, zoos and aquariums will continue during the COVID-19 response, with funding available to help organizations cover the costs of food and medicine for their animals.In response to the provincial health officer’s guidance around minimizing and containing the spread of COVID-19, dozens of animal attractions and animal care facilities, including those operated by the BC SPCA, have been closed to the public in B.C. communities. Facilities have been reporting a dramatic decrease in the donation of food, supplies and volunteers, and have been unable to hold fundraisers that support feeding their animals.The Ministry of Agriculture will work with B.C. animal care facility operators to identify instances where emergency funding may be applicable. Funding will be available for animal hygiene, habitat upkeep, veterinarian care, limited transportation and repairs to equipment required to ensure the welfare of the animals in care.B.C. animal refuges and rehabilitation centres that lack the revenue to ensure animals in their care will not be in distress will also qualify for funding.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are announcing 55 new cases, for a total of 2,053 cases in British Columbia.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 803 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 918 are in the Fraser Health region, 119 are in the Island Health region, 168 are in the Interior Health region and 45 are in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report two new COVID-19 related deaths: one in the Interior Health region and one in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, for a total of 105 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.""There have been no new long-term care or assisted-living facility outbreaks. In total, 20 facilities and three acute-care units have active outbreaks, with outbreaks now declared over at 12 care facilities.""Public health teams are also providing support to a number of community outbreaks, actively contact tracing those who may be directly affected and their close contacts.""As of today, 46 employees have now been confirmed positive at Superior Poultry in Coquitlam, and 34 employees are confirmed positive at United Poultry in Vancouver.“There are also 120 inmates and staff confirmed positive at the Mission Institution federal correctional centre, as well as 11 positive cases of COVID-19 connected to the Kearl Lake plant in Alberta.“Anyone who has been in Kearl Lake since March 24, or is a close contact of a worker and who has symptoms of COVID-19, is required to immediately self-isolate and should be tested. Visit the BC Centre for Disease Control website for information on a collection centre near you, or contact 811 or public health for information on testing.“To date, 1,231 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 94 individuals are currently hospitalized, 37 of those are in intensive care and the remaining people are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Our first priority is to ensure the health of all British Columbians. Every decision, every order and restriction is based on a comprehensive risk assessment focused on containing COVID-19.“We use science as a foundation for our thinking, while recognizing that the actions we take also have significant social, financial and emotional implications.“It is a delicate balance, as demonstrated by the co-ordinated efforts to maintain learning for K-12 students throughout the province, while putting measures in place to protect students and teachers from transmission.“We must do all we can to ensure this as we develop our made-in-B.C. framework and create a ‘new normal’ for British Columbians.“While we look ahead, we must all remember that our vulnerable citizens are still vulnerable. Our Elders and seniors, as well as those with underlying health conditions, are at highest risk of severe illness and we must continue to protect them.“We must also ensure the capacity and tools we have developed within our health-care system to rapidly respond to an outbreak today are maintained.“What is important not to lose sight of is that we all have a role to play. The decisions you make today will affect all of us tomorrow.“Personal hygiene, safe physical distancing, staying away from others when ill. These are the core tenants of public health and the foundation of our path forward.“Our personal health precautions are directly correlated to the epidemiological curve.

The first aerial-spraying treatment to eradicate invasive gypsy moths from 241 hectares of residential and municipal park land in the Fraser Heights neighbourhood of Surrey will occur in the first week of May 2020, weather permitting.The gypsy moth is destructive to native and urban forests and orchards. Without treatment, it could spread to other parts of the province and put hundreds of species of trees and shrubs at risk, including in endangered Garry oak ecosystems.The spraying will be located north of 108th Avenue to Highway 17 (South Fraser Perimeter Road), west to Highway 401 and east to 162nd Street.Up to four separate treatments are required this spring. Spraying will be carried out by a fixed-wing aircraft. It will start shortly after sunrise (approximately 5:40 a.m.) and should be completed by 7:30 a.m. daily.Unless delayed by poor weather, each treatment is expected to take one to two mornings to apply. The ministry aims to complete the spraying by mid-June.The 241-hectare spray area will be treated with Foray 48B, which contains Bacillus thuringiensis var kurstaki (Btk). Btk is an organic, natural agent that has been approved for the control of gypsy moth larvae in Canada since 1961.Foray 48B and other Btk formulations received certification for acceptable use on certified organic farms by the Organic Materials Review Institute of Canada in April 2018.Btk is naturally present in urban, forest and agricultural soil throughout the province. It does not harm humans, mammals, birds, fish, plants, reptiles, amphibians, bees or other insects and affects caterpillars only after they have ingested it.The spray will be applied by a low-flying plane. Residents within and adjacent to the treatment area will likely hear the aircraft at some point during the treatment. The spray equipment is GPS-calibrated and controlled. Spraying will occur only when the plane is immediately over the treatment area.Poor weather or wind may cause treatments to be postponed with little advance notice.For program updates, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/gypsymothIndividuals subscribed to the gypsy moth listserv (automated email updates) will receive program updates. The telephone line will be staffed during business hours and will provide up-to-date spray schedules and recorded information 24 hours a day.Anyone wishing to minimize contact with the spray material may choose to remain indoors with their windows and doors closed during the treatment, and for at least 30 minutes after.Pets and livestock that may be frightened by the aircraft should be secured or brought indoors.Learn More:Subscribe to the gypsy moth listserv: http://lists.gov.bc.ca/mailman/listinfo/l_for_gypsymothLearn more about gypsy moths: www.gov.bc.ca/gypsymoth

The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure’s assessment of the entire Island Rail (formerly E&N) Corridor has been released.This up-to-date, in-depth track and bridge assessment will be used by government to inform future decisions on investments in the corridor, which is owned by the Island Corridor Foundation.This was a thorough assessment conducted by railway industry experts to ensure a complete and accurate picture of the railway infrastructure, from ties and track to grade crossings and bridges.The entire length of the Island Rail Corridor was assessed: Victoria to Courtenay (Victoria subdivision), Parksville to Port Alberni (Port Alberni subdivision), and Wellcox Spur and Wellcox Yard (near Nanaimo).The final report includes estimated costs to upgrade infrastructure to restore rail freight operations and passenger service on Vancouver Island. It also includes cost estimates to upgrade the rail line to meet the standards needed to implement a commuter service with frequent train service between Victoria and Langford (Westhills), as well as inter-city service between Victoria and Courtenay.The ministry is currently developing the South Island Transportation Strategy, focusing on the efficient movement of people and goods. The strategy will look at all modes of transportation across southern Vancouver Island, including rail. The strategy is expected to be released in June.The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure engaged WSP Canada Group Ltd. to conduct the detailed evaluation of the Island Rail Corridor on Vancouver Island.

Food trucks are being set up at provincially owned locations throughout B.C. to support commercial truck drivers during the COVID-19 pandemic.The Government of B.C. is forgoing the usual restrictions and fees for food-truck operators who want to set up on key stops for commercial truck drivers, in locations where it is safe to do so, at the currently reduced traffic volumes. Vendors are operating at rest areas, weigh scales and other commercial truck pullouts throughout the Lower Mainland and southern Interior, with more expected to be added in the coming weeks.Current locations on provincial property with permitted food trucks, providing commercial truck drivers with more food options during their travels:
Nordel CVSE Inspection Station in Delta
Zopkios Brake Check on Highway 5, approximately 57 kilometres north of Hope
Britton Creek Rest Area on Highway 5, approximately 62 kilometres south of Merritt
Kamloops Weigh Scale in City of Kamloops – food served free of cost once per week by the Salvation Army
Food truck operating times will vary at these locations. In a separate initiative, members of the BC Trucking Association have spearheaded the Meals for Truck Drivers BC pilot, setting up food trucks at various commercial cardlocks throughout the province. Restaurants have also reopened many locations along Canadian highways for take out and restroom use for commercial drivers.Commercial truck drivers play an important role in maintaining the supply chain by delivering essential goods during the COVID-19 pandemic. The drivers ensure people around the province continue to have access to the items they need, including food and medicine. For these reasons, the ministry is working in collaboration with private food truck operators in order to help provide more options for truck drivers on their routes.Along with allowing food trucks, the Province has recently completed the installation of more than 25 portable toilets at commercial pullouts and inspection stations in the province to improve travel for commercial truck drivers.The ministry is following the advice and orders of the provincial health officer and the federal government to keep British Columbians as safe as possible and help stop the spread of COVID-19. While highways and roads remain open, the provincial health officer recommends people stay close to home and avoid any non-essential travel.Learn More:For a constantly updated map of locations and times for these food trucks, visit the Meals for Truckers page: https://mealsfortruckers.ca/Food truck operators interested in applying for a permit can go to: http://ow.ly/ME1d50zo3uFFor travel restrictions and precautions due to COVID-19, visit: http://ow.ly/jBGu50yVMROFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/

Premier John Horgan has released the following statement in recognition of the National Day of Mourning for workers killed and injured in the workplace:“Each year, on the National Day of Mourning, people in British Columbia and across Canada remember those who lost their lives or suffered serious injuries as a result of workplace incidents.“Last year, there were 140 work-related deaths and many more injuries in B.C. Today, we honour them and acknowledge the grief felt by their family and friends who miss them.“Everyone deserves to work in a safe environment. Over the past two years, WorkSafeBC has hired 40 more prevention and investigation officers, stepped up inspections and made penalties more stringent.“B.C. has also significantly increased education on workplace safety. But no injury or death at work is acceptable, and there is more to do.“During the COVID-19 pandemic, workplace safety has taken on new meaning and new urgency. Essential workers are demonstrating great courage and dedication simply by doing their jobs during this challenging time.“Our government is determined to keep people safe on the job during this pandemic. We are following direction from Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer. We are committed to making sure that workers know their rights and have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information on how to keep workplaces safe and healthy. And, under the leadership of Harry Bains, Minister of Labour, our government is working to make British Columbia workplaces the safest in Canada, today and every day.“To all those who continue to work during this crisis: thank you for keeping B.C.’s lights on. You are making sure people can get food and access services. You are caring for people’s children, seniors and the most vulnerable populations. You are doing your part, and we will continue doing ours by helping to keep you safe at work.”For a Chinese translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.28_STM_Day_of_Mourning-TC.pdfFor a French translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.28_STM_Day_of_Mourning-FR.pdfFor a Punjabi translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.28_STM_Day_of_Mourning-Punjabi.pdf

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are providing case updates for two 24-hour reporting periods: April 25 to 26, and April 26 through to midday today.“In the first reporting period through April 26, we had 39 new cases, for a total of 1,987 cases in British Columbia.“In the last 24 hours, we have had a further 11 new cases, for a total of 1,998 cases in British Columbia.“This represents 50 new cases since we reported on Saturday.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 795 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 879 are in the Fraser Health region, 117 are in the Island Health region, 164 are in the Interior Health region and 43 are in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report three new COVID-19 related deaths for a total of 103 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“Since we last reported, there have been two new long-term care outbreaks at the Valhaven Home and MSA Manor facilities in the Fraser Health region. In total, 20 facilities and three acute-care units have active outbreaks, with outbreaks now declared over at 12 care facilities, including most recently, Central City Lodge.“Public health teams are also providing support to a number of community outbreaks, actively contact tracing those who may be direcly affected and their close contacts.“As of today, 25 employees have now been confirmed positive at Superior Poultry in Coquitlam, and 34 employees are confirmed positive at United Poultry in Vancouver.“There are 118 inmates and staff confirmed positive at the Mission Institution federal correctional centre.“Given the close ties between our provinces, many B.C. residents continue to travel to Alberta for essential work. To date, there are 11 positive cases of COVID-19 connected to the Kearl Lake plant  in Alberta. Anyone who has been in Kearl Lake since March 24, or is a close contact of a worker and who has symptoms of COVID-19, is required to immediately self-isolate and contact 811 or public health for assessment and testing.“To date, 1,190 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 97 individuals are currently hospitalized, 36 of those are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“There is clear evidence that your sustained efforts to follow public health measures are working. Safe physical distancing, combined with self-isolation requirements, have slowed the rate of transmission.“Through our increased surveillance testing, new community outbreaks are being identified, enabling public health teams to quickly undertake contact tracing and isolate those who may be exposed.“This is the work that we will need to do for many months to come, and this is what we need your help to continue. We must not allow hot spots to flare.“We have a made-in-B.C. response to COVID-19 that reflects the unique circumstances of the pandemic in our province, as demonstrated by the recent challenge of spring flooding and the upcoming forest fire season.“Through the commitment and hard work of all British Columbians, we are now making plans to ease restrictions and find our ‘new normal’ in the coming weeks.“Our focus is to provide a consistent framework for sectors to operate within, as we have done with the many essential businesses.“The guidance published on April 25 for essential retail food and grocery stores is one example of the approach we will take moving forward to ensure appropriate physical distancing and proper hygiene.“To ease restrictions, we need to know that businesses are looking after your teams. Simply put, protecting your employees protects your business. How you do that is to ensure employees can safely do their jobs while at work, and equally important, are not penalized by staying home when ill.“Our go-forward plan is built on all our good work, commitment, and ongoing efforts to work together and take care of each other.”Learn More:Victims of family and sexual violence can find support from VictimLinkBC by calling 1 800 563-0808

Individuals experiencing gender-based violence, Indigenous communities healing from intergenerational traumas, and communities and families dealing with gun and gang violence will benefit from $11.8 million in grants to support community-based crime prevention and remediation initiatives.In total, 267 projects – led by community not-for-profits, school districts and others – will receive a one-time grant through the Civil Forfeiture Crime Prevention and Remediation grant program.“Taking the proceeds of crime and putting them back into our communities is just one of the many ways we’re enhancing the services that people count on,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “These grants support programs that make our communities safer, including those that prevent domestic violence, deter youth from engaging in a life of crime, and help people rebuild and heal from trauma.”Community programs and services that support individuals experiencing domestic violence and sexual assault, along with programs that target the prevention and intervention of domestic violence, are receiving more than $3.5 million in total. The remaining grants will help fund community initiatives that address crime prevention, support child and youth advocacy centres, address Indigenous healing and rebuilding, enhance restorative justice and target human trafficking and sexual exploitation.""Living with domestic and sexual violence is the reality for far too many people in our communities – hurting the most vulnerable people. Too many women and children live through abuse and far too many die from it,"" said Mitzi Dean, Parliamentary Secretary for Gender Equity. “Civil forfeiture grants are critical to supporting the work of our community partners and front-line workers who are doing the work every day to protect and support survivors of violence.""The Civil Forfeiture Office continues to undermine the profit motive behind criminal activity by taking away tools and proceeds of crime and putting them back into programs that support community safety and crime prevention.Quick Facts:
Since 2011, the Crime Prevention and Remediation grant program has provided more than $49 million to help organizations throughout B.C. to further their crime prevention and remediation efforts.
This year, the Crime Prevention and Remediation grant program has awarded just over $11.8 million in grants for 267 projects that will help support government priorities in:
crime prevention;
violence against women – sexual assault and domestic violence;
human trafficking, sexual exploitation and vulnerable women in the sex trade;
Indigenous healing and rebuilding;
restorative justice;
domestic violence prevention/intervention programming; and
child and youth advocacy centres.

As part of British Columbia’s emergency COVID-19 response plan, the Province is doubling this year’s funding for Family Caregivers of British Columbia to $1 million, helping support both caregivers and seniors.Family Caregivers of B.C. is a not-for-profit organization that supports people who are caring for elderly loved ones, family or friends.  With a network of local agencies throughout B.C., Family Caregivers will increase the capacity of its helpline and offer a number of virtual connections that can bring family caregivers together.“Many B.C. seniors count on their spouses, children and close friends to help them stay at home and manage chronic conditions,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “The circumstances of COVID-19 have added weight and worry to the task. This step to expand services builds on our commitment to support caregivers and is also a step to support the safety and wellness of seniors during this challenging time.”This funding will allow Family Caregivers of B.C. to enhance services during the COVID-19 pandemic, so caregivers get the increased support they need to help seniors remain at home, such as expanded toll-free support line hours, emotional supports and health-care navigation.“Family caregivers experience stress at the best of times; however, this is exacerbated during the COVID-19 restrictions,” said Isobel Mackenzie, B.C.’s seniors advocate. “The type of caregiver support found through adult day programs and a number of other community supports are not available now, and they may be restricted for many months. The impact of isolation on family caregivers is compounded by the need to stay at home with their loved one with little relief from their caregiving duties. Family Caregivers of B.C. can offer some support. The ability to share the burden of family caregiving with others even through a virtual connection will bring some comfort to many as they know they are not alone in their COIVD-19 journey.”“We are here to help these incredible caregivers making sacrifices every day with emotional support, access to tools and resources, and to assist them to navigate our complex health system,” said Barb MacLean, executive director, Family Caregivers of B.C. “Before COVID-19, many caregivers were already having sleepless nights, and now they are filling gaps for services that have been reduced to stop the transmission of the virus – like personal care and managing virtual appointments and medications.”Seniors and people who are caring for elderly loved ones, family or friends in need of supports can call 211 or 1 877 520-3267 (toll-free).Quick Facts:
Over 1 million people provide unpaid care for adult family members and friends in British Columbia.
The strategy to strengthen supports for caregivers is part of work underway to improve the quality of life for seniors in B.C.
In 2019, 20% of B.C.’s population was 65 or over. This is expected to rise to 25% in 15 years.

Students from the LGBTQ2S+ community, who may be feeling vulnerable and disconnected from their peers and schools, now have more virtual opportunities to connect with each other during the COVID-19 pandemic.For the first time, B.C.'s Gay-Straight or Gender and Sexuality Alliance (GSA) meet-ups will be held virtually rather than in person, where students can join their friends online or over the phone.“We know that LGBTQ2S+ kids report higher rates of feeling isolated and for some students, their school community was the only place where they could be their authentic selves,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “That’s why now, more than ever, it’s so important for LGBTQ2S+ children and youth to stay connected and to know that they have safe, confidential outlets to virtually socialize with each other.”A Population Health Journal study of B.C. students revealed that when a GSA group has been in a school for three years or more, there are lower rates of suicidal thoughts in both gay and straight kids. Other research shows that these clubs have a positive effect on LGBTQ2S+ students’ overall health, well-being and self-esteem, since GSAs promote feelings of belonging, acceptance and community. “I have heard heartbreaking stories about the challenges that many people in the LGBTQ2S+ community face, and for many, those feelings of isolation, loneliness and depression may be amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “These virtual meet-ups are absolutely vital so LGBTQ2S+ students can connect with their peers when they need it most. It’s these important connections that inspire us, lift us up and will help us all get through this uncertain time.”“We know that many LGBTQ2S+ youth experience discrimination in their own homes. These youth are at particular risk of mental-health problems and suicide, and they need targeted supports,"" said Mitzi Dean, Parliamentary Secretary for Gender Equity. “Helping students by ensuring virtual connections and resources are available will go a long way to getting through this time of physical isolation, which is not forever, but for many, may seem like it is.”GSAs are student run and student led, but they require an educator to sponsor them. Since sponsors do not always have member students in their classes, and many kids go by preferred names, it has been a challenge to get the message out that GSAs can now meet virtually.“We want to encourage students to reach out to their teacher or a trusted person at their school to find out ways they can join virtual GSA meet-ups, or even create a new GSA,” said Brad Beattie, executive director, ARC Foundation, a lead partner in the creation of SOGI 123. “With the COVID-19 situation, we are working to re-focus our efforts and increase our outreach to ensure educators know about all the resources available for LGBTQ2S+ students, including mental health and other community-based support.”Educators from 40 school districts, 14 independent schools and two First Nations recently took part in an ARC Foundation webinar to learn ways to protect students’ privacy and safety while holding virtual GSA meet-ups. Virtual GSAs can provide a comfortable, supportive forum for students to share education information, or discuss LGBTQ2S+ issues, movies or books, and activities like playing networked video games or creating stuck-at-home music playlists.To provide additional support for youth who are experiencing anxiety and social isolation, a free, virtual WE Well-being program was launched on April 17, 2020, for grades K-12 in English and French. It places a special emphasis on social-emotional learning and resiliency. Also available to parents and caregivers is the new EASE (Everyday Anxiety Strategies for Educators) at Home program with tips and strategies to create calming routines, help kids talk about difficult emotions and manage their anxiety.These at-home materials complement the recent Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions announcement of $5 million to expand existing mental-health programs and launch new services to support British Columbians during the pandemic. Foundry centres are moving services online and over the phone, including unscheduled counselling, peer support services and physical health care, so young people and families in all corners of the province can get the help they need when they need it.Quote:

Kir Tancon, GSA teacher sponsor in SD71, Comox Valley –“As a GSA teacher sponsor, I've had supportive parents reach out to me who are concerned for their kids during this time. I wish all parents were like this, as these connections are even more important for students who don’t have the support at home. The work that ARC is doing, and the facilitation that is happening with GSA leaders right now, is so important as we work together to support our students.”Learn More: More information about hosting GSAs, including how students can control their display names on virtual platforms, and links to provincial resources for LGBTQ2S+ children and youth, are available online: www.sogieducation.org/all-educators

Everyone deserves to be safe, feel protected and have the support they need.“We have two public health emergencies in our province, the overdose crisis and now COVID-19, making daily life an even greater struggle for many.“Keeping a safe physical distance from others and staying home when ill are the best things we can do with COVID-19, but we recognize this can be extremely difficult for those with precarious housing.“This is further compounded for people who may also face mental-health and addiction issues.“To address these challenges, today the Province announced important action to provide safe housing, food and wraparound support for people living in encampments in Victoria and Vancouver.“The addition of more than 1,000 hotel rooms provides a further means for vulnerable citizens to have access to secure housing with the necessary health-care and mental-health supports.“This action is welcome news, reducing the immediate health and safety risks for people living in temporary encampments.“We also know that being home more can unfortunately lead to increased stress and, in some cases, violence.“If you are experiencing violence, we want you to know that you are not alone.

440,2020-04-25 10:31:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020EMBC0020-000759,Government Website,"Province secures safe shelter, supports for people living in major encampments","

The Province is working with the cities of Vancouver and Victoria to transition people living in encampments in Oppenheimer Park, Topaz Park and on Pandora Avenue into safe, temporary accommodations with wraparound supports to protect their health and safety in the overlapping COVID-19 and overdose crises.Since March 2020, the Province, in partnership with BC Housing and local municipalities, has worked to secure and operate 686 hotel and community centre accommodations in Vancouver and 324 hotel spaces in Victoria. This allows people from the encampments to safely physically distance, with access to important health, social and other supports.“Providing safe, temporary accommodations and wraparound services for people facing homelessness has been an urgent priority for this government for a long time,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “Now, more than ever, with the concurrent emergencies of the pandemic and the ongoing opioid crisis, it is time to implement long-term housing solutions that take care of and protect our most vulnerable people.”This is a step toward providing permanent housing for people in these encampments. BC Housing, non-profit and health authority staff, provincial community-integration specialists and municipal staff will be working directly with people living in these three encampments and will help transition people into safer accommodations. There, they will have their own living space and access to services, such as meals, laundry, washroom facilities, health-care services, addictions treatment and harm reduction, storage for personal belongings and other supports.This is the next step in a phased approach, developed in co-ordination and collaboration with local governments and service delivery partners, to support vulnerably housed people living with elevated risk during two public health emergencies – the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing overdose crisis. “Having a roof over your head, access to food, health care and social supports are all essential to finding a pathway to hope,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “As we stare down not one, but two public health emergencies, we are saying that we won’t leave anyone behind.”  By transitioning vulnerable people into more secure accommodations, the Province is focused on reducing the immediate health and safety risks to people living and working in these densely populated encampments, as well as those in the neighbouring communities.“Every day I am inspired by the tremendous leadership the Province has shown British Columbians,” said Lisa Helps, mayor, City of Victoria. “This approach to helping our most vulnerable residents is thoughtful, prudent and ultimately will keep all of us safer during this pandemic.”This transition is supported by an order under the Emergency Program Act under the provincial state of emergency issued by Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, as part of the Province’s all-of-government response to COVID-19. The order sets May 9, 2020, as the deadline to transition people out of the encampments.“In this provincial state of emergency, our priority is public safety: for those living in these encampments, neighbouring communities and front-line workers delivering services to these vulnerable people,” Farnworth said. “We are committed to working in partnership with local governments and law enforcement to address the elevated health and safety risks within and around these encampments, while making sure people have access to the critical services they need.”The Province is working on comprehensive long-term plans to secure permanent housing with appropriate supports for those leaving the encampments and moving into safe, temporary accommodations. These plans will include strategies that will mitigate a return to homelessness and will also make sure the many public safety concerns at the current encampments are addressed, including fire code violations, property crime and sexual violence.These accommodations are in addition to the more than 1,739 beds that have been secured for vulnerable people, including those experiencing homelessness, in other hotel rooms, community centres and emergency response centres across the province. This step also supports additional and existing work done to date by the COVID-19 Vulnerable Populations Working Group, regional health authorities, BC Housing and the cities of Vancouver and Victoria.Quotes: Cheryl Casimer, political executive, First Nations Summit –“We would like to acknowledge the efforts of the provincial government and all partners involved in developing a strategy for the Downtown Eastside (DTES). Although the strategy announced today includes a temporary plan to address urgent housing and social service supports needed to curtail the risk of a COVID-19 outbreak in the DTES, it will also allow the Province and primary partners to work towards addressing the much needed long-term housing and wellness strategies and needs to support the DTES community. Based on reports that a second wave of COVID-19 is possible, it is absolutely necessary that these long-term needs are addressed on a priority basis.”Regional Chief Terry Teegee, B.C. Assembly of First Nations –“These necessary supports for vulnerable members of the DTES community as well as other communities are much needed during this unprecedented health crisis. I applaud the efforts of the provincial government and other partners in addressing the housing and health-related realities that residents are facing. We must continue to advance and ensure long-term collaborative supports as we work to prevent the spread of COVID-19.”Learn More:The related order under the Emergency Program Act under the provincial state of emergency can be viewed here: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/M128-2020.pdfFor an overview of BC Housing’s work to monitor and respond to COVID-19, visit: https://www.bchousing.org/COVID-19For more information and latest medical updates on COVID-19, follow the BCCDC on Twitter @CDCofBC or visit its website: http://www.bccdc.ca/For more information on non-medical issues like travel recommendations and how to manage social isolation, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID-19

To help communities during the COVID-19 pandemic, targeted funding will give people in rural, remote and Indigenous communities in British Columbia access to faster internet services at a time when they need them most.The $50-million Connecting British Columbia program now includes a funding stream to help internet service providers with immediate network equipment upgrades to rapidly improve capacity and internet speeds in underserved communities throughout the province.“People working from home, students learning remotely and families practising physical distancing all need to know they can depend on internet access during this public-health emergency,” said Anne Kang, Minister of Citizens’ Services. “Responding to the pandemic requires the best from all of us. Our communities need reliable internet access right now, and this new fund will get projects completed quickly.”Physical distancing requirements resulting from the COVID-19 public-health emergency mean more people are staying home to work, study or be with their families. Internet service providers (ISPs) have reported an increased demand on networks, which in some cases can cause slowdowns or even outages. Connecting British Columbia’s COVID-19 response funding will enable ISPs to make immediate upgrades to their networks in order to better support the people who count on their services.“The British Columbia Broadband Association really appreciates the effort to provide immediate assistance to internet service providers as they work to upgrade networks serving people during this public health emergency,” said Bob Allen, BCBA president. “Our members are excited to deliver new projects by the end of June that will provide immediate improvements to high-speed internet services for people.”Internet service providers throughout the province can apply for grants of up to $50,000 – or 90% of their expenses – to cover the cost of equipment, including antennas, electronics or other types of devices that relate to the performance or range of their network.These are types of network upgrades that can be completed quickly to significantly improve connectivity for people, rather than the traditional projects that usually require months or years to finish.Applications are now being accepted by Northern Development Initiative Trust. Submissions will be reviewed on a first-come-first-served basis, with funding decisions made within three to five business days. Internet service providers must complete their projects by June 30, 2020.“We all have to work together to protect the health and safety of our families and neighbours,” said Joel McKay, CEO, Northern Development Initiative Trust. “Immediate investments in network upgrades can help ensure that people have the reliable internet access they need, not just to work and study from home, but to keep in touch remotely with friends and family during this challenging time.”Grants will be funded through the existing Connecting British Columbia program. Applications are being accepted for both the new COVID-19 response funding and the existing Phase 3 Connecting British Columbia quarterly intake.Since July 2017, 479 communities, including 83 Indigenous communities, have benefited from completed or underway Connecting British Columbia high-speed internet connectivity projects.Learn More:Application for Connecting British Columbia COVID-19 response funding: https://www.northerndevelopment.bc.ca/funding-programs/partner-programs/connecting-british-columbia/phase-three-last-mile-transport-infrastructure/Connecting British Columbia Program: https://www.northerndevelopment.bc.ca/funding-programs/partner-programs/connecting-british-columbia/Phase 3 Connecting British Columbia funding application information: https://www.northerndevelopment.bc.ca/funding-programs/partner-programs/connecting-british-columbia/phase-three-last-mile-transport-infrastructure/ Connectivity in British Columbia: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/connectivity-in-bc

Thousands of small businesses in British Columbia will see their monthly rent reduced by at least 75%, thanks to the new federal-provincial Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance Program (CECRA).“While many small businesses have closed their doors to help keep people safe and healthy, this has not stopped the bills from coming in,” said Carole James, Minister of Finance. “British Columbia is pleased to partner with the federal government on the CECRA, a welcome next step that will help thousands of commercial property owners and tenants in British Columbia.”Launching in mid-May 2020, the CECRA will see B.C. small businesses receive a total of over $300 million in federal-provincial relief, with B.C. contributing an estimated $80 million.The 75% reduction in monthly rent for small businesses affected by COVID-19 will be achieved by providing forgivable loans to cover 50% of the rent payments for eligible small business tenants for April, May and June.The loans will be forgiven if the landlord reduces the tenant’s monthly rent by at least 75%. The commercial tenant would be responsible for covering 25%, the property owner 25%, while the federal and provincial governments share the remaining 50%.“This program is not just about providing relief for people today, it’s also about planning for our future and making sure that businesses and local economies are ready to be part of B.C.’s economic recovery,” James added. “We look forward to working with the federal government on the details of this program, as well as future opportunities to keep all B.C. businesses and communities resilient throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.”The CECRA will be administered by the federal government through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.In addition to commercial rent relief, the B.C. government is offering significant support to businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, including tax reductions, delays and deferrals.Quick Facts:
The Province has reduced most commercial property taxes by an average of 25%, providing up to $700 million in relief. To give commercial landlords and businesses more time to pay their reduced property taxes, late payment penalties for commercial properties (classes 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8) have been waived until Oct. 1, 2020.
Businesses with a payroll over $500,000 can defer their employer health tax payments until Sept. 30, 2020. Businesses with a payroll under this threshold are already exempt.
Payments for provincial sales tax, hotel tax, carbon tax, motor fuel tax and tobacco tax are also deferred.
BC Hydro rates have been reduced by 1%. Residential and commercial customers have the option to defer bill payments or arrange flexible payment plans with no penalty.
ICBC customers on a monthly payment plan who are facing financial challenges due to COVID-19 may defer their payment for up to 90 days with no penalty: https://onlinebusiness.icbc.com/eforms/dotcom/jsp/ACG398.jsp

B.C.’s provincial health officer (PHO) has released an order for industrial camps and guidelines to protect people working in the silviculture sector during the COVID-19 pandemic.This is to help contractors, tree planting operators and their employees reduce the risks of COVID-19.“B.C. continues to be a leader in the fight against COVID-19, and now is the time to reinforce our efforts to keep people safe and healthy,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “Tree planting is crucial to the health of our forests, and we are instituting strict measures based on the PHO's expert direction to make sure that it is done in a way that protects workers and the people of British Columbia.”On April 23, 2020, Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s PHO, issued an order for industrial camps that applies to workers in the agricultural, aquacultural, forestry and resource sectors, as well as those who provide accommodation for these workers. This order sets out prevention, control and inspection protocols for workers and employers.Every year, about 5,000 tree planters, primarily from B.C. and other Canadian provinces, travel to work in remote camps and communities throughout the province. This year, to reduce and mitigate the risks of COVID-19, all tree planters will be subject to strict screening procedures for COVID-19 symptoms before admission to field camps or community accommodations.The BC Centre for Disease Control guidelines for those working in the silviculture sector require:
screening of workers for symptoms or potential COVID-19 exposure;
added hygiene measures in camps, including handwashing stations;
training workers on how to stay safe while travelling to camp and to worksites;
food preparation guidelines;
limiting travel outside of camp; and
having at least one infection and control co-ordinator at each site.
“Recent planting completed on the coast shows that when workers and contractors take appropriate steps to make sure health and safety measures are followed, tree planting can safely take place,” said John Betts, executive director, Western Forestry Contractors’ Association. “Our members began implementing additional steps to protect workers and the public very early on, and it is working.”All tree planting employers are required to implement an infection prevention control plan for work camp locations, including field camps and hotel/motel accommodations, and must submit these plans to the ministry. All forestry camps, accommodations and worksites will be inspected by provincial prevention and control officers to ensure all required health and safety measures are in place. In addition, the Province has implemented on-site security at motels and hotels to ensure tree planters adhere to the PHO’s orders and guidance.“We have heard from rural/remote communities about wanting to make sure work in communities can continue safely, and that is why we have worked collaboratively to develop these guidelines for tree planting,” Donaldson said. “Additionally, we recently announced a new collaborative framework that will help make sure people living in rural, remote and Indigenous communities in B.C. have access to critical health care they can count on to meet their unique needs during the COVID-19 pandemic and into the future.”The framework was developed through a partnership between the First Nations Health Authority, Northern Health and Provincial Health Services Authority. The work is guided by the principles of cultural safety and humility, and adds to work underway by the Rural Coordination Centre of BC.The framework provides flexibility so local leaders in rural, remote and Indigenous communities can adapt it to meet their unique needs. It will be implemented through full engagement with each of the communities’ local leaders. On March 26, 2020, the Province, in consultation with the PHO, identified jobs and industries deemed as essential to maintaining vital goods and services, and supporting the Province’s ongoing response to COVID-19. This is distinct from essential service designations under the Province's Labour Relations Code.Forestry and silviculture were included in the list of essential services because they provide a continuous supply of items, such as wood, pulp and paper, and soft-pulp products, which are like those used to make medical supplies, such as protective masks, drapes and screens.Learn More:PHO industrial camp order and delegation are available here:

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are announcing 29 new cases, for a total of 1,824 cases in British Columbia.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 755 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 760 are in the Fraser Health region, 111 are in the Island Health region, 156 are in the Interior Health region and 42 are in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report four new COVID-19 related deaths in the Fraser and Vancouver Coastal health regions, for a total of 94 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“There have been one new outbreak at Orchard Manor at Hawthorn Park in the Interior Health region. There are also two new acute-care outbreaks: one at Ridge Meadows Hospital in the Fraser Health region and one at Lions Gate Hospital in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. In total, 20 facilities and three acute-care units have active outbreaks, with outbreaks declared over at 10 care facilities.“Public health teams are also providing support to a number of community outbreaks.“A second poultry facility, Superior Poultry in Coquitlam, has two confirmed cases of COVID-19. Fraser Health public health teams are working with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, who is responsible for this facility to manage the outbreak and support with active contact tracing.“In addition to the new cases at Superior Poultry, as of today, 29 employees have now been confirmed positive at the United Poultry Company in Vancouver, and 78 inmates and staff are confirmed positive at the Mission Institution federal correctional centre.“To date, 1,092 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 103 individuals are currently hospitalized, 44 of those are in intensive care and the remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“A new public health order and guidance for agriculture, aquaculture, forestry and natural resources sectors are being provided to industry today to protect the safety of workers and communities as we manage through this pandemic.“The challenge for all of us right now is to recognize that COVID-19 will be in our communities for many months to come.“What this means, is that in order for us to get to a point where we can ease restrictions in B.C., we have to reach a manageable number of new cases: one that does not overwhelm our health-care system, so we can continue to provide the best care possible for all those who are ill.“It is a careful balance, and as we have seen with the recent increase in community outbreaks, it is a balance that is difficult to find.“A misstep in the wrong direction puts us all at risk. A playdate for your children, a gathering with friends, non-essential travel – any of these actions exponentially increase potential exposures to COVID-19 for ourselves and those we care for most.“This is not forever. We will get through this hurricane in the safest, best way possible. But now is most certainly not the time to tip the scales against us. Rather, it is a time for patience and resilience, to demonstrate to each other that in the face of our pandemic, we are standing strong.”Learn More:For the provincial health officer’s orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceTo learn where, when and how people with symptoms can be tested, visit: http://www.phsa.ca/staff-resources/covid-19-resources-for-staff/staff-covid-19-testingThe COVID-19 self-assessment app, which includes details about where, when and how to be tested, can be downloaded here: https://bc.thrive.health/For information on how returning travellers can submit self-isolation plans, visit: gov.bc.ca/returningtravellers  For mental health and anxiety support visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca

More than 2,500 essential service workers on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic have been referred to open child care spaces through the Province’s new child care matching process.Less than a month after the Province launched its new child care matching process, essential service workers throughout British Columbia are dropping their children off at licensed child care spaces in their communities. More than 2,650 essential service workers have been referred to a licensed child care provider through the Province’s matching plan. This process helps match parents, who are working on the front lines of B.C.’s COVID-19 response and have children up to five years of age, with licensed child care spaces.The spaces are prioritized for children whose parents work in public health and health services, social services and law enforcement, first responders and emergency response sectors. Additional spaces are going to families working in other essential roles.For essential service workers with children older than five years, the Ministry of Education has been working closely with school districts and independent schools to ensure these students have access to in-school supports during regular school hours and access to care before and after school hours.The Province is supporting thousands of child care centres during the COVID-19 crisis. So far, the government has invested $38 million to ensure essential service workers continue to have access to reliable licensed child care, and centres that close are able to reopen.As of April 16, 2020, 2,530 child care centres offering up to 58,650 spaces around B.C. are receiving funding through the Temporary Emergency Funding Program to remain open. The program provides eligible licensed providers with funding at a rate of seven times their average monthly child care operating base funding.Child care centres receiving this funding continue to be eligible for the Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative and the Early Childhood Educator (ECE) Wage Enhancement. The fee reduction helps parents by providing funding for licensed child care providers to reduce and stabilize their monthly child care fees. The wage enhancement has provided nearly 12,000 ECEs with a $1-per-hour wage enhancement, which increased to $2 per hour on April 1, 2020, to better recognize the work they do.In addition, families accessing care from these providers may be eligible for the Affordable Child Care Benefit. As of March 2020, more than 51,500 families have benefited from it.Child care providers who have closed due to COVID-19 are also receiving support to help ensure they are able to pay their fixed costs – like rent, lease and mortgage payments – during the temporary closure, so they will be able to reopen. Just over 1,400 facilities have closed and are receiving two times their average monthly operating funding from government, which is expected to cover approximately 20% of an average group facility’s monthly operating expenses. Smaller licensed home-based child care providers are eligible for these supports.To support families who may be struggling with loss of employment and income, child care providers receiving these extra payments must not charge parents fees for any periods of closure or for any vacant spaces while they are open, including when a parent chooses to temporarily withdraw a child due to COVID-19.As British Columbians navigate these uncertain times together, parents who can are asked to continue to care for their children at home. All children and staff who are ill with a fever, or have cold, influenza or infectious respiratory symptoms of any kind, must stay home.Government will continue to be guided by the recommendations and advice of the provincial health officer to ensure British Columbia continues to stop the spread of COVID-19, while looking at safe ways to resume important aspects of society, including child care. The provincial health officer and B.C. government have designated that essential service workers get priority access to child care so they can continue to provide the essential services people rely on in their daily lives during the COVID-19 pandemic.Learn More:Essential workers looking for child care can fill out a “parent” form to identify their need for urgent child care. Forms can be accessed online: www.gov.bc.ca/essential-service-child-care
Or by calling (toll-free) 1 888 338-6622 and selecting Option 4.
Parents who are not in an essential service role are asked to care for their children at home if possible, or complete the form to find an available space nearby at a licensed centre after priority has been given to essential service workers.The Ministry of Health has developed guidelines to inform child care operators, early childhood educators and licensing officers on implementation of best practices, e.g., guidelines on what physical distancing measures are appropriate in a child care setting. Those can be found online:

Temporary relief is on the way for British Columbians whose ability to work has been affected by COVID-19, with applications for the $1,000 B.C. Emergency Benefit for Workers (BCEBW) opening on May 1, 2020.“This benefit is further help for British Columbians who are worried about paying their bills and making ends meet during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Carole James, Minister of Finance. “During these uncertain times, we want to get through this together by helping displaced workers support themselves and their families.”The BCEBW is a one-time, tax-free $1,000 payment for British Columbians whose ability to work has been affected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most people who are eligible for the new federal Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) are also eligible for the BCEBW, including those who have run out of employment insurance (EI) benefits and subsequently qualify for the CERB.To be eligible for the BCEBW, people must:
have been a resident of British Columbia on March 15, 2020;
meet the eligibility requirements for the CERB;
have been approved for the CERB, even if they have not received a benefit yet;
be at least 15 years old on the date of application;
have filed, or agree to file, a 2019 B.C. income tax return; and
not be receiving provincial income assistance or disability assistance.
Starting May 1, applications can be made online, at any time, and a link to the application portal will be available at: www.gov.bc.ca/workerbenefitAlso starting May 1, people can call 778 309-4630 or toll-free within B.C. at 1 855 955-3545, Monday to Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (Pacific time) for general support or questions. Applications over the phone will begin on May 4.Payments will start to go out within days of application. While there may be minor delays during the initial surge, government staff will be working to quickly process payments.The benefit is part of the Province’s $5-billion COVID-19 Action Plan to provide income supports, tax relief and direct funding for people and businesses, and to support the services people count on.The action plan builds on the federal government’s COVID-19 Economic Response Plan and delivers other key supports for people, including:
enhancing the B.C. Climate Action Tax Credit to provide up to $218 per adult and up to $64 per child in July 2020;
introducing a rental supplement of $300 per month for eligible households with no dependents and $500 per month for eligible households with dependents;
providing an emergency $300 per month for the next three months to individuals receiving income assistance or disability assistance and who are not eligible for EI or the CERB;
freezing all B.C. student loan repayments, interest free, until Sept. 30, 2020;
halting all evictions due to non-payment of rent for the duration of this emergency;
delaying several tax filing and payment deadlines for income tax, the employer health tax, provincial sales tax, municipal and regional district tax, motor fuel tax, carbon tax and tobacco tax;
reducing the school property tax rate for commercial properties to achieve an average 25% reduction in the total property tax bill for most businesses; and
changing the Employment Standards Act to ensure immediate job-protected unpaid leave for workers affected by COVID-19, so they can stay home as needed.

Premier John Horgan has issued the following statement in honour of the month of Ramadan:“Today marks the beginning of Ramadan, a time of spiritual reflection and self-improvement for Muslim people in British Columbia and around the world.“During the month of Ramadan, many Muslim people will renew their commitments to better themselves and the world around them through acts of charity and service to others. At a time when people around the province are struggling from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, Ramadan reminds us to always have compassion and help each other where we can. “Normally during Ramadan, friends and families will undertake congregational prayers and break fast at sunset together. This year, people will find new ways of worshipping, including by video chat or from a safe physical distance. Now, more than ever, we must do everything we can to keep ourselves and others healthy and safe.“Ramadan reminds us that we all have a part to play in making the world a better place. Now is the time to act on these values in our own lives and communities.“To all those observing this holy month, I wish you a blessed, peaceful Ramadan.“Ramadan Mubarak!”For a French translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.23_STM-Ramadan-FR.pdf

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are announcing 71 new cases, for a total of 1,795 cases in British Columbia.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 745 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 747 are in the Fraser Health region, 110 are in the Island Health region, 153 are in the Interior Health region and 40 are in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report three new COVID-19 related deaths in the Fraser and Vancouver Coastal health regions, for a total of 90 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“There have been three new outbreaks in long-term care and assisted-living facilities in the last day, at the Eden Care Centre, the Guildford Seniors Village and the New Vista Society. In total, 19 facilities and one acute-care unit have active outbreaks, with outbreaks now declared over at 10 care facilities.“Public health teams are also providing support to a number of community outbreaks.“Vancouver Coastal is working with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to manage the outbreak at the United Poultry Company. To date, 28 employees have been confirmed positive.“Fraser Health continues to work with Correction Services Canada to manage the outbreak at the Mission Institution federal correctional centre, which now has 77 cases of COVID-19.“To date, 1,079 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 103 individuals are currently hospitalized, 46 of those are in intensive care and the remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“We continue to experience new community outbreaks in our province. This tells us that we have more work to do to break the chains of transmission.“We have been clear from the outset, we are taking a whole-province approach and we need every individual, every business and every community to do that same. We cannot afford to have any weakness in our firewall that will result in a surge in new cases.“To ease restrictions, we need a continued decline in both the number of new cases and the number of outbreaks. Until we clear that important hurdle, we can’t begin to make changes.“We know that many people experience mild symptoms, making it difficult to determine if you have COVID-19 and increasing the likelihood of transmission.“That is why it is critically important that if you are ill – whether you feel it is a cold, allergies or COVID-19 – to stay home, stay away from all others and contact your health-care provider or call 811 to get tested.“We also need employers to do the responsible thing and have measures in place to ensure everyone who is working is healthy and allow employees to keep their colleagues safe, by staying home when ill.“Employers also need to understand that an outbreak in your business has a significant impact. An immediate shutdown is required and your business will only be able to open once public health officials are confident that you can operate without putting your employees or the community in harms way.“Those sectors and businesses who are looking ahead to reopening need to think about three things: processes to open safely, measures to keep people safe to avoid further outbreaks and a plan in the event that a case or an outbreak should occur.“B.C. companies, societies and co-operatives can now use electronic meetings during the Province’s state of emergency to ensure the order restricting gatherings of more than 50 people is followed.“We must remain 100% committed to working together in our common purpose to see us through this storm.”Learn More:To learn where, when and how people with symptoms can be tested, visit: http://www.phsa.ca/staff-resources/covid-19-resources-for-staff/staff-covid-19-testingThe COVID-19 self-assessment app, which includes details about where, when and how to be tested, can be downloaded here: https://bc.thrive.health/For information on how returning travellers can submit self-isolation plans, visit: gov.bc.ca/returningtravellers  For mental health and anxiety support visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca

To support B.C. companies, societies and co-operatives through the COVID-19 pandemic, electronic meetings will be allowed during the Province’s state of emergency.A temporary change under the Emergency Program Act will allow electronic meetings during the Province’s state of emergency. The order helps corporations hold annual or special general meetings, in accordance with the provincial health officer’s order against gatherings of more than 50 people.The order will also override requirements under the Business Corporations Act, Societies Act and Cooperative Association Act that prohibit electronic meetings, including a corporation’s own articles, bylaws or rules.  In addition to electronic meetings, all corporations will be able to hold hybrid meetings, giving people the option to participate in person or electronically.Each company, society and co-operative should consider which meeting method best suits its needs, such as Zoom, Skype or telephone conference calls, as long as each participant is able to communicate and vote, if needed.If an online meeting platform is chosen, organizers should consider providing a telephone option for people without access to a computer.Learn More:To learn more about the supports and services available for people, businesses and communities through the pandemic, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/emergency-preparedness-response-recovery/covid-19-provincial-support/financial-benefits

To ensure vulnerable students do not face barriers to learning while in-class instruction is suspended, B.C.’s school districts are finding innovative ways to provide families with more than 75,000 healthy meals a week.“No student should ever have to go without food, whether they’re learning in class or at home,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “Despite the challenging times we’re living in, school-district staff have partnered with local non-profits and businesses in a community effort to ensure kids and their families are getting the nutritious food they need, no matter where they live or learn.”The Government of B.C. provides $53.2 million through CommunityLINK (Learning Includes Nutrition and Knowledge) annually for the province’s 60 school districts to support vulnerable students with services that include meal programs. Twenty-five school districts also receive a combined $11.2 million from the Province through the Vulnerable Student Supplement, which addresses growth in vulnerable student populations.In school districts of all sizes, staff acted quickly to use their resources and work with community organizations and local businesses to ensure students who normally received meals at school would continue to have them at home.Teachers, education assistants, administrators and school support staff are putting together weekly grocery hampers for families, delivering food boxes and bagged lunches to homes and setting up designated hubs for meal pick-up. Some school districts are also providing grocery store gift cards and vouchers, while others have formed partnerships with caterers, non-profits, restaurants, local businesses and food banks to support vulnerable families. More than 16,000 families are receiving these services throughout the province.“So many people are stepping up to make sure students are getting nutritious meals at home,” Fleming said. “This important work is giving vulnerable families throughout the province the support they need to help their children thrive away from the traditional classroom setting.”School districts from every corner of the province are developing their own unique plans to meet the needs of their communities.The Surrey School District immediately implemented a meal pick-up and delivery program, with staff in various positions stepping up to help bring food to students. In the Cowichan Valley, the school district teamed up with Shawnigan Lake school, Nourish Cowichan, Rotary and other community partners to deliver meals to students and families.About 40% of families in Arrow Lakes are being supported by their school district with meals through a combination of hamper and food-box deliveries, food vouchers and partnerships with local caterers.In the Bulkley Valley, school district administrators have worked with the Smithers Volunteer Fire Department, as well as district staff, to co-ordinate food delivery for families in need. In Richmond, the school district collaborated with its Feed-U-Cate-38 program, non-profits and local businesses to have groceries delivered straight to students’ houses.And in the Kelowna area, Central Okanagan Public school has teamed up with Brown Bag Lunch and Food for Thought to provide thousands of meals for local families, with weekly pick-ups that help maintain physical distance.In addition to CommunityLINK and Vulnerable Student Supplement funding, the Province is supporting families by shifting the focus of the B.C. School Fruit and Vegetable Nutritional Program in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The program will deliver fruits and vegetables to low-income families with children through Food Banks BC, in partnership with schools and community-based youth programs.Quotes:Paul Faoro, president, CUPE BC –“CUPE K-12 support staff including education assistants, custodians, bus drivers, clerical and IT (information technology), to name just a few, are here when you need us. Members throughout B.C. are stepping up to support students and their families through this pandemic. We’re all in this together.”Teri Mooring, president, BC Teachers’ Federation  –“The creative and meaningful ways the Ministry of Education, school districts, teachers and CUPE staff are coming together to ensure children and families get the support they need is a great example of how well the sector is working together during these challenging times. When in-school classes were suspended, finding ways to support vulnerable children and youth was top of mind for everyone. The K–12 sector is working extremely hard and I'm very proud of what's happening in our communities.”Learn More:Learn more about the Ministry of Education’s CommunityLINK program: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/education-training/k-12/administration/program-management/communitylinkFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/

Premier John Horgan and George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, have issued the following statement to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Earth Day:“Today, people in British Columbia and around the world are celebrating the 50th anniversary of Earth Day.“Half a century ago, the first Earth Day sparked a generation to stand up and protect our natural environment to build a better, more sustainable future for everyone to enjoy.“In British Columbia, we have a long legacy of environmental stewardship that people can be proud of. It’s an important part of what makes our province so unique. People in B.C. have consistently been ahead of the curve on environmental protection, and this tradition continues to this day.“Together, we are rising to the collective challenge of climate change. In B.C., we have one of the strongest climate action plans on the continent – CleanBC. CleanBC is a blueprint to help build a cleaner, better future for people living in communities throughout the province.“Last fall, British Columbians made their voices heard by marching for strong action on climate change. In October, our government added better accountability and improved transparency to our CleanBC plan by introducing the Climate Change Accountability Act.“On Earth Day, we reaffirm our commitment to taking action for the benefit of future generations.“We have shown there is no limit to what we can accomplish together when we work toward a common purpose. It has never been more important to understand and value the connection between the health of the planet and the health of people. Together, we will continue to build a better future where the interests of people and the environment go hand in hand.”For a French translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.22_STMT-Earth_Day-FR.pdf

Drivers are advised that beginning Tuesday, April 21, 2020, Quesnel-Hydraulic Road will be closed at kilometre 20.3 to all traffic between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. due to ongoing slide activity.Significant land instability has been observed at this location. Out of an abundance of caution, the road will be closed indefinitely during these hours until geotechnical engineers can determine that a full-time reopening is safe for travellers.Prior to re-opening every morning at 6 a.m., Emcon Services will investigate the site and make any necessary repairs to ensure the road is safe.A detour via 2700 Road and 500 Road is currently being prepared to ensure a local route remains open to the public 24 hours per day. The detour is actively being graded and patrolled, with additional gravel being added in some areas to ensure the route is in good condition. The detour will add approximately 30 minutes of travel time.Drivers are advised to continue checking DriveBC for the most up-to-date highway travel information, as the status of Quesnel-Hydraulic road will be continuously updated: DriveBC.caThis traffic management plan will be closely monitored on an ongoing basis and may be altered as the condition of the road changes.

British Columbia is in the midst of two major public health emergencies. The first is the on-going overdose crisis, and while overall death rates have started to come down, it continues to take a heart-breaking toll on families and communities across B.C. The second, of course, is the COVID-19 pandemic, which has drastically changed all our lives.During this unprecedented time, it is critically important that we take extra care of each other, especially the most vulnerable people in our communities. We need to protect individual and community health and safety, and that includes protecting people who are at dual risk of COVID-19 and fentanyl poisoning.If you are struggling with addiction, if you are homeless or under-housed, or if you have to visit a clinic or pharmacy to receive medications every single day, following Dr. Bonnie Henry’s orders on physical distancing or self-isolation can feel almost impossible. And with an increasingly toxic street drug supply, people who use drugs are at considerable risk during the pandemic.  That’s why, as soon as Health Canada provided exemptions under the Controlled Substances Act, the Province and the BC Centre on Substance Use (BCCSU) acted quickly to release new clinical guidance for physicians, nurse practitioners and pharmacists to help people experiencing the symptoms of withdrawal, and people at risk of overdose and/ or at risk of COVID-19 infection.Now, across the province, safe prescription alternatives to the unpredictable and toxic drug supply can be safely prescribed and delivered to those in greatest need. This includes providing safer alternatives for people with addictions to alcohol, opioids, tobacco, stimulants and benzodiazepines. While we are making access to safer prescription medications easier – through virtual care, flexible delivery by pharmacies, and other measures –  we are also helping to flatten the curve of COVID-19.The new provincial guidance is practical and evidence-informed. It is rooted in the fact that addiction is a health issue, not a moral failing – and that people living with addiction deserve the same dignity, respect and access to quality care as people living with any other health condition. The provincial guidance is about safety and health during two public health emergencies – period.It takes courage to reach out and ask for help. But I want to encourage anyone who is facing these challenges, or knows someone who is, to talk to their health-care provider. In order to benefit from the new guidance, people don’t need to have been accessing substance use treatment already. People living with addiction shouldn’t have to risk their lives to get the safe prescription medication they need.In the coming months, we will continue to work hard to make life safer for people at risk as we navigate dual public health emergencies. No matter where you might be on your own journey --  if you are accessing an overdose prevention service, or have just started on medication assisted treatment, or have been in recovery for many years -- each person should be supported on their  own unique pathway to healing and hope.At this time of so much uncertainty - with a global pandemic on top of a fentanyl poisoning crisis - we need to look out for each other now more than ever.We can’t afford to stop caring about one health-care crisis as we stare down another.To find out if the guidance could help you or a loved one, talk to your doctor or nurse practitioner, or call 811 to be directed to supports in your region. A summary of the guidance can be found here: www.bccsu.ca/covid19

We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“There have been no new outbreaks in long-term care and assisted-living facilities the last day. In total, 20 facilities and one acute-care unit have active outbreaks, with outbreaks declared over at six care facilities.“An outbreak has been identified at the United Poultry Company in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. To date, 28 employees have been confirmed positive through active contact tracing by public heath. Close contacts have been notifed and ordered to self-isolate. The plant has been closed to slow further transmission, and public health teams are providing support.“The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is responsible for ensuring the safety of food products. According to CFIA, there is no evidence to suggest that food is a likely source or route of transmission for the virus. Therefore, no recall of chicken products distributed from this plant is required. Good hygiene practices should still be followed during food handling and preparation, such as:
washing hands with soap and water;
regularly cleaning and disinfecting surfaces;
cooking meat thoroughly; and
avoiding potential cross-contamination between cooked and uncooked foods.
“Fraser Health continues to work with Correction Services Canada to manage the outbreak at the Mission Institution federal correctional centre, which now has 76 cases of COVID-19.“A reminder that anyone who was at Kearl Lake project, near Fort McMurray, Alta., from March onward is ordered by the provincial health officer to immediately self-isolate for 14 days and contact your primary care provider, 811 or local public health team.“To date, 1,041 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 109 individuals are hospitalized, and 51 of those are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Our goal is to do all we can to limit the potential for transmission and minimize the impact of necessary public health measures.“Throughout B.C., you have stepped up. Despite the hardships, you have recognized the importance of maintaining safe physical distance, being mindful of those around you, keeping our communities strong and showing compassion and care.“Even though you may be feeling the strain, we need everyone to keep going. We are at an important crossroads with our COVID-19 response. Every day counts, and every action you take makes a difference.“Many are looking ahead and thinking about getting back to work. Now is the time to start thinking about how you can do that safely with precautions in place.“Our focus is to ensure the storm has lessened, so that our workers, entrepreneurs and business owners can join the essential workers who have done so much these past weeks to keep our economy going.“Let’s stay vigilant, connected and committed. We will get through this by remaining united and working together in our common purpose to flatten the curve.”Learn More:To learn where, when and how people with symptoms can be tested, visit:

Provincial emergency COVID-19 funding will be distributed through Community Living BC (CLBC) to ensure people with developmental disabilities stay supported and safe during the pandemic.As part of the B.C. Government’s $5-billion COVID-19 Action Plan, up to $35.6 million will be available over three months from CLBC to support service providers to continue delivering residential services, including group homes, home sharing and supported independent living that about 9,500 adults with developmental disabilities count on.“This pandemic has had a significant impact on agencies and home-sharing providers who perform essential care and services, creating challenges for people with developmental disabilities and their families,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “This funding will ensure that quality of care and staffing levels are maintained so that the people who depend on these services remain safe and supported.”Under this temporary emergency support, CLBC service providers who provide residential services, such as group homes, can request funding to address overtime costs or staffing shortages and to access additional supplies for delivering disability-related supports to keep individuals safe.People with developmental disabilities who live independently with the help of agency-supported living services have also been identified as vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic. Emergency funding will support service providers to adjust and continue supports to keep these people safe.Many home-sharing providers are taking on extra caregiving requirements. This is because of the need to follow health guidelines, the disruption to services, such as community inclusion or day programs, and difficulty in acquiring resources that people usually access in their communities. These home-sharing providers will be able to apply for temporary additional funding to ensure people under their care remain supported.In some cases, these residential services are managed through individualized funding arrangements or person-centred societies, rather than service providers. They will also be able to access emergency funding to maintain residential services.As well, the Province has provided $125,000 to VELA Microboard Association of B.C. to enhance its Support Worker Central web platform. Microboards are small groups of family and friends (a minimum of five people) who create a non-profit society to support adults with developmental disabilities. This is an online database designed to match individuals, families and agencies with support workers in their communities.CLBC will work with agencies and launch the process to request funding on April 27, 2020. Funds are available retroactive to April 1, 2020.Quotes:Ross Chilton, CEO, Community Living BC –“I want to recognize the tremendous effort over the last month on the part of service providers to modify services and home-sharing providers to provide the care necessary to keep people safe. It will be reassuring to many families to know that agencies and home-sharing providers will be supported so that they have capacity to respond to needs during these challenging times.”Brenda Gillette, CEO, BC CEO Network –“This funding responds to the needs expressed by community-living service providers in order to safeguard some of B.C.’s most vulnerable citizens. It will ensure we can continue to deliver essential front-line support.”Karla Verschoor, executive director, Inclusion BC –“The last six weeks have reinforced the critical role of the community-living sector in keeping people safe and supported. These emergency funds will allow organizations to continue providing essential services during the coming months. Inclusion BC applauds the government for its support of our member organizations.”Quick Facts:
CLBC funds three kinds of residential supports:
Staffed residential (group homes): 240 service providers support about 2,700 people living in 900 group homes (which usually house up to four people) throughout B.C. People who choose this option generally need quite a bit of support for daily living. Staff are available throughout the day and night.
Home sharing: 470 service providers provide support for about 4,500 home-sharing arrangements, where a person shares a home with an individual, couple or family that is contracted to provide supports for daily living.
Supported living: About 2,100 people live independently in their own home and get supports for daily living from about 300 service providers.

The B.C. government invites commercial vehicle drivers, owners and owner/operators in the industry to provide input on proposed changes to modernize safety regulations for commercial vehicles.The Province is proposing changes to Division 37 - Safety Code of the Motor Vehicle Act Regulations to improve road safety:As of June 12, 2021, commercial vehicles that cross provincial borders will be required to be equipped with an electronic logging device (ELD). In response to these changes to the federal Commercial Vehicle Drivers Hours of Service Regulations, B.C. is looking for industry input to help determine what the requirements will be for commercial vehicles operating within the province.National Safety Code (NSC) Standard 13 - Trip Inspections has not yet been adopted by B.C. Currently, under Part 4 of Division 37, many B.C. drivers and carriers are already required to complete trip inspection reports and use pre-printed or electronic reports that mirror the requirements of NSC Standard 13. The adoption of NSC Standard 13 would harmonize B.C. with the rest of Canada and provide clarity for commercial vehicle operators in the province.At the same time, the Province is also seeking industry feedback to inform a decision on mandating the use of speed limiters for commercial vehicles already subject to hours of service.The adoption of speed limiters in B.C. can have benefits, including improvements to safety, fuel savings and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Quebec and Ontario enacted speed limiter laws over a decade ago. Recent analysis by the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure has shown the effect on travel times by a lowered travel speed on highways posted over 110 km/h is likely to be minimal, between one to 13 minutes per corridor.Additional information regarding ELDs, NSC Standard 13 and speed limiters can be found in the following NSC bulletin. It is recommended that the bulletin be reviewed prior to completing the questionnaire: http://www.th.gov.bc.ca/cvse/national_safety_code/bulletins/NSC_Bulletin_02-2020_Modernizing_Safety_Regulations.pdfBefore final decisions are made, it is important to hear from those in the commercial transport industry. The survey is open from April 15 to May 31, 2020. It is available online here: https://feedback.engage.gov.bc.ca/821877

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are providing case updates for two 24-hour reporting periods: April 18 to 19, and April 19 through to midday today.“In the first reporting period through April 19, we had 29 new cases, for a total of 1,676 cases in British Columbia.“In the last 24 hours, we have had a further 23 new cases, for a total of 1,699 cases in British Columbia.“This represents 52 new cases since we reported on Saturday.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 700 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 705 are in the Fraser Health region, 102 are in the Island Health region, 153 are in the Interior Health region and 39 are in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report five new COVID-19 related deaths, three in the first reporting period and two since yesterday, for a total of 86 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“There has been one new outbreak at the Chartwell Willow long-term care facility in the last day. In total, 20 long-term care and assisted-living facilities, and one acute-care unit have active outbreaks. Outbreaks have been declared over at six facilities, in addition to the provincial Okanagan Correctional Centre.“There are now 75 cases of COVID-19 associated with the Mission Institution federal correctional centre. Fraser Health officials continue to work with Correction Services Canada to manage this outbreak.“We have also seen a number of new cases of COVID-19 in B.C. related to the Kearl Lake project near Fort McMurray, Alberta. Anyone who was at the site from March to present is ordered by the provincial health officer to immediately self-isolate for 14 days and contact your primary care provider, 811 or local public-health teams.“The guidance we have in place for work camps clearly outlines how to safely operate, and what should be done in the event of a positive case of COVID-19. It is important that employers and workers continue to follow these guidelines to stay safe.“To date, 1,039 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 104 individuals are currently hospitalized, 49 of those are in intensive care and the remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Today, the Premier announced a new framework to provide additional support to our rural, remote and Indigenous communities. This framework recognizes and proactively supports communities that may have limited access to the level of health care that we find in larger, urban centres. “The framework provides more in-community support and testing, faster access to primary and urgent care, and other important social supports. This will enhance our province’s ability to provide care to all British Columbians and keep our communities safe, as we continue to do all we can to break the chain of transmission.“As the situation within B.C. evolves, our testing strategy evolves with it. Initially, our approach was to understand the source of transmission by testing returning travellers, in addition to using community surveillance testing through our ongoing influenza response.“As widespread community transmission occurred, we adjusted our testing to focus on our highest risk and most vulnerable people. This includes outbreaks in long-term care, people who are critically ill and our health-care workers, whose important responsibility it is to care for all of us.“We are now using testing to help us quickly identify and address any new community clusters and outbreaks that may emerge. We want to avoid another spike in new cases and continue to flatten our curve.“What this means is that anyone with COVID-19 symptoms can now be assessed and tested through a physician, nurse practitioner or a local community collection centre.“We remind everyone that while testing is now broadly available, not everyone needs a test. If you have no symptoms, the test has limited benefit.“We are not through the storm. We must remain vigilant to protect loved ones, elders and all of our communities. We will continue to take a slow and thoughtful approach, learning from other jurisdictions that are farther along, while staying alert to changes here in B.C.“We can only introduce modifications to the orders we have in place with further improvement and with all us remaining 100% committed. Let’s stay strong.”Learn More:To learn where, when and how people with symptoms can be tested visit: http://www.phsa.ca/staff-resources/covid-19-resources-for-staff/staff-covid-19-testingThe COVID-19 self-assessment app, which includes details about where, when and how to be tested, can be downloaded here: https://bc.thrive.health/For information on how returning travellers can submit self-isolation plans, visit: gov.bc.ca/returningtravellers  For mental health and anxiety support visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca

466,2020-04-20 13:02:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020PREM0020-000725,Government Website,"Helping rural, remote and Indigenous communities respond to COVID-19","

A new collaborative framework will help ensure people living in rural, remote and Indigenous communities in B.C. have access to critical health care they can count on to meet their unique needs during the COVID-19 pandemic and into the future.  “People living in rural, remote and Indigenous communities have unique challenges in accessing the health care they need,” said Premier John Horgan. “This new collaborative framework will bring immediate relief to these communities, including a commitment to moving patients to the critical care they need at a moment’s notice. This will help our work to stop the spread of COVID-19, while supporting better health outcomes into the future.”The framework was developed through a partnership between the First Nations Health Authority, Northern Health and Provincial Health Services Authority. The work is guided by the principles of cultural safety and humility, and adds to work underway by the Rural Coordination Centre of BC.The framework provides flexibility so local leaders in rural, remote and Indigenous communities can adapt it to meet their unique needs. It will be implemented through full engagement with each of the communities’ local leaders. The framework outlines immediate actions to improve health-care services and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, including:
improved medical transportation options to larger centres, including flight and ambulance; 
housing options for people looking to self-isolate near their families while remaining in their home communities;
new and faster COVID-19 testing technology;
culturally safe contact tracing that respects privacy in small communities;
access to Virtual Doctor of the Day, a program that connects First Nations members and their families in remote communities to a doctor or nurse practitioner using videoconferencing;
options for accommodation near larger centres with more medical services; and
increased mental-health supports in communities.
Local leadership will determine how these services operate in their communities, with the priority being to ensure residents can make informed choices about how they receive care.“COVID-19 is a virus that can move extremely quickly and cause a serious decline in health,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “This presents real challenges for rural, remote and Indigenous communities, for whom access to critical care may not always be close to home. We’re working with our partners to make sure people can access the health care they need, no matter where they live in the province.”As part of this initiative, BC Emergency Health Services (BCEHS) has prepared significant additional resources to its fleet. This amounts to an additional 55 ground ambulances throughout the province, including six in Northern Health. In addition, BCEHS has prepared seven fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters for medical transport. The faster testing methods underway include GeneXpert test kits, which take less than 45 minutes to complete. Several GeneXpert instruments are in B.C. now and are being used in First Nations Health Authority, Northern Health, Interior Health, Vancouver Coastal Health and Fraser Health. A priority was given to more rural and remote sites where the instruments for testing are already in place. More GeneXpert instruments will arrive in the coming weeks.“Indigenous communities have been harder hit in past pandemics and are vulnerable to COVID-19. Elders in particular, as critical knowledge keepers and holders of language, culture and teachings, must be protected,” said Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. “Having plans and supports tailored to the unique circumstances and challenges in remote Indigenous communities will support these communities in caring for their residents.”Quotes: Colleen Erickson, board chair, First Nations Health Authority – “This addresses both the urgent short-term responses needed to support communities during the COVID-19 pandemic and the necessary long-term upgrades to health-care access for rural First Nations populations.”Charlene Belleau, chairperson, First Nations Health Council –“During the COVID-19 pandemic, B.C. First Nations', especially our remote and isolated First Nations, access to culturally appropriate quality care for our most vulnerable is critical. New resources on expanded COVID-19 testing, options for isolation and medical transportation ensure that no one is left behind. Our made-in-B.C. First Nations health governance structure is grounded in the wisdom of our Leaders who are determined to address the health inequities within First Nations communities. We honour the collaboration with our B.C. provincial partners that has made this new framework possible.”Richard Jock, chief executive officer, First Nations Health Authority –“The rapid deployment of the First Nations Virtual Doctor of the Day technology and partnership with groups like the Rural Coordination Centre of BC is an example of how technology can provide real solutions for our more vulnerable communities by delivering fast and effective primary health care where it is needed.”Colleen Nyce, board chair, Northern Health –“Northern Health is encouraged that the unique issues and challenges that rural and remote communities face have been acknowledged in this way by the Government of B.C. This framework will be very helpful in guiding the partnered work Northern Health is doing in collaboration with the First Nations Health Authority and BC Emergency Health Services in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.”Susan Wannamaker, executive vice president, clinical service delivery, Provincial Health Services Authority –“Increasing our ground ambulance and air response means people living in remote communities can relocate to be nearer to critical and acute services if they choose – and supports rapid transport to larger referral centres if their condition worsens.”Quick Facts:
The Virtual Doctor of the Day adds to the existing telehealth program that connects people in Northern Health communities with out-of-town health-care providers over a smartphone, computer or tablet.
Almost 95% of British Columbia’s land base is rural.
The populations of rural British Columbia are often small, dispersed and fluctuating.
Many areas of the province have less than five people per square kilometre.
Indigenous peoples comprise approximately 270,000 people in British Columbia.
There are more than 200 distinct First Nations in B.C., each with its own unique traditions and history. More than 30 different First Nations languages and close to 60 dialects are spoken in the province.

467,2020-04-20 11:00:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020EDUC0031-000723,Government Website,Education assistants find new ways to help students,"

B.C. students, families and educators are adjusting to a different school life environment during the COVID-19 pandemic.Most students are learning at home. But some children with diverse abilities and students whose parents are essential service workers have greater needs.For B.C.’s education assistants (EAs), the COVID-19 measures have compelled them to find creative and compassionate ways to support students either remotely or in person.At D.P. Todd Secondary school in Prince George, education assistants are connecting with students, many of whom have diverse needs and abilities. They connect through online group chats and social-emotional check-ins. The EAs support students’ learning, including reading to them over the phone.“A lot of our students rely on these check-ins,” said Caroline Parker, an EA at D.P. Todd. “When we are in class, you can see their body language change when they've had an opportunity to share what was on their mind, either by being extremely proud of an accomplishment or just letting go of a little bit of stress. This is still even more important today to maintain. They need to know that while so many doors of opportunity are closed right now due to social distancing, that we are still here and do care.”EAs at D.P. Todd are also connecting with classroom teachers to support them in making content more accessible for students who may need an extra layer of support as they learn from home. This might mean recording videos of teachers reading a short story or breaking down a math problem.“Our goal is to make sure that all students who were receiving support in the classroom continue to have access to support virtually,” said Rebecca Lund, a support teacher at D.P. Todd, “and that we are supporting teachers to ensure that their continuity of learning is accessible and inclusive to all of our learners.”Parents of students with complex needs have always known the important connection their children have with their EAs. But in these challenging times, staying in contact with EAs is proving to be invaluable to help students continue their learning and establish routines.“My son's two EAs have ensured they have stayed connected virtually,” said Stacy Cockrell, whose son is in kindergarten in Coquitlam. “It has been so astounding, the amount of effort they have put in to ensure he is still learning, engaged and also has some sort of connection with them. He lights up when he hears their voices.”Hillary Thompson, a parent in Vancouver, is noticing the positive impact her seven-year-old daughter’s EA is making on her family, with regular online meetings.“It has helped her, and us, feel included at school and motivated to keep learning,” Thompson said. “To be successful, schools and families need to work as a team to navigate this new landscape. For many students with disabilities, educational assistants are a vital part of that team.”In other school districts, EAs are taking on roles unique to the COVID-19 crisis and supervising children in schools, while their parents are on the front lines. “As we all know, there are many people in our community doing extraordinary things to achieve a greater good during these challenging and uncertain times,” said Andrea Robertson, an EA at Victoria’s Marigold Elementary school, who is working to provide care and learning opportunities for children of essential service workers. “I feel very proud that I am able to help our Tier 1 health-care providers by providing some support that is helpful for them and our community.”Another example of EAs taking on new responsibilities is in the preparation and delivery of nutritious food to families whose children would normally have access to meal programs at schools.Nearly a dozen EAs in the Comox Valley are packing food hampers that will provide nutritious meals to 200 local families during the pandemic. It’s about 11 kilograms (25 pounds) of food in each delivery.“I have truly been impressed by the stories of CUPE members in the K-12 system and how they’re stepping up in these difficult and strange times to make schools safe and inclusive, even at a distance,” said Paul Faoro, president of CUPE BC.Education assistants are vital in school communities and their work will continue and evolve throughout the pandemic. The Ministry of Education is working with all 60 school districts to balance the needs of families, students and communities, and finding solutions to challenges that nobody has faced before.Learn More:Timely information about schools, programs and educational services, including regularly updated frequently asked questions in multiple languages, is available at: www.gov.bc.ca/SafeSchools/For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/

The Government of B.C. is partnering with the District of Squamish and Squamish Helping Hands Society to provide 49 new temporary homes for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness in the community.“The need for safe, secure housing has never been more important,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “This partnership with the District of Squamish and Helping Hands Society will make sure people in need have a safe place to call their own during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.”Located at Xwu’nekw Park on Loggers Lane between Victoria Street and Main Street, the development will consist of repurposed modular units that can be put in place within a few weeks. The building will include self-contained bedrooms and shared washrooms. Residents will be provided with two meals a day, delivered to their rooms to support social distancing. There will be at least two staff on site at all times who will offer supports to residents, such as access to addiction and mental-health referrals.The temporary housing is expected to open by mid-May 2020 and will be in place until the end of October when Under One Roof, a new permanent shelter and housing project, is anticipated to open on Third Avenue. Under One Roof will provide 45 new spaces, including 15 units of low-barrier dormitory housing, 15 units of transitional housing and 15 affordable homes.“In the face of this global pandemic, we must ensure that everyone in our community can safely distance themselves from others in order to protect themselves and the broader community, and help stop the spread of COVID-19,” said Karen Elliott, mayor, District of Squamish. “I am very grateful for the quick action of everyone involved to make this project happen. This project will ensure that there are no barriers for residents to access shelter and space to physically distance during COVID-19.”Priority for this new temporary housing will be given to people who are living in the Budget Inn, which is set to be redeveloped, and to people who are experiencing homelessness in Squamish, including those staying at the temporary shelter at the Howe Sound Secondary school’s gymnasium. Once residents move into the temporary housing, the gym will no longer be used as a temporary shelter.“We are incredibly grateful for the amazing work and leadership on this project that will offer critical support and service to our fellow citizens and our community, especially those more vulnerable to this virus,” said Maureen Mackell, executive director, Squamish Helping Hands. “This is a true example of what we can achieve when we come together as a community, so that everyone can be supported and protected, especially in the midst of the current health crisis.”The Province is providing approximately $325,000 to lease the modular units from LandSea, as well as operating funding of more than $152,000. BC Housing will work with Helping Hands Society to develop the operating model. The district is providing the land for this project.In addition to this new project, the Province has also secured a total of 18 rooms across two Squamish hotels that will be reserved for people who do not have a safe place to self-isolate during the pandemic. The locations of the hotels will remain private so staff can focus on helping people in need.Learn More:More information about how BC Housing is supporting British Columbians during the COVID-19 outbreak can be found here: https://www.bchousing.org/COVID-19Details about how BC Housing is partnering with hotel providers can be found here: https://www.bchousing.org/COVID-19/community-sitesFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/

Premier John Horgan has issued the following statement in honour of Yom Ha'Shoah, Holocaust Memorial Day:“On this solemn day, British Columbians join people around the world to honour and remember the six million Jewish lives lost -- along with millions of others targeted by the Nazis because of their ethnicity, sexual identity or disability -- during the Holocaust.“This year, we will mark the 75th anniversary of the end of the Holocaust by honouring the victims and paying tribute to the survivors. While COVID-19 prevents us from gathering in person to commemorate Yom Ha'Shoah, it is important that we still remember. In these challenging times, community, solidarity and faith are especially important.“Online Holocaust Remembrance events have been organized to allow people to gather virtually, while protecting the health of their loved ones. Even though commemorations will look different this year, we must stand together, every day, against anti-Semitism, bigotry and hate.”For a Hebrew translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.04.21_STM-YomHaShoah-HEBREW.pdf

Portions of three Vancouver Island highways will be resurfaced this spring and summer as part of an $8.5-million project to improve conditions for people who travel on these routes.Work is underway to resurface a 40-kilometre section of Highway 19 between Parksville and Bowser. Due to reduced traffic volumes as a result of COVID-19, work is happening during the day and overnight with minimal impact on essential travel. Drivers can expect single-lane traffic through the work zone.Near Victoria, Highway 1 will be resurfaced between the new McKenzie Interchange and Leigh Road – a distance of eight kilometres. All on- and off-ramps in the work zone will also be resurfaced. This resurfacing work will happen overnight to minimize delays for drivers.Approximately 2.5 kilometres of Highway 14 near the Westshore Parkway will also be resurfaced. Drivers can expect lane closures during the work. Resurfacing sections of Highway 14 and Highway 1 is expected to begin in spring 2020.A contract for the work has been awarded to Peters Brothers Construction Ltd. of Penticton.The ministry is working closely with the contractor and WorkSafeBC to ensure health and safety are maintained for all workers on site.B.C.’s provincial health officer (PHO) has directed construction employers to take all necessary precautions to minimize the risks of COVID-19 transmission and illness to themselves and their employees. This includes ensuring workers maintain physical distance with a minimum of two metres apart from each other, both in the course of their duties as well as during breaks. Anyone exhibiting COVID-19 like symptoms will be directed to self-isolate at home for at least 10 days.While highways and roads remain open, the PHO recommends people stay close to home and avoid any non-essential travel.Drivers are reminded to obey construction zone speed limits and the direction of traffic control personnel.

Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, has given police and other enforcement officers the ability to issue $2,000 violation tickets for price gouging and the reselling of medical supplies and other essential goods during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  Effective immediately, these new measures are enacted under the provincial state of emergency, using the extraordinary powers of the Emergency Program Act (EPA) in ongoing support of the Province’s all-of-society approach to COVID-19 response and recovery.“These orders are not suggestions, they are the law,” said Farnworth. “These measures will provide enforcement officers and police agencies the ability to enforce the law on these criminal acts and despicable practices, like the reselling of medical supplies and price gouging.”The Province is calling upon compliance staff from provincial ministries and local governments to support enforcement for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic state of emergency. This includes municipal bylaw officers, liquor and cannabis inspectors, gaming inspectors, conservation officers, community safety unit inspectors, park rangers, natural resource officers, commercial vehicle safety officials and sheriffs.Police and other enforcement officers are empowered to actively enforce EPA orders and issue $2,000 violation tickets for infractions throughout the COVID-19 state of emergency, focusing on the Province’s ban on reselling essential goods and supplies and price gouging. If required, police and other enforcement officers will also be able to actively enforce and ticket those who:
exceed the quantity limits on the sale of specified items; and
do not comply with the requirement for hotel and other lodging operators to provide accommodation at the request of the Province to serve as self-isolation facilities or to support essential workers.
Violation tickets are a timelier alternative to prosecution through the courts and increase the Province’s enforcement toolkit to support the COVID-19 response. Police and other enforcement officers will independently exercise discretion to issue tickets for EPA order violations under the Offence Act’s Violation Ticket Administration and Fines Regulation (VTAFR).The Province is also working with Consumer Protection BC (CPBC) to keep British Columbians safe from businesses and individuals who are trying to profit from the COVID-19 pandemic. CPBC will be the first and main point of contact for all complaints related to price gouging of essential goods and supplies, and will ensure those complaints are resolved appropriately in co-ordination with police and enforcement officers.These measures are in concert with the federal government’s April 14, 2020, announcement that allows local and provincial police forces to issue tickets to returning travellers who do not comply with the requirement to self-isolate for 14 days under the federal Quarantine Act.Quick Facts:
The federal government will continue to use its authority under the Quarantine Act to ensure compliance with the emergency order requiring individuals entering Canada to self-isolate for 14 days.
Enforcement of orders of the provincial health officer (PHO), including mass gatherings and business closures, will continue to be at the direction of the PHO.
To report concerns on PHO order violations, contact your local government. Local governments can dispatch bylaw and other compliance officers to follow up on concerns and report appropriately to public health.
The authority for police officers throughout the province to issue $2,000 violation tickets corresponds with section 27(1)(a) and (b) of the EPA and will be applicable under future states of emergency.
All other designated enforcement officers around the province can issue $2,000 violation tickets for contraventions of Section 8 (4) and (5) and Section 9 of Ministerial Order 84/2020, and Section 3 of Ministerial Order 115/2020, under the Emergency Program Act. This authority is limited to the duration of the current provincial state of emergency.

Now that we are well and truly into our COVID-19 pandemic response, many people throughout British Columbia and Canada have similar questions and concerns.How bad is it going to get? How long do we have to be physically distant from others and put aside our regular routines? When can we get back to work, see our loved ones and book social events? I understand the anxiety and frustration that comes with this uncertainty.One of the tools we in B.C., as well as other provinces and the federal government, have used to understand these issues is modelling. In late March, British Columbia was the first province to share its modelling. We contributed to the national modelling in early April, and have now released our latest report.COVID-19 hit the world like a Category 5 hurricane. The most recent B.C. modelling shows us that in the face of this storm, we have made considerable progress in our province. We have experienced significant damage, but are still standing strong.I want each of you to know that this is for one reason: The immense efforts that you have taken to ‘batten down the hatches’ by being physically distant from others and following the orders and restrictions in place, are truly making a difference.I also want everyone to know that we are in the eye of the hurricane right now, and to fully weather this storm, we must remain 100% committed.The modelling from B.C. and elsewhere clearly shows that if we relax our measures too soon, we will face more severe and unnecessary damage.So how does our modelling help? To begin, we must understand that modelling is not a crystal ball. Instead, it is a useful tool to understand the many situations that we in B.C, as well as people around the world, are in, and the many approaches being taken to flatten the curve. Here in B.C., we also use dynamic modelling to assess what is happening right now, in our province and around the world. This helps guide our decision-making for the future.We are only as strong as our weakest links in society, so modelling also allows us to look over our shoulders at past indicators to see how we’ve done in our attempt to protect people. We can decide what we need to prepare for, and what we can fix right now. Modelling also helps us determine how much longer we need to protect our communities with physical distancing.It is important to understand that all models are inherently imprecise, because they use assumptions that are based on imperfect data, and there is no way for us to know for sure what’s going to happen tomorrow. What we can attempt to see from modelling, though, is how we might influence the curve of a model ourselves, every day, by being extra careful about our physical distancing and other proven measures like cleaning our hands, covering our coughs and staying home when sick. In B.C., we are committed to updating our modelling regularly so that everyone can see whether our efforts are successful, day to day, and what our possibilities are compared to other places in the world. We will continue to publish our ongoing epidemiologic curve, case counts and our test-positive rates each day on the BC Centre for Disease Control's website.In our latest presentation, we provided even more data: we have shared the demographics and the epidemiology that tell us who has been affected most by this virus — the age ranges, the locations and various types of epidemiological information — to help everyone get a better picture of who, where and when people in B.C. have been affected.We are being transparent and open with this information because, as I know well, we all need hope and we all want to know how our actions are making a difference.I also want to remind everyone that physically distancing from others does not mean being alone or without aid. Reaching out online and allowing community members to help in these challenging times can make a world of difference.We want everyone to stand united and stay strong. Every British Columbian has a part to play in flattening the curve and making a difference. Let’s all continue together to be safe, be calm, be kind and do the right thing.Learn More:For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“We are announcing 29 new cases for a total of 1,647 cases of COVID-19 in British Columbia.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 686 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 680 are in the Fraser Health region, 97 are in the Island Health region, 150 are in the Interior Health region and 34 are in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report three new COVID-19 related deaths in the Fraser Health region, for a total of 81 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“There have been no new outbreaks in the last day. In total, 20 long-term care and assisted-living facilities, and one acute-care unit have active outbreaks. Outbreaks have been declared over at five facilities.“There are now 70 cases of COVID-19 associated with the Mission Institution federal correctional centre. Fraser Health officials continue to work with Correction Services Canada to manage this outbreak.“To date, 987 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 115 individuals are hospitalized and 54 of those are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“British Columbians have listened to the orders and restrictions. You have shown your compassion and commitment to protecting loved ones, Elders and our health-care workers.“However, we cannot lose sight of the important fact that we continue to have new cases and tragically, new deaths. The hurricane is still raging, and the risk of a spike in our curve is still very much a concern.“The easing of restrictions will be gradual and slow because of the nature of the COVID-19 virus and the up-to-two-week delay in the onset of symptoms. This is why we will be watching the curve closely over the coming week to see what the impacts of the recent holiday weekend may be.“A thoughtful and careful approach will be taken, and only If we continue to see sustained improvement will we be able to introduce modifications. The earliest we would anticipate any changes would be mid-May.“Right now, we must all continue to hold the line. We must all continue to show kindness and care to those around us and do all we can to continue to flatten our curve.”Learn More:The latest modelling presentation and information is available online: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/COVID19_Update_Modelling-BROADCAST.pdfFor information on how returning travellers can submit self-isolation plans, visit: http://gov.bc.ca/returningtravellersFor mental-health and anxiety support visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca

More than 23,000 computers and devices are being loaned out in every part of the province, so students can access the internet and continue their education while in-class learning is suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic.“Now, more than ever, we must come together to help children and families who are struggling in our communities,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “That’s why we’re working closely with all 60 school districts to quickly provide parents and children with the supports they need to connect with each other, teachers and learning opportunities.”Immediately after spring break, school staff began contacting families to find out their unique needs. School districts then began creating solutions that would work best for their local communities.School districts heard there are families who have no computer for their children to use, with some finding up to 30% of families surveyed had no access to technology at all. There were also cases where there was only one computer in the home being used by a parent for full-time work. Districts also heard from families who have limited Wi-Fi or no access to internet or cellphone service.“Boards of education across British Columbia understand the diverse learning needs of the students they serve,” said Stephanie Higginson, president, BC School Trustees Association. “Boards of education know that learning solutions need to be tailored to local community needs. These technology loans are one small way boards are working to ensure that the needs of some of our most vulnerable students are met during these uncertain times.”To meet the needs of families, school district staff have worked quickly to identify and collect equipment already available in schools, while also purchasing extra computers, laptops, tablets and other devices. Some school districts have redeployed their computer technicians to pre-install learning software or to provide tech support for families who struggle to use technology.To help kids who do not have adequate internet access, school districts have worked with internet service providers to ensure families have low-cost internet or unlimited cellphone data plans. Local internet hotspots have also been created to ensure free Wi-Fi is available to multiple families in a neighbourhood.In situations where students are living in remote regions with little or no internet or cellphone access, education assistants have been delivering printed learning packages or flash thumb drives with everything the student needs for continued learning at home. Some schools are allowing students access to school computer labs, and some First Nations have opened their band offices for students, while maintaining the strict health and safety standards set by the provincial health officer.  “Parents appreciate the incredible collaboration between K-12 education and the Ministry of Education to ensure educators can shift from in-class learning to remote learning for each child,” said Andrea Sinclair, president, British Columbia Confederation of Parent Advisory Councils (BCCPAC). “BCCPAC believes equity and equal opportunity are essential in public education and maintaining the connection with children is key. Families, especially those who are low income or living in rural and remote regions, must have devices and connectivity so their children can continue learning during this unique time.”

To support families looking for additional resources to help their children learn remotely, the Ministry of Education has created the Keep Learning website, which is updated almost daily with new activities for kids of any age. The website receives hundreds of thousands of visitors and page views every week and can be found at: www.openschool.bc.ca/KeepLearningQuick Facts:
In addition to equipment support, there are approximately:
2,300 spaces created in schools to support children of essential-service workers in public schools and 1,280 spaces in independent schools; and
75,000 meals delivered to 16,000 families for vulnerable children every week.

The Ministry of Education has secured and funded enterprise licences with added security features for the application Zoom for all K-12 public, independent and First Nations schools in the province. This allows consistent access for educators who choose to use it, giving them more ways to connect with students, parents and guardians.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“We are announcing 43 new cases, for a total of 1,618 cases of COVID-19 in British Columbia.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 680 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 661 are in the Fraser Health region, 94 are in the Island Health region, 150 are in the Interior Health region and 33 are in the Northern Health region.“There have been no new outbreaks in the last day. In total, 20 long-term care and assisted-living facilities, and one acute-care unit have active outbreaks. Outbreaks have been declared over at five facilities, and  in review, one facility had been included in error. We have confirmed that the outbreak at Broadway Pentecostal Lodge was an influenza outbreak and not COVID-19. The lodge has been removed from the list.“There are now 63 cases of COVID-19 associated with the Mission Institution federal correctional centre, six of whom are in hospital. Fraser Health officials continue to work with Correction Services Canada to manage this outbreak.“To date, 966 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation. Recovery criteria for the Vancouver Health Authority have been updated to more accurately reflect recovery. New methods include consideration for specific patient symptomology. This has resulted in the decrease in patients considered recovered.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 119 individuals are hospitalized and 52 of those are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Of note, the errors that occurred in the April 16 data have been corrected. The updated information is available on the BC Centre for Disease Control's (BCCDC) website and is reflected in today’s cumulative numbers.“The modelling we released today clearly shows the resiliency and 100% commitment of everyone in B.C. is having a positive impact. We are bending the curve.“People in B.C. have listened and done the right thing. We are grateful for what everyone has done.“We are in the eye of the storm in a Category 5 hurricane. The risk is still very high and there are many unknowns, but we are hopeful that with all of us standing strong, the storm will continue to lessen.“What happens next is directly tied to your continued efforts. We still have new cases, new outbreaks and tragically, new deaths. We cannot afford a resurgence that will undo all of the effort and sacrifices we have made so far.“We all want opportunities for more social connection, but we’re not there yet. To safely ease restrictions, we must be thoughtful and careful in our approach. As we look ahead, we need to find the right balance. That is even more challenging because of the nature of the COVID-19 virus.“Our new normal in the months ahead will be a modification of what we are doing now. The physical distancing measures, staying home if you are ill and following good hand hygiene will continue. And, it is vital that we continue to show care and compassion for those around us.“The standards for essential businesses today will be the template as we move forward. Clear parameters will be given, and we will connect with individual sectors to determine how best to work within the requirements.“We thank the many researchers and epidemiology experts at the BCCDC, Simon Fraser University and the University of British Columbia for their collective efforts on the important modelling work. When you raise your voices for the 7 p.m. cheer, let’s take a moment to acknowledge their hard work and all of our continued commitment to standing together to safeguard our province.”Learn More:The latest modelling presentation and information is available online: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/COVID19_Update_Modelling-BROADCAST.pdfFor information on how returning travellers can submit self-isolation plans, visit: gov.bc.ca/returningtravellers For mental-health and anxiety support visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca

The Province is supporting strata corporations in B.C. to prevent the spread of COVID-19 by allowing them to hold meetings electronically, including their annual and special general meetings, during the current provincial state of emergency.This temporary change under the Emergency Program Act applies to all strata corporations, whether or not they already have a bylaw allowing electronic meetings.Strata councils already have the flexibility to hold monthly strata council meetings electronically. The order helps strata corporations hold annual or special general meetings in accordance with the provincial health officer’s order against gatherings of more than 50 people.Each strata corporation will need to determine what electronic meeting method works best for them. The strata council may choose from options such as Zoom, Skype or telephone conference calls, as long as it allows everyone to communicate with each other during the meeting. If an online meeting platform is chosen, alternatives for owners without a computer could include:
attending by telephone;
participating by proxy by giving their voting instructions to someone who will be attending the meeting; or
attending in person, ensuring the two-metre physical distancing order is followed.

New, free virtual educational programs for students, parents and educators are supporting social and emotional well-being as part of navigating the new world of remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.“We know that children and families are feeling anxiety and uncertainty during these challenging times, and it’s important we provide resources to help them thrive,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “These new learning tools for students, families and educators offer interactive lessons to support their health and well-being.”The free, virtual WE Well-being program was recently launched as part of the new WE Schools @home program. Accessible for grades K-12 in both English and French, the program is aimed at youth who are experiencing anxiety and social isolation. It places a special emphasis on WE Well-being online learning, including social-emotional learning and resiliency.Developed in collaboration with B.C. educators, the Ministry of Education and University of British Columbia and mental health professionals, the program provides educators with curriculum resources for students in elementary schools that cover self-awareness and personal responsibility, with plans to expand to high schools. The program was launched in 2018 as a pilot and has involved over 3,500 students, 150 educators, 43 schools and 11 school districts to date.Also available to parents and caregivers is the new EASE (Everyday Anxiety Strategies for Educators) at Home program. Activities focus on tips and strategies parents can use with their children to create calming routines, help them talk about difficult emotions and manage their anxiety. Kits have been developed for grades K-3 and 4-7 and provide five weeks of activities, with a different game or story for each day. Activities are research based and proven to help younger children calm themselves, learn relaxation techniques and understand their worries.“This is a difficult time, especially for children and youth who are safely distancing from friends and relatives and who may be feeling stressed or anxious from all the recent changes in their lives,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “These new EASE at Home resources will provide parents with simple activities that they can model for their kids and include in daily routines.”The WE Well-being and EASE at Home materials complement the recent Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions announcement of $5 million to expand existing mental-health programs and launch new services to support British Columbians around COVID-19. One focus of the funding is a new virtual clinic that will make Foundry services available around the province for young people aged 12 to 24 years and their families through voice, video and chat.“This crisis is taking a toll on the mental health of British Columbians of all ages, including young people and their families,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “This new resource is great news for students who are missing connections with friends and teachers, parents who are adapting to the needs of their children in new ways, and educators who are working hard to support both the academic and emotional well-being of their students.”Quotes:Craig Kielburger, co-founder, WE –“In our isolation, protecting our community’s physical health presents challenges for mental health and well-being. Our goal is to support youth well-being through cost-free digital resources and content that complement distance education with a focus on self care and social-emotional learning. By making these resources easy to use for students, we hope to take some burden off the shoulders of busy parents and teachers.”Kimberly A. Schonert-Reichl, professor, faculty of education, University of British Columbia –“Rarely before in our recent history have we seen such an urgent need for an explicit and intentional focus on supporting the well-being of our children, their families and our educators. B.C.’s Ministry of Education is a leader in the world through its steadfast attention to mental health in schools and its curricular competencies that integrate the promotion of students' personal and social competence, both which are informed from the latest science on well-being. The WE Well-being and WE Schools @home programs provide a perfect alignment with B.C.’s focus, because the WE organization has distilled the latest research into evidence-based practical approaches and resources that integrate social and emotional learning and the cultivation of positive human qualities, including empathy, gratitude, compassion altruism and resilience – those qualities that are essential for well-being.”Quick Facts:
Early signs of anxiety can be missed when children struggle with internal worries and physical distress. Some children are at greater risk of developing an anxiety disorder, which affects up to 4% of B.C. children and youth.
WE Schools is offered in over 1,160 schools and groups in British Columbia, with more than 1,000 schools and 300,000 students engaged.
The WE Schools @home program is connected to the long-standing, free-service learning program WE Schools, which is provided to over 18,000 schools across North America and globally.
EASE was developed by the Ministry of Children and Family Development in consultation with Anxiety Canada to be a tangible and practical approach to supporting social and emotional learning and building the capacity of K-7 educators.
EASE at Home is also being shared with Indigenous service providers, First Nations Schools Association and the First Nations Education Steering Committee.

480,2020-04-17 06:30:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020ENV0020-000704,Government Website,Bear Smart Community Program helps people live peacefully with bears,"

It’s the time of year when bears emerge from their dens and search for food, often bringing them into the nearest community.With more people staying home due to COVID-19 and some waste and recycling services impacted as a result of the pandemic response, it’s more important than ever to be vigilant about keeping bear attractants at bay.Eight communities in B.C. are already setting a strong example of what to do during this extraordinary time. Kamloops, Squamish, Lions Bay, Whistler, Port Alberni, Naramata, New Denver and Coquitlam have had official Bear Smart status for several years through the Bear Smart Community Program. The program is a voluntary, preventative conservation measure that encourages communities, businesses and individuals to work together to reduce conflicts with bears. Several more are actively pursuing the designation.“If bears do not have access to non-natural food sources, such as garbage, fruit and bird seed within communities, they have no reason to hang around. This results in increased safety for both people and bears,” said Mike Badry, provincial wildlife conflict manager, BC Conservation Officer Service. “Residents could turn this unusual time into something positive for wildlife by taking extra time to secure attractants and educate themselves about Bear Smart practices.”Nine years ago, Zoe Kirk, a public project works co-ordinator for the Regional District of Okanagan-Similkameen, and the residents of Naramata started to notice an unsettling trend – an average of four to eight bears were destroyed in the village every year due to ongoing conflicts with people.  Located on the east side of Okanagan Lake, the community of 2,400 residents consists of fruit farms, large acreages with livestock, a small village centre and tourists flocking to vacation properties during the summer. The area is also home to a healthy population of bears going to and from the lake and fishing in a creek that runs through the village. Unsecured garbage left outside overnight often lured the bruins into the community.“The community is nestled in perfect bear habitat, but some folks were being lackadaisical about attractant management, which put neighbourhoods at risk for a conflict with wildlife,” Kirk said. “Many residents were frustrated by this and began petitioning for a change.”Seeing a need to address the root cause of the conflicts, Naramata signed up for the Bear Smart Community Program in 2012. The program is designed by the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, in partnership with the B.C. Conservation Foundation and the Union of B.C. Municipalities, and is based on six criteria that communities must achieve in order to be recognized as “bear smart.”Following that criteria, Naramata put a bylaw in place to prevent residents from putting their garbage on the curb before 5:30 a.m., changed the day of garbage pickup to better align with the days most people were coming or going from the community and provided bear-proof containers in areas that had the most attractants. Then Kirk went to the local schools, getting kids to take home the message that leaving attractants around their home isn’t cool. Garbage audits were also introduced with the support of B.C. conservation officers to educate residents who were found putting out garbage early.Within a year, Kirk noticed a big change in Naramata citizens’ behaviour. Suddenly, there was no garbage on the street and call volumes to the Conservation Officer Service went down from 100 per year to about 12. In 2014, Naramata became the sixth community in the province to be awarded official Bear Smart status – a designation Kirk and village residents continue to view with pride.“People have learned to modify their behaviour and have experienced the difference. In under three years, the community has become almost completely self policing,” Kirk said, who encourages communities struggling with human-wildlife conflicts to sign up for the program. “It takes political will, it takes community will, but when those two come together, you can really make big strides forward.”Last year, the Conservation Officer Service received more than 20,000 calls related to conflicts with bears. Many of the calls pertained to unsecured attractants. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, the Province is reminding citizens to stay safe, healthy and become bear smart.  Learn More:For more information about the Bear Smart Community Program and the list of criteria to become Bear Smart, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/plants-animals-ecosystems/wildlife/human-wildlife-conflict/staying-safe-around-wildlife/bears/bear-smartTo learn more about the B.C.

The Government of British Columbia has launched Here2Talk, a new mental-health counselling and referral service for post-secondary students.The service offers confidential, free single-session services by app, phone or online chat, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.“Until now, post-secondary students have never had access to 24/7 provincewide mental-health support services,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “Students advocated for years to fill the gap in available mental-health counselling services in British Columbia. Over the past several months, we’ve been working together to develop this new free service. With the advent of COVID-19 and the increased stress it puts on students, we doubled down to get students the supports they so desperately need. I’m very excited to say that Here2Talk is now available for all 555,000 post-secondary students registered across B.C.”For the first time, every student in B.C. has access to 24/7 mental-health services – whether the students are rural, urban, domestic, Indigenous, international, public, private, full-time, part-time or in trades training. Here2Talk will complement other supports on campus and in the community, including new virtual mental-health supports announced April 9, 2020, by the Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions.“For too long, mental-health care was an afterthought in B.C., and many post-secondary students weren’t able to access the help they needed. Here2Talk is changing that,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “Now every student can access supports 24/7 without stigma or judgment – and it’s free, because access to mental-health care shouldn’t depend on the size of your bank account.”Chat sessions with a trained counsellor can be accessed by downloading the Here2Talk app or visiting: here2talk.caStudents can speak to a counsellor by phone, toll-free at 1 877 857-3397 or direct 604 642-5212. Students calling from outside Canada can dial 1 604 642-5212 (international calling charges may apply).Hundreds of students throughout B.C. provided feedback and ideas that were used to develop and tailor Here2Talk to deliver the kind of help students felt they needed. The on-demand service, operated by Morneau Shepell, will support students dealing with challenges such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, pressure to perform, crises, racism and relationships. Counsellors will also be equipped to refer students to local resources in their communities.For the launch, web, phone and chat services are currently available in English and French. Phone services are also available in additional languages upon request.Government is providing $1.5 million per year for the service.Improving mental health at post-secondary institutions is an integral part of government’s actions outlined in A Pathway to Hope, B.C.’s roadmap for making the system of mental-health and addictions care better for people no matter where they live in the province. Implementing A Pathway to Hope is a shared priority with the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Jonny Morris, CEO, Canadian Mental Health Association BC – “Here2Talk means post-secondary students who need access to mental-health counselling services will have expanded virtual access to help anytime they need it, in a way that makes sense for them. Because it is designed for the post-secondary demographic, it provides targeted support for students at any time when they need to connect. This service stands to increase access to confidential student support provincewide, while linking to existing services on campuses and in community.”Tanysha Klassen, chairperson, BC Federation of Students –  “Post-secondary education comes with lots of challenges and stress. This new service, Here2Talk, will help make a real difference in the lives of many students. Even though there are support services on some campuses and in the community, they’re not always easy to access and some students feel uncomfortable asking for help. Here2Talk’s chat, phone and online services will make it much easier for students to reach out for help when they need it.”Norah Joyce, Canada chief commercial officer and executive vice-president, Morneau Shepell –  “As the largest and the most fulsome provider of mental-health and well-being services in Canada, including for post-secondary students, we are excited to work with the government of British Columbia on this important partnership. We applaud its leadership in supporting the mental health of every student in this province through this program and are honoured to have been chosen to help provide it, especially now with anxiety related to COVID-19 impacting large sections of the population.”Quick Facts:
Morneau Shepell administers the largest clinical network in Canada. It has delivered mental-health solutions since 1974 and serviced more than 20,000 organizations worldwide. It supports more than 3,800 clients across all services in B.C. and more than 200 post-secondary institutions across North America.
The 2016 National College Health Association survey of Canadian post-secondary students found a significant number of students experience mental-health challenges:
44.4% of surveyed students reported at some point in the previous 12 months they felt “so depressed it was difficult to function”
18.4% reported being “diagnosed or treated by a professional” for anxiety
13% had seriously considered suicide
2.1% had attempted suicide

The Province is providing enhanced relief for businesses by reducing most commercial property tax bills by an average of 25%, along with new measures to support local governments facing temporary revenue shortfalls as a result of COVID-19.“We know that B.C. communities and businesses are suffering from the economic impacts of COVID-19,” said Carole James, Minister of Finance. “That is why our B.C. COVID-19 Action Plan is focused on the health and safety of British Columbians, direct support for people and businesses and economic recovery for our province. We are providing further support by making additional temporary property tax changes to provide provincewide relief for business and local governments to help weather the pandemic, continue to deliver the services people count on and be part of our province’s economic recovery.”The Province is taking significant new steps to support B.C. businesses, non-profits and other organizations through the COVID-19 pandemic by:
further reducing the school property tax rate for commercial properties to achieve an average 25% reduction in the total property tax bill for most businesses, providing up to $700 million in relief. This enhances the 50% reduction to the provincial school property tax rate that was originally announced for classes 4, 5, and 6 as part of B.C.’s COVID-19 Action Plan.
Postponing the date that late payment penalties apply for commercial properties in classes 4,5,6,7 and 8 to Oct. 1, 2020, to give businesses and landlords more time to pay their reduced property tax, without penalty.
Responding to key concerns from local governments, the Province is addressing cash flow and revenue shortfalls with new measures that provide additional support:
authorizing local governments to borrow, interest-free, from their existing capital reserves to help pay for operating expenses, such as employee salaries.
delaying provincial school tax remittances until the end of the year. This will provide significant relief to local governments facing cash flow issues.
providing local governments greater flexibility to carry debt for an additional year.
These measures will provide local governments with the resources to meet their operational costs and required remittances to regional districts, regional hospital districts, TransLink and transit authorities, BC Assessment, the Municipal Finance Authority and other taxing authorities. This will ensure that other minor taxing authorities can count on receiving the full amount they bill to municipalities and the Province’s surveyor of taxes before Aug. 1, 2020.
“The COVID-19 pandemic is having significant financial impacts on all levels of government. It’s going to take hard work from both municipalities and the provincial government, but working together we will get through this,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “Many local governments have already shown leadership by taking steps to help people and businesses and maintain services, while addressing their finances. With these new measures, we are giving local governments new tools as a first step to ease their financial burdens and that of businesses in their communities now, and as we look to recovery in the months to come.”Maja Tait, Union of B.C. Municipalities president, said: “Local governments across B.C. are working hard to support the implementation of COVID-19 orders, while ensuring residents have access to the services they need in these challenging times. The measures announced today provide additional relief to small business and will free up funds for local government. UBCM will monitor the impact of these measures on the state of local governments finances, and work with the Province to ensure that local governments have the resources to sustain their communities.”Changes to British Columbia’s property tax framework complement federal measures and build on the $5 billion B.C. COVID-19 Action Plan that provides income supports, tax relief and direct funding for people, businesses and services.Learn More:To learn more about the supports and services available for people, businesses and communities through the pandemic, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/emergency-preparedness-response-recovery/covid-19-provincial-support/financial-benefitsFor information about federal supports for businesses, visit: https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/economic-response-plan.htmlFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/

A new B.C. Business COVID-19 Support Service will serve as a single point of contact for businesses throughout the province looking for information on resources available during the COVID-19 pandemic.The B.C. Business COVID-19 Support Service will be operated by Small Business BC (SBBC), a non-profit organization that is well known and respected by the business community. The service will act as a one-stop resource to answer questions about supports available to businesses from the provincial and federal governments, industry and community partners. “We know that business owners are worried about paying their bills and covering their payrolls, and our government is doing everything we can to help,” said Michelle Mungall, B.C.’s Minister of Jobs, Economic Development and Competitiveness. “There are multiple programs available, including the B.C. government’s COVID-19 Action Plan, to support businesses through these challenging times. I encourage people in the business community to reach out to Small Business BC to learn more.”Throughout B.C. there are over 500,000 small businesses that contribute significantly to B.C.’s communities and economy. To respond to the needs of these small businesses, and all other businesses around the province, SBBC will offer expanded services.Starting on Thursday, April 16, 2020, advisors are available Monday to Friday, from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. (Pacific time) and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at 1 833 254-4357. Inquiries can also be emailed to covid@smallbusinessbc.ca, or raised on the live-chat feature available on SBBC’s dedicated website: https://covid.smallbusinessbc.caSupport is available in multiple languages and a call-back feature will be in place to help manage high call volumes.“The immediate impacts of COVID-19 are being felt by businesses across the province,” said Tom Conway, CEO, Small Business BC. “This new support service will help businesses connect quickly with our existing programs and services, and also learn about the supports being provided by the federal and provincial governments.”SBBC’s dedicated website will include announcements from industry and community partners, as well as a variety of resources, including webinars and practical tools. In addition, SBBC will continue to provide its usual service, like access to expert business advisors, educational services, and free resources in the context of COVID-19.“We’re working closely with businesses and workers across the country to assess and address the impact of COVID-19,” said Melanie Joly, federal Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages, and Minister responsible for Western Economic Diversification Canada. “Our message to them is clear: we’re here for you now with concrete measures, like the B.C. Business COVID-19 Support Service, we’ll be here for you in the days and weeks to come and we’ll get through this together.”Support for businesses and their employees is a top priority for both governments. The support service will provide employers with information on resources available that they can share with their staff.“We know that B.C.’s usually thriving tourism industry has been hit hard by COVID-19,” said Lisa Beare, B.C.’s Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture. “This support service will help B.C.’s tourism sector manage the impacts of this virus and be ready to welcome visitors back to our province, when it is safe to explore B.C. again.”The B.C. Business Covid-19 Support Service is supported by the B.C. government and the Government of Canada through Western Economic Diversification Canada. As the situation evolves, both governments will continue to support businesses and take further action as needed.Learn More:For more information on the B.C.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“We are announcing 44 new cases for a total of 1,561 cases of COVID-19 in British Columbia.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 670 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 623 are in the Fraser Health region, 92 are in the Island Health region, 146 are in the Interior Health region and 30 are in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report three new COVID-19 related deaths, one in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, one in the Fraser Health region and one in the Interior Health region for a total of 75 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“There have been no new long-term care outbreaks in the last day. The 21 affected long-term care and assisted-living facilities have a total of 265 cases of COVID-19.“Fraser Health and the BC Centre for Disease Control continue to provide ongoing support for the outbreak at the medium security Mission Institution (MI) federal correctional centre. There are now 48 cases of COVID-19 associated with MI, including seven people from that facility who are receiving care in hospital.“To date, 955 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 131 individuals are currently hospitalized, 59 of those are in intensive care, and the remaining people are recovering at home in self-isolation.“We have taken a co-ordinated, provincewide approach to our COVID-19 response to ensure the needs that exist within every community are addressed.“One thing that we all have in common is the understanding that Elders and seniors hold and preserve our history and culture. We also know that they are most vulnerable to COVID-19 and we must do all we can to protect them.“We also recognize that every community in B.C. is unique – with different health-care services and required support. Smaller communities have limited health services, which makes managing and responding to COVID-19 all the more challenging.“This is especially the case for many Indigenous communities and why we have been working to increase options for patient care and clinical support.“While self-isolation at home is preferred by many, it is not always possible. As a result, resources have been created to support Indigenous individuals with alternatives – in urban centres and in local communities.“Localized testing capabilities have been established in the Interior and North to shorten testing turnaround times and reduce the potential for community transmission.”“From the outset of this pandemic, we have adapted our response and added new tools to support British Columbians, and we will continue to do so moving forward. What we do today and every day matters.“Let’s continue to work together, to stay strong and flatten the curve.”Learn More:For information on how returning travellers can submit self-isolation plans, visit: gov.bc.ca/returningtravellers  For mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“We are announcing 27 new cases for a total of 1,517 cases of COVID-19 in British Columbia.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 658 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 601 are in the Fraser Health region, 89 are in the Island Health region, 141 are in the Interior Health region and 28 are in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report three new COVID-19 related deaths, two in the Vancouver Coastal health region and one in the Fraser health region, for a total of 72 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“There has been one new long-term care outbreak at the South Granville Park Lodge in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. The 21 affected long-term care and assisted-living facilities have a total of 266 active cases of COVID-19.“Federal officials have confirmed 41 inmate cases of COVID-19 at the medium security Mission Institution (MI) federal correctional centre, with seven of those people receiving care in hospital.“Fraser Health and the BC Centre for Disease Control continue to provide ongoing support for the MI outbreak. We have also deployed our Mobile Medical Unit from the Vancouver Convention Centre to Abbotsford Regional Hospital to provide additional patient capacity and assistance to Correctional Service Canada.“To date, 942 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 134 individuals are currently hospitalized, 58 of those are in intensive care, and the remaining people are recovering at home in self-isolation.“B.C.’s COVID-19 response is about ensuring our firewall is strong, putting out any hot spots that emerge and doing all we can to support British Columbians during this pandemic.“Four years ago, another public health emergency, B.C.’s overdose crisis, was declared. While progress has been made, the suffering and loss continue. This has been further compounded by COVID-19.“We are not slowing down or taking our focus off the overdose challenge, but adapting and continuously adding to our response efforts.“Physical distancing does not mean being alone or without help. From the outset, we have said it is critically important to ensure there are also strong social connections in place. The emergency housing options that have been activated ensure people experiencing homelessness can safely self-isolate with care and support.“We want all people who are living with addiction and other major health issues to know that you are not forgotten but are top-of-mind. There is help for those who need it.“There have been incredible sacrifices made and we want you to know that what you are doing today matters. Your individual efforts make a difference in our shared well-being.“To the many public servants who have stepped up to assist returning travellers at our land and air borders; to our health-care workers who are caring for us; to our teachers and educational assistants working in new ways to educate our children; to all British Columbians; and to the many other essential service workers who are helping British Columbians get through this, day by day, thank you for doing your part.”Learn More:For information on how returning travellers can submit self-isolation plans, visit: gov.bc.ca/returningtravellers  For mental health and anxiety support visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca

The B.C. government has formally extended the provincial state of emergency, allowing Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, to continue to use extraordinary powers under the Emergency Program Act to support the Province’s COVID-19 pandemic response.“Through this challenging time, British Columbians are leading the way in our efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19,” said Premier John Horgan. “We are starting to see the results of our sacrifice, dedication and hard work, and we must continue to be steadfast in our commitment to keep our communities safe – for ourselves, our loved ones and our workers on the front lines.”The state of emergency is extended through the end of the day on April 28, 2020, allowing government to continue to take the necessary steps to keep British Columbians safe.“British Columbians should be proud of the way we have responded to this crisis. But the work is not over,” Farnworth said. “We must hold our ground and take all the steps needed to make sure our communities remain safe and our essential service workers are supported in our ongoing efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19.”Actions taken in the previous two weeks to support British Columbians include:
introducing a new legal requirement to provide a self-isolation plan to support the federal Quarantine Act, and making sure British Columbians returning home from international destinations have the support they need to self-isolate and keep their communities safe from COVID-19;
partnering with the Digital Technology Supercluster and the Business Council of British Columbia to create the COVID-19 Supply Hub, a made-in-B.C. online platform to co-ordinate, find and speed up the delivery of medical supplies and personal protective equipment for provincial health authorities to support front-line health workers fighting COVID-19;
opening applications for the Province’s new temporary rental supplement, supporting renters who are experiencing a loss of income during the COVID-19 pandemic;
announcing $5 million to expand existing mental-health programs and services and launch new services to ensure British Columbians have increased access to vital mental-health supports during the COVID-19 pandemic;
implementing a series of temporary supports and supplements to ensure B.C.’s most vulnerable – including people on income or disability assistance and low-income seniors – do not encounter additional barriers during the COVID-19 crisis;
establishing an Emergency Relief Support Fund for children and youth with special needs and their families that will provide a direct payment of $225 per month to eligible families over the next three months;
issuing new provincial health officer (PHO) guidelines for municipal bylaw officers and other compliance officers to make sure there is compliance with the PHO’s orders and, if necessary, they are enforced consistently throughout B.C. communities; and
partnering with local governments, non-profits and the hotel industry to support British Columbians who need a place to self-isolate and to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including people experiencing homelessness, people without safe spaces to self-isolate and youth.
Actions taken to date build on supports already in place as part of government’s COVID-19 Action Plan, which includes $5 billion in income supports, tax relief and direct funding for people, businesses and services.The extension of the provincial state of emergency is based on recommendations from B.C.’s health and emergency management officials. Farnworth made the original declaration on March 18, 2020, after Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, declared a public health emergency the previous day.The Province has created 1 888 COVID-19 to connect British Columbians needing non-medical information about COVID-19. This includes the latest information on travel recommendations and physical distancing, as well as access to support and resources from the provincial and federal governments. The call line is available seven days a week, from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. (Pacific time), in 110 languages. People with questions related to their health and COVID-19 should call 811.Quick Facts:
Declarations of provincial states of emergency may be issued by the minister responsible under the Emergency Program Act.
The provincial government can extend the period of a declaration made by the minister responsible for further periods of time for up to 14 days at a time.
During the 2017 wildfire season, the province was in a provincial state of emergency for 10 weeks from July 7 to Sept. 15.

Government has temporarily extended hours of retail liquor service in British Columbia to provide greater opportunities for physical distancing for seniors and people who are immuno-compromised.Liquor retailers, such as wine stores or private liquor stores, throughout the province are now allowed to temporarily operate between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. daily, if they choose to do so.These time-limited measures should provide seniors and immuno-compromised populations the opportunity to buy liquor during early shopping hours already being provided by other retailers, such as grocery stores.Extending the hours of retail liquor service will support these businesses in complying with the requirements set out by the provincial health officer, the Ministry of Health and other authorities, including those related to physical distancing.The Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch (LCRB) issued a policy directive that temporarily extends hours of service for licensee retail stores, wine stores, special wine stores and liquor manufacturers with onsite store endorsements, while the Liquor Distribution Branch (LDB) has put into place measures that allow the same operating hours at rural agency stores.Under the temporary directives, delivery services are also authorized to purchase liquor products on behalf of a customer from a liquor store, or any licensee authorized to sell in unopened containers, and to deliver and sell that liquor during these same hours.The new policies are effective immediately and will remain in effect until July 15, 2020. These changes do not override any additional requirements or limitations placed on businesses regarding hours of liquor service by local governments or First Nations.Learn More:For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit:  http://www.bccdc.ca/

To improve travel for commercial truck drivers, the Government of B.C. is funding the installation of portable toilets at several commercial vehicle pull-outs, inspection stations and chain-up locations throughout the province.Commercial truck drivers play an important role in maintaining the supply chain by delivering essential goods during the COVID-19 pandemic. The drivers ensure people around the province continue to have access to the items they need, including food and medicine. This is why it is crucial that commercial truck drivers have safe and clean facilities.Installation of the additional portable toilets began this past weekend, with completion over the coming weeks to provide more options for commercial drivers. Approximately 20 portable toilets have been installed at commercial pull-outs and inspection stations, and the Province will look at adding additional ones in the coming weeks.The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure is also keeping all rest areas open during the outbreak to continue to support the trucking industry. Maintenance contractors are working to keep these facilities clean, sanitary and well supplied. If people encounter less than ideal conditions at any provincial rest area, they are encouraged to contact the appropriate maintenance contractor or nearest ministry office.In order to make sure everyone in B.C. has access to the goods they need, the Province has created a new Provincial Supply Chain Coordination Unit to assist with co-ordinating the distribution of goods and services. The Province has also launched the COVID-19 Supply Hub, a made-in-B.C. online platform to co-ordinate, find and speed up the delivery of medical supplies and personal protective equipment for provincial health authorities to support front-line health workers.Private industry is also stepping up to provide support for these essential transportation workers. Members of the BC Trucking Association have spearheaded the Meals for Truck Drivers BC pilot, setting up food trucks at various commercial cardlocks throughout the province. Restaurants such as Tim Hortons have reopened many locations along Canadian highways for take-out and restroom use for commercial drivers.Vancouver radio station Red FM has contacted the ministry to fund the installation of additional portable toilets in Surrey and Delta to support the commercial vehicle industry. The ministry is working with Red FM to identify locations and co-ordinate installation this week.The ministry is following the advice and orders of the provincial health officer and the federal government to keep British Columbians as safe as possible and help to stop the spread of COVID-19. While highways and roads remain open, the provincial health officer recommends people stay close to home and avoid any non-essential travel.Quick Facts:
There are 203 rest areas in the province, all of which are equipped with toilet facilities. This includes 48 seasonal facilities that are open from early spring to mid-November.
There are also 55 brake checks and 39 chain-up areas to support commercial truck drivers throughout B.C.

A dedicated transit lane now exists in both directions from Fisgard Street in downtown Victoria to the Highway 1-Burnside Road overpass in Saanich, with the completion of the new southbound Douglas Street bus lane.This continuous transit corridor along Douglas Street-Highway 1 was designed to encourage more people to use transit, helping reduce regional traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions.The entire corridor, from Fisgard Street to the south side of the Highway 1-Burnside Road overpass, is approximately 4.4 kilometres long. Of that, the new southbound section runs approximately 2.3 kilometres.The continuous northbound bus-priority lane saves passengers approximately 10 minutes in peak travel times. It is anticipated southbound passengers will see similar time savings.The $16-million southbound Douglas Street Bus Lane project is funded by the Government of Canada and Province of British Columbia, through the Investing in Canada Infrastructure Plan.Learn More:BC Transit reminds riders it is following the lead of health officials when it comes to its response to COVID-19.

All temporary foreign workers (TFWs) arriving in British Columbia for seasonal farm work will be required to self-isolate in government-managed accommodations for 14 days prior to being transported to farms throughout B.C. during the COVID-19 pandemic.The Province will fund hotel and food-service costs during the 14-day self-isolation period – the accommodation will be in the Lower Mainland near the airport and will not be at the farm workplace. The Province is also providing access to socio-economic and cultural supports for workers while they self-isolate.TFWs will need to monitor their conditions during self-isolation – if symptoms like a cough, shortness of breath or fever develop, they will need to call the public health authority or 811.Following 14 days of self-isolation, if no symptoms develop (or once the employee is fully recovered if symptoms do develop), workers will be safely transported to their farm. If TFWs have questions or concerns about their rights, they will be able to contact workplace health and safety offices or employment standards offices.Employers are responsible for paying temporary foreign workers for a minimum 30 hours per week during self-isolation, and at the rate of pay specified on the federal Labour Market Impact Assessment. This is consistent with the TFW program’s genuineness policy, which indicates that reasonable employment needs are a full-time workload (i.e., a minimum of 30 hours per week).TFWs are expected to comply with the orders and recommendations put in place by the provincial health officer as part of the B.C. government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, all farms will need to complete a COVID-19 infection prevention protocol, and be subject to a provincial inspection, before being able to accept temporary foreign workers.Before departing their country of origin, TFWs will be screened by the airline and federal government for COVID-19 symptoms and will not be permitted to travel to Canada until they are asymptomatic.Upon arrival in Canada, TFWs who have travelled to B.C. for seasonal farming work will be screened for COVID-19 symptoms by federal officials (Canadian Border Service Agency and Public Health Agency of Canada). If they have symptoms upon arrival, depending on the severity of their condition, they may be placed in quarantine at the point of entry or be sent to the hospital as per the federal Quarantine Act. If asymptomatic, workers will be sent to a government-managed accommodation to self-isolate for 14 days.Employers with questions should contact AgriServiceBC at 1 888 221-7141 or by email: AgriServiceBC@gov.bc.caQuick Facts:
Every year, approximately 10,000 seasonal farm workers are employed in B.C. through the federal Seasonal Agriculture Worker Program (SAWP).
Approximately 1,000 TFWs will arrive in British Columbia from Mexico in April to perform seasonal farm work through the SAWP. An additional 2,000 to 3,000 TFWs are expected to arrive in B.C. after April.
On April 13, the federal government announced $50 million to help temporary foreign workers arriving to work in the farming, fishing and food production and processing industries put in place self-isolation measures. It allows TFWs an exemption to travel restrictions to Canada provided they can adhere to the 14-day self-isolation period upon arrival. This will support worker salaries while they are self-isolating for 14 days or housing upgrades to meet requirements.
Employees who have concerns about their rights can call workplace health and safety offices or employment standards offices.

Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, has released the following statement in recognition of the fourth anniversary of the declaration of the overdose crisis as a public health emergency in British Columbia:“Four years ago, the overdose crisis was declared a public health emergency. Although we have made important progress and many lives have been saved, there is still an incredible amount of work to do. With the COVID-19 pandemic adding unprecedented challenges, the urgency to protect people who use drugs is greater than ever before.“While the number of overdose deaths declined from 2018 to 2019, there are still countless families reeling from the unfathomable grief of losing a loved one. Now, we are facing a global pandemic on top of a fentanyl-poisoning crisis. People are scared and they feel alone.“That’s why we are working as fast as possible, across government and with all partners, to ensure people living with addiction challenges are supported through both crises.“No one should have to risk their life to get the medication they need. Whether you are visiting a clinic every day for your safe prescription medications, or are reliant on an unpredictable, illegal street-drug supply, following provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry’s orders on physical distancing and self-isolation can feel almost impossible.“That’s why, together with the BC Centre on Substance Use, we recently announced new guidelines so that people can self-isolate to help keep communities safe from COVID-19 and to protect people from overdose, withdrawal or other harms. This guidance is the first of its kind in Canada and outlines how prescribers, patients and pharmacists can now work together to stay safe by delivering medication to patients, using virtual technology for consultations and witnessed injections, and giving patients longer carries of medications. “We are providing emergency housing options so people experiencing homelessness and COVID-19 symptoms can self-isolate. We are expanding access to affordable counselling and virtual mental-health care programs. We are providing crisis supplements to people on income or disability assistance and low-income seniors, and have halted evictions during this emergency and introduced a temporary rent supplement.“The opposite of addiction is connection. Most people who die from an overdose die alone – too consumed with shame and blame to reach out for help. As we face the unprecedented challenge of dealing with two public-health emergencies, connection is now more important than ever – but, out of necessity, it looks a little different.“Some of the services that people who use drugs rely on for connection and community, like overdose prevention and supervised consumption sites, are changing the way they operate during the pandemic to protect both staff and clients. We are working with our federal, regional and local partners to ensure people who rely on these essential health-care services can find them – through mobile-outreach teams, virtual check-ins and by removing red tape, so service providers can quickly set up shop at new locations that meet physical distancing requirements.“We are not slowing down. We will continue to take extraordinary measures to keep people safe from COVID-19 and the overdose crisis.“Every single day, I am awed by the dedication, ingenuity and passion of the thousands of people on the front lines of the fentanyl-poisoning crisis in British Columbia. Every day, they continue to work hard to save lives, connect people with treatment and recovery, and build a system of care that understands the root causes of addiction: from unresolved pain and trauma, to health inequities and economic inequality.“Working together, we will continue to challenge the status quo, empathizing with – not stigmatizing and ostracizing – people living with addiction. I encourage everyone in B.C. to do the same.“In this unprecedented time of two public health emergencies, we must work together to both flatten the curve and stop overdose deaths. We cannot afford to stop caring about one health-care crisis as we stare down another.”

The project to widen and upgrade Highway 13 near the Aldergrove-Lynden border crossing has been completed.These improvements are already helping local traffic and commercial vehicles. International travellers will benefit once current travel restrictions are lifted.There are now two northbound travel lanes and three southbound lanes on Highway 13 near the Canada-U.S. border between 0 Avenue and 8 Avenue. Northbound, a new lane for slower-moving commercial vehicles will improve traffic flow in the general travel lane. Southbound, a new truck lane and an additional future Nexus lane will improve highway capacity for southbound travellers.The additional lanes on Highway 13 will shorten southbound queues during peak travel times. Combined with a new southbound left turn on 0 Avenue, area residents will have better access, which will improve traffic on local roads. Safety improvements for pedestrians and cyclists were added at 0 Avenue.The project includes a new 3B Avenue east-west connection between Highway 13 and 264 Street, with a traffic signal at Highway 13 to provide safe access. Signals have been added to the existing 8 Avenue intersection to improve safety and traffic operations.The Aldergrove-Lynden crossing on Highway 13 is one of five Canada-U.S. border crossings in the Lower Mainland. Highway 13 becomes State Route 539 south of the border, continuing to Bellingham, Wash. On average, 6,000 vehicles use this section of highway each day in the peak summer season.As part of new measures to support the provincial health officer’s travel orders and reinforce the federal emergency order under the Quarantine Act, British Columbians returning to the country through a B.C. border crossing are required to provide a self-isolation plan.The $25.5-million Highway 13 Widening Project was cost-shared by the Government of Canada and Province of B.C.Learn More:Information on the requirement for a self-isolation plan for international travellers upon arrival to B.C. is available online: http://ow.ly/abAX50z9ijVTravel restrictions and precautions due to COVID-19: http://ow.ly/jBGu50yVMROFor guidance to construction sites operating during COVID-19, visit: http://ow.ly/P7WS50z8hNTFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit:  http://www.bccdc.ca/

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are providing case updates for two 24-hour reporting periods: April 11 to 12, and April 12 through to midday today.“In the first reporting period through April 12, we had 25 new cases, for a total of 1,470 cases in British Columbia.“In the last 24 hours, we have had a further 20 new cases, for a total of 1,490 cases in British Columbia.“This represents 45 new cases since we reported on Saturday.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 650 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 591 are in the Fraser Health region, 87 are in the Island Health region, 136 are in the Interior Health region and 26 are in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report 11 new COVID-19 related deaths, four in the first reporting period and seven since yesterday, for a total of 69 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“There have been no new long-term care outbreaks. The 20 remaining affected long-term care and assisted-living facilities have a combined 256 cases of COVID-19.“The BC Centre for Disease Control has joined Fraser Health teams to provide ongoing support for the outbreak in the Mission Institution, a federal correctional centre. The focus is to protect the B.C. public and support efforts to contain transmission within the facility. Federal officials have confirmed 35 cases of COVID-19. Eight people associated with the Mission facility have been hospitalized. These numbers are included in B.C.’s overall case count.“To date, 926 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 137 individuals are hospitalized and 58 of those are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Today marks the 50th time since the start of the outbreak that we have held a briefing to update British Columbian’s on B.C.’s COVID-19 response. We stand together with you and will continue to provide you with daily updates until these briefings are no longer necessary.“We are proud to have seen countless examples this long weekend of British Columbians doing the right thing and doing their part – staying home and away from each other – to protect everyone in our province. “Enhanced border control support measures for travellers returning to British Columbia have been fully activated to ensure everyone is able to fulfill the requirement to self-isolate for 14 days. As of today, 1,701 travellers have been screened. Of those, 13 travellers have been provided accommodation to self-isolate and a further 207 have been contacted for followup support.“British Columbians wishing to donate supplies or offer services are encouraged to use the BC Supply Hub. All donations are closely checked to ensure personal protection equipment for health-care meets medical specifications.”Learn More:BC Supply Hub information can be found online:

As we celebrate Education Week 2020, there’s never been a better time to shine a bright light on the extraordinary work being done throughout our province right now to ensure B.C. kids keep learning.It’s only been a little over three weeks since our government made the difficult decision to suspend in-class learning to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and one week since most school districts returned from spring break. In this short period of time, we have seen B.C.’s education professionals meeting each new day with tremendous innovation, teamwork and perseverance.Over spring break, government worked with all our education partners to develop a common set of teaching, and health and safety, guidelines to ensure education continues to be inclusive, while being safely delivered across all 60 of our school districts.Immediately after spring break, school leaders began connecting with families in their communities to determine the number of essential service workers who need child care so their parents can continue to serve on the front lines of the COVID-19 response. They were also checking in with students who need a meal program, a computer loan, internet access, learning resources mailed or dropped off to their homes, mental health or one-on-one tutoring support.   As educators began personally connecting with students and delivering lesson plans by phone or online, they took their creativity and compassion to a whole new level. There have been so many amazingly innovative ways educators are supporting students to help them stay engaged in the curriculum from home, while ensuring vulnerable students are supported with customized resources. Indigenous teachers are hosting daily K-8 lessons and reading groups online to ensure culturally relevant content is easily accessible for every child in the province. Phys-ed teachers are leading exercise programs to keep kids moving while they’re at home.Support staff are going above and beyond to deliver learning packages or meals to family homes, and bus drivers have stepped up to make sure schools are clean for those who need to be there. Many schools and even some students have started to use their 3D printers to create safety equipment for health workers. Others are organizing the donation of food and supplies, refurbishing laptops or creating local internet hotspots for kids who need the extra support.  These are tremendous efforts, and I’m only highlighting a few of the hundreds of inspiring stories we’ve heard about.  It also speaks volumes about the dedication of parents and guardians in our province that we’re continuing to see great success with the Keep Learning website, which has been updated almost daily with new device-free activities for kids of any age. We are seeing hundreds of thousands of visitors and page views every week to this page: www.openschool.bc.ca/KeepLearning/British Columbian families are pulling together, being flexible, being patient and making things work to help children learn remotely.  We are navigating this new terrain together and we must do our best to support each other’s health and well-being. Every British Columbian has a part to play to flatten the curve. Know that these actions are temporary, and we will return to regular school life down the road. In the meantime, we are committed to keeping communication open with families through this website: www.gov.bc.ca/safeschools/This is where families can find constantly updated FAQs, the latest news releases and information bulletins, available in seven languages.We are so fortunate to have devoted teachers, support staff, principals and vice-principals, trustees and superintendents working collaboratively in our K-12 education system, so our more than 600,000 students can continue learning.This Education Week, I encourage you to share your appreciation to the education professionals who are making a difference in the lives of B.C. children during these unprecedented times.By working together and supporting each other, we will get through this.

Premier John Horgan has issued the following statement in honour of Vaisakhi:“Today, people in B.C. and around the world are celebrating Vaisakhi, the holiest day in the Sikh faith.“While Sikhs celebrate Vaisakhi as a celebration of the formation of the Khalsa over 300 years ago, Hindus mark the day as the solar new year and celebrate it in various forms all over the Indian subcontinent. “These are extraordinary and difficult times. Normally in B.C., this day would be celebrated through worship in the Gurdwaras and big, colourful parades in the streets of communities all over British Columbia. Friends and families would come together to eat, dance and sing.“This year, Vaisakhi events will look different. People will find new ways to celebrate and connect with each other – by video chat, phone or visiting from a safe physical distance. I know spending this day apart from loved ones is very hard. I will miss walking in the vibrant Vaisakhi parades and experiencing the generosity and kindness of the Sikh community. But, now more than ever, we must do everything we can to keep ourselves and others healthy and safe.“The Sikh community has always shown compassion and generosity to those who are struggling. Now, when people around the province are dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, the community is providing free meals to low-income families, supporting seniors in isolation and raising money for workers who have been laid off.“I would also like to acknowledge the national blood drive campaign that the Sikh community is holding with Canadian Blood Services to help save lives. I am deeply grateful for this selfless community service.“Today, and through Sikh Heritage Month, I wish health and happiness to the Sikh community and to all British Columbians celebrating this day.“Vaisakhi Diyan Lakh Lakh Vadhaiyan!”For a Punjabi translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/STM_PJH_Punjabi.pdfFor a Hindi translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/STM_PJH_Hindi.pdfFor a French translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/STM_PJH_FR.pdf

People will now be able to enjoy more music at home, as the Province and Creative BC support musicians impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic with new grants for livestreaming.“Music has the power to lift us up and give us hope in times of crisis,” said Lisa Beare, Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture. “B.C.’s music industry responded swiftly by embracing opportunities to livestream and bring people together online. Today, we’re stepping up to support their efforts.”As a first step to support the music industry, the B.C. government is partnering with Creative BC to launch Showcase BC. This new online hub brings a variety of live performances, entertainment and content to British Columbians, so they can stay connected while staying home.To help B.C. musicians take part in Showcase BC, Creative BC has also opened a new Showcase BC music funding stream. This new program will provide one-time micro-grants of $500 to emerging artists and $2,000 to established artists for livestreaming, songwriting and professional development. Creative BC will offer grants to all previously eligible Amplify BC applicants. British Columbians can access all the grant performances for free through the Showcase BC website and get information on new livestream events by following the hashtag #ShowcaseBC on Twitter.To bring people together, the Province will host a free livestream concert next week featuring musicians from around British Columbia. People will be able to join in and watch the concert online. The concert lineup will be announced soon.Quotes:Bob D’Eith, MLA for Maple Ridge-Mission –“What I've heard from people in the music industry is that live-music venue closures have had a profound and immediate impact on their ability to make a living. I am thrilled that these supports will not only help musicians but will also bring music and joy to people's homes until we can all attend concerts in our communities again.”Prem Gill, CEO, Creative BC –“This program is designed as a quick response by Creative BC to the immediate needs of artists across the province’s music industry. It helps them create, stream and generate revenue, with Showcase BC bringing all of that dynamic content direct to our homes while we do our part to stay home, safe and connected.”Dan Mangan, musician and creator of Side Door –“I think most musicians are doing what they can to lift people’s spirits right now. I’ve been playing interactive online shows each Saturday via Side Door. Getting access to funding to keep the artistic community afloat makes all the difference to me and my peers.”Learn More:Watch livestreaming content from B.C. artists at: https://showcasebc.ca

As we reflect on the past few weeks and the challenges we have all faced together, we are reminded of the importance of connecting and protecting our loved ones, our Elders, our health-care workers and our communities.“This is not the time to travel, unless absolutely necessary. Stay at home and be creative with how you connect and celebrate with family and friends. Find the virtue in virtual and telephone connections. Find togetherness without gathering.“A reminder that while all BC Parks are closed, one can still enjoy some fresh air by going for walks or bike rides with your family in your neighbourhood and remembering to keep a safe distance.“British Columbians coming home from travel are required to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival and complete a self-isolation plan. It is crucial for all of us to stay strong in our commitment to flatten the curve. Consider the support that we can give one another, to our loved ones and in our communities, so we can all succeed in this goal.“B.C. continues to be prepared for the event of a surge in COVID-19 cases. The 271-bed Vancouver Convention Health Centre and 80 new beds at Royal Columbian Hospital and 84 beds at Weatherby Pavilion long-term care home are set up as alternate care sites and ready to be operationalized as needed. This is a critical step to ensure that B.C. is prepared for the worst as we work for the best outcome.“Let’s continue to stand strong – united with kindness and care.”Learn More:For information on how returning travellers can submit self-isolation plans, visit:

From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have regularly seen people choose to wear a variety of masks, from medical masks to cloth face coverings, in grocery stores and parks, on buses and sidewalks.As we all look to protect our loved ones and ourselves, many have asked if this is the right thing to do.What we know about the virus that causes COVID-19 is that it spreads from droplets when people who are infected with the virus cough, sneeze or expel droplets when they are in close contact (within one to two metres) with others. This is why physical distancing is so important and why self-isolation is necessary when we are ill or have recently travelled. This is also why washing our hands, covering our mouths when we cough, and not touching our face or eyes are the best actions we, as individuals, can take during the pandemic.Equally important is the need to reserve medical masks and N95 respirators for our health-care-workers. It is their job to care for us when we are ill and having the correct protective equipment to do that is crucial for them and for all of us.So how do non-medical cloth masks fit in? The Canadian public health special advisory committee has closely reviewed evidence from around the world to answer this question. We now know that some people can spread the virus when they have very mild symptoms or may be unaware they are infected.As Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer, has explained, a non-medical cloth mask or face covering can help you keep your own droplets out of the air and off surfaces. Choosing to wear such a face covering is like coughing or sneezing into a tissue or your sleeve.A non-medical cloth mask or face covering, while helpful in containing your own droplets, will not protect you from COVID-19, nor is wearing one required of you if you can keep your safe distance from others. Moreover, using a cloth mask does not give you permission to disregard physical distancing and self-isolation orders. Indeed, these, along with respiratory etiquette and hand hygiene, remain the key proven measures to stop transmission.Wearing a cloth mask or face covering is a matter of personal choice. It is another tool you can choose, particularly when maintaining that important safe distance can be a challenge.Our most important advice remains the same: if you are sick, you should stay home. Wearing a cloth mask may contain your virus droplets, but it does not make it okay to go out. Maintain a safe distance from others when you are out, clean your hands regularly and avoid touching your face.I applaud the creativity and ingenuity of many who have taken the time to make these cloth masks and it is encouraging to see the social connections that have been made by sharing patterns and creative ideas online.If you choose to wear a non-medical cloth mask or face covering, I remind you of the importance of continuing to not touch your face when wearing it. This is often challenging especially for small children, and of course, be cautious when removing the cloth mask. Wash it regularly and do not share it with others.We want everyone to stand united and stay strong. Every British Columbian has a part to play in flattening the curve. Let’s all be safe, be calm, be kind and do the right thing.Learn More:For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/

Premier John Horgan has released the following statement in honour of Easter:“Christians in British Columbia and around the world will celebrate Easter this weekend.“These are extraordinary times, and Easter celebrations will look different. Instead of gathering in churches or for large family dinners, people will find ways to observe Easter while also protecting their health and the health of those close to them.“Easter reminds us of the values of love and self-sacrifice as exemplified by the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Such values help sustain us through challenging times.“Easter is a time of hope and joy for Christians.

The B.C. government reassures renters they will not be evicted if they cannot pay rent during the state of emergency related to novel coronavirus (COVID-19). As announced on March 25, 2020, the Province has halted evictions during the COVID-19 crisis.To support renters who are facing a loss of income during the pandemic, a new Temporary Rental Supplement (TRS) offers up to $500 a month to help renters pay part of their rent and help ensure landlords continue to receive at least some rental income right now. Qualified tenants will be able to receive supplemental rent support for the months of April, May and June 2020. Full eligibility criteria and application forms for the rental supplement are available online: http://bchousing.org/bctrsThis supplement is in addition to funding available from the federal government and the $1,000 B.C. Emergency Benefit for Workers.There are also existing permanent programs available for seniors (Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters) and for low-income families (Rental Assistance Program).
More information on these programs is available online: https://www.bchousing.org/housing-assistance/rental-assistance 
In response to the challenges posed by the current crisis, there are also programs available from the federal government online: https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/economic-response-plan.htmlWhile the rental supplement is designed to help renters pay their rent during this emergency, renters will be responsible for any outstanding rent owing after the state of emergency has ended.Renters who are not experiencing financial hardship should still pay their rent. Tenants who are able to make even a partial rent payment are encouraged to do so.The people providing rental housing rely on rent payments to pay for their utilities, mortgages and other bills related to the rental property. If renters are unable to pay the full rent or need more time, they are encouraged to inform their landlord and to apply for the supplement and other support programs.To protect both renters and landlords during this time, the Province has frozen rent increases for existing tenants, allowed landlords to restrict the use of common areas by tenants or guests to protect against the transmission of COVID-19, and given renters the right to control who enters their units, except in emergency circumstances. These measures and others are outlined in the March 25, 2020, announcement: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020MAH0048-000561Renters and landlords are encouraged to do their best to come to mutual solutions during the pandemic. People with specific questions should contact the Residential Tenancy Branch.More information about changes in tenancy laws in response to the COVID-19 crisis can be found here: www.gov.bc.ca/landlordtenant/COVID-19For information and supports that are not health-related, call 1 888 COVID19 anytime between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week, or visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19For a French translation: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/FS_Info-for-renters-landlords_COVID-19_FR.pdfFor a Chinese translation: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/FS_Info-for-renters-landlords_COVID-19_TC.pdfFor a Farsi translation: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/FS_Info-for-renters-landlords_COVID-19_FARSI.pdfFor a Korean translation: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/FS_Info-for-renters-landlords_COVID-19_KOREAN.pdfFor a Tagalog translation: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/FS_Info-for-renters-landlords_COVID-19_TAGALOG.pdf

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“We are announcing 34 new cases, for a total of 1,370 cases in British Columbia.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 626 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 508 are in the Fraser Health region, 82 are in the Island Health region, 130 are in the Interior Health region and 24 are in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report two new COVID-19 related deaths, one in the Vancouver Coastal Health region and one in Fraser Health region, for a total of 50 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“There have been no new long-term care outbreaks in the last day, and the outbreak at Villa Cathay facility has been declared over. Vancouver Coastal and Fraser health teams continue to provide support to the 20 remaining affected long-term care and assisted-living facilities, which have a combined 235 cases of COVID-19.“To date, 858 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 132 individuals are currently hospitalized, 68 of those are in intensive care and the remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“To flatten the curve, we must ensure our health system is robust and fully able to address the unparalleled challenges of COVID-19. We must also take care of our front-line workers so they can care for us, protect and support our most vulnerable, and do all we can to keep our firewall strong.“This is a challenging time for all of us – physically, emotionally and mentally – especially when our meaningful connections are virtual connections. There are many resources available and, as the Province announced today, more are on the way. If you are struggling and need help, please reach out.“This holiday weekend is not the time for travel, unless absolutely necessary. Rather, let’s make it an ‘unwind and be kind’ weekend at home. There are lots of things we can do to relax, have fun and connect with family, friends and our local community at a safe distance.“Residents at long-term care and assisted-living homes are very vulnerable to COVID-19. One of the most important things we can do to protect them, and those caring for them, is to make it possible for workers to provide services at a single facility, reducing the risk of virus transmission between facilities.“Using orders under the Public Health and Emergency Programs acts, we have implemented a process to support workers to work at a single facility. This includes development of a new labour agreement that ensures all workers – at health authority, non-profit and private facilities – receive an equitable wage and work-hours scheduling stability so they can work at a single site without disrupting services for residents.“Long-term care and assisted living care-giving and support staff are responding courageously to monumental challenges during this unprecedented time, and deserve our respect and support.”Learn More:To view the new single-site orders, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor all provincial health officer orders, notices and guidance, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceFor the Joint Statement by the Ministers of Health for British Columbia and Alberta, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020HLTH0127-000665To learn more about new mental health and anxiety supports announced today, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020MMHA0009-000655For more information about connecting virtually with loved ones over the long weekend, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020PSSG0019-000671For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit:  http://www.bccdc.ca/

Ever wonder what everyone was doing with all the toilet paper they bought last month?Physical education (PE) teachers in North Vancouver used the bathroom staple to help encourage their students to keep active during the COVID-19 pandemic.Argyle Secondary school’s PE teachers recorded themselves making creative, funny and active use of a single roll of toilet paper. Examples included trick shots, catching a roll with a fly-fishing rod and using a roll as a football with family. The teachers uploaded the video on Youtube and then challenged students to come up with their own ways to use a toilet paper roll to stay active. The teachers say this is the start of weekly video challenges that serve a number of learning purposes. The toilet paper will eventually be used for its intended purpose once the challenge is complete. To view the video, visit: https://youtu.be/c0TP0QiveOU“Students are going through a difficult, uncertain time right now,” said Bryan Lockless, one of Argyle’s teachers. “We, as a PE department, wanted to do something fun to inspire them to be creative, show their learning in new ways, keep connected and have fun with the online physical education challenges we have put together for them.“We can’t wait to see what the students come up with on a weekly basis.”This is one of many examples of leaders in B.C.’s schools coming up with new, innovative and creative ways to reach students while in-person classes are suspended.In New Westminster, students are the stars in an uplifting video. Amy Bothwell, a Grade 5 teacher at Qayqayt Elementary school, wanted to help her students think of new ways to support their communities while in-class learning is suspended.She asked her students to take a picture, or film themselves, doing something that helped others and put together a compilation of everything her students came up with. That video can be seen at: https://spark.adobe.com/video/uKTUUqFwQPViq?fbclid=IwAR26ctBkbSdJ1nheofYE0CKlwO_xjDbX_QVO3tiepvbiQQjeP4Q8XFXbLcw“The students really just took it and ran with it,” Bothwell said. “From putting art in their windows supporting health care workers, to playing songs on a trombone, it really gave the students a sense of community and a sense of connection.“The students were really excited to see their friends again, even if it was just in a video.”The digital world is proving to be a great place for learning and connection.

Over the Easter long weekend, British Columbians are asked to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 by avoiding all non-essential travel, staying home and finding virtual ways to connect and celebrate with family and friends.Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer (PHO), has indicated that the next few weeks are critical in managing this pandemic, so it’s more important than ever to continue to follow public health guidelines and practise physical distancing to prevent further spread. Though the long weekend is normally a time when people go out for recreation, celebration and connection, the provincial health officer is urging British Columbians to stay home to help flatten the curve.Here is some important information and tips that can help British Columbians ensure that everyone can enjoy the long weekend, while following the public safety guidelines set by the provincial health officer.Follow public health orders and guidelinesBritish Columbians are asked to continue to maintain physical distancing, as well as take these other important measures to limit the spread of COVID-19:
Stay home for at least 10 days if you have any symptoms of illness. After 10 days, if your temperature is normal and you feel better, you can return to your routine activities. Coughing may persist for several weeks, so a cough alone does not mean you need to continue to self-isolate for more than 10 days.
Stay at least two metres (over six feet) away from other people outside your household.
Wash your hands frequently with soap and water, for at least 20 seconds.
Avoid touching your face.
British Columbians who are returning from abroad need to prepare a self-isolation plan before returning to the country to keep our communities safe. Guidance for those returning from international destinations is available here: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Factsheet_Returning_Travelers.pdf
Anyone who has friends or family members who are coming home from abroad are encouraged to help them understand the new rules related to COVID-19. Guidance for families of those returning home is available here: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Factsheet_Returning_Family.pdf
 More information for returning travellers is available here: www.gov.bc.ca/returningtravellers
Safely mark holidays and religious observancesAt this time, the PHO is reminding everyone to continue practising physical distancing, avoid large gatherings and stay away from others if ill. That includes religious and other celebratory gatherings that typical take place during this long weekend for Easter, Passover and Vaisakhi.Many faith-based organizations are finding ways to virtually connect to continue to observe occasions in a safe way. Or, look for creative and innovative ways to safely observe the holiday by attending virtual services or using FaceTime, Zoom or Skype to stay in touch with other members of your community.Guidelines for faith-based gatherings are available here: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/covid-19/covid-19-pho-guidance-faith-based-organizations.pdfAvoid non-essential travel and recreationThe transportation network is essential for maintaining the critical supply chain for food, goods and medicine, and ensuring people have access to essential goods and services. There are currently no plans to shut down any of B.C.’s public roads, but now is not the time to travel for tourism or recreation. By temporarily avoiding non-essential travel, British Columbians can do their part to protect vulnerable people in communities from COVID-19.Things to keep in mind over this long weekend include:Don’t visit vacation properties
This is not the time to travel to secondary homes or vacation properties in other communities. It’s not only important stay home and maintain physical distancing, but access to resources and health care may be more challenging in smaller communities if someone should become ill or if there’s a community outbreak. By staying home, British Columbians can take pressure off the already strained resources in these smaller areas.
BC Parks are closed
Finding ways to maintain safe distances has been an ongoing challenge in some of B.C.’s more popular parks and recreation sites. This is why BC Parks has announced an immediate closure of all provincial parks. Also closed are all federal parks, as well as campgrounds and amenities run by B.C.’s Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. Parks will reopen as soon as the provincial health officer indicates it’s safe to do so. 
Keep search and rescue volunteers safe
With the COVID-19 pandemic, there is higher risk for B.C.’s 2,500 search-and-rescue volunteers, as there is a risk of virus transmission during a call to help those who have been lost, stranded or injured in B.C.’s outdoors. With more people staying home, search and rescue calls have dropped by 50%. However, British Columbians are asked to do their part and not to venture into the wilderness at this time.
Things you can do close to homeVirtual visits
Instead of visiting families and friends in person, look for creative and innovative ways to safely connect with friends and family, such as virtual coffee dates and using FaceTime, Zoom or Skype to stay in touch.
Safe recreation
Getting outside for fresh air and exercise is important – so long as family can keep a safe distance of at least two metres from others outside their household.
Some parks and beaches have closed because they’re too busy. There are many other quieter outdoor spaces to enjoy, so long as everyone can keep a safe physical distance.
Being outdoors, walking pets and physical activities, such as going for a bike ride are all safe, so long as a safe physical distance is maintained.
Help elderly or vulnerable neighbours
The PHO is encouraging people to be kind and support each other as much as possible.
Elderly or vulnerable people may need assistance collecting groceries or prescriptions.
Need help? Call 211, a B.C. service that matches seniors with volunteers during the pandemic.
Spring clean but keep donations for now
With everyone staying at home, it’s a great time to do some spring cleaning.
However, with the current physical distancing orders in place, most charities are not currently picking up goods from their donation bins right now.
For now, hold onto your donations. Please don’t leave them around the donation bins.
Protect your home from floods and wildfire
British Columbians should make sure they are prepared for all emergencies, and this time at home is a good opportunity to reduce flood and wildfire risks.
Take time to clean gutters, maintain perimeter drains, clear storm drains of debris, ensure waterspouts are away from residences, and complete some simple landscaping to manage run-off.
Make sure to thin and trim trees, shrubs and other vegetation, and remove dead brush and other flammable material from the property. Also, make sure to use fire-resistant building and landscaping materials.

Les locataires qui doivent composer avec une perte de revenu durant la pandémie de COVID-19 peuvent maintenant déposer leur demande pour recevoir le supplément temporaire pour le paiement du loyer offert par le gouvernement provincial.  « Cette crise impose des pressions sur des citoyens de partout en Colombie-Britannique. Nous aidons les Britanno-Colombiens à traverser cette crise en freinant les évictions afin que les locataires ne perdent pas leur logement. Nous les aiderons à payer leur loyer grâce à un nouveau supplément temporaire, qui assurera une aide financière directe pour la dépense mensuelle la plus importante pour la plupart des ménages, a déclaré Selina Robinson, ministre des Affaires municipales et du Logement. Cette mesure, ajoutée aux programmes provinciaux et fédéraux déjà offerts, offrira aux citoyens le soutien financier dont ils ont besoin de manière immédiate. »Ce programme permettra aux ménages admissibles de recevoir une prestation de 300 $ ou de 500 $ par mois, selon qu’ils comptent ou non des personnes à charge. Les colocataires admissibles seront en mesure de demander ce supplément individuellement.  Le supplément pour le paiement du loyer est disponible à raison d’une prestation par ménage répondant aux critères suivants :
être prestataire ou admissible à l’assurance-emploi ou à la Prestation canadienne d’urgence, ou avoir subi une diminution du revenu d’emploi de 25 % sur un mois en raison de la crise de la COVID-19;
avoir un revenu annuel de moins de 74 150 $ ou de 113 040 $ pour l’ensemble du ménage, selon qu’il compte ou non des personnes à charge;
consacrer plus de 30 % de son revenu brut actuel ou réduit au paiement du loyer; 
ne pas recevoir d’autres subventions pour le paiement du loyer de quelque autre palier de gouvernement que ce soit, qu’il s’agisse d’un logement subventionné ou de prestations pour le paiement du loyer comme le Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters (SAFER) ou le Rental Assistance Program (RAP).
Le nouveau supplément sera offert pour les mois d’avril, mai ou juin 2020. Les locataires admissibles au programme et qui ont déjà payé le loyer d’avril seront toujours en mesure de recevoir une prestation pour ce mois.Ce supplément sera versé directement aux propriétaires au nom des locataires afin de réduire le montant que ceux-ci auront à payer et de faire en sorte que les propriétaires obtiennent un revenu locatif sans délai. Une fois la demande remplie et traitée, les fonds seront déposés directement au bout d’environ sept jours. BC Housing a redéployé des effectifs et mis à contribution du personnel supplémentaire pour s’assurer que les demandes puissent être traitées aussi rapidement que possible. Le supplément pour le paiement du loyer vient s’ajouter au financement déjà offert par le gouvernement fédéral et à la prestation d’urgence de 1 000 $ pour les travailleurs, offerte par le gouvernement de la Colombie-Britannique. Cette mesure s’inscrit dans le cadre du plan d’action de 5 milliards $ contre la COVID-19 pour offrir du soutien au revenu, des allégements fiscaux et une aide financière directe aux personnes et aux entreprises, et pour la prestation de services sur lesquels compte la population.  Le gouvernement de la province a aussi imposé un moratoire sur les évictions et décrété un gel du prix des loyers pour la période de l’état d’urgence sanitaire, et a aussi donné l’autorisation aux propriétaires de restreindre l’utilisation des espaces communs comme mesure de protection contre la transmission de la COVID-19 et accordé aux locataires le droit de contrôler qui entre dans leur appartement, sauf en cas d’urgence.Pour en savoir plusPour de l’information sur le supplément temporaire pour le paiement du loyer et sur les critères d’admissibilité à ce programme, consultez bchousing.org/bctrs ou composez le 1 877 757‑2577.Prenez note que les formulaires de demande en ligne sont en anglais uniquement.  Pour les dernières nouvelles sur le plan médical, notamment le nombre de cas, les mesures de prévention, les risques et les tests de dépistage, consultez www.bccdc.ca ou suivez, sur Twitter, @CDCofBC.  Pour voir les ordonnances, avis et directives des fonctionnaires provinciaux de la santé, consultez www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidancePour de l’information et de l’aide concernant des aspects non liés à la santé tels que l’aide financière, les services de garde d’enfants et le soutien à l’éducation, les voyages, les transports et les services essentiels, consultez www.gov.bc.ca/COVID-19 ou composez le 1 888 COVID19 (1 888 268‑4319) de 7 h 30 à 20 h, tous les jours.

To ensure British Columbians have increased access to vital mental health supports during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Province has announced $5 million to expand existing mental health programs and services and launch new services to support British Columbians. “If you are feeling anxious, stressed, depressed or disconnected because of COVID-19, I want you to know that you are not alone,” said Premier John Horgan. “Our government is working to give you more options for mental health support as we all stay home to prevent the spread of this virus.”Enhanced virtual services will help all British Columbians with mental health needs arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on adults, youth and front-line health care workers. The funding will also increase access for Indigenous communities and those living in rural and remote parts of the province. It will provide more options for people living with mental health challenges who are currently unable to access in-person supports.“I have heard from people right across B.C. about how this pandemic is taking a toll on their mental health,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “Whether longstanding challenges are flaring up or you’re struggling with your mental health for the first time – we’re here for you. We’re working quickly to expand virtual mental health services to ensure that when you reach out for support, someone will be there to help.”The Province is working in partnership with Foundry Youth Centres, the Canadian Mental Health Association – BC Division (CMHA-BC), the BC Psychological Association and other community partners to deliver new and expanded mental health services. These include:
providing more access to online programs for mental health by expanding the BounceBack program. BounceBack provides online coaching and the Living Life to the Full program, which helps people deal with life challenges and learn self-management skills (CMHA-BC);
expanding access to no- and low-cost community counselling programs, including those that serve immigrant and refugee populations, and enabling them to be delivered virtually;
increasing access to online peer support and system navigation (CMHA-BC);
providing virtual supports for youth aged 12 to 24 by making Foundry services available around the province through voice, video and chat (FoundryBC);
providing more online tools and resources to help people assess and manage their own mental health;
supporting front-line health-care workers through a new online hub and providing virtual peer support (CMHA-BC); and
a new online psychological support service for health-care workers (BC Psychological Association).
Existing services are being scaled up rapidly to meet increased need while new services are being implemented. Several services are available and online, while others will come online April 20, 2020. See the backgrounder below for details.The emphasis on virtual support and care will be offered in multiple languages, as well as connect people living in rural and remote communities and Indigenous peoples throughout the province. The Province will continue to collaborate with Indigenous partners to ensure these services are culturally safe and responsive to the needs of Indigenous peoples in rural and urban areas.This funding is in addition to a co-ordinated effort across government to bolster virtual mental health services for children, youth and students related to the COVID-19 pandemic.Quotes:Jonny Morris, CEO, CMHA-BC –“The COVID-19 pandemic is having profound impacts on the mental health of British Columbians, with increased reports of stress, worry, depression, anxiety and loss. This investment will help the CMHA and our partners respond to the growing mental health impacts of COVID-19 through increased access to warm, compassionate and skilled virtual care. It is critical that expanded access to mental health and substance use care is part of the ongoing response to COVID-19. Now, more than ever, we need these mental health supports to reach people, even while we remain physically apart.”Dr. Steve Mathias, executive director, Foundry –“At this unprecedented time, it is even more important for youth and families across B.C. to know where to find the supports and services they need. With the support of the provincial government and our nine Foundry centres, Foundry is moving our services online, starting with drop-in counselling, and then peer support services and physical health care. We’re pleased to be able to provide these services virtually so that young people and families in all corners of the province can get the help they need, when they need it.”

Lesley D Lutes, director of clinical training, department of psychology, University of British Columbia (UBC) Okanagan; director of public advocacy, British Columbia Psychological Association –“On behalf of my colleagues at UBC Okanagan and the BC Psychological Association, we will work tirelessly on this initiative, not only to support direct patient care, but to provide training and support to our mental health colleagues and the next generation of psychologists. We are eager to assist in evaluating new and extended services to ensure that they are both evidence based and delivered to the highest possible level of care. We look forward to developing a meaningful partnership with the Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions, and I want to thank Minister Darcy for her support thus far. Whether it’s mental or physical health, I’m pleased that we are all coming together to put the health and well-being of British Columbians first.”Learn More:For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca

Carole James, Minister of Finance, has issued the following statement on the release of Statistics Canada’s Labour Force Survey for March 2020:“The COVID-19 pandemic has had a serious impact on people and economies around the world. British Columbia is no exception, which is evident in the number of lost jobs in this month’s labour force survey.“We know today’s numbers reflect the initial impacts of the pandemic, and a fuller picture will become clear in next month’s report. This is a stressful time for all British Columbians, but I want people and businesses to know our government is doing everything it can to support them — and together we will get through this.“Our COVID-19 Action Plan builds on the federal government’s economic plan and provides significant support to people and businesses who are worried about paying their bills.“This includes the $1,000 B.C. Emergency Benefit for Workers, relief for renters, a three-month credit for affected BC Hydro customers, as well deferment of taxes for businesses, cutting the school property tax by 50% and additional relief for people and businesses.“We will continue to monitor the impacts of COVID-19 and are committed to doing what it takes to support people and businesses in B.C.“We are focused on delivering on a plan that addresses the critical situation many people and businesses find themselves in today. And we’re working with a new Economic Recovery Task Force and engaging stakeholders in every sector to ensure we have a plan in place for B.C.’s recovery.“We have seen inspiring stories from across the province of people and businesses going out of their way to help others in their community. It is this spirit that will help bring us through these trying times and begin the path to recovery.”

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health for British Columbia, and Tyler Shandro, Minister of Health for Alberta, have issued the following joint statement:“Albertans and British Columbians have deep and historic ties. Many of us have family and friends on both sides of the border and enjoy visiting each other’s province.“A typical long weekend is something we look forward to throughout the year. It’s a chance to spend a little extra time with our loved ones, often in gatherings or on trips out of town.“This long weekend is different. These are extraordinary times. A global pandemic puts us all at risk – and we all must stay home, stay in our communities and stay at a safe physical distance from others when outside.“Spending a holiday away from people we care about is difficult – but what we are doing matters. Together, we are helping slow the spread of COVID-19.“Let us be clear: Staying home means no travelling – especially across our borders. Instead, we encourage everyone to find ways to connect virtually this long weekend, including by video chat or with phone calls.“Thank you all for doing your part, and a special thanks to the many faith leaders who have found innovative ways to virtually celebrate important holidays like Passover, Easter and Ramadan with their congregants. “Please continue to make every effort to protect loved ones, our Elders and our health-care workers.“Now, more than ever, we need you to keep it up.”

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“We are announcing 45 new cases, for a total of 1,336 cases in British Columbia.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 615 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 487 are in the Fraser Health region, 81 are in the Island Health region, 130 are in the Interior Health region and 23 are in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report a further five COVID-19 related deaths in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser health regions for a total of 48 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“There have been no new long-term care facility outbreaks in the last day. Vancouver Coastal and Fraser health teams continue to provide support to the affected long-term care and assisted-living facilities, which have a combined 226 cases of COVID-19.“To date, 838 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 135 individuals are hospitalized and 61 of those are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Flattening the curve is about following the orders and restrictions in place, and equally important, supporting others to make it easy for them to do the same.“Right now, it is critical to stay strong in our commitment to protect our province. We cannot allow for gaps that could set back all the positive efforts we have made so far.“The new requirement for returning travellers to have an approved self-isolation plan is one more tool to help make that happen.“We thank the many volunteer organizations and public servants who have stepped up to enable this important action. Teams will be connecting with travellers at borders and while self-isolating to ensure they have the necessary support that may be required.“All of us need to avoid unnecessary travel, particularly to smaller communities where there are fewer health resources. While many of us have family and friends in Alberta, we must not travel to visit them this long weekend. We need to make the choice to protect our friends and family by staying home and finding virtual ways to connect. Consider the significant impact one step in the wrong direction could have on all of us.“Let’s bend the curve, not the rules and stay safe.”Learn More:For mental health and anxiety support, visit: https://bouncebackbc.ca/

The Province is introducing new measures to make sure British Columbians returning home from international destinations have the support they need to self-isolate and keep their communities safe from COVID-19.The measures, which include a new legal requirement to provide a self-isolation plan, support the provincial health officer’s travel orders and reinforce the federal emergency order under the Quarantine Act requiring people entering Canada to self-isolate for 14 days.“As we welcome British Columbians back home, we must stay vigilant and do everything we can to stop the spread of COVID-19,” said Premier John Horgan. “As we follow the advice and guidance of our provincial health officer, it’s also important to take care of one another. By supporting people through a self-isolation plan after international travel, we will keep people safe and help flatten the curve.”Effective immediately, international travellers (including from the United States) coming to the province are required to provide a self-isolation plan before or upon arrival to B.C., regardless of their point of entry to Canada.This document, which can be submitted online or completed in person on arrival, must show that returning travellers have supports in place to safely self-isolate for 14 days.Beginning Friday, April 10, 2020, provincial officials will be on hand at the Vancouver International Airport and major land border crossings to make sure self-isolation plans are complete and to assist those who need it.Upon border arrival, self-isolation plans will be reviewed by officials, and travellers will be supported as follows:
If a self-isolation plan is submitted and approved, travellers will receive a confirmation. This confirmation can be shown on arrival. Travellers with approved plans will proceed to their home residence (or another identified accommodation) to self-isolate.
If an airline traveller arrives and an adequate self-isolation plan is proposed but needs additional support to execute safely (e.g., enlist volunteers to deliver groceries or fill prescriptions once at home), travellers may be taken or directed to an accommodation site provided in collaboration with the provincial and federal governments to begin self-isolation, while outstanding details of their plan are put in place. With an approved self-isolation plan, they may return home. Without an approved plan, they will remain at an accommodation site for 14 days.
If a traveller arrives at a major land border crossing and needs additional supports to execute a self-isolation plan, they will be sent directly home to start self-isolating and will be followed up with by officials for additional support.
If a traveller does not have a self-isolation plan or is unable to safely carry one out as determined by officials, they may be transported or sent to an accommodation provided by government where they can safely complete their 14-day self-isolation.
Emergency Management BC, through a network of community supports and volunteer organizations, will help travellers with necessary food deliveries, prescription drugs and other supplies so people can safely self-isolate for 14 days.The Province, through Service BC, will follow up with travellers in self-isolation with telephone calls and text messages to make sure people have the support they need to complete their mandatory self-isolation. If required, the Province will work with travellers to modify self-isolation plans to ensure public safety.The federal government will continue to use its authority under the Quarantine Act to ensure compliance with the emergency order requiring individuals entering Canada to self-isolate for 14 days, enforceable by the RCMP. Maximum penalties for breaking the federal emergency order include fines of up to $750,000 and/or imprisonment for six months, or up to $1 million and/or imprisonment up to three years for a person who causes a risk of imminent death or serious bodily harm.Quick Facts:
Self-isolation plans can be submitted at: www.gov.bc.ca/returningtravellers
Self-isolation plans can also be submitted via the BC COVID-19 Support App and Self-Assessment Tool under “travellers.”
24/7 land crossing borders are the Douglas (Peace Arch), Pacific, Osoyoos and Boundary Bay.
Essential service workers who must travel across the border for work must still create a self-isolation plan and self-monitor. However, they are only expected to implement their plan if they develop symptoms. These essential workers include health-care workers, critical infrastructure, trade and transportation workers, airline crews and people making medical deliveries.

Mitzi Dean, Parliamentary Secretary for Gender Equity, has issued the following statement about the Province’s support for women and children experiencing violence during the COVID-19 pandemic:“While people across the province are staying home to stem the spread of COVID-19 and protect us all, for some, home is not a safe place. We know that social isolation is making life harder for women and children who live in unstable or violent situations.“If you reach out for help, we will make sure there is a safe space during this emergency – no matter where you live in B.C.“BC Housing is already working with our partner organizations to support women and children who would otherwise be trapped at home in dangerous situations.“I want to thank all of our partners and the front-line workers who are there for women and children now, and every day. We could not do this work without you. I also want to thank Minister Selina Robinson, BC Housing and Premier Horgan for their leadership on providing supports for people who need them most during this time of crisis.“If you or someone you know is experiencing violence or abuse, please contact VictimLinkBC at 1 800 563-0808 or by email at: VictimLinkBC@bc211.ca“They can connect you to these supports and are available to help 24/7 with service in multiple languages.“Violent and unstable homes are still an unacceptable reality for many people, and during times of crisis, levels of violence can increase.“We may be distanced, but we are united in our work to help keep British Columbians safe. We are in this together, and together, we will get through this.”Learn More:Information is also available on the BC Housing website: https://www.bchousing.org/housing-assistance/women-fleeing-violence/transition-houses-safe-homes

Book lovers of all ages will soon have greater access to online learning and reading resources, thanks to a one-time $3-million government investment in public libraries.“It’s important that people have access to digital literacy programs, ebooks and online learning,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “I am proud to see the innovative ways our libraries continue to support and connect people who want to learn, explore and be entertained through digital resources. This funding will help bring libraries into the homes of families throughout the province.”Libraries can use this new funding to provide enhanced digital and connectivity services by expanding Wi-Fi capabilities, offering community digital literacy training, enhancing online library programs and purchasing technology, such as scanners, tablets, microphones and cameras. Libraries will work together to deliver a provincewide collection of ebooks, magazines and other online services that people will be able to access with their library card.Part of these funds, $1.8 million, will be allocated through the BC Libraries Co-operative to support electronic resource licensing and help expand online common collections for all B.C. public libraries. The additional $1.2 million will be distributed directly to libraries.The ministry has released a new strategic plan for provincial public library services in British Columbia. The plan was developed with library partners and focuses on making sure British Columbians experience library services that are engaging, accessible and responsive to their needs.“Public libraries are an important part our government’s plan to make life better and more affordable for British Columbians of all ages,” Fleming said. “Libraries improve the services people count on and help provide them with the skills they need to succeed as we work together to build a strong, sustainable economy throughout our province.”Libraries provide vital services to British Columbians of all ages so they can have free, equitable access to quality sources of information. Libraries increase opportunities for people to contribute to their communities, reducing inequality to information access, helping close the divide between poverty and opportunity, while helping remove barriers that can hold people back. Public libraries are an important part of the B.C. government’s vision for a province that works for everyone. Quotes:Dana McFarland, chair, BC Libraries Co-operative –“The BC Libraries Co-operative was built to help libraries help people. This funding means British Columbians will have access to more digital content and will enable us to invest in longer-term projects that benefit our communities. We thank the Province and look forward to working together with our members to support people by improving access to public libraries’ online collections and internet through connectivity initiatives.”Scott Hargrove, chair, Association of BC Public Library Directors, and CEO, Fraser Valley Regional Library –“Public libraries play a key role in helping our communities connect to the digital world. This funding is very welcome, especially given the ever-increasing demand on library digital resources. We look forward to supporting innovation in our communities while continuing to work with the ministry on its strategic plan for libraries.”Mike Gagel, president, BC Library Trustees Association, and chair, Prince George Public Library Board –“The Ministry of Education's new Strategic Plan for BC Public Libraries, along with a $3-million one-time grant, demonstrates the government's understanding of the important and unique role that public libraries play in building resilient communities. The plan and the one-time funding to support digital services and infrastructure indicate that the ministry has heard and taken to heart the message from the BC Public Library Partners and our supporters that investing in B.C.'s public libraries is investing in B.C. communities for everyone.”Quick Facts:
Government provides $14 million in annual funding toward operating costs at B.C.'s public libraries.
There are 71 public libraries with 249 branches throughout B.C., serving 99% of B.C.’s population.

The British Columbia Civil Resolution Tribunal (CRT) remains open, and to help people resolve disputes during the COVID-19 pandemic, is extending statutory deadlines and waiving fees for those struggling financially.The CRT, which operates online 24/7, has the authority to resolve disputes involving:
strata property, societies and co-operative associations;
small claims valued at $5,000 and under; and
motor vehicle personal injury cases valued at $50,000 and under.
Recognizing that many British Columbians are struggling with disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CRT will consider extending deadlines for applications and dispute responses upon request. The CRT has extended deadlines for respondents who are impacted by the pandemic until at least May 15, 2020. For this reason, the CRT will not process new applications for default decisions and orders from March 18, 2020, until at least May 15, 2020. A default decision is when the CRT decides in favour of an applicant because the other party did not respond to the dispute by the deadline.Anyone who needs the CRT to consider waiving, suspending or extending a mandatory time period is encouraged to contact the tribunal immediately, with their dispute number and the reason for the request, by email or phone.  The CRT can consider altering timelines only during a declared state of emergency. Once the state of emergency ends, regular deadlines will apply.The CRT waives fees for those who cannot afford to pay them. CRT fees, for items such as filing an application for dispute resolution, adding third-party claims or filing a notice of objection over a decision, range from $25 to $200.People with low incomes do not have to pay CRT fees. If a person cannot afford CRT fees due to a COVID-19 related loss of income, but do not yet fit the fee waiver guidelines, they can contact the CRT with their dispute number and the CRT will consider their request. People can also ask for a fee waiver at any time in the CRT process if their circumstances change.The CRT is monitoring the COVID-19 situation as it progresses and may extend the May 15, 2020, timeline further in the interest of fairness. Further updates will be posted on the CRT website.Learn More:To learn more about the CRT’s COVID-19 response, visit: https://civilresolutionbc.ca/covid-19/To learn more about CRT fees, visit: https://civilresolutionbc.ca/resources/crt-fees/To learn more about CRT fee waivers, visit: https://civilresolutionbc.ca/resources/crt-fees/#what-if-i-cant-afford-crt-feesFor a French translation: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/CRT_FR.pdfFor a Punjabi translation: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/CRT_Punjabi.pdfFor a Chinese translation: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/CRT_TradChinese.pdf

525,2020-04-08 08:30:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020CFD0043-000650,Government Website,Province provides emergency fund for children with special needs,"

The B.C. government is providing a new Emergency Relief Support Fund and has added service flexibility for parents of children with special needs to help during the COVID-19 pandemic.“We have been hearing from families of children with special needs that they are facing a lot of uncertainty right now,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “We want to help, so we’re offering these families emergency funding and allowing more flexibility in our supports. Our government is committed to helping make life a little easier during this unprecedented and very challenging time.”The Ministry of Children and Family Development (MCFD) is establishing an Emergency Relief Support Fund for children and youth with special needs and their families. The fund will provide a direct payment of $225 per month to eligible families over the next three months (to June 30, 2020).Using a needs-based approach, the emergency funding will support 50% more of the eligible families that are currently awaiting services. This payment can be used to purchase supports that help alleviate stress. These could include:
meal preparation and grocery shopping assistance;
homemaking services
caregiver relief support (e.g., funded support to allow a family member to provide temporary care for a child or youth);
counselling services, online or by phone; and
and other services that support family functioning.
Policy guidelines for many Children and Youth with Special Needs (CYSN) services will be more flexible to ensure families continue to benefit from other funding and supports, even as access to many in-person school and community-based services remain limited:
Families with children in care on a special needs agreement or a voluntary care agreement will not have to make monthly maintenance payments for the duration of the pandemic period. This will provide temporary relief to parents who may be struggling with income or housing insecurity related to the pandemic.
Supported Child Development and Aboriginal Supported Child Development programs will be able to extend extra staffing during school hours to help with the reduced availability of school-based services. Children of parents who are essential service providers and need extra staffing supports for their child will continue to receive those throughout the pandemic period.
Eligibility and access to At Home Program medical benefits will be relaxed, and any families receiving benefits will continue to do so without the need for a reassessment during the pandemic period.
Parameters on services purchased with Autism Funding will be expanded, allowing families to use up to 35% of funding to purchase equipment and items that assist in home learning and virtual instructional approaches.
Families may direct their child’s Autism Funding to access family counselling and therapy services with a qualified provider for all age categories accessing the Autism Funding program.
MCFD recognizes that each child and family faces unique circumstances and has unique needs. Families are encouraged to reach out to their CYSN worker to see how they can benefit from emergency help.The Emergency Relief Support Fund is sustained by a $900,000 investment. This is part of government’s $5-billion COVID-19 Action Plan to provide income supports, tax relief and direct funding for people, businesses and services.Quick Facts:
About 30,000 children and youth with special needs access CYSN services.
MCFD provides autism funding to families of more than 16,000 children and youth diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.
There are approximately 275 families with children on a Special Needs Agreement or Voluntary Care Agreement.
Families of more than 6,300 children with special needs access Supported Child Development or Aboriginal Supported Child Development programs.

The B.C. government is restricting camping and motorized recreation (including the use of off-road vehicles) throughout the entire Koocanusa Recreation Strategy area this spring and summer.These restrictions will help prevent environmental damage and ensure orders and guidance from the provincial health officer related to the COVID-19 pandemic are followed.The restrictions will take effect at 1 p.m. (Mountain time) on Wednesday, April 8, 2020, and will remain in place until further notice.Although overnight camping will be prohibited in this area, people may still use designated roads and trails on a day-use basis as long as they adhere to physical distancing guidelines and other restrictions that may be in place.The Koocanusa Recreation Strategy (see link below) contains a map of the Koocanusa Recreation Strategy area.These restrictions are implemented by the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development under Section 58 of the Forest and Range Practices Act, in partnership with the Conservation Officer Service, the RCMP, the Ktunaxa Nation and the Tobacco Plains Indian Band, as well as other local government stakeholders in the region.There have been growing concerns in recent years about unauthorized mudbogging (i.e., operating or racing off-road vehicles in wet earth or mud) on Crown land around the Koocanusa reservoir — particularly in the Dorr Road and Umbrella Beach areas — and its associated impacts on the land and the environment.Specific stewardship concerns due to mudbogging and related activities include:
water and soil contamination;
damage to forest and rangeland habitat;
lack of sanitation and garbage facilities;
public safety;
impacts on archeological and cultural resources;
damage to recreational infrastructure; and
displacement of wildlife.
The Section 58 restrictions are consistent with orders and guidance issued by the provincial health officer under the provincial state of emergency, regarding physical distancing and a prohibition on public gatherings of more than 50 people. In the midst of a global pandemic that has affected hundreds of people throughout this province and neighbouring jurisdictions, British Columbians and visitors from other provinces are urged to follow the advice of public health officials.The restrictions will be enforced by the Province’s natural resource officers, conservation officers and the RCMP, who will conduct regular patrols and educate the public at access points into the area. People who do not comply with the restrictions may be issued a violation ticket for $115 and told to leave the area.The restrictions for the Koocanusa Recreation Strategy area align with the decision by Recreation Sites and Trails BC to close its campgrounds and amenities to gatherings and overnight camping in response to COVID-19.Quick Facts:
The B.C. government has been working collaboratively with the Ktunaxa Nation, stakeholders and local governments for several years on a Koocanusa Recreation Strategy.
The development of this strategy includes the management of camping and trail use in the area.
Mudbogging is not considered a legitimate activity and is neither supported nor included in the Koocanusa Recreation Strategy.

BC Parks is immediately closing all provincial parks in response to the widespread call for increased action to address COVID-19.The closure responds to both the federal and provincial directives that people should stay close to home to reduce COVID-19 transmission risk. This temporary measure means people should not be going to provincial parks until further notice.“Because physical distancing works, it is critical that we take every action needed to restrict the spread of COVID-19. This applies to British Columbians and out-of-province visitors who were planning to visit or stay at our provincial parks. The message is clear: stay home, avoid travel, do not put yourself or others at risk,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy.“I understand and share the love people in British Columbia have for the outdoors and the connection between health and proximity to nature. We tried to provide safe space for people to get some exercise and fresh air in our beautiful parks. But it has proven too challenging to maintain safe distance between visitors. This action is difficult but necessary. We look forward to the day we can welcome people back to our wonderful parks.”The decision to close the park system is informed by continued feedback from RCMP, local government, First Nations, local search-and-rescue organizations and the general public. While many people are observing the physical distancing requirements set by the provincial health officer (PHO), some continue to ignore the order, making enforcement in a wilderness setting challenging.The timing of this decision is important given the upcoming long weekend and the beginning of the busy season for outdoor recreation and camping. BC Parks is also extending the ban on all camping in provincial parks until May 31, 2020, in alignment with neighbouring jurisdictions and the temporary closure of Canada’s national parks. Refunds for bookings up to May 31 will be sent automatically.As previously announced, the Recreation Sites and Trails BC (RSTBC) branch of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development has also closed its campgrounds and amenities in response to the COVID-19 situation.BC Parks has taken a scaled and phased in approach to limiting park access following PHO requirements and the latest COVID-19 transmission data. BC Parks recognizes the value of nature in contributing to public health and wellness and will expand access to the park system as soon as the PHO indicates it can be done without increasing the risk of COVID-19 transmission.Learn More:Any change to provincial park access or services will be posted to the BC Parks website: http://bcparks.caFor status updates on RSTBC campgrounds, visit:

Instead of gathering in person tonight for the seder, generations of family will find other ways to connect with each other, including by video chat, phone call or visiting from a safe physical distance. No matter how they choose to celebrate, many people will still enjoy food, wine, song and the retelling of the Exodus, when Israelites broke free from slavery in ancient Egypt.“I know spending this holiday apart from family and friends is difficult. But now, more than ever, we must do everything we can to keep ourselves and others healthy and safe.“The Passover holiday is a celebration of hope and optimism and reminds us to always fight for a better world. There is no better time than now for us to remember what we can overcome when we work together.“To everyone in the Jewish community who is celebrating tonight and for the next eight days, I wish you Chag Pesach Sameach!”For a French translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Passover-2020_FR.pdf

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“We are announcing 25 new cases, for a total of 1,291 cases in British Columbia.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 603 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 458 are in the Fraser Health region, 79 are in the Island Health region, 128 are in the Interior Health region and 23 are in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report a further four COVID-19 related deaths in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser health regions for a total of 43 deaths in British Columbia. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“There have been no new long-term care facility outbreaks in the last day. Vancouver Coastal and Fraser health teams continue to provide support to the affected long-term care and assisted-living facilities, which have a combined 213 cases of COVID-19.“To date, 805 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 138 individuals are hospitalized, and 66 of those are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“Starting tomorrow and over the coming days, British Columbians of many faiths, along with millions around the world, will be celebrating major religious holidays in ways that many have never experienced before.“B.C.’s faith leaders have taken the challenge of maintaining physical distance to heart and are using these holidays as an opportunity to reinforce our commitment to showing kindness and care for our communities.“We call on faith leaders, followers and congregations to pay special attention to our Elders and seniors to ensure we protect them by connecting safely from a distance.“We know many people must manage chronic diseases and other health issues. We encourage people to continue to connect with their primary care provider or family physician for ongoing care. Phone and virtual resources are available for everyone.“This long weekend, we need to stay home, to stay in our communities and to stay at a safe physical distance from others when outside. Avoiding unnecessary travel, particularly to smaller communities, where they may be unable to support you if you get sick and where they have fewer resources, is an important way we can protect ourselves and our loved ones.“Let’s continue to stand united, to stay strong and do all we can to flatten the curve.”Learn More:For mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca

Effective at noon (Pacific time) on Thursday, April 16, 2020, most open burning activities will be prohibited throughout British Columbia to reduce the likelihood of human-caused wildfires, although campfires will still be allowed.The following activities will be prohibited, and these restrictions will remain in effect until the public is otherwise notified:
Category 2 open fires;
Category 3 open fires;
Resource Management open fires;
the use of fireworks;
the use of sky lanterns; and
the use of burn barrels or burn cages of any size or description (except when used for a campfire).
These prohibitions apply to all public and private land within British Columbia, unless specified otherwise (e.g., in a local government bylaw). Check with local government authorities for any other restrictions before lighting any fire. A poster explaining the different categories of open burning is available online: www.gov.bc.ca/openfireregsA map of the affected areas is available online: http://ow.ly/8uct30qvSv2COVID-19 and wildfire responseThese open burning prohibitions will reduce demands on firefighting resources and help protect the health and safety of the public, as well as BC Wildfire Service staff. They will also help reduce the impact of wildfire smoke on air quality and public health during the COVID-19 pandemic.A strategic deployment of wildfire management resources is critical this fire season, so it is especially important to reduce the number of unnecessary, human-caused wildfires. It is vital BC Wildfire Service staff remain healthy to respond to wildfires throughout the 2020 season and ensure the BC Wildfire Service’s response capability is not affected.During the current pandemic, larger open burns pose an unnecessary risk and could detract from wildfire detection and response capabilities. The open burning prohibitions coming into effect on April 16 should decrease the number of false alarms (where firefighters respond to a report of smoke, only to find the smoke is coming from a controlled burn and not from a wildfire).These open burning prohibitions also support the BC Centre for Disease Control’s recommendation to help reduce excess air pollution in airsheds throughout the province.EnforcementEnforcement of fire prohibitions is undertaken by:
the Compliance and Enforcement Branch of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development;
the Conservation Officer Service; and
the RCMP.
All illegal fires will be investigated, and charges may be laid under the Wildfire Act or Wildfire Regulation, depending on the outcome of the investigation.Anyone found in contravention of an open burning prohibition may be issued a violation ticket for $1,150, required to pay an administrative penalty of $10,000 or, if convicted in court, fined up to $100,000 and/or sentenced to one year in jail. If the contravention causes or contributes to a wildfire, the person responsible may be ordered to pay all firefighting and associated costs.To report a wildfire, unattended campfire or open burning violation, call 1 800 663-5555 toll-free or *5555 on a cellphone.For the latest information on current wildfire activity, burning restrictions, and air quality advisories, go to: http://www.bcwildfire.ca  Follow the latest wildfire news:

To support British Columbians who need a place to self-isolate and to reduce the spread of COVID-19, the Province is partnering with local governments, non-profits and the hotel industry.So far, more than 900 spaces have been secured at 23 sites including hotels, motels and community centres throughout B.C.“These new spaces are a critical part of how we can support those who are vulnerable in our community, including those who are experiencing homelessness or living in communal locations where the virus could spread more quickly,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “In partnership with health authorities and local government, these new spaces are helping us mitigate the effect of this virus and support our health-care system in communities across the province.”These new rooms and community centre beds are assisting a range of people, including people experiencing homelessness, people without safe spaces to self-isolate and youth.In addition, some hotels are reserved specifically for people who have COVID-19 and need a place to self-isolate while they recover. Other spaces are for patients being discharged from hospitals who do not have COVID-19 and who do not need emergency care, but still require ongoing health care – freeing up much needed beds in hospitals.Health authorities are identifying those who require self-isolation and working with BC Housing to refer people to hotel rooms or community centres. Some of these facilities are already operational, while the others are expected to be ready in the coming days and weeks. In addition to the more than 900 spaces secured to date, more rooms have been identified in communities throughout the province to be able to expand capacity if a need is identified by health authorities.Non-profit societies who have significant experience working with vulnerable populations will oversee the day-to-day management of the hotels, motels and community centre spaces. Staff will be on site regularly and will provide daily meals and cleaning services. When required, health-care workers will also provide on-site care to ensure people are getting the medical attention they need.This initiative is part of the Province’s efforts to stop the spread of the virus and protect vulnerable people, by ensuring those who need it have the space to self-isolate when they need to.  Learn More:For the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are providing case updates for two 24-hour reporting periods: April 4 to 5, and April 5 through to midday today.“In the first reporting period through April 5, we had 26 new cases, for a total of 1,229 cases in British Columbia.“In the last 24 hours, we have had a further 37 new cases, for a total of 1,266 cases in British Columbia.“This represents 63 new cases since we reported on Saturday.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 586 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 450 are in the Fraser Health region, 79 are in the Island Health region, 128 are in the Interior Health region and 23 are in the Northern Health region.“There have been 39 COVID-19 related deaths in British Columbia. We are saddened to report that we have had a community death of a known COVID-19 case in the Vancouver Coastal health region. The BC Coroners Service is investigating, as is the process for any sudden unexpected death that takes place in community. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“The Vancouver Coastal and Fraser health regions continue to respond to outbreaks and new cases in long-term care and assisted-living facilities, which have a combined 210 cases of COVID-19. Residents in these facilities are our most vulnerable citizens, and efforts to protect them continue to be a major focus of our health teams. Vancouver Coastal Health has one new long-term care facility outbreak, while three outbreaks at long-term care homes in that region have been declared over.“A new community outbreak of COVID-19 has been detected at a federal correctional centre in Mission. Correctional Service Canada has implemented outbreak response protocols at the facility.“To date, 783 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer require isolation.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 140 individuals are currently hospitalized, 72 of those are in intensive care. The remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“While it is encouraging to see the overall rate of new cases in British Columbia in the last few days levelling, we also continue to see new outbreaks in the community and with vulnerable individuals.“These hot spots are very concerning, as they can quickly escalate and further challenge our health system – something we have seen in many other parts of the world.“We must all work to ensure our firewall stays strong and remain united in our efforts to hold the line.“British Columbians can help to flatten our curve and protect our communities by staying home as much as possible, continuing to follow physical distancing measures when out, and importantly, continuing to support loved ones and others in our communities.“We recently made a call for British Columbians to donate blood. Volunteers in the Sikh community stepped up in response to our appeal. The Sikh Nation Blood Drive is the largest of its kind in Canada, and it is working with Canadian Blood Services to launch a new blood drive. We thank them, and the many British Columbians who have responded to that call, for their generosity.“As travellers return, we welcome you home to join us and do your part by following provincial and federal orders to immediately self-isolate for 14 days.“Let’s continue to make a 100% commitment to breaking the chain of transmission.”Learn More:For mental health and anxiety support, visit: www.bouncebackbc.ca

The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure plans to tender repair work for a section of Highway 14 at Parkinson Hill, just east of Port Renfrew, in the coming weeks.People using Highway 14 in the Port Renfrew area are advised that significant repairs are required, with overnight highway closures necessary during construction.The highway has been reduced to a single lane of traffic since November 2018 after a significant rainfall resulted in a slope failure. The current plan to address the slope failure is to first build a 220-metre-long retaining wall, followed by significant deep road-base repairs along a 500-metre section of Highway 14.The work will be done overnight to minimize the impact to traffic. The ministry intends to close Highway 14 between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. nightly, except for Saturday and Sunday nights, for a duration of about six months while the retaining wall is built. Similar closures would also be required in early 2021 as the road-base repairs are completed. During these closures, accommodations will be made for emergency access.The ministry is advising key area stakeholders of project details, including First Nations, local governments and emergency services.The project will go to tender in the coming weeks. With a successful tender, construction could begin this summer, with completion by March 2021. Further details and the final traffic management plan will be made available to the public prior to the start of construction.

When an outbreak hits a community, one of the most urgent things people want is information. This is human nature, as information allows us to protect ourselves, our families and our loved ones.Information is at the heart of public health: knowing what our risks are, where they are coming from and who is affected. One of the key ways we gather information is through active contact tracing, when public-health teams map the transmission, alert those at risk and close the circle to break the chain.Public-health protocols also dictate that when the potential for transmission is unknown, we must immediately alert the public. From the very beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in B.C., we have been doing exactly that – alerting people to the risks within communities through regular briefings and connecting with individuals who are close contacts. When we cannot close the circle, we open the circle.Public health is boots-on-the-ground health care, which means teams work to connect with each and every person who may be at risk of exposure to COVID-19. We do this to provide individual support and, equally important, to continue to follow the transmission trail.Initially, public-health teams identified the source of transmission was from travellers. That is why our briefings listed travel locations and cruise ships. With that information known, we were able to put precautions in place.However, as we have seen here in B.C. and globally, once there is community transmission, there is no boundary to the spread of COVID-19. Simply put, the risk is everywhere.It would be irresponsible to mention only a few communities and give people outside those areas a false sense that they are not susceptible or at lower risk. Every health region in British Columbia has people with COVID-19. Every community and home town – no matter how large or small – is at risk.As we notify the public about COVID-19 cases, we have been careful about how much we disclose about the personal details of people who were potentially exposed and the specific location of confirmed cases. This is because, as with many communicable diseases, there is still very much of a stigma associated with infection.We want people who have symptoms to contact us and to feel safe contacting us, knowing their personal information will be protected. This is important to everyone. It allows public-health teams to do the work they need to do to keep all of us safe.So, while I understand the desire to know and understand what the COVID-19 situation is in your community, I need to emphasize that knowing where the positive cases are does not protect you, your family or your community. The actions you take will do that.No one is immune from this disease, but everyone can make a difference. Every British Columbian has a part to play to flatten the curve.Wash your hands, do not touch your face, stay home if you are ill, and stay apart with physical distancing.

Greenhouse operators can now apply for carbon tax relief grants for the 2020 production year, until May 1, 2020.Commercial producers in B.C. who grow vegetables, ornamental flowers and plants, forest seedlings and nursery plants are eligible to apply for the grant if they:
had sales exceeding $20,000 in 2019;
used natural gas or propane to heat their greenhouses or produce carbon dioxide; and
had a production area greater than 455 square metres.
The grant covers up to 80% of the carbon tax that commercial greenhouse growers of eligible crops paid on the natural gas and propane they used for greenhouse heating and carbon-dioxide production in 2019. Cannabis is not an eligible crop at any phase of production.Greenhouse growers supply communities with fresh vegetables for about 10 months of the year. In 2018, nearly 120,000 tonnes of vegetables were grown in greenhouses, including tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, eggplants and lettuce. In addition to vegetable growers, B.C.’s floriculture and nursery industries grow more than 80 million greenhouse flowers and cuttings and produce approximately 50 million potted plants a year.Learn More:Application information and eligibility criteria are available here: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/agriculture-seafood/programs/greenhouse-carbon-tax-relief-grant

As part of British Columbia’s emergency novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response plan, the Province is partnering with the BC Care Providers Association (BCCPA) to launch EquipCare BC to help seniors in long-term care and assisted living homes.EquipCare BC is a new program that will provide $10 million to enhance infection prevention and control, and improve quality and safety in long-term care and assisted living homes throughout the province.“Seniors and residents of long-term care and assisted living homes are the most vulnerable due to complications associated with COVID-19,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “Our goal is to ensure that both residents and health-care workers are protected to the maximum extent possible.”More than 240 long-term care homes and more than 200 assisted living homes in B.C. will be eligible for funding to support increased infection prevention and control measures in their homes. Funds may be used to buy items, including outbreak carts and mobile hand-hygiene sinks, touchless towel and soap dispensers, and safe handling equipment for waste and laundry.“We are committed to protecting our seniors and elders during this critical time of COVID-19,” said Ronna-Rae Leonard, Parliamentary Secretary for Seniors. “This program will further equip long-term care and assisted living residences with the tools to enhance safety measures for seniors and caregivers in these residences.” BCCPA will administer the program and accept applications from facilities beginning on Saturday, April 4, 2020. The program will initially focus on supporting infection prevention and control through to the end of summer to address immediate needs related to COVID-19. Following this, the focus of the program will shift to funding for safety and quality improvements in publicly funded facilities.“With this new funding, we can move swiftly to get these important protections against the spread of COVID-19 in our care homes and assisted living residences,” said Daniel Fontaine, CEO, BCCPA. “Operators can expect to receive funding within weeks of a completed application. Not only will EquipCare BC be an efficiently run program, but it will continue to improve workplace safety and quality of life for seniors in care.”Oversight for EquipCare BC will be provided by a group of industry stakeholders and government, including representatives from BCCPA, SafeCare BC, Denominational Health Association and the Ministry of Health. An additional appointment to the oversight committee will include a provincial representative with expertise in infection prevention control.Further information about EquipCare BC will be posted here: www.bccare.caThe launch of EquipCare BC supports additional actions in place to protect seniors from the risks of COVID-19. In addition, the Province is providing the United Way of the Lower Mainland with $50 million to increase seniors’ supports at community service agencies throughout British Columbia.Quick Facts:
In 2019, 20% of B.C.’s population was 65 or over; in 15 years, this is expected to rise to 25%.
EquipCare BC expands the mandate and scope of the Seniors Safety Quality Improvement Program (SSQIP).
SSQIP funded $10 million of safety and quality improvements to 99% of eligible long-term care operators in B.C.
Through the program, operators purchased more than 8,000 new items, including beds and mattresses, shower chairs and tubs, mobility equipment, lighting and visual aids, sensory rooms, music therapy and ergonomic furniture.

Indigenous post-secondary students experiencing financial pressures will benefit from additional provincial emergency funding.Government is providing an additional $1.5 million to supplement the Indigenous Emergency Assistance Fund, which assists Indigenous students who are experiencing an unexpected financial emergency that may affect their ability to finish their studies. Support is available through all 25 public post-secondary institutions in B.C., as well as Native Education College (NEC).“Our government is increasing emergency financial assistance for Indigenous students to ensure they have the necessary funds to focus on staying heathy, meeting their educational goals and finishing their semester,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “By supporting Indigenous students to succeed, we are doing our part to implement article 23 of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action.”In addition to emergency living expenses like groceries, cell phone bills and childcare, the fund supports Indigenous learners through other unanticipated expenses like medical, dental and optical costs, and travel costs for family crisis or community obligations.“These additional emergency funds to support B.C.’s Indigenous students are vital right now,” said Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. “No one should have to choose between an education and survival, and these emergency funds will help Indigenous students complete their studies with a better sense of well-being.”Students who access the emergency funding do not have to repay it. Indigenous students can contact the Indigenous Student Service Centre on campus, which will help with the application process to receive the financial assistance.Since 2017, $1.1 million has been provided to the Indigenous Emergency Assistance Fund with more than 3,700 Indigenous students accessing the fund in that time frame. The funding supports the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 21.1 and 21.2, and the Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada 23.i.Quick Facts:
The Indigenous Emergency Assistance Fund was launched in 2012 after research showed that having access to emergency relief funds was indispensable to the success of many Indigenous learners, allowing them to complete their studies.
The federal government has also announced $305 million for a new distinctions-based Indigenous Community Support Fund to address immediate needs in First Nations, Inuit and Métis Nation communities across Canada.

Drivers are reminded that winter tire regulations remain in place until April 30, 2020, on many highways to account for early spring snowfall.The ministry is following the advice and orders of the provincial health officer and the federal government to keep British Columbians as safe as possible and stop the spread of COVID-19. While highways and roads remain open, the provincial health officer recommends that people stay close to home and avoid any non-essential travel.Winter tire regulations are currently in effect for most B.C. highways so people should ensure their vehicle is equipped with tires with the mountain/snowflake or mud and snow (M + S) symbol when travelling on designated routes.Tires must be in good condition and have a minimum tread depth of 3.5 millimetres. For rural highways and mountain passes, tires with the mountain/snowflake symbol provide the best traction and handling.Last winter, the regulations were extended to April 30 from March 31 on select highways, most of which are located in the Interior and northern parts of the province. Road conditions can change quickly and snowfall is still possible in these regions.While maintenance crews strive to keep routes safe and in the best possible condition, people must use caution and slow down when they encounter bad weather or limited visibility. Driving to current conditions will improve safety for everyone on the road.Crashes can be prevented when people are prepared. Here are some helpful tips for travelling in winter driving conditions:
Check the weather forecast and adjust travel times to more favourable conditions, or choose alternative routes.
For current road conditions, check DriveBC before leaving, as well as the nearly 800 highway webcam views available at more than 400 locations throughout B.C.
Wear comfortable clothing that does not restrict movement while driving, but bring warm clothing (winter boots, coat, gloves and hat) in case getting out of the vehicle is required. 
Have an emergency plan. Ensure the vehicle has a full tank of gas and is equipped with a windshield scraper and snow brush, food and water, a first-aid kit and other emergency supplies.
If stuck or stranded, do not panic. Stay with the vehicle for safety and warmth and if a cellphone is available, call for roadside assistance. If there is an emergency, call 911.
Heavy snowfall or rapidly warming spring temperatures can increase the risk of avalanches in some areas. This can cause temporary highway closures while ministry avalanche experts ensure safe conditions. During these times, obey all traffic control personnel.The Sea to Sky Highway in the Lower Mainland and the Malahat on Vancouver Island are not included. Winter tire regulations were lifted on those routes on March 31.For non-health related information and supports, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19

There have been 31 COVID-19 related deaths in British Columbia. The majority have been residents of long-term care. We offer our condolences to everyone who has lost their loved ones.“A new community outbreak of COVID-19 has been detected with an inmate in a correctional centre in the Interior Health region. BC Corrections has implemented response protocols and the inmate has been isolated.“The Provincial Health Services Authority, which is responsible for health care in B.C.’s correctional centres, is working with the Interior public health team to investigate and undertake contact tracing.“There have been no new reported cases in long-term care and assisted living facilities in the last day.“Residents at long-term care and assisted-living homes are very vulnerable to COVID-19. One of the most important things we can do to protect them, and those caring for them, is to make it possible for workers to provide services at a single location, reducing the risk of transmission between facilities.“We are working diligently with unions and employer groups to do this, while ensuring that these workers are at least ‘made whole’. They are responding courageously to monumental challenges during this unprecedented time and deserve our respect and support.“To date, 641 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer have isolation requirements.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 149 individuals are hospitalized, 68 of those are in intensive care, and the remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“We continue to see patients with serious illness requiring hospitalization for COVID-19. This tells us that the risk remains high for everyone in British Columbia.“Without exception, all travellers returning to Canada must immediately comply with the federal government's quarantine order and isolate for 14 days.“Each of us must also continue to follow good hand hygiene, stay home as much as possible and stay apart with physical distancing.“In the coming weeks there will be a number of major religious celebrations on the calendar. Just as we have seen around the world, we call on our faith leaders to postpone all in-person gatherings and use the many tools we have available to connect and celebrate with followers in other ways.“We must stand united and working together, we must follow the orders and precautions we have in place, and we must do all we can protect our province.”Learn More:For more information on the COVID-19 ethics framework, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-professionals/clinical-resources/covid-19-care/ethicsFor the latest medical updates, including case counts, prevention, risks and testing, visit:  http://www.bccdc.ca/

A new Economic Recovery Task Force will bring together leaders from business, labour, First Nations and not-for-profits to help ensure the Province’s economic response to COVID-19 is effective and responsive to the needs of British Columbians.“COVID-19 is not only a public-health challenge, but also an economic one. People and businesses urgently need support,” said Premier John Horgan. “We will be there to protect people’s health and give immediate relief during the crisis. This task force will help us keep in close contact with community leaders to ensure the steps we are taking now are working and to plan for a long-term economic recovery after the crisis has passed.”  The task force, which will help advise the cross-government economic response to the COVID-19 crisis, will take the form of a weekly conference call between Premier Horgan; Carole James, Minister of Finance; Michelle Mungall, Minister of Jobs, Economic Development and Competitiveness; other members of cabinet and leaders from business organizations, including the Business Council of B.C., BC Chamber of Commerce, Vancouver Board of Trade, Surrey Board of Trade, the BC Federation of Labour, First Nations organizations and the not-for-profit sector. After an introductory conference call last week, the task force will begin its work starting Thursday, April 2, 2020.The task force will help ensure the benefits of provincial programs are reaching their intended targets and complement federal programs, and discuss ways to ensure the best possible information is available to workers and member organizations. It will also explore issues around the designation of essential and critical services; child care and other supports for essential workers, and safe workplace operations for businesses operating now, as well as those restarting after the crisis. Importantly, the task force will begin to discuss long-term economic recovery following COVID-19. It will provide participants the opportunity to advise government on economic impacts in their sectors and solutions for long-term economic recovery. “COVID-19 is a huge challenge, but British Columbians can be assured their government has their back – and together we will get through this,” Premier Horgan said.

To ensure B.C.’s most vulnerable – including people on income or disability assistance and low-income seniors – do not encounter additional barriers during the COVID-19 crisis, the Province is implementing a series of temporary supports and supplements.“We are putting in place measures that complement the federal crisis measures to support our most vulnerable populations and ensure they do not fall deeper into poverty as a result of COVID-19,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “This is a stressful time for everyone, but for those struggling to put food on the table at the best of times, it is important that we ensure there are no additional barriers to get what they need to keep themselves and their families safe and healthy.” For people in B.C. currently receiving income assistance or disability assistance, the Province will temporarily exempt federal employment insurance benefits, including the new $2,000 Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB). These payments will be fully exempted for the next three months so people receiving income assistance and disability assistance in B.C. will benefit from these new emergency federal support programs, without any reductions to their monthly assistance payments.  For everyone on income assistance or disability assistance who is not eligible for the emergency federal support programs, including the CERB, the Province will provide an automatic $300-monthly COVID-19 crisis supplement for the next three months. This supplement will also be provided to low-income seniors who receive the B.C. Senior’s Supplement and recipients of income assistance or disability assistance who reside in special care facilities.With the current provincewide suspension of BC Transit and Translink bus fares, the Province will also provide all BC Bus Pass Program users receiving income assistance and disability assistance with the $52 Transportation Supplement for the duration of the fare suspension. This will be included on the next cheque and for each subsequent month while the fare suspension remains in place.Existing Compass passes under the BC Bus Pass Program will not be cancelled and will remain active during this time, so people will not need to reapply for bus passes in the future. This will also ensure people can still use SkyTrain and SeaBus services that are still charging fares. There is no change for eligible low-income seniors who will continue to have an active bus pass provided by the BC Bus Pass Program.These interim measures further complement government’s $5-billion COVID-19 Action Plan to provide income supports, tax relief and direct funding for people, businesses and services.To further support vulnerable people, the Province recently provided a $3-million emergency grant to Food Banks BC to distribute among food banks provincewide. The grant will support immediate needs to buy and distribute food, pay employees and cover other costs essential to the delivery of their food programs.Recognizing that vulnerable people in different circumstances face distinct risks, the provincial Vulnerable Population Working Group continues to identify, assess and address the immediate challenges faced by five specific groups – people living on the street, people experiencing homelessness living in encampments, shelter residents, tenants of private single-residence occupancies and tenants in social and supportive housing.This working group includes representatives from the ministries of Municipal Affairs and Housing, Social Development and Poverty Reduction, Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation, Mental Health and Addictions, Children and Family Development, Health, Public Safety and Solicitor General, Finance, Attorney General, as well as Emergency Management BC, the City of Vancouver, the Office of the Provincial Health Officer, BC Centre for Disease Control, First Nations Health Authority, Provincial Health Services Authority, regional health authorities, BC Housing and Community Living British Columbia.Reducing poverty is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Learn More:Ministry of Social Development and Poverty Reduction: www.gov.bc.ca/sdprFor non-medical information and supports, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19

Government is taking steps to protect those providing essential services by ensuring they cannot be held liable for damages caused by exposure to COVID-19 while continuing to operate, so long as they are complying with orders from the provincial health officer and other authorities.The order is being introduced because a number of essential service business owners identified challenges with their insurance as a result of the pandemic. The changes government is implementing are intended to assist with some of these concerns.For example, a child care provider will not be liable for a child in their care or a family member being exposed to COVID-19, so long as they are following established protocols on how to prevent the spread of the virus, like proper handwashing, regular cleaning and disinfecting and identifying children who are sick.Essential service providers who are not compliant with respective authorities or who are grossly negligent will not receive protection under the order and will be held liable for damages. The order only applies to situations related to COVID-19 and will remain in effect for as long as the state of emergency remains in place. Additionally, it will continue to protect essential service providers until any relevant limitation periods have expired.The Province, in consultation with Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, has defined the essential services British Columbians rely on in their daily lives in the context of COVID-19 response and recovery. This is distinct from essential service designations under the Province's Labour Relations Code.Learn More:For non-medical information and supports, call 1 888 COVID19 between 7:30 a.m.-8 p.m., seven days a week, or visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19To view the list of the provincial health officer’s orders, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/phoguidanceTo view the list of essential services in B.C. during the COVID-19 pandemic, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/family-and-social-supports/covid-19/list_of_essential_services.pdf

Students attending British Columbia’s 25 public post-secondary institutions, who are experiencing emergency financial pressures, will benefit from a one-time investment of $3.5 million in emergency financial assistance.“Our government is taking steps to ensure post-secondary students get some emergency support so they can focus on staying healthy, meet their educational goals and finish their semester,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “We heard from students who are facing extremely difficult situations, and we’re moving quickly to ensure they have access to immediate financial relief.”The $3.5-million investment will supplement existing student emergency financial assistance. This funding will support domestic B.C. students who are experiencing an unexpected financial emergency that may affect their ability to finish their studies and handle expenses. This non-repayable emergency assistance can be used to help with a broad range of costs, including living expenses, food, travel, portable computers and other supports for students who are not already able to study remotely.Each year, the Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training invests $100,000 in public post-secondary institutions for student emergency assistance. This investment represents a significant boost to the existing supports to help students who may be experiencing financial hardships.Students who attend one of B.C.’s 25 public post-secondary institutions can access these funds by contacting their school’s financial aid office, which will assist with the application process. Each post-secondary institution will determine the specific amount a student can receive based on their individual needs.Quick Facts:
In the academic year 2018-19, the Province helped 446 students through its annual emergency assistance funding.
International and out-of-province students face unique challenges. The ministry is working directly with public post-secondary institutions to ensure emergency assistance is provided.

The provincial health officer (PHO) has issued new guidelines to support compliance with orders on business closures and gatherings, under the Public Health Act.The new guidelines for municipal bylaw officers and other compliance officers give clear instruction on warnings, public education and fines – and what can be issued by whom – to make sure there is compliance with the PHO’s orders and, if necessary, they are enforced consistently throughout B.C. communities.“Local governments are key partners in ensuring the provincial health officer’s orders are obeyed so people in our communities can stay healthy,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “It’s important that communities, and those responsible for compliance, have clear and consistent guidelines to enforce the provincial health officer’s orders so businesses can adapt their workplaces and help keep people safe.”To strengthen compliance and enforcement measures, the Province will redeploy provincial compliance staff from other ministries to support local governments under the direction of the PHO. This includes liquor and cannabis control and licensing inspectors, gambling enforcement and investigations officers, and community safety personnel.As outlined in provincial orders issued last week, bylaw enforcement officers do not have the ability to detain an individual as a result of a contravention or suspected contravention of a public health order, or issue a fine or penalty, including an administrative penalty, under the Public Health Act.Local bylaw and other compliance officers can, however, provide enforcement assistance for the PHO’s orders by:
monitoring facilities and areas closed to the public by a public health order;
providing warnings, information and advice to businesses and members of the public about public health orders, including warnings to businesses and members of the public who may be acting in contravention of a public health order; and
providing information on potential contraventions of a public health order for followup by health authorities.
Compliance officers will provide public health agencies with recommendations and advice on whether further action is necessary. Any enforcement will be at the direction of the PHO or local medical health officer.Public concerns regarding compliance with the PHO’s orders should be directed to local governments, who can dispatch bylaw officers for followup.  To view the PHO’s guidance toward compliance and enforcement, visit:

Local governments are strongly encouraged to focus their enforcement efforts on PHO’s orders relating to COVID-19.
This would provide a consistent approach throughout the province and reflects the PHO’s recommendations for individuals and communities.

Local governments are encouraged to avoid adopting any parallel bylaws and instead, focus on supporting enforcement of the existing PHO’s orders.
All guidance on enforcement of the PHO’s orders will be at the PHO's request to police and overseen by a unified command structure overseen by the Police Services Branch and comprised of the ministries of Public Safety and Solicitor General; Attorney General; Municipal Affairs and Housing; and Emergency Management BC.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“We are announcing 53 new cases, for a total of 1,066 cases in British Columbia.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 497 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 367 are in the Fraser Health region, 72 are in the Island Health region, 114 are in the Interior Health region and 16 are in the Northern Health region.“In the last 24 hours, we must also report one death in the Fraser Health region, for a total of 25 COVID-19 related deaths in British Columbia. Our condolences to everyone who has lost loved ones.“We continue to see new cases in long-term care and assisted-living facilities. There are now COVID-19 cases in 21 facilities in B.C., all in the Fraser and Vancouver Coastal health regions. Public health officials are providing support to implement outbreak protocols at all sites.  “To date, 606 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer have isolation requirements.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 142 individuals are currently hospitalized, 67 of those are in intensive care and the remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“This is an incredibly challenging time for all of us. Along with the serious health risks of COVID-19, many are also facing financial hardship and mental health struggles.“We know, without a doubt, that with all of us working together, we will get through this. Our goal is to have the restrictions and orders in place for as short a time as possible.“Maintaining strong social connections – at a distance – is one of the best ways that we can take care of ourselves and show support for each other.“The 7 p.m. cheer is heard across our province each evening. We have seen flowers and groceries on door steps, young children on virtual playdates, teens hosting gaming marathons and countless other examples of community connection.“We have also received hundreds of offers of support from those with supplies of personal protection equipment and medical supplies.“A new joint government-business COVID-19 Supply Hub launched today to fast-track sourcing and delivery of supplies to our front-line health workers.“Global Affairs Canada has registered tens of thousands of Canadian passport holders looking to come home from countries heavily impacted by COVID-19, some starting later this week.“All travellers arriving in British Columbia must immediately comply with federal quarantine orders. There must be no ambiguity from the federal government.

The Government of British Columbia and BC Hydro are helping people, small businesses and industries most impacted by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.“We are facing unprecedented challenges due to COVID-19. People are out of work, and businesses are facing tough choices about whether they can stay open,” said Premier John Horgan. “Giving people relief on their power bills lets them focus on the essentials, while helping businesses and encouraging critical industry to keep operating.”BC Hydro will offer new, targeted bill relief to provide immediate help to those most in need.Residential customers who have lost their jobs or are unable to work as a result of COVID-19 will receive a credit to help cover the cost of their electricity bills. The credit will be three times their average monthly bill over the past year at their home and does not have to be repaid.Small businesses that have been forced to close due to COVID-19 will have their power bills forgiven for three months. BC Hydro is waiving bills for these customers from April to June 2020.Major industries, like pulp and paper mills and mines, will have the opportunity to defer 50% of their bill payments for three months.“People who have lost their jobs or are unable to work due to COVID-19 shouldn’t have to choose between paying their rent or mortgage and paying their hydro bill,” said Bruce Ralston, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources. “These measures will also provide relief to small businesses such as restaurants and retail shops who have had to close during COVID-19, and support them in reopening once the pandemic has passed.”In addition to this new targeted bill relief, BC Hydro rates will be reduced by 1% on April 1, 2020, after the B.C. Utilities Commission provided interim approval of the application BC Hydro submitted last August. This is the first rate decrease in decades.“We recognize the financial stress many of our customers are facing after losing their job or having to close their business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Chris O'Riley, president and chief executive officer, BC Hydro. “We hope that not having to worry about their electricity costs for a few months will help provide some temporary relief during these challenging times.”On March 13, 2020, BC Hydro introduced its COVID-19 Customer Assistance Program to provide residential and commercial customers with the option to defer payments or arrange a flexible payment plan to help pay their BC Hydro bills.Quick Facts:
The average residential customer’s bill is $159 per month, so the average credit provided will be $477. Some customers may also be eligible for BC Hydro's existing Customer Crisis Fund, which provides access to grants of up to $600 to pay their bills.
The average bill savings for small businesses who qualify will be $121 per month, so the average total bill savings will be $363.
BC Hydro has halted all service disconnections for non-payment during COVID-19 and cancelled all non-emergency planned power outages affecting its customers.
The Province’s COVID-19 Action Plan includes a new BC Emergency Benefit for Workers that will provide a one-time $1,000 payment to workers whose ability to work has been affected by the outbreak that will add to benefits that are received under federal supports.
The Government of B.C. is also providing support for businesses through a 50% cut in school property taxes this year and allowing deferrals of a range of tax remittances that complement federal measures like the wage subsidy and interest-free loans.

Lisa Beare, Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture, has released the following statement about immediate responses to novel coronavirus (COVID-19) for B.C.’s amateur sport sector:“Government invests more than $50 million annually to make sure everyone has opportunities to participate in and enjoy the benefits of sport.“COVID-19 and the need for physical distancing has had a significant impact on everyone, including those in the sport sector. B.C.’s sport leaders responded quickly to the orders, direction and recommendations from the provincial health officer and cancelled tournaments, training schedules and other activities to protect people’s health. We understand this has had a significant impact on the province’s athletes, coaches, officials, sport organization staff and volunteers.“Starting in April 2020, the Province, through viaSport, will provide provincial, disability and multi-sport organizations with the ability to access $5 million, which represents 50% of their annual 2020-21 provincial funding allocation, to provide these organizations with access to cashflow sooner.“Sport plays a powerful role in helping people lead healthy, productive lives and contributes to the health and wellness of our communities. These measures are what we can do right away within the existing sport sector budget to help organizations during the pandemic. This is a first step and we will have more to announce regarding additional supports for the sector in the weeks ahead.”Learn More:ViaSport’s FAQ for provincially funded sport organizations: https://www.viasport.ca/news/faqs-events-and-programs-funded-viasport-and-province-bc-affected-covid-19Provincial support for the COVID-19 pandemic: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/emergency-preparedness-responserecovery/covid-19-provincial-supportSupports for B.C.’s small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/employment-business-and-economicdevelopment/business-management/small-business/covid-19_small_business_supports.pdfFor information and supports that are not health-related, call 1 888 COVID19 anytime between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m., seven days a week, or visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19

Les éducateurs pourront communiquer à distance avec leurs élèves grâce à une plateforme de vidéoconférence et de collaboration conviviale pendant que l’apprentissage en salle de classe est suspendu pour enrayer la propagation de la COVID-19.Le ministère de l’Éducation a obtenu et financé des licences d’utilisation de l’application Zoom pour toutes les écoles primaires et secondaires publiques et indépendantes en Colombie-Britannique. Cela offrira ainsi un accès uniforme à cette plateforme aux éducateurs qui souhaitent communiquer de plusieurs autres manières avec les élèves et les parents.  L’apprentissage continu variera d’une école à l’autre selon les besoins des élèves. Certaines options comprennent des outils d’apprentissage en ligne ou des trousses de ressources ou des devoirs que les enseignants enverront aux parents par courrier électronique ou par la poste. Pour les éducateurs qui choisissent d’offrir l’apprentissage en ligne, Zoom leur donne une plateforme commune et cohérente pour communiquer avec leurs élèves et leur présenter des leçons.Pour assurer la sécurité et protéger la vie privée des élèves, le contrat de licence est conforme à la Loi sur l’accès à l’information et la protection de la vie privée (LAIPVP) de la Colombie-Britannique. Les administrateurs des technologies scolaires peuvent contrôler les autorisations et les privilèges, tout en désactivant les fonctions inutiles ou inappropriées. Les élèves recevront une adresse de site Web unique pour accéder à leur salle de classe virtuelle, sans avoir besoin d’un compte individuel. De plus, le serveur Zoom sera situé au Canada, avec un chiffrage supplémentaire, ce qui en fera une plateforme d’apprentissage sécuritaire. Les éducateurs recevront l’accès à Zoom par le truchement de leur conseil scolaire ce mois-ci, ainsi que des instructions simples pour utiliser ce logiciel.  Bien que la responsabilité de l’apprentissage continu incombe principalement aux enseignants et aux écoles, le gouvernement a lancé également Keep Learning BC (www.openschool.bc.ca/keeplearning), le 27 mars 2020. C’est un site central où les familles pourront trouver des idées d’activités éducatives pour tous les jours, des liens vers des ressources d’apprentissage gratuites, ainsi que des conseils pour aider les enfants à apprendre et pour assurer leur bien-être pendant qu’ils restent à la maison. Du matériel pédagogique sera ajouté à ce site Web qui sera mis à jour régulièrement. Au 31 mars 2020, plus de 136,000 visiteurs ont accédé au site Web Keep Learning, ce qui représente une moyenne de 33,786 visiteurs par jour.Comme de nombreux élèves rencontreront des difficultés pour travailler en ligne, les écoles ont également reçu des consignes pour rechercher d’autres méthodes d’apprentissage continu qui répondront aux besoins individuels et qui seront adaptées aux circonstances de leurs collectivités. Certains conseils scolaires pourront également prêter des ordinateurs ou des appareils informatiques pour soutenir les élèves pendant qu’ils étudient à domicile.Faits en bref
Un nouvel arrêté ministériel pris conformément à la Loi sur l’accès à l’information et la protection de la vie privée (LAIPVP) permet de généraliser l’utilisation des outils de communication pendant la pandémie.

The Province has partnered with the Digital Technology Supercluster and the Business Council of British Columbia to create the COVID-19 Supply Hub, a made-in-B.C. online platform to co-ordinate, source and expedite medical supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE) for provincial health authorities to support front-line health workers fighting COVID-19.The COVID-19 Supply Hub provides a single point of entry to triage and prioritize the thousands of offers and donations for essential supplies from business and other organizations since the onset of the COVID-19 response.“In this provincial state of emergency, partnership and co-ordination are critical to keep our front-line workers safe and support our COVID-19 response and recovery,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. ""Launching the COVID-19 Supply Hub is an important step in maintaining our supply chain and making sure essential goods and services are getting where they need to go, and fast.”Premier John Horgan said, “This made-in-B.C. innovation showcases how important it is to work together to support our front-line workers. By giving B.C. businesses a platform to help, we are enabling some of our best and brightest minds to meet the demands of this pandemic and help keep people safe.”Developed by local B.C. tech company Traction on Demand and built on the Salesforce platform, the COVID-19 Supply Hub will make the types and specifications of critical supplies needed publicly available. From there, proposals can be quickly and efficiently managed and evaluated, so the right products get to the right workers on the front lines as efficiently as possible.The COVID-19 Supply Hub’s initial focus is on sourcing supplies for the health-care system and front-line workers, though government is also accepting offers for other essentials, like cleaning supplies.The COVID-19 Supply Hub will be managed under the new Provincial Supply Coordination Unit at Emergency Management BC in partnership with the Provincial Health Services Authority as part of the Province’s cross-government approach to COVID-19 response and recovery.“This initiative demonstrates how tech can be used quickly to make a difference in people’s lives,” said Michelle Mungall, Minister of Jobs, Economic Development and Competitiveness. “I am incredibly proud of the leading-edge work being done by the Digital Technology Supercluster, the business community and companies like Traction on Demand. They are finding unique ways to help front-line workers meet the needs of those impacted the most by COVID-19.”Sue Paish, CEO, Digital Technology Supercluster, said, “From concept to actualization within one week, the supply hub is illustrative of the Supercluster’s ability to harness our community’s power of collaboration. We are moving at an unprecedented pace to meet the demands of this pandemic, with innovative solutions. The supply hub will make a difference and address critical needs.”Companies looking to offer support or supplies through the COVID-19 Supplier Hub can access it here: www.gov.bc.ca/supplyhubQuick Facts:
The Provincial Supply Coordination Unit was established under the provincial state of emergency to support the Province’s response and recovery to COVID-19.
The COVID-19 Supply Hub is complementary to existing provincial procurement streams in order to expedite medical supplies under the provincial state of emergency. The supply hub will work in co-ordination with other provincial and federal initiatives to secure medical and other essential supplies.
COVID-19 Supply Hub partners: the Business Council of British Columbia, the Digital Technology Supercluster, Salesforce, Traction on Demand, the Provincial Health Services Authority, the Ministry of Citizens’ Services, the Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General and the Ministry of Jobs, Economic Development and Competitiveness.

Starting in April 2020, the Province will remove invasive ivy that is growing on the Nelson Courthouse and causing building-integrity risks.A recent assessment by Fairbanks Architects Ltd. determined that the ivy is threatening the building’s structural integrity, including obstructing gutters and downspouts, preventing proper roof drainage, and damaging the chimney, roof and soffits. Ivy roots and tendrils are degrading the foundation, and there is evidence of water damage inside the building as well.Previously, a five-year trim-back maintenance plan was in place. It proved to be costly and inefficient due to the ivy’s rapid growth. The original stone for the building, Kootenay marble, is soft and susceptible to damage.The Province is contracting Cornerstone General Contracting to remove the ivy without the use of chemicals. The work must get underway in April. Timing beyond that would incur additional costs as the ivy will be in bloom. In carrying out this work, the contractor will follow the rules of the provincial health officer.Once the ivy has been removed, the courthouse will be thoroughly inspected for any further indications of damage. Repairs and future maintenance work will be identified and prioritized.A Nelson citizen is checking with a local nursery to see if it is possible to move, at their cost, the ivy root ball to different locations in the community or to individuals who may want a clipping. This idea was the result of a stakeholder group meeting held earlier this month. Other items discussed by the group included the project rationale and the risk of maintaining the status quo.The courthouse, which was designed by Francis M. Rattenbury and constructed in 1908, has heritage status in Nelson. Rattenbury also designed the Parliament Buildings and the Fairmont Empress Hotel in Victoria.Learn More: Nelson Courthouse: https://www.provincialcourt.bc.ca/court-location/nelson

Cameras are now clicking at busy, high-risk intersections around B.C., equipped to ticket the fastest vehicles.Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, has confirmed that automated speed enforcement equipment is now in place at all 35 planned Intersection Safety Camera (ISC) program sites and operating at 34 of them, on a 24/7 basis. Prominent warning signs are in place to warn and deter speeding drivers.Government is postponing activation of the new speed enforcement equipment at one location – Island Highway at Aulds Road in Nanaimo – until mid-September 2020. This grace period is to allow drivers time to adjust to a recent reduction of the speed limit on the highway there, to 70 km/h from 80 km/h. This site remains activated for red-light enforcement.A map showing all of B.C.’s ISC sites, and municipal and regional lists of them, are online here (linked by region): https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/public-safety/intersection-safety-cameras/where-the-cameras-areSince B.C. activated its first five automated speed enforcement cameras at the end of July 2019, the program has issued more than 20,000 speeding tickets. The fastest ticketed vehicle clocked 174 km/h at a location where the posted speed limit is 80 km/h. Quarterly data for ISC red-light and speed violation tickets are here: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/public-safety/intersection-safety-cameras/statisticsISC equipment captures images and speeds of the fastest vehicles passing through monitored intersections on red, yellow and green lights. Before mailing tickets, which carry fines but no penalty points, ISC officers review the digital images and data to confirm the applicable Motor Vehicle Act charge or charges. Notably, the registered owner of a vehicle that speeds through a red light at a speed-activated ISC intersection would face fines for both infractions.

The B.C. government has formally extended the provincial state of emergency to support the provincewide response to the COVID-19 pandemic, through the end of the day on April 14, 2020.“The next 14 days are critically important in our province’s unprecedented fight against COVID-19. What we do today will affect what our doctors, nurses and first responders face in the days and weeks ahead,” said Premier John Horgan. “Today, we’re asking all British Columbians to re-commit to doing their part. There are early signs that our actions are making a difference, and we can’t stop now.”Using the extraordinary powers under the Emergency Program Act, Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, has issued a series of orders to ensure a co-ordinated response to COVID-19 across all levels of government. Through these orders, the Province is taking an active role in co-ordinating the supply chain for essential goods and services, supporting the enforcement of the provincial health officer’s orders and prohibiting the secondary selling of essential goods and supplies.Government is also taking steps to ensure people and businesses are supported through this challenging time by:
providing $5 billion in income supports, tax relief and direct funding for people, businesses and services;
halting evictions, freezing rents and introducing a $500 temporary rental supplement;
amending the Employment Standards Act to protect jobs for those unable to work for reasons relating to COVID-19;
launching a process to match essential service workers with child care in their communities and supporting child care providers with temporary emergency funding;
bolstering seniors’ supports at community service agencies with $50 million and expanding bc211, a provincewide information and referral service to match seniors whose support network has been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak with volunteers;
supporting families who rely on food banks with a $3-million emergency grant to Food Banks British Columbia; and
providing people and organizations in the arts sector with a $3-million Arts and Culture Resilience Supplement to be administered by the BC Arts Council.
“Our government is continuing to take all actions necessary to keep our communities safe, goods moving, and essential service workers supported,” Farnworth said. “This is an unprecedented time in our province. We’re working hard to alleviate the pressures that we’re all facing, and we will get through this together.”The extension of the provincial state of emergency is based on recommendations from B.C.’s health and emergency management officials. Farnworth made the original declaration on March 18 after Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, declared a public health emergency.The Province has created 1 888 COVID-19 to connect British Columbians needing non-medical information about COVID-19. This includes the latest information on travel recommendations and physical distancing, as well as access to support and resources from the provincial and federal governments. The call line is available seven days a week, from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m., in 110 languages. People with questions related to their health and COVID-19 should call 811.Quick Facts: 
Declarations of provincial states of emergency may be issued by the minister responsible under the Emergency Program Act.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“We are announcing 43 new cases, for a total of 1,013 cases in British Columbia.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 476 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 348 are in the Fraser Health region, 67 are in the Island Health region, 107 are in the Interior Health region and 15 are in the Northern Heath region.“It is with sadness that we report five deaths in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser Health regions in the last 24 hours, for a total of 24 COVID-19 related deaths in British Columbia.“We continue to see new cases in long-term care and assisted living homes. There are now COVID-19 cases in 19 facilities in B.C., all in the Fraser and Vancouver Coastal health regions. Public health officials are providing support to implement outbreak protocols at all sites.  “To date, 507 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer have isolation requirements.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 128 individuals are currently hospitalized, 61 of those are in intensive care and the remaining people with COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“We are at a critical juncture in our provincial COVID-19 response. Every British Columbian has a part to play to flatten the curve. We must all do the right thing and be 100% committed.“No one is immune, but everyone can make a difference. If you are older, staying home keeps you away from those who could put you at risk. If you are young, staying apart means you are preserving important capacity within our health-care system for our elders and others at highest risk.“The Government of B.C. continues to provide new resources to support British Columbians during this challenging time.“We are providing our essential workers who are parents a new resource to access child care for children five years old and younger.

To support parents who are essential service workers during the response to novel coronavirus (COVID-19), the Province is launching a new process.This process will match parents, who are working on the front lines of B.C.’s COVID-19 response and have children up to five years of age, with child care in their communities.Starting today, essential workers can fill out a new “parent” form to identify their need for urgent child care. Forms can be accessed by calling 1 888 338-6622 and selecting Option 4, or online:
www.gov.bc.ca/essential-service-child-careChild Care Resource Referral (CCRR) centres in 38 communities will act as community-based hubs. The CCRRs will reach out to essential-service workers in their area who filled in the form to connect them with available licensed child care spaces.Applicants will be asked:
which category of essential worker they are;
their child’s age; and
in which community they need child care.
Child care spaces will be prioritized for children whose parents work in public health and health services, social services, law enforcement, first responders and emergency response sectors. Additional spaces will then be given to families working in other crucial roles, defined as essential service workers.The number of spaces available for essential service workers will be up to each child care operator, based on its licensed capacity and following any additional health requirements established by the provincial health officer.Hours of operation for spaces will vary by facility. While many centres are open Monday to Friday, others may offer care on the weekends and outside the hours of 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Government is monitoring whether the needs of essential service workers for care outside of regular hours are being met.  Child care centres, which are open, are required to follow the child care licensing regulation and guidelines on how to prevent the spread of and protect children and staff from COVID-19. This includes proper handwashing, regular cleaning and disinfecting, as well as identifying children who are sick. Families who want to access child care services must also continue to ensure their children are practising physical distancing with anyone outside of their immediate family circle.To help the child care sector through this pandemic, the Ministry of Children and Family Development is providing temporary emergency funding to support providers and ensure access to child care is maintained for essential service workers.Licensed providers that are open and operating are eligible to receive emergency funding at a rate of seven times their average monthly child care operating base funding. Centres will continue to be eligible for the Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative and the Early Childhood Educator Wage Enhancement. In addition, families accessing care from these providers may be eligible for the Affordable Child Care Benefit.The form and matching process are temporary. They will remain in place for as long as the provincial health officer advises that all parents who can, should care for their children at home and that child care services can and must be provided for those families whose parents work in critical roles.  The Ministry of Education has been working closely with school districts and independent schools to identify and support children, aged five to 12 years (kindergarten to Grade 6), whose parents are essential service workers, with a focus on public health and health services, social services, law enforcement, first responders and emergency response sectors. School districts and independent school authorities have been asked to ensure students whose parents work in these fields have access to care during regular before-, during- and after-school hours.Hours of care will vary by school district and independent school. If essential service workers who have school-aged children need before-, during- and after-hours care for their children, they are asked to contact their school district directly. Most school districts have already reached out directly to families through surveys to gather information on urgent child care needs.As British Columbians navigate these uncertain times together, parents who can are asked to care for their children at home. All children and staff who are ill with fever, have cold, influenza or infectious respiratory symptoms of any kind must stay home. If they are unsure of their status, BCCOVID-19 BC Support App and Self-Assessment Tool and the BC Centre for Disease Control’s online assessment tool can help assess whether or not they can return to child care.Learn More:Frequently asked questions about the matching program can be found here: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/FAQ_COVID_and_Child%20Care_Mar_30.pdfTo view the list of essential services in B.C. during the COVID-19 pandemic, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/family-and-social-supports/covid-19/list_of_essential_services.pdfFor recommendations on protecting yourself and your community from COVID-19, and to use an online self-assessment tool, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/BCCOVID-19 BC Support App and Self-Assessment Tool: https://bc.thrive.health/The BC Centre for Disease Control's online assessment tool: http://covid-19.bccdc.ca/A backgrounder follows.Translations:For a traditional Chinese translation: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/IB_child_care_matching_March30_Chinese.pdfFor a French translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/IB_child_care_matching_March30.pdfFor a Punjabi translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/IB_child_care_matching_March30_punjabi.pdf

Local residents who rely on the Province’s inland ferry system will benefit from a new B.C. built cable ferry, the Arrow Park III.The Arrow Park III has completed sea trials and the ferry is ready to enter service the week of March 30, 2020, when operations and environmental conditions permit. The vessel runs across the junction of Upper and Lower Arrow Lakes at Arrow Park, 22 kilometres south of Nakusp on Highway 6.This is the last vessel to be delivered as part of a $27.9-million contract with Waterbridge Steel of Nakusp to design and build four new cable ferries. The new 24-car ferry will be larger and able to carry more vehicles than the existing ferry, with capacity increased to handle commercial vehicles at full highway loads.This is also the first vessel of the ministry’s inland fleet that will be fully electrified, an important part of the Province’s CleanBC commitment. The vessel is scheduled to be fully electrified in 2021.During the current COVID-19 pandemic, the ministry would like to remind people to avoid all non-essential travel and remain inside vehicles during sailings. Please follow the direction of the crew.

Youth in care will not age out of services during the COVID-19 pandemic and those who have recently aged out will get extra assistance.“During these uncertain times, youth deserve our steady, consistent support to help them through,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “We don’t want anyone to fall through the cracks, so we’ve taken emergency steps to ensure young people in and from care can continue getting the services they count on.”Youth and young adults from care will continue receiving the same level of service during the pandemic, even if they were set to age out. This enables extra stability and support for young people who might otherwise face housing, educational and employment uncertainty. Youth currently living in foster care, contracted residential agencies or with relatives through the extended family program will be able to stay where they are. Social workers are modifying agreements to allow youth and caregivers to extend their current living arrangements once a youth reaches 19 years old.Young adults between the ages of 19 and 27 who are enrolled in the Agreements with Young Adults (AYA) program will continue to receive financial support despite school closures and other training program interruptions caused by the current pandemic. If applicable, these young adults may also be eligible to receive an extension of AYA support beyond the current maximum of 48 months. Youth who are nearing the end of an Independent Living or Youth agreement will be given options allowing them to continue receiving monthly living expenses past their 19th birthday. Social workers are contacting youth to guide them through this process.Additional efforts will be made to locate young adults who have recently aged out of care to connect them to other lines of available support, like the B.C. Emergency Benefit for workers and the Federal Emergency Care Benefit.These interim measures further complement government’s $5-billion COVID-19 Action Plan to provide income supports, tax relief and direct funding for people, businesses and services.Learn More: For information on B.C.’s COVID-19 Action Plan and other government resources and updates, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19Agreements with Young Adults: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/family-social-supports/youth-and-family-services/teens-in-foster-care/agreements-with-young-adultsFor non-medical related information on COVID-19, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are providing case updates for two 24-hour reporting periods: March 28 to 29, and March 29 through to midday today.“In the first reporting period through March 28, we had 16 new cases, for a total of 900 cases in British Columbia.“In the last 24 hours, we have had a further 70 new cases, for a total of 970 cases in British Columbia.“This represents 86 new cases since we reported on Saturday.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 472 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 323 are in the Fraser Health region, 67 are in the Island Health region, 94 are in the Interior Health region and 14 are in the Northern Health region.“We are saddened to report two additional COVID-19 related deaths in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, resulting in a total of 19 COVID-19 related deaths in British Columbia. This includes the first death in the community as a result of COVID-19, as confirmed by the BC Coroners Service.“There are now COVID-19 cases in 13 long-term care and assisted living homes in British Columbia. All are in the Fraser and Vancouver Coastal health regions. Public health officials are providing support to implement outbreak protocols at all sites.  “To date, 469 people who had tested positive for COVID-19 have recovered and no longer have isolation requirements.“Of the total COVID-19 cases, 106 individuals are currently hospitalized, 60 of those in hospital are in intensive care and the remaining people who have tested positive for COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“We are at a critical juncture in our provincial COVID-19 response. We have two paths ahead: we will begin to see evidence of a flattened curve or our rates of infection will rise even more.“Our entire government is doing everything we can to address this challenge, and we need every person in our province to do the same. Let us be united in this singular purpose: in these next two crucial weeks we must be 100% committed to flattening the curve and lessening the devastating impacts of this virus.“While we are watching the epi-curve closely, we continue with the active readiness of our health-care system to prepare for the potential of a large spike in COVID-19 cases.“A shipment of one million surgical masks has arrived as we continue to restock our provincial personal-protection equipment supplies.“We have designated 19 major hospitals across the province as primary COVID-19 facilities to deliver care to the most critically ill patients.“To maximize capacity at these primary sites, we are also readying a number of off-site treatment centres, such as the Vancouver Convention Centre (with resources for approximately 270 beds) and the new tower at the Royal Columbian Hospital (with resources for approximately 80 beds), to be ready for providing less acute in-patient care. In coming days, other health authorities will begin making similar preparations.“Additionally, in an effort to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission, we are suspending pay parking for the patients, staff and visitors at all health authority owned and operated sites, effective April 1 until further notice. This change makes it easier for individuals to avoid touching screens and buttons at payment kiosks that may have been touched by someone previously, and also supports physical distancing measures. Health authorities will provide details on this change of practice at each of their facilities.“This week, our K-12 educators and students will begin a new form of learning as in-class education remains suspended. The Keep Learning BC website is a new resource to give families additional support and provide guidance on how to incorporate learning into their everyday activities.“Equally important for families, as we all adjust to the physical distancing measures, is to use the many tools and creative solutions available to maintain the valuable social connections between students that would otherwise be provided in school settings.”Learn More:To see the list of COVID-19 primary hospital facilities, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/modelling-projectionsFor recommendations on protecting yourself and your community from COVID-19, and to use an online self-assessment tool visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/The COVID-19 self-assessment app can be downloaded at: https://bc.thrive.health/For non-health questions about COVID-19 call 1-888-COVID-19 or visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19For a full listing of provincial health officer orders, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topics/covid-19-novel-coronavirusFor the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities:

The man died in his residence.Due to the privacy of the deceased, as required by the Coroners Act and provincial privacy legislation, the BC Coroners Service does not confirm or release identity.Deaths that are unnatural, or sudden and unexpected, must be reported to a coroner. If cause of death cannot be reasonably established through examination of the body, scene and history, additional post-mortem investigations will be undertaken.Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, coroners in B.C. will gather additional information in apparently natural sudden deaths in the community to determine whether COVID-19 played a role.

The protection of privacy is a top priority for the B.C. government, and so is protecting the health and safety of British Columbians during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.A new ministerial order under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIPPA) enables the broader use of communications tools for health-care workers and other public-sector staff who are responding to the COVID-19 state of emergency. This order supports the people working on the front lines to protect the health and safety of British Columbians by ensuring they have access to vital software and technology that can help in this fight.The health and safety measures that provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has put in place throughout the province mean that:
K-12 schools are taking extended spring breaks and post-secondary institutions are moving in-person lectures to online platforms.
thousands of British Columbians are now staying at home with their loved ones and working remotely.
most importantly, doctors, nurses, first responders and other front-line health-care providers are in urgent need of tools that will help them improve their ability to share information quickly and respond effectively to emerging needs.
The public-health emergency has made it necessary for government to temporarily enable the use of technologies that would otherwise be restricted under FOIPPA’s current rules. The global pandemic has changed how the Province, health-care providers and organizations in the broader public sector are working. It has affected the way they need to deliver the services and supports that British Columbians count on.British Columbia has the strictest privacy and data-residency laws in Canada. It is one of only two Canadian provinces with legislation requiring the personal information of its citizens to be stored in and only accessed from within Canada. The ministerial order temporarily permits health-care bodies like the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions, and health authorities to use communication and collaboration software that may host information outside of Canada. The order also enables B.C. schools and post-secondary institutions to provide online learning for students who have been displaced due to the need for physical distancing.The ministerial order is in effect until June 30, 2020. The Province will work with the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner on or before this date to either rescind or renew the order, depending on the pandemic landscape at that time.Quick Facts:FOIPPA makes public bodies more accountable to the public and protects personal privacy by:
giving the public a right of access to records;
giving individuals a right of access to, and a right to request correction of, personal information about themselves;
specifying limited exceptions to the rights of access;
preventing the unauthorized collection, use or disclosure of personal information by public bodies; and
providing for an independent review of decisions made under this act.
The act does not replace other procedures for access to information or in any way limit access to information that is not personal information and is available to the public.Learn More:To see the ministerial order, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/british-columbians-our-governments/services-policies-for-government/information-management-technology/information-privacy/resources/ministerial_order_085_respecting_disclosures_during_covid-19_emergency__march_2020_pdf.pdfFreedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act in B.C.: http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96165_00

As the challenges caused by the COVID-19 outbreak continue to shift, the B.C. government and Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer (PHO), are taking unprecedented measures to slow the transmission of COVID-19, including in the retail food and grocery store sector.Recently, Henry issued an order under the Public Health Act prohibiting the gathering of people in excess of 50 people at a place of which a person is the owner, occupier or operator, or for which they are otherwise responsible. Employers in the retail food and grocery store sector are asking for clarity about what this means for them.Retail food and grocery stores play an essential service in every community by ensuring safe and reliable access to food, supplies and other provisions.Many retail food and grocery store owners have asked whether or not the PHO’s order prohibiting mass gatherings of 50 or more people applies to them. While this order does not directly apply to the retail food and grocery industry, the spirit of the order should be followed. This means that, for example, in large grocery stores where it is feasible to have more than 50 people present at one time, it is permissible to do so provided that appropriate physical distancing can be maintained.A link to specific guidance is available in the Learn More section. Key considerations include:
enhancing the premise’s sanitation plan and schedule, and ensuring staff are practising proper hygiene. This includes frequent hand washing, only coughing or sneezing into an elbow, and avoiding touching one’s face;
placing hand sanitizer with a minimum of 60% ethyl alcohol in dispensers near doors, pay stations and other high-touch locations for customer and staff use;
ensuring washrooms are always well stocked with liquid soap and paper towels, and that warm running water is available;
providing clean carry-out bags for purchased food and grocery products; customers should not use their own containers, reusable bags or boxes;
posting signs at each check-out indicating that no customer packaging is to be used or placed on check-out counters;
ensuring cones or tape markers are in place every two metres to provide customers with visible queues that support physical distancing;
using physical queue-line controls, such as crowd control cordons at entrances and in check-out lines outside the stores;
do not sell bulk items, except via gravity feed bins or where staff dispense the bulk items;
self-isolation can end 14 days after the last contact or return to Canada if you have not developed symptoms; and
with or without a history of travel, if you have respiratory symptoms that can be managed at home, self-isolate at home for at least 10 days after onset of symptoms. After 10 days, if your temperature is normal and you feel better, you can return to your routine activities.
Coughing may persist for several weeks, so a cough alone does not mean you need to continue to self-isolate for more than 10 days.

Employers should reassess their work environment every day and keep updated with the information posted on the Province’s website: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19The B.C. government is doing everything it can to help contain the spread of COVID-19. The safety of British Columbians remains its top priority.Learn More:For a copy of the guidelines providing guidance to the retail food and grocery store sector, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/public-safety-and-emergency-services/emergency-preparedness-response-recovery/embc/covid-materials/covid-19_guidance_to_grocery_stores_29mar2020_final.pdf)

To support vulnerable British Columbians during the COVID-19 crisis, the Province is providing a $3-million emergency grant from the Community Gaming Grants program to Food Banks British Columbia.Food Banks British Columbia will distribute the money among food banks provincewide to support their immediate needs to buy and distribute food, pay employees and cover other costs essential to the delivery of their food programs. Food Banks BC was selected to distribute the funding because of its expertise in management of food distribution.“We know that many British Columbia families count on food banks to supplement their weekly grocery needs. To help ensure that people continue to have access to the food they need, our government is taking steps by supporting B.C. food banks so they can, in turn, keep meeting the needs of the people in the communities they serve,” said Mable Elmore, Parliamentary Secretary for Poverty Reduction. “Using funds from the gaming grants program is an example of how government and non-profit partners are working together to respond to the evolving nature of the pandemic, easing the burden on B.C.’s food banks and helping people who are feeling the strain of the COVID-19 crisis.”Food Banks BC will assess the needs and requirements of food banks to determine the amount and timing of the distribution. Funds will be distributed quickly and equitably to food banks across all regions of the province. “British Columbia’s not-for-profit food banks provide a critical service for vulnerable people in our communities, especially during this most challenging time,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “During times like these, we need to help each other as much as possible. This community gaming grant will help relieve hunger and provide support for the people in our province who need it most.”The $3-million grant uses funding that remained in the Community Gaming Grant’s 2019-20 budget of $140 million after all 2019 community gaming grants had been awarded to or approved for eligible organizations.

“This grant will make a tremendous impact in communities all over B.C. and ensure that food banks can keep their doors open and continue to meet the needs of the vulnerable, who particularly need their assistance at this time,” said Laura Lansink, executive director, Food Banks BC. “We sincerely thank the Province for this encouraging and vital assistance to Food Banks BC.”

The grant to Food Banks BC is in alignment with the ministerial order issued March 26, 2020, under the Emergency Program Act, to protect B.C.’s most vulnerable, making it easier to support critical services for vulnerable people, like food banks and shelters.In response to concerns raised by food banks about capacity to respond to the urgent need in their communities, the order removes barriers to business to allow: drive-through and delivery opportunities, larger hampers, increased home delivery capability and removes the requirement to present identification. These measures will make it easier for food banks to operate in this challenging time when more people are using their services.This is one in a series of ministerial orders to ensure a co-ordinated response to COVID-19 across all levels of government for the duration of the provincial emergency.These latest steps are part of government’s $5-billion COVID-19 Action Plan to provide income supports, tax relief and direct funding for people, businesses and services.Quick Facts:
Food Banks BC is B.C.’s provincial association of food banks that represents and supports food banks across the province.
Every year, commercial gaming generates revenue that the Government of B.C. invests in key services.
These investments support organizations in the areas of health care and education, arts and culture groups, sports, environment, public safety, human and social services, as well as parent advisory councils in schools throughout B.C.

Up to $140 million of the revenue generated is directed into the community through the Community Gaming Grants program that supports about 5,000 community organizations each year.

March 27, 2020Ottawa, ON - The Honourable Bernadette Jordan, Minister of Fisheries, Oceans, and the Canadian Coast Guard and Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture for British Columbia, issued the following joint statement:“During these unprecedented times, it is more important than ever that we work together across all orders of government to keep Canadians safe and communities supported. Today, we spoke for the second time in recent days, to discuss the rapidly evolving COVID-19 impacts on the fish and seafood industry in British Columbia.Harvesters, seafood growers, and processors, are essential to our collective food security and to coastal communities up and down the Pacific. We spoke about the need to maintain the supply chain while ensuring the health and safety of the essential workers who support it. Your health is of paramount importance to us.We discussed industry concerns regarding fluctuating markets, financial losses, and the economic measures being put forward by the federal government to address some of those concerns. The small business measures – including additional liquidity from Business Development Bank of Canada and up to 75% wage subsidy for eligible employers – will help local businesses stay afloat and keep people on staff throughout this public health crisis. In addition, the new Canada Emergency Response Benefit will be there for people who can’t go out and fish or who have no earnings as a result of COVID-19’s impact on the market.Seafood growers, shellfish farmers, and processors, will have access to the $5 billion Farm Credit Canada loan program announced earlier this week by federal minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau.The B.C. government is going to support the British Columbian families who make their living from seafood during this pandemic and in the recovery process that follows. There are a number of programs the B.C. Government is working on to support all B.C. businesses and employees through these difficult days. The Ministry of Agriculture’s core programming that helps B.C. fish, shellfish and marine plant producers with local and international marketing efforts, clean technology and projects that promote habitat restoration will also continue, so people can continue to enjoy high-quality B.C. seafood now and for generations to come.We know there is more to do, and we will continue to collaborate, to meet weekly, and to work together to weather this storm. Know that we are working around the clock to support your livelihoods in the short term and ensure a strong recovery in the long term.”Associated links:

580,2020-03-27 16:36:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020EDUC0026-000580,Government Website,Taking steps to keep kids learning during in-class school suspension,"

New guidelines for school leaders and a new website are being introduced to support B.C.’s K-12 students while in-class education is suspended to prevent the spread of COVID-19.“This is a challenging time for families in B.C. as we work together to stop the spread of COVID-19, but it is vital students have a sense of routine and continued opportunities to learn while they are at home,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “These guidelines will ensure the needs, health and safety of students are put first as school leaders actively plan to serve the unique needs of their communities.”While in-person classes are suspended, the B.C. school system remains open to continue to support students and families in a variety of ways. Note that parents should not bring their children to school on Monday, March 30, 2020, as they usually would after spring break.However, essential frontline health-care workers, like those directly involved in patient care, who need urgent care for their school-aged child the week of March 30 are advised to contact their school principal as soon as possible to discuss care arrangements available during the first week back after spring break. Other parents who are deemed an essential service worker and who may need child care for their school-age children can expect to hear from their school regarding care options by Friday, April 3, 2020. Schools will be doing their best to accommodate urgent child care needs while meeting the guidelines and directives of the provincial health officer.Since there are many students who will have challenges working online, schools have been directed to look at alternative approaches for continued learning that will fit with the individual needs and circumstances of their communities. School leaders are actively working on these plans, and families will hear from their school superintendent and/or school principal in the coming week with an update on their timelines.Government is working with all 60 school boards, independent school authorities, First Nations schools, teachers, school leaders, support staff, public health officials and all education partners on a co-ordinated approach. Guidelines for developing education plans for students will follow these principles:

Maintain a healthy and safe environment for all students, families and employees.
Provide the services needed to support children of essential workers.
Support vulnerable students who may need special assistance.
Provide continuity of educational opportunities for all students.

These principles will also guide planning and support for students who need extra learning support or those with disabilities, important services like meal programs and child care services operating on school grounds.
“Boards of education across the province are working on ways to ensure continuity of learning in their communities,” said Stephanie Higginson, president, BC School Trustees Association. “Local boards of education understand the unique needs in each community. That local connection will be key as boards roll out plans tailored to each school district in the province.”
While teachers and schools will have primary responsibility for continuous learning, government has launched Keep Learning BC. This is a central place where families can find ideas for everyday educational activities, annotated links to free learning resources, as well as how to help children learn and how to ensure their well-being while they are at home. Keep Learning BC is available at: www.openschool.bc.ca/keeplearning/
The Keep Learning BC website will have helpful guides to maintain routines and stay safe online, giving parents information about how talk to their children about COVID-19, along with other mental health resources to manage stress or anxiety. A comprehensive set of frequently asked questions is also available, with continuous updates about school services and programs as things progress: www.gov.bc.ca/safeschools/
Fleming added, “While it’s important for kids to keep learning, there is no expectation that we can duplicate a normal school day at home, and every family will need to figure out what works best for them, in discussion with their children’s teachers. I understand that many children are experiencing anxiety, while also missing their teachers and friends, and that’s why it’s important they know the actions we’re taking are designed to keep everyone safe, and we will return to regular school life down the road. By working together and supporting each other, we will get through this.”
Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, said, “We are proud of the parents, families and school communities who are working together to keep their children safely at home, and recognize how important it is for children to have continued learning opportunities in these challenging times. Parents who are health-care workers are also eagerly waiting for support, and it’s our job to work as a team to make sure they can continue their essential services.”
Quote:
Andrea Sinclair, president, BC Confederation of Parent Advisory Councils —
“The BC Confederation of Parent Advisory Councils is truly appreciative of the united effort that is being undertaken across the education sector resulting in the continuity of an educational program while our children are at home. Parents understand that alternative instruction plans are being created to best meet the needs of children and that learning will vary by grade, district and region. As we try to maintain a daily routine in our homes, including academics and recreation, parents acknowledge that educators play a critical role supporting our children during this extraordinary time.”
Quick Facts:

On March 17, 2020, under the direction of the provincial health officer, all schools were ordered to immediately suspend in-class instruction until further notice. 
Every student in K-12 will receive a final mark for the 2019-20 school year, and all students who are on track to move to the next grade will do so in the fall. Every student eligible to graduate from Grade 12 this school year will also graduate. On average, about 45,000 students graduate every year.
The Ministry of Education is also working across government to ensure all students graduating high school will have a smooth transition to post-secondary education.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“We are announcing 67 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 792 cases in British Columbia.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 391 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 262 are in the Fraser Health region, 57 are in the Island Health region, 70 are in the Interior Health region and 12 are in the Northern Heath region.“We are saddened to report two more deaths as a result of COVID-19 in the Vancouver Coastal health region. Our condolences to their loved ones during this difficult time.“Two additional long-term care homes in the Fraser Health region have staff with confirmed cases of COVID-19, The Harrison at Elim Village and Chartwell Independent Living at Langley Gardens. In total, 11 long-term care homes in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser Health regions have confirmed cases of COVID-19. Public health officials are providing support to implement outbreak protocols.“Two hundred and seventy-five patients with COVID-19 have recovered and no longer have isolation requirements.“Additionally, of the total COVID-19 cases, 73 individuals are currently hospitalized, and the remaining people who have tested positive for COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“We are tracking the epidemic curve closely here in B.C. We are also monitoring outbreaks in other nations to guide our health system preparations and public health response.“In the past few days, our upward path has been less severe than other places, but we continue to see steady increases in community transmission cases and continue to be concerned about outbreaks, which could quickly grow and challenge our pandemic response.“The evidence is clear: with every person in British Columbia 100% committed to physical distancing, we can flatten the curve. Over the next two weeks we must be united in this one goal.“We strongly discourage any in-person gathering of any size at this time, but rather encourage using the many online options we have available today to stay connected to friends, family, customers and clients.“We know that our community and farmers markets are an important source of fresh food. We are heartened that, with the support of funding from the provincial government, many markets are shifting to an online model. We remind market organizers that a public gathering order is in place and physical distancing measures must be followed.“Further, to reduce the potential for transmission and ensure local, B.C.-grown food can continue to reach customers, a provincial health officer order has been issued, effective immediately.“All occasional/recurring/weekly events where food and other merchandise is sold (e.g., markets, street markets, night markets, Saturday markets or community markets) must only allow vendors that sell food to be at these events. Vendors of non-food items and all other merchandise are prohibited to sell at these events.“Every day that we stay home and stay apart will bolster our COVID-19 response. This is how we will protect our health-care workers, whose job it is to care for us, our loved ones and ourselves.”Learn More:For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community from COVID-19, and to use an online self-assessment tool, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/The COVID-19 self-assessment app can be downloaded at: https://bc.thrive.health/For non-medical questions about COVID-19, call 1 888 COVID-19 or visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19For a full listing of provincial health officer orders, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topics/covid-19-novel-coronavirusFor the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit: https://www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/

Government liquor stores remain open in order to continue serving British Columbians, while also ensuring the safety of the most vulnerable people, employees and customers during the COVID-19 pandemic.BC Liquor Stores (BCLS) are adjusting hours of operation, in part, to ensure BCLS staff complete additional store cleaning in the off hours, in order to minimize risk to both employees and customers and help stem the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The number of customers permitted in stores will also be limited, where required, in order to allow for observance of the self-distancing guidelines outlined by the provincial health officer and the Ministry of Health.Additionally, while there is no shortage of beer, wine and spirits in B.C., an increase in sales and customers has led to challenges in keeping shelves properly stocked. The adjusted hours will allow staff to ensure products are available for customers at a time when stores have been experiencing staffing shortages.In addition, if landlords or shopping malls are limiting hours, the Liquor Distribution Branch will be required to reduce operating hours accordingly.As the situation evolves, the government continues to explore additional temporary measures to support the hospitality industry. New opportunities will be communicated with the public as they become available.Learn More:COVID-19 BC government web page: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19BC Liquor Stores: http://www.bcliquorstores.com/

Limitation periods to commence court proceedings in British Columbia have been suspended, and statutory decision-makers have been provided discretion to waive, suspend or extend time periods related to their powers. At the request of the Attorney General, the Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General has made the order under the Emergency Program Act to protect public health and to recognize that during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, British Columbians involved in legal or administrative proceedings may be unable to take steps required by legislation. The order provides that mandatory limitation periods, and other mandatory time periods established in an enactment or law of British Columbia, within which a civil or family action, proceeding, claim or appeal must be commenced in the provincial court, Supreme Court or Court of Appeal are suspended. It also provides that a person, tribunal or other body that has a statutory power of decision may waive, suspend or extend a mandatory time period relating to the exercise of that power.The order applies during the current state of emergency, including any extension of the state of emergency. Update as of April 8, 2020: The order does not apply to a mandatory limitation period and any other mandatory time period established under the Builders Lien Act.

Lisa Beare, ministre du Tourisme, des Arts et de la Culture, a publié la déclaration suivante concernant les interventions immédiates de son ministère en réponse au nouveau coronavirus (COVID-19) pour le secteur des arts et de la culture :« La maladie à coronavirus, la COVID-19, et l’éloignement social désormais nécessaire ont eu des répercussions considérables sur tous les aspects de la vie de chacun, y compris sur les arts. Les organismes du secteur se sont immédiatement conformés aux ordonnances, aux directives et aux recommandations de la directrice provinciale de la santé publique et ont su faire preuve d’un leadership exemplaire en annulant des événements, des spectacles et des festivals afin de protéger la santé du public. Nous sommes conscients que ces décisions ont eu des conséquences importantes pour les artistes, leurs familles et les organismes du milieu.    Mon collègue Bob D’Eith, député de la circonscription de Maple Ridge-Mission et moi-même avons eu des entretiens réguliers avec les dirigeants du milieu des arts et de la culture afin de bien comprendre leurs besoins immédiats au cours de cette pandémie. Dans le but d’aider les gens et les organismes du secteur, nous avons créé un fonds de soutien de 3 millions de dollars pour la résilience du secteur des arts et de la culture, qui sera administré par le BC Arts Council. Dès le début d’avril, ce fonds permettra aux clients en activité et aux projets admissibles de bénéficier d’un supplément pouvant aller jusqu’à 15 000 dollars pour les aider dans le paiement de leurs factures courantes.   À compter d’avril 2020, le BC Arts Council versera à ses clients en activité une avance équivalant à 50 % du financement qui leur avait été accordé pour 2020-2021 afin de les aider à disposer de plus de liquidités. Nous reporterons également les dates limites de dépôt des demandes, assouplirons les exigences de production de rapports et permettrons aux organismes d’utiliser leur financement pour couvrir les dépenses urgentes comme le paiement du loyer ou des services publics.   Ces mesures s’ajoutent au plan d’action de notre gouvernement pour la COVID-19. La nouvelle prestation d’urgence pour les travailleurs, la BC Emergency Benefit for Workers, permettra aussi aux personnes œuvrant dans le secteur des arts et dont le revenu a été affecté par la pandémie de COVID‑19 de déposer une demande afin de recevoir une prestation unique de 1 000 dollars. Le plan de soutien financier de notre gouvernement comprend plusieurs mesures auxquelles les organismes du secteur des arts sont admissibles, notamment le report des dates limites pour l’envoi de déclarations de revenus ou de paiements.   Il s’agit là d’une première étape hautement nécessaire. Ces mesures regroupent ce que nous pouvons faire maintenant, dans le cadre du budget existant du BC Arts Council, pour aider les organismes du secteur des arts au cours de la pandémie. Nous annoncerons d’autres mesures de soutien dans les semaines à venir. »Pour en savoir plus :Soutien à l’échelle provinciale dans le cadre de la pandémie de COVID-19 :

During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the BC Association of Farmers’ Markets (BCAFM) is helping member markets move to an online model to continue providing consumers with locally grown and prepared food products.“It’s important to support your community and each other during this time of uncertainty, and a virtual shopping trip to a farmers market is an easy way to get the groceries on your list and to Buy BC, while ensuring physical distancing measures are being followed,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “Moving farmers markets online will help ensure the health and safety of vendors and consumers, while still providing the same fresh and local food that families all over the province count on.”The 145 BCAFM member farmers markets operating in British Columbia play a key role in many communities’ food supply and support the livelihood of many farmers and their families. These markets are eligible to receive funding to help transition to an online market platform. This will enable them to continue selling their food products to customers in their communities.“The critical importance and resiliency of local food and farmers has never been clearer than now, and B.C. farmers markets are an essential retail sales channel for British Columbians to access local food and sustain the livelihoods of thousands of farmers and food processors across our province,” said Heather O’Hara, executive director, BCAFM. “Our member farmers markets continue to modify their operations to ensure the health and safety of customers, vendors and market organizers alike, and in further response to COVID-19, our new BC Farmers’ Markets Online platform will offer a new shopping channel for the peak farmers market season this summer.”British Columbians can find a farmers market near them and see which markets have launched online operations in the weeks and months ahead at: https://bcfarmersmarkettrail.com/The B.C. government is providing $55,000 to the BCAFM to cover fees for individual farmers markets to join the online platform and set up their digital market store presence. Each participating farmers market will create its own virtual market store to best serve its communities.The funding is part of the Ministry of Agriculture’s Buy BC program. Buy BC helps farmers, ranchers and producers market their products as locally grown, raised, harvested or produced, making it easy for British Columbians to Buy BC.Learn More:As they open, information about active BC Farmers’ Markets Online will be added to: https://bcfarmersmarkettrail.com/

A tentative agreement under the B.C. government’s Sustainable Services Negotiating Mandate has been reached between the members of the BC Teachers’ Federation (BCTF) and the BC Public School Employers’ Association (BCPSEA).The mandate focuses on improving services for people and ensuring fair and affordable compensation.The tentative agreement covers just over 45,000 teachers represented by the BCTF who deliver education to students in the province’s 60 school districts.Further details about the agreement will be available once the ratification processes for the teachers and the employer-members of BCPSEA have been completed.The Sustainable Services Negotiating Mandate supports government’s commitment to improve the services people count on, make life more affordable and invest in sustainable economic growth. The mandate is consistent with B.C.’s commitment to sound fiscal management. It provides parties with the ability to negotiate conditional and modest funding to drive tangible service improvements for people in B.C.Currently, about 290,000 public-sector employees are now covered by tentative or ratified agreements reached under B.C.’s Sustainable Services Negotiating Mandate.Learn More:Learn more about public-sector bargaining in B.C.: www.gov.bc.ca/psecbargaining

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“We are announcing 66 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 725 cases in British Columbia.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 359 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 241 are in the Fraser Health region, 52 are in the Vancouver Island Health region, 62 are in the Interior Health region and 11 are in the Northern Heath region.“Nine long-term care homes in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser health regions have confirmed cases of COVID-19. Public health officials are providing support to implement outbreak protocols.“Provincial health officer orders for public and private health sector employers and long-term care facilities were issued today. These orders ensure employees work at only one facility to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.“One hundred and eighty-six patients with COVID-19 have recovered and no longer have isolation requirements.“Additionally, of the total COVID-19 cases, 66 individuals are currently hospitalized, 26 of those are in intensive care, and the remaining people who have tested positive for COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“The Province continues to take steps to protect and support British Columbians during this pandemic.“In addition to providing immediate Medical Services Plan (MSP) coverage to those moving back to B.C., MSP coverage will also be expanded to temporary foreign workers until July 31, 2020. This is an important step to keep these workers safe and keep goods moving.“We have also provided clinical guidelines to support patients receiving withdrawal treatment that will assist them in self-isolating and help protect their community from COVID-19 transmission.“We are encouraged by the Government of Canada’s decision to put a mandatory 14-day quarantine in place for all travellers entering Canada, and we are reminding people in B.C. about the 14- and 10-day requirements we already have in place here.“The March 17 provincial health officer order mandates that anyone in B.C. who has travelled anywhere outside of Canada must self-isolate for 14 days on their return.“Equally important, if you are presumed or confirmed positive for COVID-19, you are required to self-isolate for 10 days from the onset of symptoms.“Every day that we stay home and stay apart, while still staying connected to friends and loved ones, will bolster our COVID-19 response. You can connect with friends online, you can share stories about your day through photos and videos, and you can make a difference.“We need everyone to be 100% committed now, next week and next month.”Learn More:For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community from COVID-19, and to use an online self-assessment tool, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/The COVID-19 self-assessment app can be downloaded at: https://bc.thrive.health/For non-medical questions about COVID-19, call 1-888-COVID-19 or visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19For a full listing of provincial health officer orders, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topics/covid-19-novel-coronavirusFor the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit:

To help reduce the risks to people who use substances, the Province has announced new clinical guidance, effective immediately, for health-care providers to stem the spread of COVID-19 and respond to the ongoing overdose emergency.The provincial clinical guidance incorporates the federal government’s recent exemptions to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.The dual public health emergencies present unprecedented risks for vulnerable and at-risk people, including safely responding to overdoses related to the increasingly toxic drug supply and withdrawal for those who must self-isolate or quarantine to prevent the spread of COVID-19.“We’re dealing with one public health emergency on top of another, and the challenges are unlike anything we’ve ever seen,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “Physical distancing is not easy when you are living in poverty, visiting a clinic every day to get your medicine and relying on an unpredictable, illegal drug supply. This guidance will make it easier for at-risk people to meet the requirements of distancing while avoiding other serious risks to their health and to the health of the community.”The guidance supports people who are at risk of COVID-19 infection, people who have a confirmed infection or a suspected case pending diagnosis and people who have a history of substance use, including opioids, stimulants, alcohol, benzodiazepines or tobacco.To reduce the risk of transmission, the guidance outlines steps that prescribers, pharmacists and care teams can take to support the provision of medications – including safe prescription alternatives to the illegal drug supply – to be delivered directly to patients, along with telemedicine for clinical assessments.Further, these guidelines indicate the use of prescription alternatives in addition to existing treatment options to prevent the risk associated with the toxic drug supply.“This response is urgently needed to support people who use substances, their families and health care providers,” said Cheyenne Johnson, co-interim executive director, BC Centre on Substance Use. “As the effects of the pandemic continue to unfold, the illicit drug supply is likely to become significantly more adulterated and toxic. Coupled with directions to self-isolate or quarantine and risk potentially dangerous withdrawal as a result, people who use substances are especially vulnerable to the harms of these dual health emergencies.”People who use substances and who have an existing general practitioner or nurse practitioner are encouraged to work with them to access these new supports. Others can contact a rapid access addiction clinic, some of which are equipped to provide telehealth support, consultation for prescribers and patient assessment.While isolating, patients are encouraged to use harm-reduction best practices to prevent overdoses, including practicing safer drug use, buddying up while maintaining a two-metre separation and carrying a naloxone kit.The guidance was developed by the BC Centre on Substance Use with a provincial working group of addiction medicine clinicians and people with lived and living experience, and was reviewed by Ministry of Health, Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions, Office of the Provincial Health Officer and First Nations Health Authority. It has also been reviewed by the College of Physicians and Surgeons of BC, College of Pharmacists of BC and BC College of Nursing Professionals.Learn More: To read the guidance, visit: www.bccsu.ca/covid-19

As part of British Columbia’s emergency novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response plan, the Province is providing the United Way of the Lower Mainland with $50 million to bolster seniors’ supports at community service agencies throughout British Columbia.This will help address immediate needs associated with the impact of COVID-19, so seniors get the support they need to stay safe at home.  The supports are the outcome of work conducted by an all-party COVID-19 Seniors Working Group co-chaired by Isobel Mackenzie, B.C.’s seniors advocate, and the ministry. Members of the working group are Ronna-Rae Leonard, MLA for Courtenay-Comox; Janet Routledge, MLA for Burnaby North; Shirley Bond, MLA for Prince George-Valemount; John Yap, MLA for Richmond-Steveston; and Sonia Furstenau, MLA for Cowichan Valley.“This is a trying time for all of us, but especially for seniors across B.C.,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “I am so proud and appreciative of the work that the seniors advocate and all members of the Seniors Working Group have done to build a plan for safely supporting seniors at home and in community through the COVID-19 pandemic.”The Province is funding the expansion of bc211, a provincewide information and referral service, to match seniors whose support network has been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak with volunteers.Starting today, bc211 will be available to residents of B.C.’s North and Interior, in addition to the rest of B.C., and provide extended hours of service. This service will take calls from people who would like to volunteer to help seniors in their community with basic needs, including grocery shopping and pharmacy drop-offs and check-ins.“Seniors in B.C. are especially vulnerable to the impact COVID-19 will have on their health and their ability to stay connected with others,” Mackenzie said. ""The outpouring of calls from people who want to help our seniors is inspiring, and using bc211 to match British Columbians who want to help, with seniors who need some help to stay connected and meet basic needs, is a perfect match.”The funding provided to the United Way of the Lower Mainland will address immediate needs associated with the impact of COVID-19, as well as maintain and expand some existing programs.“We’re excited to be collaborating with bc211 and the Ministry of Health to deliver these essential supports to seniors,” said Michael McKnight, president and CEO, United Way of the Lower Mainland. “It is important that we support our most vulnerable citizens during this challenging time with local communities and community agencies being essential to these efforts. If you are a senior in need of support, we urge you to reach out.”Improving access to local support for seniors includes expanding current services and addressing both geographic and capacity gaps, to better serve seniors locally during this crucial time.Quick Facts:
In 2019, 20% of B.C.’s population was 65 years of age or older. In 15 years, this percentage is expected to rise to 25%.
The information and referral service will gather information and share it with participating local community agencies that will match seniors and volunteers who live in the same community.
The phone service will be available seven days a week during daytime hours and is free.

Construction continues on the Highway 4 Kennedy Hill Safety Improvement Project, with the project currently at 60% complete.However, due to a variety of factors, the project will not be completed in summer 2020 as originally scheduled.Factors affecting the completion date include the fast-evolving COVID-19 pandemic, the need for more complex blasts due to variable rock, increased environmental protections and the repairs to Highway 4 resulting from blasting damage at the project site in January.Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was anticipated that final paving would take place in fall 2020, with completion in this coming winter due to the necessary blasting and repair work. However, the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure acknowledges the possibility of more delays as a result of the developing situation with COVID-19. The ministry and the contractor are committed to working together to mitigate any schedule delays.Blasting on site continues to be the key activity. Once the rock bluffs have been lowered to highway grade in the next few months, the contractor will be able to shorten highway closures. This will improve access for residents and visitors.The excavation at this project site has been particularly complex. Design adjustments have been made to reduce the amount of rock and earth removed by about 130,000 cubic metres. Three cantilever bridge structures will be added, and the new rest area will now be located on the lake side of the highway. These adjustments will help reduce project risk associated with blasting without requiring further schedule extension.The Highway 4 Kennedy Hill Safety Improvement Project will create a safer and more reliable connection between Port Alberni and the west coast of Vancouver Island.The ministry thanks area residents and other people who rely on the highway for their patience and understanding during construction and the changing schedule.  Learn More:To listen to the travel information hotline message, updated daily during construction, call 1 855 451-7152.General project information and traffic schedules are available at: www.gov.bc.ca/highway4kennedyhillVisit the project page on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/eac.bc.ca.kennedy.hill/Follow @DriveBC and #BCHwy4 on Twitter or visit: www.drivebc.caFor more information on the emergency support hubs for commercial truck drivers, recreational vehicles and campers, contact Pacific Rim National Park Reserve at 250 726-3524.Guidance to construction sites operating during COVID-19 is available at: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020EMBC0002-000542

The provincial government has introduced a series of ministerial orders under the Emergency Program Act to support its ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
These orders do not override First Nations jurisdiction. Local states of emergency issued by First Nations for their communities continue to apply.
First Nations usually declare states of emergency through band council resolutions or issuing a declaration. The Province continues to recognize First Nations’ states of emergency, and to support First Nations in managing COVID-19 through agencies including Emergency Management BC and First Nations Health Authority.
Some First Nations under their local states of emergency have issued travel restrictions related to non-essential travel into their communities, and the Province respects these emergency declarations.
At this time, the Province is not issuing orders that affect travel into or out of First Nations communities. The Province will work to support First Nations if they seek to assert measures they deem necessary regarding travel restrictions in the coming days.
The provincial health officer recommends against all non-essential travel at this time in order to reduce the spread of COVID-19.
First Nations Health Authority, Emergency Management BC and Indigenous Services Canada have been working with First Nations to secure essential supplies and equipment for managing the COVID-19 pandemic. The interests of First Nations and Indigenous communities and organizations will continue to be an essential part of the work of the new Provincial Supply Chain Coordination Unit.
The suite of emergency orders was issued March 26, 2020, by the minister of public safety and solicitor general under the Emergency Program Act.
In early 2019, the provincial government initiated work on modernizing this emergency management legislation. To date, there has been extensive Indigenous engagement on proposed changes, including five regional Indigenous engagement sessions with more than 80 participants from over 60 First Nations.
Emergency Management BC is taking that feedback to further refine this work. The Province will ensure ongoing involvement of Indigenous peoples as the new legislation is developed, in keeping with the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act.
Emergency Management BC is holding regular regional public health co-ordination calls on COVID-19 for local governments and First Nations across all regions.

Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, is using extraordinary powers under a state of provincial emergency to keep British Columbians safe, maintain essential goods and services, and support the Province’s ongoing response to novel coronavirus (COVID-19).“B.C. is in a strong position to effectively respond to and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Farnworth. “Informed by the direction of the provincial health officer, we’re taking these critical steps to keep our communities safe, goods moving and essential service workers supported.”Using the extraordinary powers under the Emergency Program Act, the minister is issuing a series of ministerial orders to ensure a co-ordinated response to COVID-19 across all levels of government for the duration of the provincial emergency. These include:
Supply chain: Establishing a new Provincial Supply Chain Coordination Unit to co-ordinate goods and services distribution; taking a more active role in co-ordinating essential goods and services movement by land, air, marine and rail; and suspending any bylaws that restrict goods delivery at any time of day.
Protecting consumers: Banning the secondary resale of food, medical supplies, personal protective equipment, cleaning and other essential supplies; and restricting quantities of items purchased at point of sale. 
Enforcement: Enabling municipal bylaw officers to support enforcement of the provincial health officer’s orders for business closures and gatherings, in line with offences under the Public Health Act.
Travel: Ensuring all passenger and car-ferry services provide minimum service levels and priority access for residents, and essential goods and workers.
Protecting B.C.’s most vulnerable: Making it easier to support critical services for vulnerable people, like food banks and shelters.
Co-ordination: Suspending local states of emergency specific to the COVID-19 pandemic, except for the City of Vancouver; giving municipal councils the ability to hold more flexible meetings to expedite decisions; and co-ordinating potential use of local publicly owned facilities, like community centres, for self-isolation, testing, medical care, warehousing and distribution.
These unprecedented steps, made based on the recommendation of B.C.’s health and emergency management officials and invoked for the first time under a provincial state of emergency, will support the provincial health officer and minister of health in a co-ordinated cross-government approach to COVID-19 response and recovery.Farnworth added, “Many local governments, First Nations and partners have stepped up to make sure they have prepared to protect their communities from the impacts of COVID-19. Today’s measures will make sure communities are taking necessary steps, in co-ordination with the Province, to get ready should more action be required to combat COVID-19.”The Province, in consultation with the Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, has defined essential services British Columbians rely on in their daily lives in the context of COVID-19 response and recovery. This is distinct from essential service designations under the Province's Labour Relations Code.In consultation with the provincial health officer, any business or service that has not been ordered to close, and is also not identified on the essential service list, may stay open if it can adapt its services and workplace to the orders and recommendations of the PHO.“In these new and challenging times we are facing, we’re asking British Columbians to stay strong as a community, and together we can get through this,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “I’m proud of the strategic measures we have enacted government-wide to help our families and health-care workers, to keep them safe and supported. By issuing a series of ministerial orders, we recognize that this is not forever, but it is for now. With everyone stepping in and respecting the extraordinary means we have to take, we will overcome this.”Farnworth declared a provincial state of emergency on March 18, 2020, after the provincial health officer declared a public health emergency on March 17. The Province previously declared states of emergency in 1998, 2003, 2017 and 2018 – all related to wildfires. In each of those previous declarations, necessary actions were able to be taken without issuing minister’s orders under the Emergency Program Act.Quick Facts:
Declarations of provincial states of emergency may be issued by the minister responsible under the Emergency Program Act.
The provincial government can extend the period of a declaration made by the minister responsible for further periods of time.
During the 2017 wildfire season, the Province was in a provincial state of emergency for 10 weeks from July 7 to Sept. 15.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“We are announcing 42 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 659 cases in British Columbia.“One additional residential care home now has a confirmed case – a health-care worker at the Broadway Pentecostal Lodge in the Vancouver Coastal health region. Public health officials are providing support to implement outbreak protocols.“It is with sadness we share that one more resident of the Lynn Valley Care Centre has passed away. That brings us to a total of 14 people who have died after testing positive for COVID-19. We extend our condolences to their loved ones.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 339 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 218 are in the Fraser Health region, 47 are in the Vancouver Island Health region, 46 are in the Interior Health region and nine are in the Northern Heath region.“Additionally, of the total COVID-19 cases, 64 individuals are currently hospitalized, 26 of those in hospital are in intensive care and the remaining people who have tested positive for COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“One hundred and eighty-three patients with COVID-19 are now considered fully recovered and no longer have isolation requirements.“An order is in place prohibiting gatherings larger than 50 people. This is not an order of convenience, but a requirement to protect everyone in our province – especially our elders and those most vulnerable to severe illness – from COVID-19.“We remind all British Columbians that while 50 is the maximum number, the smaller, the better. Community connection is very important during this challenging time, but it must be done safely, either virtually or with physical distance. Celebrations and ceremonies that bring many people together, including our elders and seniors, need to be postponed.“With enhanced cleaning and physical distancing precautions in place, we can keep everyone safe and keep many businesses, including all the essential services we need, going.“There are a number of new resources and tools available to help British Columbians who may have questions about COVID-19. Together, we can make a difference.”Learn More:For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community from COVID-19 and to use an online self-assessment tool, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/The self-assessment app can be downloaded at: https://bc.thrive.health/For non-health questions about COVID-19, call 1 888 COVID-19 or visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities:

To support people and prevent the spread of COVID-19, the Province is introducing a new temporary rental supplement, halting evictions and freezing rents, among other actions.  The new rental supplement will help households by offering up to $500 a month towards their rent, building on federal and provincial financial supports already announced for British Columbians facing financial hardship.“With lost jobs and lost wages due to COVID-19, many tenants are worried they can’t make the rent. It’s a challenging time for landlords too,” said Premier John Horgan. “Nobody should lose their home as a result of COVID-19. Our plan will give much-needed financial relief to renters and landlords. It will also provide more security for renters, who will be able to stay in their homes without fear of eviction or increasing rents during this emergency.”The funds will support renters experiencing a loss of income by helping them pay their rent and will be paid directly to landlords on their behalf, to ensure landlords continue to receive rental income during the pandemic. Benefiting people with low to moderate incomes, this supplement will be available to renters who are facing financial hardship as a result of the COVID-19 crisis, but do not qualify for existing rental assistance programs.“People are feeling a lot of fear and anxiety and they need to be able to depend on the comfort and stability of home right now. Our government is taking steps to help take some of the pressure off renters and landlords and protect people’s health,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “We’re helping renters pay rent and giving them the peace of mind that they have a stable home in these unprecedented times, and ensuring that landlords can count on some rental income right now to keep them afloat too.”Spencer Chandra Herbert, MLA for Vancouver-West End, who led the Province’s Rental Housing Task Force, consulted with a broad range of tenant and landlord organizations to inform the development of these actions that meet the needs of both landlords and tenants during the pandemic.“As we work together to fight this pandemic, we can’t afford to leave anyone behind,” Chandra Herbert said. “That’s why I delivered recommendations that address the immediate concerns of both landlords and tenants who are doing their best at this difficult time.”The Province is implementing a number of additional measures to keep people housed and protect their health. The full list of immediate measures includes:
The new temporary rent supplement will provide up to $500 per month, paid directly to landlords.
Halting evictions by ensuring a landlord may not issue a new notice to end tenancy for any reason. However, in exceptional cases where it may be needed to protect health and safety or to prevent undue damage to the property, landlords will be able to apply to the Residential Tenancy Branch for a hearing.
Halting the enforcement of existing eviction orders issued by the Residential Tenancy Branch, except in extreme cases where there are safety concerns. The smaller number of court ordered evictions are up to the courts, which operate independently of government.
Freezing new annual rent increases during the state of emergency.
Preventing landlords from accessing rental units without the consent of the tenant (for example, for showings or routine maintenance), except in exceptional cases where it is  needed to protect health and safety or to prevent undue damage to the unit.
Restricting methods that renters and landlords can use to serve notices to reduce the potential transmission of COVID-19 (no personal service and allowing email).
Allowing landlords to restrict the use of common areas by tenants or guests to protect against the transmission of COVID-19.
To further support renters and landlords, the Residential Tenancy Branch will implement several additional actions, including adjourning and rescheduling hearings in situations where people need additional time to prepare and extending timelines for filing applications for dispute resolution.These latest steps are part of government’s $5-billion COVID-19 Action Plan to provide income supports, tax relief and direct funding for people, businesses and services.Learn More:For information about the temporary rental supplement, including eligibility criteria, visit: http://bchousing.org/bctrs

As challenges caused by novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continue to shift, the B.C. government and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer (PHO), are taking unprecedented measures to slow transmission.On March 16, 2020, Henry issued an order under the Public Health Act prohibiting gatherings of more than 50 people.On March 18, 2020, the chief inspector of mines (CIM) communicated to all major mines, sand and gravel, and placer operations in B.C. with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further to the guidance provided by the CIM that all mines must follow the public health order, the PHO is directing all mines and smelters to take additional precautions to minimize the risks of COVID-19 transmission and illness to their employees.While mine sites are not considered to be gatherings of more than 50 people, the PHO has provided the following directions for day-to-day production and site operations:
Reduce the number of on-site personnel by encouraging work from home where feasible.
Daily pre-shift safety meetings (toolbox meetings) affecting more than 50 people are to be held in smaller numbers or via other media, such as by phone or video conferencing.
In-person town-hall meetings used to address the whole site must be avoided for groups of more than 50 people. Communication should continue in smaller groups or via other means.
There should be no more than 50 people in the same space in any circumstance. This includes common areas in bunkhouses and cafeterias.
Where possible, employees should maintain a distance of two metres from each other. This distancing is as important outside of work hours as it is during work hours.
Post signage that limits the number of occupants in any elevator to four people at a time.
Reduce in‐person meetings and gatherings. Where feasible, hold site meetings in open spaces or outside.
Increase the number of handwashing stations. Post signage that identifies their location.
Maintain a list of employees who are currently working on site. Update this list daily.
All common areas and surfaces are to be cleaned as needed, and at the end of each shift. Examples include washrooms, shared offices, common tables, desks, light switches and door handles.
Self-isolation can end 14 days after the last contact or return to Canada if you have not developed symptoms.
With or without a history of travel, if you have respiratory symptoms that can be managed at home, self-isolate at home for at least 10 days after onset of symptoms. After 10 days, if your temperature is normal and you feel better, you can return to your routine activities.
Coughing may persist for several weeks, so a cough alone does not mean you need to continue to self-isolate for more than 10 days.

Anyone who has been in contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 must self-isolate at home for 14 days.
Visitors must be essential to the mine site’s operation.
These requirements also pertain to transportation to and from mines. All employees are reminded to follow direction of the PHO regarding physical distancing when off site.Employers should reassess their work environment every day and keep up to date with the information posted on the Province’s COVID-19 website: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19The B.C. government is doing everything it can to help contain the spread of COVID-19. The safety of British Columbians remains its top priority.Learn More:For more information on the COVID-19 response, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19

The B.C. government and provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry are taking unprecedented measures to slow the transmission of COVID-19.Henry recently issued an order under the Public Health Act prohibiting gatherings of more than 50 people at a place where a person is the owner, occupier or operator, or for which they are otherwise responsible. Employers in the manufacturing sector are asking for clarity about what this means for them.The public health officer is directing employers to take all necessary precautions to minimize the risks of COVID-19 transmission and illness to themselves and their employees. This includes:
There should be no more than 50 people in the same space in any circumstances.
Employees must be able to maintain a distance of two metres apart from each other.
Reduce in-person meetings and other gatherings and hold shop meetings in open spaces or outside.
Increase the number of handwashing stations and post signage that identifies their location. Handwashing stations must be added if none currently exist.
Maintain a list of employees who are currently working in each shop and update this list daily.
All common areas and surfaces should be cleaned at the end of each day. Examples include washrooms, shared offices, common tables, desks, light switches and door handles.
Self-isolation can end 14 days after the last contact or return to Canada if you have not developed symptoms.
With or without a history of travel, if you have respiratory symptoms that can be managed at home, self-isolate at home for at least 10 days after onset of symptoms. After 10 days, if your temperature is normal and you feel better, you can return to your routine activities.
Coughing may persist for several weeks, so a cough alone does not mean you need to continue to self-isolate for more than 10 days.

Section 4.85 of the Occupational Health and Safety Regulation provides for a minimum standard around the provision of washrooms and handwashing facilities. Where plumbed facilities are not feasible, employers must provide access to portable washroom and handwashing facilities. Those facilities must be maintained in good working order and be provided with the supplies necessary for their use.Employers should reassess their work environment every day and keep updated with the information posted on the Province’s COVID-19 website: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19The B.C. government is doing everything it can to help contain the spread of COVID-19.

600,2020-03-24 17:25:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020HLTH0105-000556,Government Website,Joint statement on Province of B.C.'s COVID-19 response and latest updates,"

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“Today, we are providing case updates for two 24-hour reporting periods: March 22 to 23, and March 23 through to this morning.“In the first reporting period through March 23, 2020, we had 67 new cases, for a total of 539 cases in British Columbia.“In the last 24 hours, we have had 78 new cases, for a total of 617 cases in British Columbia.“This represents 145 new cases since we reported yesterday morning.“Two additional residential care homes have confirmed cases. One is a health-care worker at the Little Mountain Place residential care home in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, and one is a resident in Evergreen Heights assisted-living residence in the Fraser Health region. Public health officials are providing staff support to implement outbreak protocols.

“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 330 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 194 are in the Fraser Health region, 44 are in the Vancouver Island Health region, 41 are in the Interior Health region and eight are in the Northern Heath region.“In total, there have been 13 deaths from COVID-19 in British Columbia, in large part as a result of the clusters in long-term care homes.“We are very pleased to report that 28% of cases, or 173 individuals, have now recovered and are no longer in isolation.“Additionally, of the total COVID-19 cases, 59 individuals are currently hospitalized, 23 of those are in intensive care, and the remaining people who have tested positive for COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“As the escalating numbers across B.C. show us, there is circulation and risk of COVID-19 throughout British Columbia. While the majority of known cases are in the Lower Mainland, no community or individual is immune – whether in the North, on Vancouver Island, young or old.“We must remind ourselves that the virus can spread with minimal symptoms and that is why physical distancing, especially staying away from people at higher risk, is so critically important at this time.“Equally important is for all of us to know that, despite the challenges before us, our province and our country will get through this. Let’s continue to join together and support each other.“We continue to look to the World Health Organization, and other parts of the world with major outbreaks, to learn and adapt our response here in B.C. This is informing our strategy on testing and hospitalization.“To help British Columbians who may have questions about COVID-19 symptoms, yesterday we launched a self-assessment app. In the last 24 hours, 18,800 users have downloaded it. The online self assessment tool on the BC Centre for Disease Control website has also been used almost 2.5 million times since its launch last week.“Later this week, we will present our latest epidemiological modelling.”Learn More:For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community from COVID-19, and to use an online self-assessment tool, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/The self-assessment app can be downloaded at: https://bc.thrive.health/For non-medical questions about COVID-19, call 1-888-COVID-19 or visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities:

602,2020-03-24 12:11:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020ENV0014-000553,Government Website,"Province closing certain parks, recreation areas","

BC Parks continues to monitor whether people visiting provincial parks are complying with the physical distancing required to stop the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19).Parks throughout British Columbia are seeing an increase in visitors, but many people are not complying with the provincial health officer’s (PHO) requirement for families and individuals to stay at least two metres away from others. This puts the most vulnerable populations at risk. BC Parks has heard concerns from the public, RCMP and First Nations, as well as regional and municipal governments about the increase in visitors and is implementing full closures of certain parks throughout the province.“The mental and physical wellness benefit of being outside during the COVID-19 pandemic response is important, but keeping people safe right now is the most important thing we can be doing,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “Until we flatten the transmission curve of COVID-19 and people strictly comply with the PHO physical distancing requirement, provincial park access will be restricted.”These closures are in addition to a previous suspension of services and facilities in provincial parks, including visitor centres, nature houses, washrooms and day-use areas. In alignment with Parks Canada, all campgrounds are closed until April 30, 2020.  BC Parks will continue to monitor the COVID-19 outbreak closely and follow the direction and advice set out by the PHO and the Ministry of Health. Additional provincial park closures may be implemented on a case-by-case basis where and when required. People who still choose to visit provincial parks should be mindful that they are responsible for their own safety and that washroom facilities will not be available.In addition to the BC Parks closures, the Recreation Sites and Trails BC (RSTBC) branch of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development is closing its campgrounds and amenities in response to the COVID-19 situation.“We want to do whatever we can to make sure British Columbians have access to this province’s great outdoor recreation opportunities, but this is an unprecedented situation and we need to protect everyone’s health,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development.RSTBC campgrounds are generally located in remote areas and provide basic facilities. Potable water and electricity are not provided. The temporary closure includes RSTBC campgrounds where there is an increased likelihood of close contact with frequently touched surfaces, including toilets, kiosks, ticket booths, overnight shelters and day-use shelters. Day-use shelters, backcountry cabins, warming huts, ticket booths at snowmobile areas and other built facilities will be closed.Backcountry trails will remain open, but maintenance services, including grooming, have been suspended. Trail users are encouraged to use local facilities and not travel for recreation purposes. The facilities accessed by these groups will also remain closed.Learn More: For status updates on BC Parks closures, visit the BC Parks website: http://BCParks.caFor status updates on RSTBC campgrounds, visit:

Close to 60 new supportive homes with around-the-clock supports are opening in Vancouver, as a result of a partnership between the Government of B.C., the City of Vancouver and the Government of Canada.“Everyone deserves a safe and secure place to call home,” said Selina Robinson, Minister for Municipal Affairs and Housing. “We are taking urgent action with our partners because when people have housing, the entire community benefits.”Located at 3598 Copley St., Naomi Place consists of a three-storey building with 58 self-contained homes. Each of the units includes a private washroom and mini kitchen. The building also includes a commercial kitchen, dining and lounge areas, storage and amenity space, and laundry and medical examination rooms.Community Builders, a non-profit organization that has been providing supportive housing in Vancouver since 2001, will operate the building. It will provide residents with support services, including meal programs, life and employment skills training, health and wellness supports and opportunities for volunteer work. At least two staff members will be on site 24/7.“On behalf of the Community Builders staff and team, we are honoured to be part of this new temporary modular housing site in partnership with the City of Vancouver and BC Housing and assist in the delivery of 58 more housing spaces for those in Vancouver that need it most,” said Julie Roberts, executive director, Community Builders. “We know the opportunity to move into this building will be life changing for the 58 people who will soon call Naomi Place home. We look forward to being part of community-wide efforts to welcome our new residents and integrate this temporary modular housing site with its surrounding neighbourhood.”Naomi Place will prioritize homes for people who are currently experiencing homelessness in the same neighbourhood as the development. BC Housing worked with its partners to identify people experiencing homelessness in the local area to move them into these homes. Residents started moving into these homes on March 23, 2020.The Province is also providing funding to keep Vancouver’s temporary shelters open. These 238 beds, operated across seven shelters, will remain open after April 1 to make sure people have access to a safe place to sleep, sanitation facilities and other supports.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:
The Province is providing $8.4 million to the project, as well as an annual operating subsidy of approximately $878,500.
The City of Vancouver provided the land for the project.
In just more than two years, the Province has built more than 2,100 supportive homes in communities around B.C., with more than 900 more underway and a goal of 4,900 over 10 years.
Learn More:New reports show that supportive housing for people experiencing homelessness is substantially improving the quality of life for residents and reducing their use of emergency health services. The full reports and a summary of the results can be found here: https://www.bchousing.org/modular-supportive-housing-resident-outcomes-reportsA map showing the location of all announced provincially funded housing projects in B.C. is available online: https://www.bchousing.org/homes-for-BCTo learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/A backgrounder follows.

The Province has made two significant changes to the Employment Standards Act to better support workers both during the COVID-19 public health emergency and in the long term.Firstly, changes will allow workers to immediately take unpaid, job-protected leave if they are unable to work for reasons relating to COVID-19. This means workers who are ill, need to self-isolate, need to care for their child or other dependent, or whose employer is concerned that the employee may expose others to risk, will be able to take leave without putting their job at risk.“These proactive changes ensure that no one will lose their jobs for prioritizing their health and safety, or the health and safety of their loved ones and their community,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “Given these extraordinary times, we are ensuring that the legislation provides protections for those impacted by COVID-19.”The leave will be retroactive to Jan. 27, 2020, the date that the first presumptive COVID-19 case was confirmed in B.C. During this public health emergency, people can take this job-protected leave for as long as the circumstance that requires them to be away from work applies.  Secondly, to better support workers on an ongoing basis, the changes also provide up to three days of unpaid, job-protected leave each year for people who cannot work due to illness or injury. This is a permanent change to the act that brings B.C. in line with all other provinces in Canada.“This crisis has highlighted the importance of having permanent job-protected illness or injury leave in place for people in this province,” said Harry Bains, Minister of Labour. “We’re stepping up and bringing in this new leave to support workers over the long term, beyond this crisis.”While on job-protected leave related to the COVID-19 crisis, workers may also be eligible for financial support through expanded Employment Insurance benefits through the federal government.Improving fairness for workers and ensuring balance in workplaces are shared priorities between government and the BC Green Party caucus and are part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Learn More:It is important that all employers and workers understand their rights, obligations and where to go for assistance — as well as keep informed of both the provincial and federal supports for workers and businesses as they become available.For up-to-date, non-health information, including provincial and federal programs, call 1 888 COVID-19 or visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/emergency-preparedness-response-recovery/covid-19-provincial-supportFor more information on B.C.’s employment standards, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-business/employment-standards-advice/employment-standardsFor more information on federal Employment Insurance sickness benefits, visit: https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-sickness.htmlFive things to know about job-protected leaves: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/COVID19_Job_Protected_Leave_Factsheet.pdfA backgrounder follows.Translations:Punjabi: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020-Mar23_Punjabi-NR_Three-DayLeave_COVID-19_ESA_Amendments.pdfTagalog: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/NR-Three-Day-Leave-COVID-19-ESA-Amendments_Tagalog.pdfChinese: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/NR-Three-Day-Leave-and-COVID-19-ESA-amendments_CN.pdfFarsi: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/NR-Three-Day-Leave-COVID-19-ESA-Amendments_Farsi.pdfFrench: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/NR-Three-Day-Leave-COVID-19-ESA-Amendments_FR.pdfKorean: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/NR-Three-Day-Leave-COVID-19-ESA-Amendments_KN.pdf

Les Britanno-Colombiens touchés par la pandémie de la COVID-19 bénéficieront de 5 milliards $ de soutien du revenu, d’allègement fiscal et de financement direct pour les personnes, les entreprises et les services.« La pandémie de la COVID-19 pose des défis pour notre santé, notre économie et notre mode de vie. Les personnes et les entreprises ont besoin d’être soutenues de toute urgence, a déclaré le premier ministre John Horgan. Notre plan d’action est axé sur les services qui protègent la santé et la sécurité des personnes, il apporte une aide immédiate aux personnes et aux entreprises et il organise le rétablissement à long terme de l’économie de la Colombie-Britannique. »Le plan d’action face à la COVID-19 est la première initiative du gouvernement pour venir en aide aux personnes et aux entreprises en Colombie-Britannique. Ce plan alloue 2,8 milliards $ pour aider les personnes et financer les services dont elles ont besoin pour traverser la crise et 2,2 milliards $ pour venir en aide aux entreprises et pour les aider à se rétablir après la flambée du virus.Le plan d’action de la Colombie-Britannique face à la COVID-19 s’appuie sur le plan économique fédéral et renforce les soutiens pour les Britanno-Colombiens afin que le paiement de leurs factures et leur maintien à flot ne soient pas source d’inquiétude.Soutenir les personnes et les services dont elles dépendentLe plan comprend des mesures immédiates pour aider les individus et les familles à faire face à d’éventuelles maladies, à des difficultés financières ou à des emplois précaires. Il augmente également le financement de services fondamentaux, comme les soins de santé, le logement et les services sociaux, pour s’assurer qu’ils continuent à soutenir les Britanno-Colombiens et qu’ils contribuent à enrayer la propagation de la COVID-19.« Tant que cette crise durera, nous devrons assurer la sécurité des Britanno-Colombiens et la disponibilité des services vitaux, a affirmé la ministre des Finances Carole James. Cela veut dire permettre aux gens de payer leurs factures, de rester chez eux en sécurité et de subvenir aux besoins de leurs familles en cette période exceptionnelle. »Des 2,8 milliards $ consacrés aux services et aux soutiens dont les Britanno-Colombiens auront besoin en ces temps difficiles, le gouvernement de la province affecte 1,1 milliard $ au renforcement du revenu des personnes touchées par la COVID-19.Une nouvelle prestation d’urgence pour les travailleurs de la Colombie-Britannique, d’un montant de 1 000 dollars non imposable, sera versée aux Britanno-Colombiens que la flambée du virus empêche de travailler. Cette prestation sera un paiement exceptionnel pour les Britanno-Colombiens qui perçoivent l’assurance-emploi fédérale (AE) ou la nouvelle allocation de soins d’urgence fédérale ou la nouvelle allocation de soutien d’urgence fédérale à cause de la COVID-19. Les bénéficiaires seront notamment les travailleurs qui ont été mis à pied, qui sont malades ou placés en quarantaine, les parents d’enfants malades, les parents qui s’absentent du travail pendant la fermeture des garderies et des écoles et ceux qui prennent soin de membres de leur famille qui sont malades, comme un parent âgé. Ces travailleurs pourront être admissibles ou non à l’AE, comme les travailleurs autonomes. Cette prestation sera versée aux résidents de la Colombie-Britannique en plus des soutiens du revenu fédéraux.Le plan d’action face à la COVID-19 comprend d’autres mesures de renforcement des soutiens du revenu, dont l’augmentation et l’expansion du crédit pour la taxe sur les mesures climatiques de la Colombie-Britannique en juillet. Pas moins de 86 % des Britanno-Colombiens bénéficieront ainsi de fonds supplémentaires. Les familles admissibles de quatre personnes recevront jusqu’à 564 $ et les individus admissibles jusqu’à 218 $ grâce à cette augmentation du montant habituel du crédit pour la taxe sur les mesures climatiques qui pourra s’élever jusqu’à 112,50 $ par famille de quatre personnes et jusqu’à 43,50 $ par adulte.La prestation d’urgence pour les travailleurs et l’augmentation du crédit pour la taxe sur les mesures climatiques de la Colombie-Britannique compléteront l’une et l’autre les soutiens du revenu et aideront les personnes aux prises avec la perte de leur emploi, la baisse de leur revenu ou la hausse des coûts liée à la crise dans l’immédiat.La province veut avant tout assurer la sécurité et la santé des Britanno-Colombiens et les soutenir pendant toute la durée de la pandémie de la COVID-19. À cette fin, le plan d’action octroie 1,7 milliard $ pour les services qui leur sont indispensables.Ces fonds de 1,7 milliard $ financeront notamment des investissements dans l’aide au logement et les refuges, les programmes d’aide au revenu et aux personnes handicapées et les services de santé indispensables, comme l’assistance téléphonique du BC Centre for Disease Control. Ils financeront également les mesures de quarantaine, les tests de laboratoire et les travaux en cours à l’Autorité sanitaire des Premières Nations et au programme Better at Home de Centraide pour les aînés.Pour soutenir les organismes sans but lucratif, les organismes de prestation de services et les fournisseurs de services de garde d’enfants, la province maintiendra leur financement, même si ces organismes sont fermés ou si leurs activités habituelles sont perturbées. Les fournisseurs de services de garde d’enfants agréés qui resteront ouverts recevront un financement plus important afin de poursuivre leurs activités. Ces garderies sont admissibles à recevoir du gouvernement des fonds d’exploitation sept fois supérieurs à leur montant mensuel moyen, ce qui devrait couvrir approximativement 75 % de leurs dépenses d’exploitation mensuelles moyennes.Pour aider les personnes ayant contracté des prêts étudiants de la Colombie-Britannique, la province gèlera les paiements des prêts étudiants pendant six mois à partir du 30 mars 2020. Les paiements des prêts étudiants fédéraux sont également gelés.Les Britanno-Colombiens qui ont besoin de plus de temps pour régler leurs factures peuvent également présenter une demande aux programmes d’étalement des paiements existants d’ICBC et de BC Hydro. ICBC reporte les paiements pendant une période pouvant aller jusqu’à 90 jours. Les personnes qui subissent la perte de leur emploi, une baisse de salaire ou qui sont malades à cause de la COVID-19 peuvent aussi être admissibles à recevoir jusqu’à 600 $ du programme de subventions du fonds de crise pour les clients de BC Hydro.Soutenir les entreprisesL’assise économique de la Colombie-Britannique est solide, mais les répercussions de la COVID‑19 se font sentir partout au pays et dans le monde entier. Cette pandémie touchera chaque aspect de l’économie de la province. Le plan d’action face à la COVID-19 aidera les entreprises à traverser la crise dans l’immédiat et préparera le terrain pour qu’elles puissent se remettre sur pied après la crise.Dès maintenant, les entreprises à la masse salariale supérieure à 500 000 $ pourront reporter les paiements de leur impôt santé jusqu’au 30 septembre 2020. Les entreprises dont la masse salariale est inférieure à ce seuil sont déjà exemptées de cette taxe.En plus de l’impôt santé des employeurs, la province reporte au 30 septembre 2020 la date limite pour les déclarations d’impôt et les paiements pour la taxe de vente provinciale, la taxe municipale et la taxe de district régional, la taxe sur le tabac, la taxe sur l’essence pour véhicules automobiles et la taxe sur les émissions carboniques. La hausse de la taxe sur les émissions carboniques prévue pour le 1er avril, ainsi que les nouvelles exigences en matière d’inscription de taxe de vente provinciale pour le commerce électronique et la mise en œuvre de la taxe de vente provinciale pour les boissons gazeuses sucrées seront retardées et leur calendrier sera révisé d’ici le 30 septembre 2020.L’impôt scolaire applicable aux catégories des biens commerciaux et des biens industriels standard et majeurs sera réduit de moitié. Cela offrira aux entreprises propriétaires de leurs locaux un allègement immédiat de 500 millions $ qui permettra aux propriétaires de locaux commerciaux de faire bénéficier immédiatement de ces économies leurs locataires liés par des baux hypernets.À plus long terme, le plan de rétablissement consacrera du financement aux secteurs de l’économie durement touchés, comme le tourisme, l’accueil et la culture. Le gouvernement de la Colombie-Britannique élabore un plan de stimulation économique, de concert avec les dirigeants d’entreprises et les dirigeants syndicaux. La province a alloué 1,5 milliard $ au rétablissement économique.En savoir plusPour consulter le plan d’action de la Colombie-Britannique face à la COVID-19 et d’autres ressources et mises à jour gouvernementales, allez à : www.gov.bc.ca/covid19Pour vous renseigner sur le Plan d’intervention économique du Canada pour répondre à la COVID-19, allez à : https://www.canada.ca/fr/ministere-finances/plan-intervention-economique.htmlPour les renseignements non médicaux liés à la COVID-19, composez le 1 888 COVID-19.Pour obtenir de plus amples renseignements sur l’aide apportée aux personnes et aux entreprises par le plan d’action de la Colombie-Britannique face à la COVID-19, allez à : http://news.gov.bc.ca/factsheets/bc-takes-steps-to-support-people-businesses-duringcovid-19-pandemic

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“We are announcing 48 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 472 cases in British Columbia, since we last reported on Saturday, March 21, 2020.“It is with sadness we share that three more patients have passed away after testing positive for COVID-19: one at the Lynn Valley Care Centre, one at the Haro Park Centre and one a resident of Fraser Health who was receiving treatment at home. That brings us to a total of 13 people who have died after testing positive for COVID-19. We extend our condolences to their loved ones.“Of the new cases, one patient is a health-care worker at the German-Canadian Care Home in Vancouver Coastal Health and one is a health-care worker at the Delta View Care Centre in Fraser Health.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 248 are in Vancouver Coastal Health, 150 are in Fraser Health, 39 are in Island Health, 30 are in Interior Health and five are in Northern Heath.“Additionally, of the total COVID-19 cases, 33 individuals are currently hospitalized and 14 of them are in intensive care. We are pleased to report that 100 patients have recovered, and the remaining people who have tested positive for COVID-19 are recovering at home in self-isolation.“The significant increase in confirmed recoveries is a result of many people who have been recovering in self isolation, with mild symptoms, meeting newly established criteria for recovery.“Our testing capacity has increased to about 3,000 tests per day, and that capacity will continue to increase this week.“The number of 811 calls we are able to answer has increased to more than 4,000 calls per day, as a result of adding 12 more nurses and 42 more navigators to our call centres.“Over the last week, several new physical distancing measures have been put in place around the province, in health regions and individual communities.“The gravity of the situation cannot be overstated, and everyone must do all they can to support our efforts break the chain of transmission and flatten the outbreak curve.“Our health-care workers are at the heart of our pandemic response and they face the added risks of exposure both in the community and at work.“Enhanced screening is in place for health-care workers, as well as clear guidance for appropriate use of personal protective equipment. As individuals, health-care workers must also have a heightened awareness of symptoms and maintain physical distance from others, as much as possible.“The Province of B.C. continues to put new tools in place to support British Columbians during this challenging time.

To align with recommendations from the provincial health officer, Service BC is taking action to limit the risk of exposure to the COVID-19 virus for citizens and staff.Service BC centres are remaining open throughout the province to connect people to core services and supports during this uncertain time. In order to ensure people’s health and safety, staff at Service BC centres are taking extra steps to regularly sanitize public and office spaces, and are modifying reception areas to support social distancing.During the first hour of business, vulnerable citizens – including seniors and people who have underlying health conditions or compromised immune systems – will now receive priority service by calling their local Service BC centre to make an appointment.Many government organizations are modifying their face-to-face supports due to the pandemic. Service BC is working closely with its partner agencies to identify the core programs and services that will continue to be available at Service BC centres. These include:
income assistance and disability assistance;
residential tenancy;
BC Services Card;
drivers’ licensing;
Affordable Child Care Benefit;
Medical Services Plan (MSP); and
forest-worker support programs.
A full list of available services at each Service BC centre is available online, along with information on hours of operation at each site. In addition to physical offices around the province, Service BC supports citizens through online, telephone and text channels.People are asked to call a Service BC centre, rather than coming in to an office, if:
they are showing symptoms of COVID-19, including coughing, shortness of breath and fever;
they have a sick family member or have been around someone who is sick; and/or
they have not yet completed the 14-day isolation period after traveling abroad.
Adapting its approach will help Service BC support its employees, while also ensuring that citizens throughout B.C. – especially those most vulnerable – continue to have access to the core services they need most.Quick Facts:

Distillers in British Columbia are temporarily authorized to manufacture alcohol-based hand sanitizer to help combat the COVID-19 pandemic, through an updated policy directive from the Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch (LCRB).“We are in unprecedented times and everyone must do their part to fight COVID-19,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “Distilleries have been approaching us asking how they can help, and this new policy directive will mean they are authorized to manufacture alcohol-based hand sanitizer.”Previously, distilleries and other licensed manufacturing establishments would have required discretionary authorization from the general manager of LCRB in order to produce alternative products. However, given the context of the current provincial health emergency related to COVID-19, the general manager is now permitting all distillers to produce alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Hand sanitizers must meet certain federal regulatory requirements.  Some distillers are donating the “excess alcohol” from their distilling process to a third party that can produce hand sanitizer. Others are producing the hand sanitizer themselves, taking steps to ensure products contain the necessary level of alcohol content to make them effective. Distillers will be able to donate or sell the hand sanitizer they have manufactured, and the authorization will be reviewed on an ongoing basis as the provincial health context changes.“The flexibility shown by distillers to create much-needed hand sanitizing products demonstrates the leadership of B.C.’s agriculture sector and highlights the additional and unforeseen roles that B.C.’s food and beverage producers can play in an emergency response,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “B.C.’s food and beverage sector has so much to offer, and these displays of businesses changing their operations to help British Columbians in our time of need emphasizes the value each of us add to our communities every time we Buy BC.”Public health officials would like to remind the public that the best way to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 is by thorough handwashing with soap and water, scrubbing for at least 20 seconds.Learn More:BC Centre for Disease Control’s guide to hand hygiene: http://www.bccdc.ca/Health-Professionals-Site/Documents/COVID19_Handwashing%20Poster_MD%20offices.pdf

Dear friends,Thank you for doing your best in the fight against COVID-19!As a member of the cabinet of British Columbia, I can say with great sincerity that your provincial government is working incredibly hard to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. We are in this together and we will get through it together.As the minister of agriculture, I want to comment on two of the many urgent issues that my ministry is prioritizing on behalf of B.C.’s farm, fish and food sector.The first is seasonal labour. Seasonal labourers are a crucial and appreciated part of our food supply system. Every year more than 10,000 seasonal farm workers travel from their homes to work on farms and food-processing locations all over the province. They come from different regions, provinces and countries.It is the federal government that determines who can enter Canada and under what conditions. The Ministry of Agriculture’s executive team is working with the federal government and other provinces on a daily basis regarding foreign labour.I want to acknowledge the work done by the federal government as reflected in the announcement they made on March 20, 2020: https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2020/03/canada-provides-update-on-exemptions-to-travel-restrictions-to-protect-canadians-and-support-the-economy.htmlTo safeguard health and food security, temporary foreign workers in the agriculture sector will be allowed under specific conditions to travel to Canada. I will be redoubling my efforts and working closely with key stakeholders and decision-makers – including foreign governments and the provincial health officer of B.C. – to help farmers and processors safely employ the foreign farmworkers they need. This is an urgent matter and with the proper precautions in place, it will benefit all British Columbians, as we all need access to safe, fresh, local food.We are also actively looking at new ways to encourage employment opportunities for British Columbians in the agriculture sector.Second, farmers markets. Under additional conditions regarding COVID-19, farmers markets can continue to operate in B.C. at this time. The Ministry of Agriculture is working directly with the B.C. Association of Farmers’ Markets to assist with this season, and I'm pleased to share that the ministry will be providing financial support for it to develop an operating model better suited to times of a pandemic.Farmers in B.C. are a fundamental part of our food system, and farmers markets come in many shapes and sizes. Regrettably, at this time, the COVID-19 pandemic means they will not be about socializing and community. They will be focused on serving a very important purpose, though: helping people all over this province access fresh, locally grown or raised meat and other proteins, vegetables, fruit and many more foods and beverages. I want to thank everyone who works in the farm, fish and food sector – you are critical, and we appreciate you!I'm so proud of the agricultural sector that is working to adapt and keep on going. The harvest season comes early in many parts of B.C., so the work demands are already enormous. For farmers and others in the sector who need help, please see these messages I put out previously:

As the challenges caused by the COVID-19 outbreak continue to shift, the B.C. government and Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, are taking unprecedented measures to slow the transmission of COVID-19.Recently, Henry issued an order under the Public Health Act prohibiting the gathering of people in excess of 50 people at a place of which a person is the owner, occupier or operator, or for which they are otherwise responsible. Employers in the construction industry are asking for clarity about what this means for them. While this order does not apply to construction sites as a whole, the public health officer is directing employers to take all necessary precautions to minimize the risks of COVID-19 transmission and illness to themselves and their employees. This includes:
There should be no more than 50 people in the same space in any circumstances.
Where possible, employees should maintain a distance of two metres apart from each other.
Post signage that limits the number of occupants in any elevator to four people at a time.
Reduce in-person meetings and other gatherings and hold site meetings in open spaces or outside.
Increase the number of handwashing stations and post signage that identifies their location.
Maintain a list of employees that are currently working on sites and update this list daily.
All common areas and surfaces should be cleaned at the end of each day. Examples include washrooms, shared offices, common tables, desks, light switches and door handles.
Self-isolation can end 14 days after the last contact or return to Canada if you have not developed symptoms.
With or without a history of travel, if you have respiratory symptoms that can be managed at home, self-isolate at home for at least 10 days after onset of symptoms. After 10 days, if your temperature is normal and you feel better, you can return to your routine activities.
Coughing may persist for several weeks, so a cough alone does not mean you need to continue to self-isolate for more than 10 days.

Section 4.85 of the Occupational Health and Safety Regulation does provide for a minimum standard around the provision of washrooms and hand washing facilities. Where plumbed facilities are impracticable, employers must provide access to portable washroom and hand-washing facilities. Those facilities must be maintained in good working order and must be provided with the supplies necessary for their use.Employers should reassess their work environment every day and keep updated with the information posted on the Province’s website: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19The B.C. government is doing everything it can to help contain the spread of COVID-19, and the safety of British Columbians remains its top priority.Learn More:For more information on the COVID-19 response, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19For a Spanish translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020_Guidance_to_construction_sites_operating_during_COVID_Spanish.pdfFor a Punjabi translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020_Guidance_to_construction_sites_operating_during_COVID_(Punjabi).pdf

In order to reinforce social distancing orders and help support workers in the restaurant industry, government is making changes to temporarily allow restaurants to deliver liquor products alongside the purchase of a meal.“In these extraordinary times, more British Columbians are relying on delivery services during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “Permitting licensed restaurants to hire their out of work servers to deliver liquor products as part of their food-delivery service allows the public to continue to observe social distancing measures and also offers much-needed support to these workers and businesses.”These changes will be made available to customers who purchase a meal and the sealed, packaged liquor product for pick up from the restaurant’s premises or for delivery at home. Previously, these licensees were only permitted to sell liquor for consumption in their establishment, unless they had a special endorsement on their licence.  Existing safeguards for safe consumption continue to be in place, such as verifying identification. The individuals delivering the liquor products will also be required to be certified with Serving It Right, which government hopes will help encourage businesses to use currently laid-off serving staff to make these deliveries. Staff in licensed establishments are already required to hold this certification.These changes come as the restaurant and hospitality industry have been deeply impacted by COVID-19. The Business Technical Advisory Panel, which consists of representatives of the liquor and hospitality industry, provided this recommendation to help support struggling hospitality workers and businesses during this time.“A special thank you to the members of the Business Technical Advisory Panel for their recommendations during this public health emergency that has had such a terrible impact on workers in our favourite bars and restaurants,” Eby added. “Government is committed to working with hospitality workers and businesses to identify ways to reduce the impact of this crisis.”The changes take effect immediately and expire July 15, 2020. The timeline can be amended by government through a regulation change.“These changes not only help restaurant operators through a very tough time, but also could support the many British Columbians working in our breweries, wineries and distilleries,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “Supporting local businesses and choosing to Buy BC makes a real difference in our communities, especially at a time like this.”Learn More:Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch’s policy directive: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/employment-business-and-economic-development/business-management/liquor-regulation-licensing/policy-directives/20-05_sale_and_delivery_of_packaged_liquor_from_service_area_for_off-site_consumption.pdf

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“We are announcing 76 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 424 cases in British Columbia.“It is with sadness that we share the news that another Lynn Valley resident who previously tested positive for COVID-19 has passed away. We offer our deepest condolences to their loved ones and the staff who cared for them.“Every health region in British Columbia has people with COVID-19: 230 are in Vancouver Coastal Health Authority, 126 are in Fraser Health Authority, 37 are in Vancouver Island Health Authority, 27 are in Interior Health Authority and four are in Northern Heath Authority.“Additionally, of the total COVID-19 cases: 27 individuals are currently hospitalized, of which 12 are in intensive care, six individuals have recovered and the remaining patients are at home in isolation.“Until further notice, personal service establishments – like barbershops, salons, nail estheticians, health spas, massage parlours, tattoo shops and others – are ordered to close.“As part of our COVID-19 response strategy, our B.C. team has been tracking the epidemiology of the virus. Epidemiology looks at the who, what, where and when of disease outbreaks – to better understand their sources and effectively combat them. That is how we were able to determine the initial cases in B.C. were travel-related.“Because we now know a lot more about COVID-19, our testing strategy has evolved to focus on clusters and outbreaks, patients in hospital and health-care workers.“Here in B.C., 55% of all positive cases are female. This is because we have seen younger, female health-care workers with the virus – mainly related to the Lynn Valley Care Centre and other long-term care outbreaks.“As part of the virus tracking, we look at two curves: the total number positive test results and the date of symptom onset, as determined by the public health investigation of each case.“We pay attention to the onset curve, because we know that the time from the onset of symptoms to when someone is tested can sometimes several days. This is because people’s initial symptoms may be too mild to consider speaking to their doctor or going for testing.“As we get more information about the onset of symptoms from patients, the onset curve is updated to reflect this new information.“To most effectively flatten the curve, and break the chain of transmission, we need everyone to take action at the onset stage. That is why we have put public gathering orders and social distancing measures in place now – to protect us in the weeks ahead.“Now is the time to stay home as much as possible, and to keep a safe distance from others when outside. We are reminding British Columbians that their actions today will determine the impact of the virus in coming weeks.”Learn More:To view tables of epidemic curve and age distribution, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Epidemic_Curve_Age_Distribution_March_20_2020.pdfFor recommendations on protecting yourself and your community from COVID-19, and to use an online self-assessment tool visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/For non-health information on COVID-19 call 1 888 COVID-19 or visit www.gov.bc.ca/covid19For the latest videos and livestreaming of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit: https://www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/

616,2020-03-21 10:15:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020MAH0013-000536,Government Website,Government acting to protect province’s most vulnerable during COVID-19 crisis,"

As British Columbians work to reduce the spread of the coronavirus, the Province is taking swift action to protect vulnerable people, including those experiencing homelessness, in communities around British Columbia.Initial actions include:
a ban on evictions for non-payment of rent in BC Housing-funded buildings;
the development of distinct protocols and identification of sites to support isolation for vulnerable people experiencing homelessness – sheltered or unsheltered – and those in private single room occupancy (SROs) and social housing buildings;
sustaining service providers through continued payments to ensure they can pay their staff and operating costs; and
centralized procurement for critical supplies needed by frontline providers, including gloves and cleaning products.
“Frontline workers are working tirelessly to ensure that vulnerable residents are protected across the province, recognizing the significant added risks that vulnerable people face in the context of the COVID-19 crisis,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “We are committed to making sure these frontline workers have the support they need to do their job – whether that’s in the form of safe spaces for people who need isolation or personal protective equipment for staff working in the field. We are all in this together.”Recognizing that vulnerable people in different circumstances face distinct risks, a provincial Vulnerable Population Working Group is working to identify, assess and address the immediate challenges faced in particular by five groups – people living on the street, people experiencing homelessness living in encampments, shelter residents, tenants of private SROs and tenants in social and supportive housing buildings.This working group includes representatives from the ministries of Municipal Affairs and Housing, Social Development and Poverty Reduction, Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation, Mental Health and Addictions, Children and Family Development, Health, as well as Emergency Management BC, the City of Vancouver, the Office of the Provincial Health Officer, local health authorities, BC Housing and Community Living BC.Isolation protocols are being developed in partnership with local governments and health authorities based on the needs of vulnerable residents in each region. While in some situations self-isolation may be possible within a unit, additional locations have been identified throughout the province for those situations where off-site isolation of one or more people is required. In addition, recognizing that many providers have identified difficulty in sourcing necessary medical and cleaning supplies, BC Housing is now procuring personal protective equipment needed by frontline workers on a central basis and is distributing them directly to housing providers.“While all of us are feeling the effects of the COVID-19 crisis, there is no doubt that our most vulnerable populations including the homeless and the working poor are disproportionately affected,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “We are working together with our partners at every level of government and in the social services sector to find safe and efficient ways to provide supports to the people who need them the most as quickly as possible.” Recognizing that many residents may face challenges in making rent payments as a result of COVID-19, BC Housing has implemented a moratorium on eviction for non-payment of rent in their directly managed properties and is also working with non-profit housing providers around the province to do the same. In addition, the process of applying for a rent reduction is being streamlined for tenants who have lost income as a result of COVID-19, including changing the rules to remove the requirement for proof that the decrease in income is permanent.People experiencing homelessness often have higher rates of health concerns, and as a result could be at greater risk if exposed to COVID-19. For that reason, enhanced screening and cleaning protocols are in place at residential facilities to reduce the potential that this virus can spread within the building and beyond. To support partners’ efforts, BC Housing is also working closely with the Ministry of Health, the provincial health officer, local health authorities, the BC Non-Profit Housing Association and the Aboriginal Housing Management Association to ensure non-profit providers can protect their guests and residents. This includes providing training and support in encouraging social distancing, best practices in building cleaning and maintenance, identification of on- and off-site isolation spaces, and access to testing and other services.  Learn More:For more information on BC Housing’s eviction and rent adjustment policy, visit: https://www.bchousing.org/publications/Covid-19-Bulletin-for-Housing-Providers-Eviction-and-Rent-Adjustment-Notification-March-18th-2020.pdfA backgrounder follows.

Premier John Horgan and Anne Kang, Minister of Citizens’ Services and responsible for Multiculturalism, have issued the following statement marking the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination:“Today is International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, a day to stand together against those who seek to divide us and renew our commitment to fight racism, prejudice and discrimination.“At a time when people around the world are using hate and division as tools, we must stay united. Through challenging times, we are always stronger and more resilient as a province when we treat each other with kindness, generosity and respect.“As individuals, we must use our voices to speak out against racism and discrimination. Those who have privilege must acknowledge it and learn to see the world from different perspectives. This is how we will truly understand ourselves and others.“As a government, we are working every day to build a better B.C., where everyone is treated with dignity and respect. We re-established the Human Rights Commission to protect and defend human rights throughout the province. In 2019, Ravi Kahlon, as parliamentary secretary for sport and multiculturalism, held 21 community dialogues on racism and hate. As a result of these conversations, we launched Resilience BC, a new anti-racism network that will support partners in 40 communities throughout the province in their work to eliminate racism, discrimination and hate.“Today, and every day, we celebrate the multicultural province we are so lucky to live in. Our lives and communities are enriched by the diverse cultures that make up British Columbia.“Our government will continue to stand up for equality and justice, so our children will grow up in a province and a world where everyone feels valued and respected.”For a French translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/20200321_STM_PJH_Day_for_Elimination_of_Racial_Discrimination_V5_FR.pdf

Staying connected to her culture has helped Tara Michelle Bridge work through her own intergenerational trauma and continues to help her support children and families in her community.Bridge, a child protection worker from the Kispiox First Nation, is one of the many front-line workers that Social Work Week recognizes and celebrates, March 15-21, 2020.Growing up, Bridge says she relied on spiritual and cultural practices like singing, drumming and sports to help her stay mentally, physically and emotionally healthy. After 11 years with the Ministry of Children and Family Development, Bridge still relies on her connection to culture to help her, her family and the children and families she works with to overcome difficult situations.“It’s important to understand that families dealing with intergenerational trauma often don’t realize that’s what it is,” Bridge said. “I bring in as many people as I can, the grandparents, aunts, uncles and the band representative, to start the conversation.”Bridge said she is always “up front and honest” with parents and makes it clear “there is work they need to do,” but that she is there to help and support them.One of the many reasons addressing intergenerational trauma is difficult, Bridge said, is because families often don’t want to talk about it. “They’re afraid their kids will be taken away,” which is why finding the right supports and cultural connections is important. Bridge works with parents and children to build a family plan, and then connects them with specific services through family wellness workers, counsellors and victim services so they can address the concerns.When working with Indigenous children, “finding even one connection to their culture can make a big difference,” Bridge said. “I worked with two children in care who were homeschooled, and when I asked if they knew where they were from, they didn’t.”Bridge worked with the parents and the band representative to develop a cultural plan, which included enrolling the kids in school where they could make new friends, socialize and connect to their community through various activities. It is a simple thing that Bridge said has made a huge difference.“They smile so much more, and you can tell they feel connected to their culture by being involved in their community. Children should always know where they come from and feel like they belong,” Bridge said, explaining that a connection to culture can help children feel supported, like they are part of something larger, and can help their confidence and personal development.Living and working as a child protection worker in a small community has its challenges. “I care about my community. My children are a part of it. It can be isolating though because people are wary of my work.”With her husband and three children, Bridge said finding healthy, cultural activities helps keep her grounded and focused. “I do a lot of crafting, I make jewelry and I’m starting to bead. That connection to my culture helps me feel balanced.“I’m basically a child advocate. I believe in the possibility of healing.”Quick Facts:
As of Dec. 31, 2019, there were a total of 3,408 employees providing front-line work on behalf of the Ministry of Children and Family Development.
At Delegated Aboriginal Agencies, there are almost 400 front-line and administrative full-time equivalent employees.

The British Columbia government is taking steps to support the child care sector while ensuring parents who must work during the COVID-19 pandemic continue to have access to child care, with new funding for providers.Dr. Bonnie Henry, provincial health officer, has advised all parents who can, should care for their children at home. She also recognized that while some centres may close, child care services can and must be provided in a safe manner for those families whose parents work in critical roles.The Province will give centres that remain open compensation to continue operating with reduced enrolment. Centres that close will also receive support for fixed operating costs, like rent or lease payments.“As a former early childhood educator (ECE), I understand how difficult this time is for those working in the child care sector,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “We are working hard with the Ministry of Health to address concerns. We have heard from many child care providers and ECEs who want to stay open to support families and essential service workers at this time. The measures we’re announcing today will give them the support they deserve and the tools they need to continue safely caring for children.”Child care providers staying open will receive enhanced funding to keep operations going. These centres are eligible to receive seven times their average monthly funding from government, which is expected to cover approximately 75% of a group facility’s average monthly operating expenses. Child care centres remaining open will continue to receive ECE wage enhancements for their staff. These expanded financial supports will help facilities stay open, even with reduced enrolment, to support care needs for those parents who need it.Reducing the number of children in child care centres will make it easier for licensees and ECEs to follow preventative health measures. The Ministry of Health is developing detailed guidelines to inform licensees, ECEs and licensing officers on implementating best practice, which will be circulated to child care providers shortly.Child care providers who close due to COVID-19 will also receive support to help ensure they are able to pay their fixed costs, like rent/lease/mortgage during the temporary closure, so they can reopen when able. These centres are eligible to receive two times their average monthly funding from government, which is expected to cover approximately 20% of an average group facility’s monthly operating expenses.Smaller home-based child care providers are also eligible for these supports.“I have received many messages from parents, providers and ECEs as this situation has evolved and this feedback has informed our way forward,” said Katrina Chen, Minister of State for Child Care. “These measures will provide some financial support to child care providers who need to close until they can return to providing services for families and ensures parents don’t face the economic burden of paying fees for services they aren’t using.”These measures are in addition to increased federal government measures to support workers through Employment Insurance, the new Emergency Care and Support Benefits, and the Employment Insurance Work Sharing Program, as well as the wage subsidy support for small business. The Province will continue to work with federal partners to advocate for higher benefits for people affected by the pandemic as it prepares to announce further provincial supports for people and businesses.To support families who may be struggling with loss of employment and income, child care providers receiving these extraordinary payments must not charge parents fees for any periods of closure or for any vacant spaces while they are open, including when a parent chooses to temporarily withdraw a child due to COVID-19.They must also agree to reserve spaces for families that were accessing their services before the pandemic, even if these families choose to temporarily withdraw, so families can be assured their spot will still be there once the pandemic passes.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“We are announcing 77 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 348 cases in British Columbia.“Of the new cases, one patient is a health-care worker at the Dufferin Care Centre, a long-term care home in Coquitlam. Fraser Health authority public health and infection control teams are on site.“Every health region in British Columbia has patients with COVID-19: 200 are in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, 95 are in the Fraser Health region, 30 are in the Vancouver Island Health region, 19 are in the Interior Health region and four are in the Northern Heath region.“Additionally, of the total COVID-19 cases, six people have completely recovered, 22 are receiving acute care, 10 are in intensive care and the remaining patients are at home in isolation.“As the number of cases increases and the pressure on our health-care system intensifies, we would like to acknowledge and thank our health-care workers as they support all those in B.C. who require testing and care for COVID-19.“In step with World Health Organization recommendations, the Public Health Agency of Canada’s National Advisory Committee on Infection Prevention and Control provides clear guidance for all health-care workers to follow. They can be confident that by following these guidelines on appropriate use, we will have sufficient supply of personal protective equipment.“We need everybody to be aware of the risk in every community and every health region across B.C. And, equally important, because of the incubation period and rapid transmission, the self-isolation and social distancing that we do today will benefit all of us two weeks and two months from now.“Given the challenges social distancing presents for restaurants, effective immediately, all dine-in food services are prohibited. Restaurants must move to delivery or take-out options only, or close.“We also want to be clear that while spending time outdoors is important, people still need to stay away from groups in any environment – to prevent bringing the virus into their homes.“New resources are being made available every day to support everyone in our province as we continue to work to stop the transmission of COVID-19.”Learn More:For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community from COVID-19 and to use an online self-assessment tool, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/For non-health information on COVID-19, call 1-888-COVID-19 or visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19For the latest video of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit: https://www.facebook.com/BCProvincialGovernment/

Provincial parks are a great place for people in B.C. to get out and enjoy nature, while following the social distancing directives from British Columbia’s provincial health officer (PHO).While BC Parks is bringing in some new novel coronavirus (COVID-19) protocols, people throughout B.C. will still be able to enjoy day-use parks as a positive way to connect to nature.Some day-use services and facilities are currently available at the following provincial parks:
Mount Seymour Provincial Park – access restricted to some lower-elevation trails. Parking and road access are closed.
Cypress Provincial Park – access restricted to some lower-elevation trails. Parking and road access are closed.
Goldstream Provincial Park
Rathtrevor Beach Provincial Park
Miracle Beach Provincial Park
Wells Gray Provincial Park
“Nature provides the perfect environment to promote health and well-being,"" said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “We are following the advice of the provincial health officer to help people get outside, while ensuring they are following the PHO’s direction and guidance to stay healthy. Our government is taking every necessary step to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We look forward to a time when we can return to full operations at our provincial parks.”People will continue to be able to day hike and recreate in most all other provincial parks. However, there will be a temporary suspension of services and facility closures as a result of the ongoing provincial response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Campgrounds and camping opportunities will be closed and existing reservations will be automatically refunded.The temporary measures include the suspension of services at marine parks, visitor centres, nature houses, washrooms and day-use facilities. Provincial park visitors may continue to use trails and areas where accessible. Visitors should be aware parking lots in some parks may be closed and gated where necessary.Provincial parks can attract large numbers, particularly those parks close to urban centres. Visitors should keep this in mind when choosing which park to visit. People are also reminded to keep at least two metres apart from each other during this time. In addition to social distancing, people may need to be extra patient and aware of their impact on the environment. Full provincial park closures are also being implemented on a case-by-case basis, where required, to address concerns regarding health and safety. Visitors should be mindful that they are responsible for their own safety and that washroom facilities may not be available in most parks. They are asked to check the BC Parks website for any updates before heading out. Any changes to services at provincial parks will be posted to the BC Parks website: http://bcparks.caIn alignment with Parks Canada, all campgrounds, camping opportunities and accommodations will be closed until at least April 30, 2020. Refunds will be provided to those with existing reservations during this time.The Discover Camping reservation system has been suspended for all new reservations. No action is required for people with reservations to receive a refund. Refunds will be done automatically and are expected to take seven to 10 business days. A public notice will be issued once facilities are reopened and the system is able to accept new reservations.Many tourism operators and other businesses have permits to offer services and trips within BC Parks. This closure may affect the availability of services provided by commercial operators permitted to operate in BC Parks. Park visitors are advised to check with them directly before visiting to determine if there have been any changes to their services.BC Parks continues to monitor the COVID-19 outbreak closely and is following recommendations set out by the provincial health officer and minister of health to assess when to reopen facilities and services and return to full operations.Learn More: For non-clinical information on COVID-19, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/COVID19The latest information on COVID-19 protective measures is available through the BC Centre for Disease Control by calling 1 888-COVID19 or at: BCCDC.caBC Parks website: http://bcparks.ca

Over 100 piles of woody debris near Coglistiko Lake and Fishpot Lake will be burned between Monday, March 23 and March 31, 2020, to reduce wildfire risks and prepare for the upcoming tree-planting season.These controlled burns will be conducted by staff from the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. Burning will occur only on days when site and weather conditions are favourable and will allow smoke to dissipate.The areas around Coglistiko Lake and Fishpot Lake, about 10 kilometres west of Nazko and about 80 kilometres west of Quesnel, were heavily damaged by the 2017 Plateau wildfire and contained high concentrations of standing dead trees. The piles of wood were created when many of these dead trees were cut down.  Burning the piles will allow more trees to be planted in the cleared areas this spring and also decrease future fire hazards in the area. Several of the piles will remain in place to enhance wildlife habitat by providing cover for martens, fishers and other animals.

Residents along 0 Avenue (pronounced as ""Zero Avenue""), from Surrey to Aldergrove, are asked to report sightings of Asian giant hornets (Vespa mandarinia) that may emerge from their nests in the coming weeks and months.In December 2019, two specimens were found near Blaine, Wash., and a single specimen was found in White Rock in November 2019. These findings indicate a probability that nesting hornets are overwintering in the area.Wooded habitat, like areas near the Canada-U.S. border, offer suitable hornet nesting grounds. Residents along 0 Avenue may be the first to notice them.The provincial apiculturist will place hornet traps in the area and distribute pest-alert notices to 0 Avenue residents in the coming weeks, along with information and pictures of the Asian giant hornet and the steps to take if you spot the insect.Asian giant hornets are large compared to other hornets, with noticeably large orange heads and black eyes. Worker hornets are approximately 3.5 cm in length. Queens can be up to 4 cm to 5 cm in length with a wingspan of 4 cm to 7 cm.The Asian giant hornet is classified as a serious honeybee predator. Asian giant hornets hunt insects for food and generally are not interested in humans, pets and livestock. When their nest is disturbed, they will attack with painful stings, which can be hazardous to people’s health.British Columbians who think they may have seen an Asian giant hornet can report their findings to the Invasive Species Council of BC at 1 888 933-3722, via the council's ""Report Invasives"" mobile phone app or online: https://bcinvasives.ca/reportThe Asian giant hornet was first found in British Columbia in August 2019 in Nanaimo.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“We are announcing 40 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 271 cases in British Columbia.“It is with sadness that we announce that another patient who tested positive for COVID-19, a resident from the Lynn Valley Care Centre, has passed away. We offer our heartfelt condolences to their loved ones and the staff who cared for them.“Of the total cases, 152 are in Vancouver Coastal Health, 81 are in Fraser Health, 22 are in Island Health, 12 are in Interior Health and four are in Northern Heath.“Additionally, of the total COVID-19 cases, 17 individuals are currently hospitalized, nine are in intensive care and the remaining patients are at home in isolation.“We know that social distancing is an important line of defence for all us – staying a fingertip-to-fingertip distance away from each other, but no touching. Equally important is maintaining our connections with friends, family and colleagues while many of us remain at home.“We are encouraged by the many innovative ways that people across B.C. are staying connected, while staying apart:“Virtual coffee dates on your phone or laptop, takeout windows at restaurants, spending time outside with our families, or even dropping off homemade baking or books for those self-isolating. British Columbians are taking the challenge to heart.“As individuals, there are many things we can do to stay connected. Getting outside in our many parks, walking your pet, or going for a bike ride are all safe. And when inside, take advantage of the many free online resources at your disposal, from virtual learning to exercise classes to reading an ebook from your local library.“If you are picking up groceries, maintain space when lining up to pay. If you need to take a taxi, sit in the back seat and wipe down the payment pad with alcohol-based wipes before and after paying.“New resources are being made available every day to support everyone in our province as we continue to work to stop the transmission of COVID-19. And if you are healthy and able to do so, please consider donating blood.”Learn More:To view all the provincial health officer's orders, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topicsTo take the online self-assessment tool, visit: http://covid-19.bccdc.ca/For non-health information on COVID-19, call 1 888 COVID-19 or visit: www.gov.bc.ca/covid19For more information on COVID-19, latest updates on testing strategy, self-isolation, and personal and community protection, follow the BC Centre for Disease Control on Twitter @CDCofBC or visit its website: http://www.bccdc.ca/For the COVID-19 pandemic preparedness and planning materials, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topics/pandemic-influenzaTo make an appointment to donate blood, download the GiveBlood app, call 1 888 2-DONATE (1 888 236-6283) or book online: https://blood.caFor the latest audio clips of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit: https://soundcloud.com/bcgov

British Columbians have more time to share their input for a vision of coastal ferry services, as the public consultation to seek feedback on a vision for coastal ferry services has been extended to Friday, April 17, 2020.This public consultation was launched in February 2020. Due to the ongoing situation with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), in-person meetings in coastal communities have been cancelled. The extension of the survey will provide time for MLAs to connect with their constituents and local stakeholders, and provide a longer time frame for the public to provide feedback.Following the close of the survey on April 17 at 4 p.m. (Pacific time), the results will inform the development of a provincewide vision to guide the future of British Columbia’s coastal ferry service.The questionnaire is available on the Coastal Ferries Vision web page: https://engage.gov.bc.ca/coastalferries

Premier John Horgan has issued the following statement in celebration of Nowruz on Thursday, March 19, 2020:“Today, millions of people from around the world will celebrate Nowruz, the Persian New Year that welcomes the coming of spring.“Rooted in traditions that date back thousands of years, Nowruz is a time of renewal that embraces new beginnings while old chapters close. Traditionally, people celebrate by jumping over bonfires to burn away bad luck and replace it with warmth, health and energy. Children bang on pots and collect sweets and coins from neighbours. Families gather to sing songs and eat feasts of grilled meat, spiced stew and steamed rice.“This year, many families may choose to celebrate Nowruz differently as people take precautionary steps to protect their health and the health of others. No matter how people choose to celebrate Nowruz this year, I wish you a joyous new year blessed with health, happiness and prosperity.“Norouzetan Pirouz!”For a Farsi translation: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Nowruz-2020_Farsi.pdfFor a French translation: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Nowruz-2020_French.pdf

To protect residents from the current threat of novel coronavirus (COVID-19), Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, has deferred byelections in Victoria, Rossland and Lytton, and a referendum in Kamloops.This action, requested by both public health officials and local government members, will help ensure residents are not required to gather in polling stations and will free up local government resources to focus on dealing with the impact of COVID-19.“I know that local governments are working hard to keep their communities safe and protected during this pandemic,” Robinson said. “Our government is working closely with our partners to help marshal all resources to protect those most vulnerable and ‘flattening the curve’ of the spread of COVID-19. After consulting with our public health officials and local governments, I have signed a ministerial order postponing byelections and referendums in these communities so they can focus on protecting their residents.”In 2020, Victoria and Rossland had byelections set for April 4, and Lytton had a byelection set for April 25. Kamloops had a referendum scheduled for April 4, 2020.Decisions to reschedule the byelections and referendum will be made by local governments in conjunction with public health officials and Elections BC. Meanwhile, the ministry will continue to work with local governments that are considering byelections or referendums to ensure plans take into consideration the need to protect community residents during this emergency situation.Learn More: For the latest updates on COVID-19, follow the BC Centre for Disease Control on Twitter @CDCofBC or visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/To view the provincial health officer's order on mass gatherings, visit:

Of the new cases, 13 are currently hospitalized, seven are in intensive care, five have recovered and the remaining patients are at home in isolation.“Of the new cases, one patient is a resident of the Haro Park Centre, an independent housing, assisted living and long-term care centre in Vancouver. Vancouver Coastal public health and infection control teams are on site.“Of the total cases, 144 are in Vancouver Coastal, 58 are in Fraser, 16 are on Vancouver Island, nine are in Interior and four are in Northern health regions.“We are reminding British Columbians that there are provincial health officer orders in place restricting travel, mass gatherings and operations of bars and clubs, in addition to requirements for social distancing in restaurants and indefinite suspension of school classes.“The orders are a last measure to protect British Columbians and slow the transmission of COVID-19. While they are temporary, it is extremely important that everyone in our province abide by these orders.“The provincial health officer can and will compel peace officers to enforce orders if that is required, but we believe it is far better to take precautions on a voluntary basis.“We continue to remind people of the three things they can do to help all of us: first, use hand hygiene, second, maintain social or physical distancing, and third, stay at home if you are sick or at high risk for serious illness.“Canada Blood Services has alerted us to an urgent need for new donations to maintain supply. Additional screening and social distancing measures are in place, and it is safe to donate blood.

The chief inspector of mines has communicated to all major mines, sand and gravel, and placer operations in B.C. to ensure they are complying with the orders and directives issued by the provincial health officer in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.Specifically, mines in B.C. must follow the public health order prohibiting gatherings in excess of 50 people. The following recommendations apply in terms of day-to-day production and site operations:
Reduce the number of on-site personnel by encouraging work from home where feasible.
In person town hall meetings used to address the whole site must be avoided for groups of more than 50 people. Communication should continue in smaller groups or via other media.
Daily pre-shift safety meetings (toolbox meetings) affecting more than 50 people are to be held in smaller numbers or via other media.
Reduce in person meetings and other gatherings where possible.
Although bunkhouses and cafeterias are regulated by WorkSafeBC and regional health authorities, the chief inspector of mines is also recommending that mine managers limit the number of people in each area to fewer than 50 at any given time and establish multiple sittings in cafeterias to minimize interactions.The recommendations also include advice for transportation to and from mines, as well as general implementation of social distancing practices of two metres between people.Mines inspectors and the Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources are in contact with mines around the province to ensure the health and safety of workers and the environment is maintained. This work is fluid as the ministry adjusts to the COVID-19 pandemic.Learn More:For the latest orders and directives from the provincial health officer, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topicsHelp flatten the curve by checking symptoms online: https://covid19.thrive.health/If you or a family member have symptoms or need medical advice, call 811.For the most up-to-date health information on the #COVID19 outbreak, follow the BC Centre for Disease Control at @CDCofBC (twitter.com)  or visit: www.bccdc.caFor up-to-date non-health information, including the latest travel restrictions and provincial and federal programs, call 1 888 COVID-19 or visit: gov.bc.ca/covid19For the latest COVID-19 updates and statements, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/Search?q=COVID-19

Many brokers remain open for business for people who want to visit in person or for transactions that cannot be done over the phone, such as vehicle registrations and new policies.ICBC customers will be able to receive the following services from participating brokers:
vehicle insurance renewal, cancellation and policy changes by phone
changes to storage policies (APV345) and temporary operating permits (APV16)
receive transactions by email
submit signatures electronically
submit payments by phone
receive policy documents by email
“With the COVID-19 outbreak impacting brokers’ offices and customers, these provisional changes are the right move to help protect the health and wellness of everyone, while continuing to meet British Columbians’ insurance needs,” said Chuck Byrne, executive director, Insurance Brokers Association of B.C. ICBC customers are advised to give themselves ample time for renewals, as the transaction may take longer than usual. Those customers who have questions should contact ICBC at 250 978-8300 or toll-free at 1 800 950-1498.At this time, there are no changes to driver’s licence renewal protocols, but ICBC is working actively on further options across the board to support customers and employees. ICBC also continues to work closely with brokers through a joint task force on additional online services, including a more permanent process for insurance renewals.Learn More:ICBC road tests cancelled during COVID-19 outbreak: https://www.icbc.com/about-icbc/newsroom/Pages/2020-mar17.aspx

Premier John Horgan has released the following statement regarding the federal response to COVID-19:“I welcome the news on the border measures announced today by the federal government. We need to limit non-essential travel over the U.S. border, while maintaining our supply chains, so people have access to essentials.“As we know, more and more people are working contract-to-contract or are self-employed in the gig economy. These workers also deserve direct support as they self-isolate or care for a family member or children. Therefore, I am pleased to see that federal government responded to our request for additional benefits for those who don’t qualify for Employment Insurance.“We will be conducting a full review of the federal package announced today, and we will work with our federal partners to advocate for higher benefits so people will be able to afford rent and essentials while staying home during this crisis.“Our government is working on details of a B.C. plan. Our focus is on supporting services that protect the health and safety of people impacted by the COVID-19 virus. We will expand on the federal government’s efforts to offer immediate relief for people and businesses, and build our longer-term plan for economic recovery in collaboration with the business community.”

Le gouvernement de la Colombie-Britannique a déclaré l’état d’urgence provincial afin de soutenir les interventions à l’échelle de la province pour faire face à la pandémie de la nouvelle maladie à coronavirus (COVID-19).Mike Farnworth, ministre de la Santé publique et solliciteur général, a fait cette déclaration en se fondant sur la recommandation des représentants en santé et en gestion des urgences de la province, après que la Dre Bonnie Henry, agente de santé provinciale de la C.-B., ait déclaré une situation d’urgence de santé publique le mardi 17 mars 2020.« Déclarer un état d’urgence est une mesure importante pour soutenir les interventions rapides et efficaces de notre agente de santé provinciale et du ministre de la Santé face à la pandémie de la COVID‑19, affirme M. Farnworth. Nous travaillons de concert avec nos partenaires de tout le gouvernement et de l’industrie afin de coordonner les interventions d’urgence et n’hésiterons pas à recourir aux outils à notre disposition pour protéger la population. »La déclaration de l’état d’urgence permet à la province, par l’entremise du ministre, de mettre en place toute mesure d’urgence provinciale qui s’impose concernant l’accès aux biens fonciers et aux ressources humaines pouvant s’avérer nécessaires pour prévenir les effets d’une situation d’urgence, intervenir ou atténuer de tels effets. Il pourrait s’agir de protéger les chaînes logistiques critiques afin de s’assurer que la population obtient des biens et services essentiels, et que l’infrastructure requise pour les interventions est facilement accessible.L’état d’urgence, une fois décrété, est d’abord en vigueur pendant 14 jours et pourrait être étendu ou abrégé, selon les besoins. Il s’applique à toute la province et permet de déployer des ressources fédérales, provinciales et régionales dans le cadre d’efforts coordonnés.En sa qualité de leader parlementaire, M. Farnworth s’affaire également à reprendre les travaux de la Chambre afin de mener à bien les affaires urgentes du gouvernement et d’accélérer les interventions du gouvernement face à la COVID-19.« Nous travaillons tous ensemble et mettons ces pouvoirs en place en vue de protéger notre population, notre système de santé et notre économie, indique Adrian Dix, ministre de la Santé. Ces mesures provisoires nous seront d’un immense secours, à long terme. J’encourage les résidents de la Colombie-Britannique à respecter la situation actuelle et à garder à l’esprit que chacun de nous est lié par une responsabilité et un devoir civique d’entraide de son prochain, qu’il assumera en se conformant à toutes les ordonnances d’urgence. »La province a instauré une ligne d’urgence, le 1 888 COVID-19, à l’intention des résidents de la Colombie-Britannique ayant besoin de renseignements non médicaux sur la COVID-19. Ils pourront obtenir les plus récentes informations sur les recommandations relatives aux voyages et sur l’éloignement social, ainsi que sur l’accès à l’aide et aux ressources mises à leur disposition par les gouvernements provincial et fédéral.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:""We are deeply saddened to announce that a further three people who tested positive for COVID-19 have recently passed away. Two were residents of the Lynn Valley Care Centre and one was a man in his 80s from the Fraser Health region. We offer our heartfelt condolences to their loved ones and the staff who cared for them.“We are also announcing 83 new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 186 cases in British Columbia. Of the new cases, seven are currently hospitalized, four are in intensive care, five have recovered and the remaining patients are at home in isolation.“Of the total cases, 116 are in Vancouver Coastal, 47 are in Fraser, 12 are on Vancouver Island, seven are in Interior and four are in Northern health regions.“This steep increase in the number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases in B.C. is in large part a result of consolidating data this week as our reporting process aligns with the increase in the number of tests that is now taking place in five sites around the province. We anticipate this will level off.  “The provincial health officer has declared a public health emergency. This is an additional step to ensure our province has more tools available to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. “This declaration enables the provincial health officer to facilitate an even faster response to the rapidly changing situation and enact further measures to protect British Columbians, such as enforcement of orders limiting public gatherings of 50 people or more.“Effective immediately, businesses with liquor primary licences, such as bars, pubs and night clubs, must close as they are unable to adequately meet the requirements of social distancing. Restaurants and cafes that cannot maintain social distancing of one to two meters between patrons will need to move to take-out and delivery models.“We also remind British Columbians that public gatherings of more than 50 people – indoors or outdoors – must be cancelled.“This is the second time the provincial health officer has served notice under the Public Health Act to exercise emergency powers. The first declaration was in 2016, in response to the overdose crisis.“We would like to remind people that tests are available for all those who need them, but not everyone requires a test.“To further support people who are wondering if they should be tested, a new self-assessment tool is now available. Before calling 811, we recommend completing the self-assessment at: http://covid-19.bccdc.ca/“We continue to remind people to please use hand hygiene, maintain social or physical distancing, and to stay at home if you are sick or at high risk for serious illness. That includes the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions.“Sufficient physical distancing of one to two meters should be incorporated for workers and customers for businesses and services that will remain open to provide transportation, keep our communities safe and provide essential goods and services.“For those who have recently travelled outside of Canada and are currently self-isolating for 14 days: leaving your home, hotel or a similar place should only be done for essential errands, such as obtaining medication or food, and with a mask or tissues.“This is a time to support our friends, family and communities. Purchasing groceries for those isolating or donating blood to support our health-care system are some of the ways you can help. Canada Blood Services has added additional screening measures for increased vigilance to enable the continued supply of blood products for surgery, cancer treatments and emergencies.”Learn More:To view the provincial health officer's order on people returning from travel, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topicsTo view the provincial health officer's order on mass gatherings, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topicsFor more information on the updated testing strategy and self-isolation, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/testing-isolationFor recommendations on protecting yourself and your community, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/coronavirus-(novel)For the COVID-19 pandemic preparedness and planning materials, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topics/pandemic-influenza.For more information and latest updates on COVID-19, follow the BC Centre for Disease Control on Twitter @CDCofBC or visit its website: http://www.bccdc.ca/To make an appointment to donate, download the GiveBlood app, call 1 888 2-DONATE (1 888 236-6283) or book online: https://blood.caFor the latest audio clips of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit: https://soundcloud.com/bcgov

Ryan Hues, a ministry child protection worker, says becoming a parent has helped him to stay “real” in his role working with families and children under 12.Ryan is just one of many front-line workers who are being acknowledged for their work during Social Work Week, March 15-21, 2020.“Being a parent and a step-parent has helped me understand just how stressful kids can be,” he said. “Parenting isn’t easy. I recognize how overwhelmed parents can feel, and how it’s possible to end up in a position where they aren’t coping well.”When he follows up on a child protection complaint, he empathizes with the anxiety the process can create for parents who are already struggling. “We want them to recognize that we are there to support them and to see how we can collaborate with them. Our purpose is the safety of kids,” he said, adding, “It’s rare that we work with families and have to remove children. That is the absolute last resort.”Ryan’s best days are when “parents acknowledge that there is work to be done, they are willing to work collaboratively and they begin to help themselves to mitigate the impacts on their children. Seeing a parent do the work to better themselves is amazing to watch.”He believes the struggles he overcame in his teens and 20s have helped him to “get really honest” with the families he works with. “I don’t have blinders on. I’m quite aware of how families are impacted by issues like substance use, mental illness, unemployment and poverty, and even coping with the layers a blended family brings.”There are many threads for social workers to unravel. “Sometimes parents get caught up in being punitive toward their former partner and that adds a whole other layer of sorting out what’s actually going on,” Ryan said. “That’s why we always try to approach any child-protection complaint with curiosity. We ask, ‘Is this a new problem for this family? Do they have a history with the ministry? What worked for them the last time? And most importantly, how can we help them move forward?’ ”He says it was about nine years ago and a lot of soul-searching that led to a shift in his lifestyle from the unhealthy choices he’d made as a young teen and adult. “If I had to talk to my younger self now, I’d tell him what I’d tell youth in general: ‘You’re going to face a lot of struggles. It’s okay to be hurting. It’s okay to reach out and ask for help, and then actually allow someone to help you. You don’t need to know everything all the time.’ ” One of the most important questions he asked himself when he was getting back on track was, “What kind of man do I really want to be?”Once Ryan had made up his mind to work in social services, he started volunteering at the Aboriginal Friendship Centre in Nanaimo. “I’d go there every day and spend time with youth at risk, many of whom were homeless.” He got a social services diploma and then went on to get a social work degree, continuing to work with youth. “I also learned a lot about colonization and systemic racism. I worked a lot with dads whose kids were in the care of the ministry. It really clued me in to my privilege,” he said.Now Ryan knows the answer to the question he asked himself all those years ago: “I want to be the kind of man who’s there for people when they need me to be – at work and in my personal life.”Quick Facts:

Communities throughout B.C. will be safer and more inclusive for people, with 75 projects supported through the latest round of BC Multiculturalism Grants.“We are privileged to live in one of the most culturally diverse places in the world, and we all need to work together to ensure that everyone feels welcomed, valued and respected in British Columbia,” said Anne Kang, Minister of Citizens’ Services and responsible for Multiculturalism. “Through these grants, we are assisting community organizations to deliver projects that strengthen intercultural connections, and increase trust and understanding to reduce incidents of racism, hate and discrimination for a better B.C.”The BC Multiculturalism Grants program provides a total of $300,000 annually to non-profit and charitable organizations for projects promoting collaborative community approaches that tackle racism and hate while supporting systemic change. Projects benefiting from this latest round of grants include:
The Diversity and Inclusion Capacity Building Project (Kelowna): a project that will focus on cultivating cross-cultural and intercultural knowledge and awareness among people of all backgrounds.
Support Network for Indigenous Women and Women of Colour (Victoria): a project that will support conversations in Victoria and Vancouver on systemic issues, access barriers and other challenges related to the maternal health of women of colour. 
Culture Confluence Anti-Racism Broadcast Series (Prince George): a podcast/radio series that will explore the ways local culture contributes to and combats systemic racism.
Quick Facts:
The BC Multiculturalism Grants program was established in 2012 in accordance with the Multiculturalism Act.
In 2018, the program's grant criteria were revised to better align with the ministry’s priorities of building trust and understanding between British Columbians and reducing systemic barriers to participation by under-represented, racialized groups.

We offer our heartfelt condolences to their loved ones and the staff who cared for them during this difficult time.“We are also announcing 30 new cases of COVID-19 for a total of 103 cases in British Columbia. The individuals are in the Vancouver Coastal, Fraser, Interior and Island health regions and were confirmed positive, based on BC Centre for Disease Control testing.“Six people confirmed positive are in acute care, five have fully recovered and all others are self-isolating at home.“A significant number of new cases are related to the Pacific Dental Conference 2020 held at the Vancouver Convention Centre on March 6 and 7, 2020. We are asking anyone who attended to self-isolate until March 22, 2020.“Today, we are taking a number of additional steps to address the changing situation in B.C. and ensure our health-care system is best positioned to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.“British Columbia’s health authorities are directed to immediately move all hospitals in the province to Outbreak Response Phase 2. This means hospitals will undertake only urgent and emergency procedures and will postpone all non-urgent scheduled surgeries. Hospitals will review operating-room capacity daily to prioritize urgent and emergency cases. “Lions Gate Hospital in the Vancouver Coastal Health region is directed to move to Outbreak Response Phase 3. This means the hospital will accept only emergency patients. Lions Gate Hospital is also preparing to open a dedicated COVID-19 unit to provide care to those with the virus.“These measures will assist hospitals to redeploy and train essential service health-care providers on critical care related to COVID-19 to ensure sufficient medical supplies for patients and staff who need them most, and to further increase capacity to respond to the potential for a surge of COVID-19 patients requiring acute care.“We have worked with the College of Pharmacists to advise pharmacies to provide patients with a prescription refill or an emergency supply of their medications if needed. This will give physicians more time to care for patients with acute care needs. British Columbians are asked to respect this temporary arrangement and are reminded that there is no need to stockpile medication.“To further enhance the availability of physicians for all British Columbians, the Province will provide physicians compensation for providing virtual-care services. We have also requested all health regulators to begin emergency registration of non-practising or retired health-care professionals, including professionals from other jurisdictions and the armed forces.“Further, we are moving to restrict visitors in long-term care to essential visits only. Essential visits include compassionate visits for end-of-life care and visits that support care plans for residents based on resident and family needs, for example, families who routinely visit to provide assistance with feeding or mobility.“In an effort to allow 811 health-care professionals to support more people who are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms or who require assistance with other health issues, the Province has created a dedicated phone service to provide British Columbians non-medical information about COVID-19. This includes the latest information on travel recommendations and social distancing, as well as access to support and resources from the provincial and federal governments.“British Columbians can reach service representatives seven days a week, from 7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m., by calling 1 888 COVID19. Information is available in more than 110 languages.“We have also taken additional action to enhance social distancing and limit transmission. These efforts are not forever, but they are important for now.“We are issuing a new order prohibiting all public gatherings of more than 50 people. This includes indoor and outdoor sporting events, conferences, meetings, religious gatherings and other similar events. “On the recommendation of the provincial health officer, the attorney general, minister responsible for the British Columbia Lottery Corporation, has ordered all casinos to close until further notice to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. This order came into effect 11:59 a.m. today.“We are also consulting with education stakeholders on potential recommendations for school operations following spring break.”Learn More:To view the provincial health officer's order on mass gatherings, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topicsFor more information on B.C.’s updated testing strategy and self-isolation, visit:

It also means you can still do your shopping, go to restaurants, attend family events and continue to enjoy many other activities.“The recommendations and direction are about protecting our community and about slowing down the transmission of COVID-19 to enable our health-care system to continue to support those who need care – whether with COVID-19 or another illness.“We continue widespread testing of those with symptoms to identify cases of COVID-19 and take immediate action. As of March 13, 2020, 6,326 individuals have been tested in B.C. We commend health-care workers across our province and at the BCCDC for their incredible work in this area.“We continue to activate the British Columbia Pandemic Provincial Coordination Plan. One example of the measures we are taking is to enable emergency, temporary registration of physicians and nurses. That is now in place and we have already received many calls from across the province of offers to support our pandemic response.“Our 811 navigators and nurses are doing an incredible job with record high call volumes, providing support to over 10,000 callers in the last three days. We are adding more staff and more phone lines to resolve the intermittent busy signals some people have experienced.”Learn More:For guidance on mass gatherings, visit: https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/health-professionals/mass-gatherings-risk-assesment.htmlFor federal government recommendations on cruise ship travel, visit: https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/latest-travel-health-advice.html#cruiseFor recommendations on protecting yourself and your community, visit:http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/coronavirus-(novel)For the COVID-19 pandemic preparedness and planning materials, visit: visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topics/pandemic-influenza.For more information and latest updates on COVID-19, follow the BCCDCon Twitter @CDCofBC or visit its website: http://www.bccdc.ca/For the latest audio clips of COVID-19 media availabilities, visit: https://soundcloud.com/bcgov

The Province is making affordable, quality child care more accessible for families in Castlegar by investing in 30 new spaces.  “Partnering with local government lets us create more new licensed child care spaces that will help strengthen the community for years to come,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “This is about making a long-term investment in the area and the young families that call Castlegar home.”Through the Childcare BC New Spaces Fund, the Regional District of Central Kootenay (RDCK) is creating 30 new spaces: 10 spaces for children aged three to five, and 20 school-age spaces. The RDCK is partnering with the Kootenay Family Place Society for Children and Youth, which has been operating child care centres in the area for over 45 years. The district expects the new centre to open in September 2021.“What an amazing time for the complex! Most new parents will tell you that available child care is a challenge in the Kootenays. I am one of those parents,” said Bergen Price, chair, Castlegar and District Recreation Commission. “As we continue to grow as a community, assets like these are essential. Thank you to the recreation commissioners, RDCK staff and Kootenay Family Place for making this happen.”The Circle of Indigenous Nations Society will provide Indigenous programming for the centre. It also offers various supports like the Aboriginal Supported Child Development Program, which helps Indigenous families who have children with extra support needs to participate in the centre’s programming. Children at the centre will be involved in their community by helping out in the community garden, taking part in the Adopt a Street Litter Program and through regular visits to the Castle View Seniors Centre.“We are excited to celebrate our innovative partnership with the Regional District of Central Kootenay and bringing much-needed access to child care to one of the most central, convenient and highly utilized facilities in the community,” said Jim Fisher, executive director, Kootenay Family Place. “This project will enhance early learning in our community and provide much-needed additional and flexible space for recreation programs and events in Castlegar.”In addition to child care, Kootenay Family Place will offer various wraparound services through partnerships with other affiliated programs. Kootenay Family Place also operates the local Neighbourhood House facility, which offers family support services, including weekly English-as-a-second language drop-in classes to support families new to the country. The new child care centre will also host early childhood education students from Selkirk College for the practicum portion of their program.This latest investment means that 53 new licensed child care spaces have been funded in Castlegar since July 2018. These new spaces are part of the fastest creation of child care spaces in B.C.’s history, with more than 13,000 funded since July 2018.An additional 4,100 spaces have been funded through the 2017 Budget Update and the Early Learning and Child Care agreement with the Government of Canada, bringing the total to more than 17,000 spaces since July 2017.Since launching in February 2018, the Childcare BC plan has helped parents in Castlegar save more than $850,000 through the Affordable Child Care Benefit and Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative.Investing in child care and early childhood education is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:
Selkirk College Children’s Centre in Castlegar is one of more than 50 Childcare BC Universal Prototype Sites, providing 47 spaces for no more than $10 a day.
To date, the Province has invested more than $19 million to provide more than 11,500 early childhood educators with a $1-per-hour wage enhancement, with another $1-per-hour lift to come in April 2020. This includes more than $30,000 for early childhood educators in Castlegar

649,2020-03-13 09:45:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020CFD0035-000461,Government Website,Success stories are part of child protection workers’ days,"

After five years as a child protection worker, Rachel Davidson says the biggest misconception people have about her work is that it is always negative.But that impression couldn’t be further from her reality.“Every single week, there’s a different success story. There’s always good news,” says Rachel, one of the many front-line workers that Social Work Week recognizes and celebrates March 15-21, 2020.“We are meeting with families on their worst days, but we also have the privilege of seeing them come out the other side,” Rachel explains. She often sees youth she has supported over the years at the grocery store or gym, and she is proud when she sees them thriving. It is also not unusual to have a youth come back to her office to say “hi” and keep in touch.When she’s working with a family, Rachel says she always uses what she refers to as the “least intrusive measure available” as a response, so children can remain with their parents. This includes developing a safety plan with parents to address concerns and helping them access resources, counselling or other services to support them in creating a safer and happier home.“I’m respectful but transparent with parents,” says Rachel, who highlights that being genuine goes a long way in building trust. “I tell them I know they are doing the best they can. Parents always have their children’s best interests at heart, and so do I.”Upon receiving a child protection report, Rachel meets with parents to discuss the concerns and generally starts with a simple question: “How have things been going lately?” She interviews the children to learn their perspective of life at home and uses their own words when talking with parents to help navigate the conversation, working with them to develop an agreed upon plan to move forward.The goal is always to preserve the family unit, but if a removal is necessary due to significant safety concerns, Rachel says the first alternative is finding extended family who can provide safe care. “I believe that identifying family members who love a child and have a pre-existing relationship with them can only support positive outcomes. At times there can be complex dynamics between parents and extended family members, and it’s always important to remind parents the purpose of involving them is to support family connections for their child, while also allowing parents the time to address the concerns we have for them.”Recently, the ministry created a new position, a family finder, which is a networking role that specifically searches for extended family members who might be a good fit to step in and care for a child. In 2019, 4,522 children and youth were placed in out-of-care options, including in the care of extended family members instead of in the care of the ministry.Rachel says she’s grateful for the supportive home she grew up in and the stories her mother, who worked with at-risk youth, and grandmother, also a child protection worker, shared with her. She says these relationships and experiences played a role in her finding this career path.Considering the demands of her job, Rachel says her close-knit team and getting her “sweat on at the gym every day before work” are the key to a healthy work/life balance. “My team is always sharing success stories with each other. There’s a lot more positivity in our role than most people realize. I love being here and it may sound cliché, but I could not imagine working anywhere else.”Quick Facts:
As of Dec. 31, 2019, there were a total of 3,408 employees providing front-line work on behalf of the Ministry of Children and Family Development.
At Delegated Aboriginal Agencies, there are almost 400 front-line and administrative full-time equivalent employees.

People struggling with mental-health and substance-use challenges will be supported through a new research project to test an integrated set of employment supports for people with multiple and long-term barriers to employment.The Province is providing $1.5 million through WorkBC’s Community and Employer Partnerships (CEP) to the Canadian Mental Health Association BC Division (CMHA BC) for a two-year research and innovation project that is expected to be complete in January 2022.The project is designed to increase access to meaningful volunteering, training and employment for people who receive the Persons with Persistent Multiple Barriers (PPMB) category of income assistance. PPMB recipients have faced a range of adverse experiences, including homelessness or domestic violence, and often have chronic health conditions, such as mental illness or addiction, that make finding and sustaining employment challenging.“Provincial supports, such as income assistance and employment programs, are meant to help some of the most vulnerable people in B.C.,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “Projects like this will ensure that our programs are actually reaching the people who need them most, when they need them most, and create sustainable employment by meeting people where they are in their lives.”The project will create a set of wraparound services for people on PPMB assistance, based on person-centred outcomes that acknowledge the individual experiences and promote personal choice and recovery. The project will assess the success of each of the services, with a focus on physical and mental-health outcomes and how successful people are in finding and maintaining volunteering, training and employment. The CMHA BC will provide quarterly reports to the Province and release a final report that will help develop future B.C. government programs and services. “A sense of purpose and the chance to contribute can make a huge difference to someone on their pathway to healing and hope,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “This project is creating new ways for people with multiple barriers, including mental-health and substance-use challenges, to fully participate in their communities and find new ways forward.”“This unique project will combine proven employment supports, trauma-informed and culturally safe practices, and primary care to pave a path forward toward hope for people living with significant mental-health and substance-use problems,” said Jonny Morris, chief executive officer, CMHA BC. “Meaningful, paid work is a key driver of recovery, and we are excited to work with people with lived experience to design and offer the right services at the right time to help workers with mental illness become valued members of the workforce.”Quick Facts:

Budget 2020 ensures B.C.’s education system will have the highest school operating funding ever, investing more than $20 billion for B.C.’s schools over the next three years, with the highest capital funding at $2.8 billion over three years.
Children and youth in care, children living in low income families and a greater number of students with mental health challenges will benefit from a new $23-million supplement being allocated to school districts in 2020-21.
School boards will determine how this funding is used based on the students in their community who need the extra support. Districts will use the supplement to provide additional supports and services to these students, including trauma counselling, tutoring, mental health prevention strategies or hiring additional support staff.
B.C. students will also benefit from an estimated $144.6 million in new operating funding for K-12 public schools in 2020-21. 
This increase will bring the total public school operating grant to $5.536 billion for the 2020-21 school year, supporting 3,480 more full-time students in September 2020, based on school district enrolment estimates.
When all operating funding for public schools is included, the average per-student funding in 2020-21 is estimated to be $10,749, 13% higher than in 2016-17.
Students at rural schools will benefit from the largest one-year funding increase ever for their schools, with $321.6 million allocated this year, $26.5 million more than last year and $49.4 million more than in 2016-17.
The amount of money school districts receive to support Indigenous learners and students with special needs is increasing for the 2020-21 school year.
Students with special needs are being supported with an estimated $627 million in supplemental funding in 2020-21 – an increase of $163 million (35%) since the 2016-17 school year.
Indigenous learners will benefit from an estimated $93.3 million in supplemental funding in 2020-21 – an increase of $23.7 million (34%) since the 2016-17 school year.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“We are announcing seven new cases of COVID-19 for a total of 53 cases in British Columbia. The individuals are in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser health regions and were confirmed positive, based on BC Centre for Disease Control testing.“Three cases are connected to the Hollyburn House Retirement Residence, three cases are travel-related and one is a community case.“The three individuals are connected to the Hollyburn House Retirement Residence in West Vancouver include case 48, a male in his 40s and case 49, a female in her 40s, both of whom are health-care workers at Hollyburn. Case 47 is a man in his 90s, a resident. Public health teams are on site and actively working to investigate and contain potential transmission to other residents and workers. The outbreak at this facility is linked to the outbreak at Lynn Valley Care Centre.“Case 50 is a man in his 40s who returned from travel in the United Kingdom and lives in the Vancouver Coastal Health region.“Case 51 is a man in his 40s. Case 52 is a woman in her 40s. Both cases 51 and 52 live in the Vancouver Coastal Health region and are returning from a group trip to Egypt.“Case 53 is a man in his 50s and is a community case identified through laboratory surveillance. He is self-isolating at his home in the Vancouver Coastal Health region.Of B.C.’s 53 COVID-19 cases, four people have fully recovered and one woman in her 60s remains in in hospital in the Fraser Health region in stable condition. All other individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19 are in isolation at home with care and support from public health teams.“With the increasing transmission of COVID-19 at mass gatherings and events, in addition to the escalating risk of community transmission, we must do our best to slow transmission of COVID-19 and protect our communities.“Our schools and our workplaces are operating safely, and we want to keep it that way.“We are recommending against all non-essential travel outside of Canada, including to the United States. Effective today, anyone who chooses to travel outside of Canada will be asked to stay away from work or school for 14 days upon their return. We know that this is a voluntary measure, but it is our expectation that people will follow this direction as part of their civic duty. “Effective today, we also directing all event organizers to cancel any gathering larger than 250 people. This includes indoor and outdoor sporting events, conferences, meetings, religious gatherings or other similar events. This threshold has been selected, as it is much easier to maintain important social distancing to prevent transmission of COVID-19.“Some post-secondary institutions have classes with more than 250 students, and we are working with them to take measures to address this situation.“Over spring break the B.C. government will also work with school districts to develop procedures to be implemented with students and staff when classes resume.“We are asking employers to excuse staff for sick leave without requiring a doctor’s note, if their employees are ill or required to self-isolate. We are also reinforcing that if you have symptoms and may have been exposed to COVID-19, you must call your local primary care provider, or 811, to arrange for safe testing.“We have heard reports of employers requiring all their staff to get tested. Only a health-care professional can determine whether you require a test – and employers should not require employees to have a test if a health-care provider has recommended against it.“We recognize this will have a significant economic and social impact, and want to reassure British Columbians that these are temporary measures required to protect the health of the public at this critical time of pandemic. We will be reassessing these conditions on an ongoing basis as the pandemic evolves.“Our 811 navigators and nurses are doing an incredible job with record high call volumes - providing support to 3,291 callers yesterday, March 11, 2020.

South Surrey students can look forward to more classrooms in an expanded Sunnyside Elementary and a new school site in the Darts Hill neighbourhood.“After years of underinvestment in Surrey’s schools, we’re taking action to add new seats for students so they can get out of portables and be better connected to their peers,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “As Surrey continues to grow, we’ll keep building new and expanded schools wherever they’re needed, so every student has the best chance to succeed.”The Government of British Columbia is investing a combined $25.4 million in a 10-classroom, 250-seat addition at Sunnyside Elementary and in purchasing a school site in the Darts Hill neighbourhood. The Surrey School District is contributing an additional $5 million for the Darts Hill site.“Our student population has been steadily increasing every year, with rapid growth in South Surrey,” explains Laurie Larsen, chair of the Surrey Board of Education. “An addition at Sunnyside Elementary and a new school site in the Darts Hill area will help our district respond to this growth and move students out of portables and back into schools.”This new funding is needed to help address the number of portables in the district, where only one new school has opened since 2014.

Since September 2017, the Province has approved over $301 million for school capital projects in Surrey, which is helping over 7,600 new student seats open in the district between 2018 and 2022, eliminating the equivalent of nearly 305 portables.There are many more new projects to come in Surrey, with four school sites now purchased and eight expansion projects supported for business case development.  The Sunnyside Elementary expansion is scheduled to be complete in September 2022.There are currently 12 portables in use at the school. This expansion, along with a new addition at Pacific Heights opening in April 2020 and a new Edgewood Drive Elementary school opening in September 2021, will eliminate the need for 11 of those portables.To continue improving schools for students in Surrey and throughout B.C., Budget 2020 includes a record $2.8 billion for school capital projects, including new and expanded schools, seismic upgrades and land purchases for future schools.

People experiencing homelessness in Kelowna will soon have a place to call their own as new permanent supportive homes with around-the-clock care and supports open in the community.“Everyone deserves a safe, secure place to call home and that is what this project is about,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “These new supportive homes will give people experiencing homelessness in Kelowna the chance to make changes and build a better life.”Located at 280 McIntosh Rd., Samuel Place is a four-storey modular apartment building with 50 self-contained units, including private washrooms, showers and mini kitchens. Shared amenities include a laundry room, commercial kitchen and a dining lounge area where residents can have meals together. The building also has a medical room to provide on-site care for residents.“The City of Kelowna and its community partners continue to support the Journey Home Strategy’s Housing First model and to advocate for additional and diverse forms of housing, so that everyone in our community can have a place to call home,” said Colin Basran, mayor, City of Kelowna.The John Howard Society of Okanagan and Kootenay (JHSOK) will manage Samuel Place and provide residents with support services, including meal programs, life and employment skills training, health and wellness support services and opportunities for volunteer work. At least two staff members will be on site 24/7.“We are excited to welcome residents into their new home at Samuel Place, where they can restore dignity and become part of a community that they can contribute to and feel a genuine part of,” said Dawn Himer, executive director, JHSOK. “Housing with supports makes a difference in lives and creates opportunity for safe, healthy and inclusive communities for all.” Residents will begin moving into the building on March 23, 2020. All 40 guests from Fuller Bridge to Housing, Kelowna’s temporary bridge housing for people experiencing homelessness, will be transitioned to supportive housing sites in the city, including Samuel Place.“I was never taught how to keep an apartment and live on my own, but I left home at a young age and tried for several years to make ends meet,” said V, a new resident at Samuel Place. “I fought hard to pay rent and live, even to a point of having three jobs, but somehow it wasn’t enough, and I just couldn’t figure it out. Through these difficult circumstances, I have learned much about myself, people, life and matured, so I look forward to this second chance at having my own home, to care for and to learn to stand on my own and be who I can be.”Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:
The Province provided $15.5 million to the project through the Rapid Response to Homelessness program and will provide up to $1 million in annual operational funding.
B.C.-based manufacturer Horizon North was selected by the Province to manufacture these new homes in Kelowna, and for several other modular projects in B.C., supporting jobs and local economies.
With the opening of Samuel Place, Hearthstone (46 homes) and Heath House (40 homes), there are now 136 supportive homes in Kelowna that have opened within the past two years and an additional 100 homes are underway.
In just over two years, government has built more than 2,100 supportive homes, with over 900 more underway and a goal of 4,900 over 10 years.

Giving people opportunities to be active and engage in sport is the foundation of Pathways to Sport, B.C.’s new strategic framework.The first public-facing document of its kind in B.C. in over a decade, Pathways to Sport sets out a clear vision for a prosperous and sustainable sport sector. It will guide government investments and identifies three key priority areas: increasing sport participation, strengthening athlete development and enhancing event hosting opportunities for B.C. communities.“We know sport contributes to our health and wellness and adds to the vibrancy of our communities,” said Lisa Beare, Minister of Tourism Arts and Culture. “Every person should have an opportunity to enjoy the benefits of active living, and this is why we are putting forward a plan for a provincial sport system that is accessible, affordable, safe and inclusive for everyone.”The framework is based on four key principles: affordability, accessibility, equity and inclusion, and safety and ethics. It focuses on those who continue to be under-represented in sport, including people with disabilities, lower income families, Indigenous peoples, immigrants and new Canadians, 55+ adults, and girls, women and non-binary genders. This framework will also guide new relationships with Indigenous peoples based on reconciliation and respect as B.C. continues to lead Canada in implementing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's Calls to Action related to sport.“ViaSport is proud of its role in supporting the process of creating B.C.’s strategic framework for sport, helping to ensure that sport continues to be a catalyst for positive health, social and community benefits,” said Charlene Krepiakevich, CEO of viaSport.Quick Facts:
Currently, more than 800,000 British Columbians play organized sports and are members of one of the more than 70 provincial sports organizations, multi-sport organizations or disability sport organizations.
B.C. is a leader in Canada for high-performance sport, contributing approximately 34% of the athletes on Canadian national teams.
In February 2019, B.C. endorsed the Red Deer Declaration, which called for a co-ordinated response to addressing and preventing harassment, abuse and discrimination in sport.
As part of the 2020 Athlete of the Year Awards, the Province launched the new Delivering on Diversity Award, which recognizes a provincial, disability or multi-sport organization that has demonstrated a commitment toward advancing accessibility and inclusion in sport.
The award supports the Province’s commitment to gender-based analysis plus, diversity and inclusion.

Young people will have the chance to not only survive, but also thrive, thanks to a new Foundry centre opening in Maple Ridge that focuses on reaching them early and preventing small problems from becoming big ones.Foundry Ridge Meadows, as with all Foundry centres, provides young people ages 12-24 who are living with mental health and substance use challenges with a safe and judgement-free environment where they can feel comfortable asking for help, accessing the services they need or finding solutions to their problems.“Our young people are dealing with immense pressures every single day that are impacting their mental health, including anxiety, depression and substance use,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “When young people walk through the door at Foundry Ridge Meadows, they’ll be welcomed by warm, caring and qualified staff ready to support them through their struggles, because no one should have to walk their unique pathway to healing and hope alone. I am so grateful to all the community partners and to MLAs Lisa Beare and Bob D’Eith for their strong advocacy.”The centre will provide a number of integrated wellness services, including physical and mental health care, substance use supports such as counselling, social services including supportive employment, and youth and family peer supports.“We are excited to have Ridge Meadows join the Foundry network as the ninth centre to open its doors. This community has rallied around its youth and families to improve services, and to make Foundry Ridge Meadows a reality,” said Dr. Steve Mathias, executive director, Foundry. “A lot of work and engagement of young people and families goes into building and operating these centres. What you see today is a testament to an incredible commitment by the community to this new centre.”The capital renovation costs for Foundry Ridge Meadows totalled $1.4 million. Foundry Ridge Meadows received two government grants – a Foundry capital grant for $400,000 and a capital gaming grant for $250,000. The remainder of the funding was raised by Maple Ridge/Pitt Meadows Community Services, with help from the Ridge Meadows Hospital Foundation and many community supporters.Foundry Ridge Meadows, located at 22932 Lougheed Hwy., is one of nine centres open throughout the province, joining Victoria, Kelowna, Campbell River, Prince George, Abbotsford, Penticton and two locations in Vancouver (Granville and the North Shore), with two more in development in Terrace and Richmond.

Amendments to the Agricultural Land Commission Act are now in force, improving the ability of the Agricultural Land Commission (ALC) to preserve farmland, encourage farming and protect local food supplies throughout British Columbia.Bill 15 received royal assent last spring, and new regulations were developed in consultation with representatives of local governments and a technical working group that included the Union of B.C. Municipalities, the ALC and the BC Agriculture Council.The changes strengthen the ALC by giving the commission more flexibility to create decision-making panels that can better consider local and regional circumstances for land within the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR). This amendment allows the ALC to reduce decision wait times for landowners and make better use of the commissioners, drawing on their expertise in a related technical field or land-use issue.In addition, the process by which farmland can be permanently removed from the ALR will now go through a planning approach so that only local governments, First Nations and other prescribed bodies can make exclusion applications directly to the ALC. This change strengthens the exclusion application process by empowering local governments to ensure ALC decisions align with the land-use plans in their own communities. Private landowners can still request that their land be removed from the ALR provided their local government agrees and makes the application to the ALC.During the recent Strengthening Farming public consultation, local governments indicated they need sufficient transition time to implement these changes. As a result of this feedback, this change will go into effect on Sept. 30, 2020.Other changes include:
simplifying the ALC application fee process so ALR landowners only pay the local or First Nations governments their portions of an application fee, and if these governments later forward the application to ALC, pay the ALC directly for its portion of the fee;
adding new decision-making criteria to prioritize the protection of the size, integrity and continuity of the land base that the ALC must consider when exercising any power or performing a duty under the act;
bringing more rigour to the reconsideration process by clarifying the circumstances under which reconsiderations will proceed; and
ensuring the ALC chair can give input to government regarding commissioner appointments.
Quick Facts:
The ALR includes 46,159 square kilometres of B.C. that are preserved for agricultural use, which is equivalent to less than 5% of B.C.’s total land base.
Prior to the establishment of the ALR in 1973, thousands of hectares of farmland were lost to development every year.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:“We are announcing seven new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 46 cases in British Columbia. The individuals are in the Vancouver Coastal Health, Fraser Health and Island Health regions.“Two cases are connected to the Lynn Valley Care Centre, three cases are travel-related and two are community cases.“Case 40 is a male in 20s living in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, and case 45 is a woman in her 50s living in the Fraser Health region. Both work at the Lynn Valley Care Centre. There are no new resident cases.“Case 43 is a male in his 70s living in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. Case 46 is a man in his 60s living in the Island Health region. Both cases 43 and 46 have returned from travelling in Egypt. “Case 42 is a man in his 70s from Egypt, who is visiting family in the Fraser Health region.“Case 41 is a woman in her 60s, currently in hospital. Case 44 is a man in his 60s. Both are new community cases, who were identified through laboratory surveillance, and both reside in the Fraser Health region.“Three patients have been discharged from hospital and are now recovering at home. One person is in hospital. All other patients with COVID-19 remain in isolation at home with care and support from public health teams.“We have seen an increase in community cases in the Lower Mainland and Fraser Valley in recent days, where the source of the virus infection is not yet known. Public health teams are actively investigating, as we continue work to limit the spread of transmission in B.C.“Today, we are asking British Columbians to take additional care of seniors and people with compromised immune systems. Do not visit them if you are sick. If they are living at home and are sick, consider how you may support them with food and other necessities. If you need to visit a long-term care home or other health-care facility, go one person at a time and limit your visit to the person you know.“We are working with all long-term care and assisted living facilities to implement enhanced prevention measures to further protect all residents.“If any British Columbian has been notified by event organizers that they may have been exposed to COVID-19, such as the recent Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada conference in Toronto, we are strongly recommending social distancing in the workplace and at home, especially from those most vulnerable, in addition to closely monitoring for symptoms.“Today, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. As part of the British Columbia Pandemic Provincial Co-ordination Plan, we continue to focus on containment to break the chains of transmission, and we are using all the tools in our toolbox required at this time.“As an example, callers to British Columbia’s HealthLink 811 line have experienced intermittent busy signals today as call volume has increased. We are resolving this by adding more staff, more phone lines and a new menu option to provide a dedicated queue for calls about COVID-19.“The British Columbia Pandemic Provincial Co-ordination Plan details the preparations and comprehensive toolkit to respond to the evolving outbreak. This will be an ongoing resource for the province.”Learn More:For federal government recommendations on mass gatherings, visit:

The Government of B.C. is partnering with the Vancouver Aboriginal Friendship Centre Society (VAFCS) and the City of Vancouver on a proposal to provide more than 160 new affordable homes and 80 shelter spaces for people and families in downtown Vancouver.“It’s great to see the Vancouver Aboriginal Friendship Centre, the City of Vancouver and the Government of B.C. working together to address the desperate need for housing,” said Melanie Mark, MLA for Vancouver-Mount Pleasant, on behalf of Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “1015 East Hastings will provide various housing options that meet the needs of my diverse constituents. Partnerships like this will go a long way to deliver the safe, secure and affordable housing people deserve.”The proposed site for the mixed-use development is the vacant lot at 1015 East Hastings St. The city currently owns the site. It is an ideal location for the development due to its proximity to transit and services.In the coming weeks, BC Housing and VAFCS will submit an application to rezone the site. The proposal will include:
85 affordable rental homes
53 rental homes at or below market rent
25 supportive homes
80 shelter beds
commercial space to be operated by VAFCS
“This project is designed to make a positive contribution to the community,” said Susan Tatoosh, executive director, VAFCS. “It will help people gain the skills they need to transition to independent living, celebrate the area’s rich and vibrant Indigenous history, and create a space where neighbours can connect to each other and people from all cultural backgrounds.”Once rezoned, BC Housing would take over ownership of the site. The VAFCS would operate the shelter and supportive housing, which would prioritize spaces for Indigenous peoples experiencing homelessness in the community. BC Housing is in the process of working with the Aboriginal Housing Management Association (AHMA) to identify a non-profit partner to operate the affordable rental homes.“AHMA’s vision aligns with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Article 23, which states, ‘Indigenous Peoples have the right to be actively involved in developing and determining health, housing and other economic social programmes affecting them,’” said Margaret Pfoh, CEO, AHMA. “The Province partnering with our members of the Vancouver Aboriginal Friendship Centre Society is an integral step towards obtaining that vision. We know this partnership will lead to incredible positive impacts and we look forward to welcoming future residents to the AHMA community.”Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:
On March 31, 2020, all partners will host an information session for neighbours and the broader community to learn more about the proposal. Details about the information session can be found on BC Housing’s Let’s Talk page: www.letstalkhousingbc.ca/1015EHastings
Through investments by the Province, more than 23,000 new homes are complete, under construction or in development for people with a range of incomes throughout B.C., including more than 3,500 homes in Vancouver.

Post-secondary education and training will be more affordable for thousands of students throughout B.C., thanks to the new B.C. Access Grant program.“The new B.C. Access Grant will break down financial barriers and enable thousands more students to get a college or university education in their chosen fields,” said Premier John Horgan. “It’s part of our government’s work to build a strong economy for everyone, where people can get good, well-paying jobs that support them and their families, and business can access more skilled workers.”Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation spoke with students from the Nicola Valley Institute of Technology (NVIT) and celebrated the new grant, which will take effect in September 2020. Eligible students can receive up to $4,000 per year through the new program.The new, needs-based B.C. Access Grant will target those who need it most: low- and middle-income students. Students will receive the grant at the beginning of their studies, so they can pay for tuition, text books, lab and other supplies needed for their program of study.For the first time, such funding will also be available for students who are studying in programs under two years, including certificate and diploma programs, as well as for students studying part time. The changes nearly double the number of students who will be eligible to receive support.“Students have been calling for this moment for almost two decades,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “The new grant will open doors to post-secondary education for thousands of British Columbians who were shut out for far too long. This is a game changer that will benefit students who need it the most, especially with their up-front costs like tuition and books. I am so proud that our government is investing in the next generation of students.”The B.C. Access Grant complements the Canada Student Grant for Full-time Students, ensuring B.C. students attending public post-secondary institutions receive up to $4,000 a year to help with the cost of programs leading to a certificate, diploma or degree.“The youth of today are our future. I have spoken with students on many occasions about both the challenges and opportunities of pursuing post-secondary education, and I believe these grants will make a difference in their path ahead. By making these new grants available – the first new investment in post-secondary grants by the provincial government in 15 years – we are supporting students who might otherwise struggle to pursue their studies and helping to build a better, stronger B.C. for tomorrow,” said Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation.Government is investing $24 million in new funding over three years. This is in addition to approximately $37 million government is reinvesting from existing grant programs that don’t help students with the up-front costs of their post-secondary education. More than 40,000 low- and middle-income students will be eligible for the new B.C. Access Grant, which will be available starting in the fall 2020 semester. Quick Facts:
Students will automatically be assessed for their eligibility for the B.C. Access Grant when they apply for financial assistance from StudentAid BC.
Eligible students in programs that are under two years in length will receive up to $4,000 per year.
Eligible students in programs that are two years or longer will receive up to $1,000 per year.
These students may also be eligible for the Canada Student Grant for Full-time students of up to $3,000 per year.

North and Central Island residents living with kidney disease now have access to integrated, specialized care closer to home, thanks to a new kidney care clinic at the North Island Hospital in Campbell River.The clinic, funded by BC Renal and operated by Island Health, officially opened on Jan. 6, 2020, to support people living with kidney disease but who do not require dialysis or post-transplant care.“March is National Kidney Month, so it is particularly appropriate that we recognize the excellent work being done here in Campbell River to support improved kidney health,” said Claire Trevena, MLA for North Island. “This is an excellent resource for the people of the North Island living with kidney disease.”In the past, North Island residents had to travel to Nanaimo to see a kidney specialist or wait for travelling care teams to visit Campbell River or the Comox Valley. Now they have access to a new kidney care team that includes nurses, a dietitian, social worker and pharmacy technician.“It’s excellent to see care provided in a way that works best for the patient, as we work on developing a health system that truly meets the needs of patients, where they are in the community, at home,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “By reducing the burden of travel for patients on the North Island, we’re helping them be empowered with their health to address the challenges of living with kidney disease.”The clinic, located in the hospital’s wellness centre, operates from Monday to Friday. Kidney specialists, called nephrologists, will visit weekly.The Campbell River kidney care clinic, which is the third such clinic in Island Health, provides patients with expert education, counselling and support with things like diet, medication and other important factors that influence overall health and disease progression. Approximately 250 patients benefited when their care was moved to the new clinic. Future patients will be referred by their nephrologist.Visiting clinics, with travelling practitioners from Nanaimo, will continue to be held in the Comox Valley.Quotes:Dr. Adeera Levin, executive director, BC Renal –""Research clearly shows that early identification and treatment can slow or even stop progression of kidney disease through changes to lifestyle and diet, as well as medications. The more involved a person is in his or her own care, the better the results.”Teresa Backx, manager of Renal Services, Island Health –“The goals of the clinic are to provide information and support for people with advanced or quickly progressing kidney disease. The clinic promotes patients being involved in their care and has an emphasis on self-management. Patient visits don’t always need to include a nephrologist, but they can work with the rest of our care team to slow progression of their illness or prepare them for treatment options if required. This clinic will deliver care closer to home, which is really important. Once they begin receiving care, patients want to visit the clinics. Making it easier for patients in this region to access a kidney care clinic is a real benefit to them and their families.”Walter Podovsky, Comox Valley patient – “The people in Nanaimo are wonderful, but it’s that much farther to travel. It will be great to have the clinic in Campbell River. I’m sure it will be well used.”Learn More:For more information about kidney care within Island Health, visit: www.islandhealth.caFor information about Kidney Health Month and BC Renal, visit: www.bcrenalagency.ca

A partnership between Stó:lō Nation, Vancouver Community College (VCC) and University of Fraser Valley (UFV) is helping Indigenous learners get the skills they need to open doors to sustainable jobs and further training in the in-demand hospitality industry.“I am proud to celebrate this community-driven partnership between Stó:lō Nation, Vancouver Community College and University of Fraser Valley. To me, this demonstrates reconciliation in action,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “Providing students with up-to-date, industry-standard trades training is vital to building a 21st-century workforce throughout the province. We need more people from all walks of life to fuel their passion and take advantage of the training and employment opportunities in the trades, including culinary arts.”The Province has invested $300,000 through the Aboriginal Community-Based Training Partnerships Program to fund the Stó:lō Aboriginal Skills and Employment Training (SASET) Culinary Arts program – a 12-week pre-trades training program at VCC and UFV that provides first aid, Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System, FoodSafe and SuperHost certificates, along with pre-apprenticeship training, including a work practicum placement.“A career in the culinary arts is a lifelong endeavour where learning never stops and job satisfaction happens every day,” said Chris Monkman, culinary instructor, UFV. “We’re thankful the Province recognizes the need for partnerships like this, as well as the need for state-of-the-art training equipment and spaces. This partnership really is a win-win.”An additional $200,000 in capital funding from the Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training is also being invested at UFV to build a new test kitchen space and provide equipment for the program. The project is underway at the Chilliwack campus where Lisa Beare, Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture, made the announcement on behalf of Mark.“I’m proud to be a part of a government that’s taking action to ensure students have access to affordable education and skills training,” said Beare. “This partnership between UFV, VCC and the Stó:lō Nation is giving these students the hands-on training and experience they need to pursue a good career in the trades.”Skills training that is culturally sensitive and relevant for Indigenous peoples helps meet the Calls to Action set out by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The SASET Culinary Arts program has been delivered to more than 140 students and has had positive impacts. At the course’s end, more than three-quarters of its students were employed or enrolled in further education.Quote:Jimmy McKay, SASET student, UFV –“This course and our instructor really opened up my eyes to the culinary world, and I feel like myself when I cook and bake. I’m thankful for being able to be a part of this. I am happy to have met ‘Chef’ and to have this program at UFV. I will be enrolling in the professional cook Level 1 program in August 2020!”Quick Facts:
The 2019 Labour Market Outlook indicates that by 2029, B.C. should expect close to 73,000 job openings in the trades.
That includes more than 7,828 job openings for cooks in the next decade in B.C.’s Mainland and Southwest regions.
In 2019, the Province invested $3.1 million in trades and technical equipment at 19 public post-secondary institutions throughout B.C., including $160,000 at VCC where the SASET Culinary Arts Program is offered.

673,2020-03-10 16:30:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/factsheets/investing-in-bc-transit,Government Website,Delivering public transit,"

A good public transit system is essential to building strong communities that are more affordable for the people who live in them.The B.C. government is committed to making life more affordable for British Columbians, improving the services that people count on and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Public transit is a service that contributes to these goals.Public transit services in over 130 communities are provided by BC Transit, funded by a cost-sharing partnership between provincial and local governments (Victoria Regional Transit Commission in Greater Victoria).The B.C. government will continue to support public infrastructure projects to increase safety for people, create connected communities and help BC Transit meet people’s public transit needs for generations to come.Key facts on transit investments:
The B.C. government continues to work with BC Transit, the federal government and local governments to fund transit improvements throughout B.C., including improving handyDART service.
The B.C. government’s budget for public transit outside Metro Vancouver is over $190 million in 2020. This includes $115.8 million in operating grants to make transit affordable for local governments, and capital investments of $77.4 million. 
Over the next three years, the Province’s capital investments, including the purchase of new buses, are projected to be $251.3 million. These investments allow BC Transit to fully leverage funding from partnerships with the Government of Canada and local governments.
Through the Government of Canada’s Public Transit Infrastructure Fund (PTIF) and Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program (ICIP), the Province of B.C., the Government of Canada and local governments are partnering to fund $1.2 billion in transit investments over the next decade in communities served by BC Transit.
This partnership will pay for new and replacement buses, such as electric and compressed natural gas, smart technologies including NextRide, safety technology (CCTV cameras), advanced fare technology, new and upgraded transit facilities, and new transit exchanges, park and rides, and bus lanes.
Transit services in northern B.C. have also been enhanced in support of the Province’s efforts to enable safe, affordable travel for Indigenous communities, residents and organizations through BC Bus North and the B.C. government’s Highway 16 Transportation Action Plan.
These combined investments will allow B.C. to support a growing population with a public transit system that is environmentally sound, affordable, accessible and convenient.

674,2020-03-10 15:30:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/factsheets/wildfire-prevention-is-everyones-responsibility,Government Website,Wildfire prevention is everyone's responsibility,"

In the wake of the unprecedented 2017 and 2018 wildfire seasons, the B.C. government has invested heavily in wildfire prevention and preparedness initiatives to help keep British Columbians safe and protect the province’s natural resources and infrastructure.The B.C. government has increased Direct Fire funding in Budget 2020 by $35 million, for a total of $136 million per year. This increase recognizes historical firefighting costs and allows for increased response capacity, community engagement and communication resources, to help communities be better prepared for wildfires.Government strongly supports the efforts of local governments and First Nations to reduce wildfire risks in and around their communities by completing fuel management projects, developing Community Wildfire Resiliency Plans and implementing FireSmart principles. This work is particularly important in the wildland-urban interface, where urban development borders on grasslands and forested areas.The Community Resiliency Investment program, launched in September 2018, provides $60 million to assist local governments and First Nations mitigate wildfire threats around their communities. As of March 9, 2020, 209 Community Resiliency Investment program grants have been allocated provincewide, amounting to more than $18.6 million.The BC Wildfire Service works closely with land managers to undertake a variety of fuel management activities to reduce wildfire risks, including the use of prescribed fire. A more comprehensive prescribed burning program, which will incorporate traditional ecological knowledge and is supported by an initial $10 million provided in Budget 2019, is being developed.Volunteer and composite fire departments throughout B.C. will receive a $5-million boost for equipment and training through the Province’s Community Emergency Preparedness Fund, distributed through the Union of B.C. Municipalities. This money is part of a newly established funding stream to help eligible applicants in local government and First Nations communities build resiliency with firefighter training and new or replacement firefighting equipment.Community Resiliency Investment program:
The B.C. government has committed $60 million to the Community Resiliency Investment program to help local governments and First Nations mitigate wildfire threats around their communities. The program, launched in September 2018, replaces the Strategic Wildfire Prevention Initiative.
As of March 9, 2020, 209 Community Resiliency Investment program grants have been allocated provincewide, amounting to more than $18.6 million.
The program allows local governments and First Nations to apply for funding to cover up to 100% of their wildfire risk reduction projects. Eligible applicants with a lower wildfire risk can apply for up to $25,000 per year, but applicants with a demonstrated higher wildfire risk can now apply for up to $150,000 per year.
The Community Resiliency Investment program takes a proactive approach to wildfire risk reduction and fuel management treatments by considering fire prevention and FireSmart activities on provincial Crown land, private land, local government land and reserve land.
Partnerships between local governments, First Nations and other tenure holders are encouraged, particularly in areas where treatments, vegetation management or other activities cross administrative boundaries.
More information about the Community Resiliency Investment program and the application process is available on the Union of B.C. Municipalities website: www.ubcm.ca/cri
More crews and equipment:The BC Wildfire Service (BCWS) has made changes to its operations to enhance its response capabilities.
More than 1,700 firefighters and support staff were available for the 2019 wildfire season. Both the Northwest Fire Centre and Prince George Fire Centre added additional initial attack crews in remote locations.
The use of the industry equipment strike team model is being expanded throughout the province to support initial attack efforts. These strike teams are a combination of heavy equipment, operators and line locator personnel that can be quickly deployed in response situations.
BCWS held joint training workshops with forest industry licensees in spring 2019 to enhance wildfire response throughout the province.
The Province's long-term contracted fleet for the 2019 fire season consisted of 32 fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, about 80 ground-attack vehicles and additional short-term contractors. Other national and international resources may be requested through mutual aid agreements.
The integration of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft was improved to maximize efficiency and firefighting aircraft contracts were longer for the 2019 fire season. For example, the availability period for the ""Fire Boss"" skimmer aircraft group (consisting of four Air Tractor “Fire Boss” airtankers and one Cessna Grand Caravan bird dog) was increased from 100 to 120 days.
BCWS and the Office of the Fire Commissioner are working on an expanded structure protection program, which will provide additional resources in rural and wildland-urban interface areas.
Type 1 firefighting crews are BCWS’s most highly trained frontline firefighters and have experience using a variety of firefighting equipment. BCWS also regularly calls on the services of contract crews to support wildfire management in British Columbia.
Type 2 contract crews are used to supplement BCWS firefighters and for sustained action support. Type 2 crews carry out expanded attack operations, including hand-guard construction, mop-up, and patrol duties.
Once part or all of a fire is considered to be under control, Type 3 contract crews may be brought in to mop up the fire using pumps and hoses, patrol burned areas using hand tools to extinguish any remaining hotspots, or remove equipment once a fire is fully extinguished.
Strengthening partnerships:
One of the key themes of the Abbott-Chapman report on the 2017 wildfire and freshet seasons (Addressing the New Normal: 21st Century Disaster Management in British Columbia) was the need to re-examine how the provincial government works with First Nations on wildfire issues.
Significant progress has been made to keep First Nations better informed on fire-related topics, such as:
pre-season forecasts;
fire season debriefings;
the use of heavy equipment; and
firefighting equipment caches in remote communities.

BCWS will continue to meet regularly with Indigenous communities to discuss communications, firefighter recruitment opportunities and contract opportunities.
BCWS has partnered with the First Nations’ Emergency Services Society of B.C. and Indigenous Services Canada on a strategy to deliver training required for Type 3 and Type 2 firefighting crews. The First Nations’ Emergency Services Society of B.C. is leading this training, supported by $150,000 from the BC Wildfire Service and $75,000 from Indigenous Services Canada.
Based on a pilot project conducted in Alexis Creek, BCWS is developing a First Nations firefighter recruitment strategy to be implemented throughout B.C.
Guidance is being provided to interested Indigenous communities to respond to master standing offer requests to supply Type 3 firefighting crews. BCWS is also providing advice to Indigenous communities interested in upgrading their existing Type 3 crews to Type 2 crews.
As part of ongoing efforts to help keep communities safe from wildfires, the B.C. government has provided $500,000 to the B.C. Cattlemen’s Association to work on an initiative to use grazing livestock to help manage fine fuels in parts of B.C. Targeted grazing is not a solution to all fuel management challenges, but it is a powerful tool when combined with other methods, such as prescribed burning and selective tree harvesting.
In partnership with the Fraser Basin Council, BCWS is holding community wildfire roundtables in communities facing a high wildfire risk. This $300,000 program is being delivered over two years.
BCWS is providing $400,000 to the Association of B.C. Forest Professionals to develop fire-related professional development sessions, which will provide guidance on the use of fire and management of fire risk when planning forestry operations.
In partnership with the Western Forestry Contractors’ Association, BCWS has formed a contract advisory committee to co-operatively develop procurement processes and allow BCWS to work more effectively with the contracting community.
FireSmart program
Mitigating wildfire risk is a shared responsibility. British Columbians can play a crucial role in mitigating wildfire risks around their homes and properties by using FireSmart principles.
FireSmart is founded on seven disciplines that are part of the responsibility or mandate of different organizations and/or levels of government:
education;
vegetation management;
legislation and planning;
development considerations;
inter-agency co-operation;
emergency planning; and
cross-training.

FireSmart is the Canadian standard recognized by all provinces and territories, based on National Fire Protection Association standards that have evolved over the last 40 years. FireSmart is backed by a vast amount of field, laboratory and modelling research. Its methods were demonstrated time and time again to reduce the risk of losses, under even the most extreme fire conditions.
Given the effects of climate change and the increased number of homes being developed in forested areas, B.C. residents need to undertake FireSmart activities to help protect their homes and neighbourhoods from wildfires.
The FireSmart Begins at Home manual was developed to help people reduce the risk of personal property damage due to wildfires. The manual and more information about the FireSmart program are available online: www.firesmartbc.ca
The BC FireSmart Committee was established in May 2017 to deliver a more effective FireSmart program throughout the province. The committee includes representation from:
BC Wildfire Service
Office of the Fire Commissioner
Union of B.C. Municipalities
Fire Chiefs’ Association of British Columbia
Emergency Management BC
Forest Enhancement Society of B.C. 
First Nations’ Emergency Services Society of B.C.

Forest Enhancement Society of British Columbia:
The Forest Enhancement Society of B.C., a Crown agency, was established in 2016 to advance environmental and resource stewardship of the province’s forests by:
preventing and mitigating the impact of wildfires;
improving damaged or low-value forests;
improving habitat for wildlife;
supporting the use of fibre from damaged and low-value forests; and
treating forests to improve the management of greenhouse gases.

To date, the B.C. government has invested $235 million in the society, with about $233 million allocated, as of Jan. 30, 2020, for wildfire risk reduction, reforestation, forest rehabilitation, wildlife habitat restoration and raising awareness of the FireSmart program.
Education and enforcement
Public outreach was significantly expanded in recent years to make full use of online resources and social media tools, such as Facebook and Twitter.
Nearly half of all wildfires each year are caused by human activity, so the BC Wildfire Service puts a strong emphasis on wildfire prevention, public education and enforcement.
In April 2016, the B.C. government significantly increased ticket fines for 19 different violations under the Wildfire Act and another seven violations under the Wildfire Regulation. British Columbia now has some of the highest wildfire-related violation ticket fines in Canada. More information about these changes is available online: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/wildfire-status/about-bcws/governance/legislation-regulations/summary-of-fines?keyword=fine
Anyone found in contravention of an open burning prohibition may be issued a ticket for $1,150, required to pay an administrative penalty of up to $10,000 or, if convicted in court, fined up to $100,000 and/or sentenced to one year in jail. If the contravention causes or contributes to a wildfire, the person responsible may be ordered to pay all firefighting and associated costs.

The Province has enabled the creation of Silver Star Mountain Resort Association, which will bring economic benefits to residents and businesses in the north Okanagan.The proposal submitted by the Silver Star Marketing Task Force – a group of interested stakeholders, including individual property owners, businesses, hotels and the resort operator – met the legislative requirements under the Resort Association Act to establish a resort association:
There will be a ski lift and year-round recreational area centre.
The local government where the resort association is located, which is the Regional District of North Okanagan, agrees to the resort association.
At least 50% of the landowners within the resort association boundaries, representing 50% of the property value, have signed a petition in favour of creating the resort association.
Silver Star Mountain Resort is a family ski resort in the north Okanagan and will be the fourth resort association in B.C. after Whistler, Sun Peaks and Red Mountain.Resort use and development is a critical part of B.C. tourism and is a major economic driver, creating local jobs, while generating provincial revenue. Resort associations help promote, facilitate and encourage the development, maintenance and operation of resorts. Resort associations collect a fee from property owners within the designated resort area who use their property for rental, business or commercial purposes.The next steps are for the Silver Star Marketing Task Force to register the resort association in B.C. with the registrar of companies and elect its first board of directors in order to begin operations.

Post-secondary education and training will be more affordable for thousands of students throughout B.C., thanks to the new B.C. Access Grant program.“I’m excited to be here today to speak with students about what the B.C. Access Grant will mean for them,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “By making the first new investment in post-secondary grants in 15 years, we’re empowering those who need it most to access, afford and complete their post-secondary education and training.”Heyman spoke with students from North Island College on Tuesday, March 10, 2020, and celebrated the new grant, which will take effect in September 2020. Eligible students can receive up to $4,000 per year through the new program.The new, needs-based B.C. Access Grant will be available for those who need it most: low- and middle-income students. Students will receive the grant at the beginning of their studies, so they can pay for tuition, text books, lab and other supplies needed for their programs of study.For the first time, such funding will also be available for students who are studying in programs under two years, including certificate and diploma programs, as well as for students studying part time. The changes nearly double the number of students who will be eligible to receive support.“Students have been calling for this moment for almost two decades,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “The new grant will open doors to post-secondary education for thousands of British Columbians who were shut out for far too long. This is a game changer that will benefit students who need it the most, especially with their up-front costs like tuition and books. I am so proud that our government is investing in the next generation of students.”The B.C. Access Grant complements the Canada Student Grant for Full-time Students, ensuring B.C. students attending public post-secondary institutions receive up to $4,000 a year to help with the cost of programs leading to a certificate, diploma or degree.Government is investing $24 million in new funding over three years. This is in addition to approximately $37 million government is reinvesting from existing grant programs that don’t help students with the up-front costs of their post-secondary education. More than 40,000 low- and middle-income students will be eligible for the new B.C. Access Grant, which will be available starting in the fall 2020 semester. Improving access and reducing the cost of post-secondary education for students are shared priorities between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and are part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Ronna-Rae Leonard, MLA for Courtenay-Comox –“This is an exciting time for students, who will be able to study closer to home, thanks to our government’s investment with the needs-based up-front access grant. This grant will enable students at North Island College to study in in-demand fields, like the trades and health-care professions, and give them the opportunity to study closer to home. I’m so proud of our government’s work to make life more affordable and remove barriers to post-secondary education.”John Bowman, president, North Island College –“I want to thank Minister Heyman for taking the time to speak to our students today to share the news of the new B.C. Access Grant program. This grant will provide additional financial support for students throughout the North Island College region and supports our goal of increasing access to education across the North Island.”Quick Facts:
Students will automatically be assessed for their eligibility for the B.C. Access Grant when they apply for financial assistance from StudentAid BC.
Eligible students in programs that are under two years in length will receive up to $4,000 per year.
Eligible students in programs that are two years or longer will receive up to $1,000 per year.

Mitzi Dean, Parliamentary Secretary for Gender Equity, has issued the following statement welcoming the introduction of a bill in federal parliament to ban conversion therapy:“On behalf of the Province of British Columbia, I applaud the federal government for responding to our August 2019 call for action to ban conversion therapy.“We fully support these amendments to the Criminal Code. Introducing criminal penalties for advertising or taking money for conversion therapy makes it clear that attempting to change someone’s gender or sexual identity is harmful and wrong and will not be tolerated in Canada.“I am especially pleased that this bill includes specific provisions to protect LGBTQ2S+ children. Children and youth are at the highest risk of being forced into conversion therapy – and they often experience lifelong trauma as a result.“This bill is an important step toward making Canada a better place for LGBTQ2S+ people. It sends the message that people of all sexual orientations and gender identities have a right to live their lives in peace and safety, without interference.“I acknowledge the work undertaken by B.C.’s attorney general, minister of Health and the MLA for Vancouver-West End to urge the federal government to amend the Criminal Code and make conversion therapy a crime.“These discredited and discriminatory practices have been allowed to continue in Canada for far too long. Our government hopes this bill passes swiftly into law.”

The Province is making affordable, quality child care more accessible for families in Smithers by investing in 42 new spaces.  “We are working in partnership with the school district to bring child care to the grounds of Walnut Park Elementary,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “These new spaces are a win for everyone. They will save parents time by having one central drop-off and pickup location for their kids and give kids quality early learning and a smoother transition from child care into their first years of school.”Through the Childcare BC New Spaces Fund, the Bulkley Valley School District (School District 54) is creating a new child care centre as part of the Walnut Park Elementary school redesign. Currently under construction, the centre will accommodate 42 children, ages three to five. “I’m proud to see our government investing in the young families that are the future of our community,” said Doug Donaldson, MLA for Stikine. ""These new child care spaces will make it easier for parents to pursue career opportunities here in the North, while helping to set children up for success.”The school district will be working with Coast Mountain College to support early childhood educator training to help create new opportunities for recruitment and retention. The new school, along with the child care centre, is expected to be open for the 2021-22 school year.“School District 54 looks forward to this opportunity to develop an active partnership with child care providers for enhancing both the transitions from preschool to kindergarten, as well as before- and after-school care options for school-aged children,” said Michael McDiarmid, superintendent of School District 54. “The district anticipates that this investment will create enriched learning environments for both preschool and school-aged children.”This investment means that 95 new licensed child care spaces have been funded in Smithers since July 2018. This is part of the fastest provincewide creation of child care spaces in B.C.’s history, with support for more than 13,000.An additional 4,100 spaces, funded through the 2017 Budget Update and the Early Learning and Child Care agreement with the Government of Canada, takes the total to more than 17,000 spaces since July 2017.Since launching in February 2018, the Childcare BC plan has helped parents in the Smithers area save more than $965,000 through the Affordable Child Care Benefit and Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative.Recent changes made by the Ministry of Education to the School Act will make it even easier for school boards to create and operate before- and after-school care. The changes will also require school boards to create an inclusive child care policy and prioritize space that is not being used for K-12 students for child care.Investing in child care and early childhood education is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:
To date, the Province has invested more than $19 million to provide more than 11,500 early childhood educators with a $1-per-hour wage enhancement, with another $1-per-hour lift to come in April 2020.

A key step in implementing the Fuel Price Transparency Act (FPTA) has been taken, bringing the legislation into force and giving the BC Utilities Commission (BCUC) the power to make special requests for information from oil and gas companies.“This step gives the BCUC the power to collect information to hold oil and gas companies accountable,” said Bruce Ralston, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources. “British Columbians are tired of feeling gouged at the pump. It’s time to pull back the curtain on fuel pricing.”Effective immediately, the BCUC has been named as the administrator of the FPTA. The FPTA will require companies to submit regular information to the BCUC about the fuel market in British Columbia. It also gives the BCUC power to make special requests for information outside of the regular reporting schedule. Information that could be collected includes refined fuel imports and exports, and fuel volumes at refineries and terminals, as well as wholesale and retail prices.The FPTA was developed in response to the BCUC investigation that found a lack of competition and substantial markups in the province’s gasoline market, including a 10- to 13-cent-per-litre premium being charged to drivers that industry was unable to explain during the BCUC inquiry. This unexplained premium results in British Columbians paying an extra $490 million every year.The FPTA will make companies publicly accountable for unexplained markups and price increases, and produce a common set of facts to help government properly evaluate other policy measures to bring fairness at the pump.Government will now engage with the BCUC on further steps in the implementation of the FPTA, with work underway to determine the type and frequency of the information to be collected on a regular reporting schedule through regulation.Learn More:Learn more about the FPTA: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2019JTT0048-002219

The B.C. government is committed to continually improving western trade corridors and supporting commercial truck drivers, as well as making investments in infrastructure that will help importers and exporters get goods to market, quickly and efficiently.In addition, as part of the government’s CleanBC plan, the ministry is committed to reducing carbon pollution created by the transportation sector as a necessary step towards creating a cleaner, better future. Recently, the B.C. government and the BC Trucking Association unveiled a new heavy-duty vehicle efficiency program that will help lower greenhouse gas emissions and will help commercial truck drivers spend less money on fuel.A snapshot of B.C.’s trade sector:
In 2019, B.C.'s transportation network allowed for $144.32 billion in exports and imports to be transported through B.C.: 
$71.5 billion worth of goods by ship;  
$41.75 billion worth of goods by road; 
$11.92 billion by rail;
$8.41 billion by air; and
$10.74 billion by other modes.

Government continues to work closely with other provinces, the Government of Canada, the Port of Vancouver and Prince Rupert, CN, CP and other industry partners to take advantage of B.C.’s strategic location at the crossroads of the North American marketplace and the economies of Asia.
Government and industry leaders are working together to analyze the future needs of the labour force and ensure all current and future workers have the skills to take advantage of the growing opportunities in the transportation sector.
In response to increasing container traffic at B.C. ports, the B.C. government has partnered with Canada, the ports, local governments and the private sector on projects that support economic activity. For example:
Government continues to move forward with a $260-million roadway upgrade in Delta. Through a partnership with Government of B.C., Government of Canada, Vancouver Fraser Port Authority and Tsawwassen First Nations, the Highway 91/17 and Deltaport Way Upgrade Project is a combination of improvements to boost safety and efficiency along the Highway 91 Connector and Deltaport Way.
The B.C. government is partnering on a major project with the Government of Canada and the Township of Langley to invest a further $235.5 million to widen Highway 1 another 10 kilometers between 216th and 264th streets. The project will add a new HOV lane in each direction, reconfiguring the 232nd Street interchange and adding a new underpass at Glover Road and the CP Rail crossing.
Keeping people and goods moving: 
The Port of Vancouver volume was 144 million tonnes of cargo in 2019 - a 2% decrease from 2018. Container volume was 3.398 million TEUs - a 0.1% increase from 2018.
The Port of Prince Rupert volume was 29.84 million tonnes - a 12% increase from 2018. Container volume was 1.210 million TEUs - a 17% increase from 2018.
Cargo volumes are forecast to continue to grow over the next 10 to 20 years as Canada’s commodity exports and container traffic are expected to significantly increase.
The Province is delivering relief for Lower Mainland container truck drivers by expediting tougher enforcement and taking steps to improve the rate structure.
In 2019, Vancouver International Airport (YVR) carried over 26.4 million passengers — a 1.7% increase over 2018, reaching its 25 million passenger milestone two years ahead of forecast.
In 2019, YVR moved 310,000 tonnes of cargo — down 8% from 2018.

The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure is working to upgrade Trans-Canada Highway 1 from Kamloops to the Alberta border.Upgrading the highway to a modern, 100 km/h, four-lane standard will allow traffic to move more safely and efficiently.In Budget 2020, $1.044 billion was committed to this project over the next three years. Most four-laning projects are cost-shared with the federal government, through the Provincial-Territorial Infrastructure Component - National and Regional Projects fund.One four-laning project is ongoing:
Illecillewaet: 42 kilometres east of Revelstoke – two kilometres of Highway 1 widening and an expanded and improved brake check with more parking, increased lighting, and acceleration and deceleration lanes. 
The Kicking Horse Canyon Phase 4 project is in the RFP stage, and work will get underway on that project east of Goden in summer 2020.The following construction projects are expected to be tendered in the coming month, with work beginning in summer 2020:
Chase Creek Road to Chase West: 3.4 kilometres of Highway 1 widening, a new interchange and upgrades to other highway intersections and frontage roads.
Salmon Arm West: 1st Ave SW to 10th Ave SW: 2.2 kilometres of Highway 1 widening and replacement of the Salmon River Bridge in Salmon Arm.
Several projects are also in various stages of design and consultation.These and future four-laning projects will use a Community Benefits Agreement, which will ensure all workers receive competitive, equal, transparent wages and benefits, enabling greater employment and training opportunities for people traditionally underrepresented in the trades, including women, Indigenous peoples, apprentices and people with disabilities. This will help diversify and mobilize the skilled trades now and in the future.Highway improvements between Kamloops and Alberta are expensive, due to the challenging terrain over most of the corridor. The ministry has prioritized projects to improve sections that have higher-than-average crash histories, high-traffic volumes and bridges that need replacing.

B.C. students and families are going to see more green, efficient and safe learning spaces as school districts receive record annual maintenance funding of $217.7 million this year.“Tackling climate change is critically important for all of us, and our school system can play a part in helping cut carbon pollution,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “That’s why we’ve significantly increased maintenance funding to help districts better maintain schools, improve energy efficiency and work to provide the best possible learning environments for students.”This year’s funding is $32.3-million higher than it was in 2016-17. It includes an additional $12.2 million from CleanBC that will give school districts more resources through the Carbon Neutral Capital Program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide operating cost savings from energy efficiencies. This can include adding solar panels, high efficiency boilers and LED lighting upgrades to schools, as well as installing electric vehicle charging stations.  CleanBC is government’s plan to reduce carbon pollution and build a cleaner economy for people throughout B.C., through approximately $1.3 billion in provincial funding over four years. “All youth deserve a brighter future and that’s what CleanBC is about,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “We’re working with school districts throughout the province to create healthier learning environments for students and modelling a more secure future through energy efficient buildings and transportation options.”To further support green energy initiatives, school districts will now have the option to purchase electric school buses through the Bus Acquisition Program. This new initiative helps school districts switch to zero-emission, clean-energy vehicles.“B.C. is leading the country in transitioning to electric vehicles, and our government is supporting that movement wherever we can,” said Bruce Ralston, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources. “Helping school districts invest in electric buses contributes not only to a cleaner environment, but also a healthier space for students.”The 2020-21 Bus Acquisition Program provides $13 million for 31 school districts to buy 101 new buses, including up to 15 electric buses. Districts that buy electric buses will also have access to provincial funding for charging station infrastructure.Along with the new CleanBC funding, the Carbon Neutral Capital Program is providing $17.2 million to school districts for 67 energy efficient projects this year, such as a new solar-power system at Edgehill Elementary in Powell River that will help reduce emissions and provide future cost savings.The School Enhancement Program supports school districts to upgrade roofing, fire systems, washrooms (including conversion to gender-neutral washrooms), windows and more. This year’s funding is $64 million, which includes gender-neutral washroom upgrades at 10 schools in the Coast Mountain School District.Through the Building Envelope Program, districts are receiving a combined $8 million to remediate schools that have suffered water damage.In addition to these programs, the $115.5-million Annual Facility Grant will allow all school districts to undertake additional maintenance projects that promote the continued safe and efficient operation of schools. Many of the projects will benefit school districts by saving money on electricity, natural gas, fuel and ongoing maintenance. Those savings can be reinvested in classrooms to support student learning.Education funding is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quote:Paul Faoro, president, CUPE BC – “On behalf of the more than 30,000 CUPE members who work to make our public schools safe, welcoming and inclusive for all students, I welcome this record level of investment from the provincial government, and we applaud the decision that savings that flow from improved energy efficiency can be directed to classrooms to support student learning.”For a backgrounder detailing approved investments in each school district, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/School_Funding_Programs_2020-21.pdf

Communities throughout B.C. are increasing their efforts to address the overdose crisis with more than $900,000 in grants awarded to municipalities for local community wellness, safety and harm-reduction projects.Twenty-four municipalities and their community partners have received up to $50,000 in funding for initiatives that build on community wellness, safety and harm-reduction efforts related to the overdose crisis and saving lives. The opportunity was first announced by Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, at the Union of BC Municipalities convention in September 2019.“Everyone deserves to live in a healthy and safe community,” Darcy said. “We know that when people come together to identify challenges and solutions, we can create vibrant communities that put residents’ wellness first.”Funded projects include:
a business engagement and ambassador project in Abbotsford;
a needle recovery program in Vancouver;
youth harm reduction and wellness efforts in Port Alberni;
a drop-in harm reduction and meal program in Houston; and
an employment program in Penticton and Kelowna.
Additional projects aim to reduce stigma, while engaging and empowering people with lived and living experience of substance use.The one-time grants are supported by the Community Crisis Innovation Fund through the Ministry of Health and will be administered by the Community Action Initiative.This funding is part of a comprehensive investment of $746 million since Budget Update 2017 (through to 2023) aimed at harm reduction, prevention, enforcement, treatment and recovery initiatives.Escalating B.C.’s response to the overdose crisis is a pillar of government’s actions, as outlined in A Pathway to Hope — B.C.’s roadmap for making the system of mental health and addictions care better for people. Implementing A Pathway to Hope is a shared priority with the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Henry Braun, mayor of Abbotsford —  “Abbotsford has spent the past years building on efforts to address the specific needs of vulnerable people at the local level. A community wellness hub was launched through collaboration with various social and health organizations that serve our community, one of the many positive steps towards supporting broad-based community wellness. We are pleased that the Province is continuing to support municipalities and program development at the local level to support health and wellness in our communities.”Linda Brown, mayor of Merritt —“It is critically important to build communities that care, where everyone has value and we look out for each other, regardless of personal circumstance. In our focus on infrastructure and economic development, we must not lose sight of people. I would like to thank the Province for its funding, which will allow us to provide supports for those people in our community who struggle with mental health and substance use.”Sharie Minions, mayor of Port Alberni —“We are incredibly proud to be one of 24 communities selected for this grant. The City of Port Alberni works closely with the community action team to provide supports and resources dedicated to community-based harm-reduction services. Through grants like this, we are demonstrating how powerful collaboration between provincial and local governments, local service providers, persons with lived experience, and citizens of the Alberni Valley can make a difference in the lives of those seeking a pathway to treatment and recovery.”Learn More:For a complete list of funded programs, visit:

People living in Castlegar will soon have better access to team-based urgent and primary care with the opening of a new urgent and primary care centre (UPCC).“Castlegar has about 2,000 people who do not have a regular primary care provider. This needs to change,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development and MLA for Kootenay West, on behalf of Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “That is why, through the Province’s primary care strategy, we are announcing a UPCC in Castlegar to provide residents better access to same-day appointments and regular care. This centre will implement a team-based approach to ensure patients get the comprehensive care they need, when they need it.”Dix said, “We are listening to people in B.C. and that is why we developed a primary care strategy. Through this strategy, we are announcing a UPCC in Castlegar to provide residents access with the comprehensive, team-based care they need. With this new centre, we are helping thousands of people who do not have a family doctor get attached to one and for others to have more access to same-day appointments and regular care.”The Castlegar UPCC will be operated by Interior Health and be located at the Castlegar and District Community Health Centre. Expected to open at the end March 2020, the centre will support both regular, ongoing health care for people who do not have a primary care provider and urgently needed primary care services for residents. It will be open 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., seven days a week, 365 days a year.The urgent and primary care centre team in Castlegar will include general practitioners, registered nurses, social workers, physiotherapists and medical office assistants. The team will provide comprehensive primary care services, including on evenings and weekends. To further support the primary care needs of patients, the hours for laboratory and X-ray services will be extended.Quotes:Dr. Doug Cochrane, board chair, Interior Health –“The urgent and primary care centre planned for Castlegar will have a positive impact on all those living in the community and surrounding area who are looking for local, same-day access to health-care services. The team, which includes social workers and physiotherapists alongside the physicians and nurses who also support the Castlegar Health Centre’s emergency department, will mean people will have better support for their immediate and long-term health-care needs.” Dr. Kathleen Ross, president, Doctors of BC –“We look forward to the opening of the new urgent and primary care centre to provide Castlegar residents with more timely access to health-care services, while supporting those important long-term relationships and continuity of care that result in better health outcomes for patients.” Dr. Dave Larocque, Kootenay Boundary Division of Family Practice member and Castlegar chief of medical staff –“The Castlegar Medical Association is pleased to have partnered with Interior Health and the Ministry of Health to establish the Castlegar Urgent and Primary Care Centre. We believe the centre will enhance services to the community by providing access to a team of caregivers that will include social workers, physiotherapists and nurses alongside physicians from the community. With longer hours of service, and lab and X-ray services located just steps away, we are looking forward to being able to provide a wide range of therapies with a team-based approach that will ultimately provide improved access and broader care to the citizens of Castlegar.”Quick Facts:

Even more B.C. parents will have access to child care as the Province marks the latest milestone in its popular Childcare BC plan with funding for more than 13,000 new spaces since July 2018.“Our government has embarked on the biggest child care space creation program in B.C.’s history,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “In just over 18 months, we have, on average, funded almost 700 new spaces per month because families have been waiting too long for access to licensed child care. We’ve been overwhelmed by the positive response from providers, large and small, wanting to work with us to support families as part of our Childcare BC plan.”Katrina Chen, Minister of State for Child Care, announced the new spaces at the celebration for the latest achievement in Burnaby. The majority of Burnaby’s 682 newly approved spaces are the result of a partnership between the Burnaby School District and the City of Burnaby.“These new spaces are being created through the collective strengths of our partners,” said Chen. “The City of Burnaby and the Burnaby School District have been among the first to step up and work with the Province to deliver hundreds of spaces at a time. It’s this kind of critical mass we want to see more of for all communities, and recent proposed changes to the School Act are designed to make it easier for school boards to operate before- and after-school spaces.”Changes to the School Act will also allow school boards to prioritize available space and create programs based on the unique needs of their community, as well as require them to create an inclusive child care policy.“Safe, affordable, licensed care gives parents and guardians the peace of mind they need to go to work or school – knowing they have quality care they can rely on close to home,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “Our government is paving the way to ensure more child care is offered on school grounds, giving Burnaby families more supports and services.”The Burnaby School District is partnering with the Province and the City of Burnaby to create 601 new spaces at eight different locations on school district property, with six located on elementary school properties. Operators will provide inclusive environments for children, including serving those with extra-support needs, as well as vulnerable populations, Indigenous communities and families who are new to Canada.“There is no better investment a government can make than investing in our children,” said Stace Dayment, a Burnaby parent. “This is a historic and positive change. I am excited for the families of our community to finally have this essential service.”In addition, Doxa Education Group is creating 81 new spaces in Burnaby.The new spaces are part of the fastest provincewide creation of child care spaces in B.C.’s history. An additional 4,100 spaces, funded through the 2017 Budget Update and the Early Learning and Child Care agreement with the Government of Canada, bring the total to more than 17,000 spaces since July 2017.Since launching in February 2018, the Childcare BC plan has helped parents save up to $1,600 a month per child, for a total of more than $400 million going to families through the Affordable Child Care Benefit and Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative. Through these programs, almost 29,000 children have received child care for no more than $10 a day.“Expanding access to public child care and early childhood education spaces has been foundational to this minority government,” said Sonia Furstenau, MLA for Cowichan Valley. “Aligning early childhood care and learning with our existing schools, in particular, has been a wonderful way to further invest in our public education system and create healthier communities.”Investing in child care and early childhood education is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.QuotesMike Hurley, mayor, City of Burnaby –  “High-quality, affordable child care helps families choose to live and work in Burnaby. That helps our business community maintain and attract the workforce they need to keep our economy strong.”Gary Wong, chair, Burnaby Board of Education –“The spaces we’re announcing today represent a significant increase at a district level. Burnaby families need everyone in the community to pull together to help, and that’s what’s happening through partnerships with the provincial government, the City of Burnaby and our school district. We’ve been a leader for more than 35 years in enabling space in our schools and on our properties for service providers to offer high quality child care.”Christine Hui, director, Doxa Education Group –“We are grateful for the funding from the Childcare BC New Spaces Fund. This will allow us to better serve the children and the families of Burnaby. We have a vision to create a high-quality child care centre where it will be more than just a place parents drop off their children, but a place where children grow and develop a strong sense of self, love, collaboration and creativity. This funding will contribute significantly to actualize our vision.”Janet Routledge, MLA for Burnaby North –“Parents have been struggling for too long to find affordable child care, and the shortage of spaces has had a real impact on our community. Many people are faced with travelling long distances to find care, adding to their daily commute. These new spaces will help bring child care closer to home and make life easier for families.”Anne Kang, MLA for Burnaby-Deer Lake –“New child care spaces will make it easier for parents to return to work or school, knowing their children have safe, quality care. With these investments, we are making life better for families and strengthening our local economy.”Raj Chouhan, MLA for Burnaby-Edmonds – “These new child care spaces will make a big difference for many families in the community. Creating new child care spaces is just one more way we are making life more affordable for families.”Quick Facts:
In January 2020, the Province launched a new professional development program, which is giving early childhood educators (ECEs) access to more than 30 teaching specialists at community hubs throughout B.C., helping them stay up to date on the latest child care teaching trends and techniques.
The Province has made significant investments to improve supports to B.C.’s early care and learning professionals, including investing approximately $16 million to provide more than 5,400 bursaries for students pursuing a career in child care.

The Province is providing almost $9 million to help 89 local governments and First Nations throughout British Columbia prepare so their homes, businesses and communities are better protected against the threat of wildfires.“Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities are on the front lines of wildfire prevention, and we removed barriers so our Community Resiliency Investment program met their needs,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “We fund up to 100% of local projects and projects that include Crown land because we know wildfires don’t distinguish between municipal, on-reserve and provincial Crown land.”Ravi Kahlon, Parliamentary Secretary for Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development, announced the third round of 89 Community Resiliency Investment grants during a visit to recipients in the Interior. (The recipients and their projects are listed in a backgrounder.)“The people who call these communities home know all too well the dangers from wildfires,” said Kahlon. “Our government is committed to supporting local governments and First Nations because it’s their on-the-ground efforts and local knowledge that are crucial to protecting the economic, recreational and environmental lifeblood of their communities.”Among the recipients is the Penticton Indian Band, which will use $150,000 to reduce buildup of flammable material like wood debris, branches and undergrowth from high risk areas near homes and crucial infrastructure. The Penticton Indian Band has been a recognized FireSmart community since 2016.“Caring for our lands, including the health of our forests, is an inherent right and responsibility we as Syilx Okanagan People take seriously and are working with many levels of government ministries through agreements like this,” said Chief Chad Eneas of the Penticton Indian Band. “Fuel management supports us to protect the cultural and heritage value of our forests, as well as ensure they can contribute to a sustainable economy for many generations.”Kahlon met with the Regional District of Okanagan-Similkameen, which received $140,000 to update an Official Community Plan to incorporate FireSmart principles for keeping homes, neighbourhoods and communities safe. Funding will also be spent on a FireSmart educator, for public outreach and education.Kahlon’s two-day visit will take him to Osoyoos, Summerland and Merritt to meet with representatives from multiple communities from the Kamloops and Southeast fire centres.The B.C. government has committed $60 million to the Community Resiliency Investment program to help local governments and First Nations reduce the risk of wildfire through the promotion and use of FireSmart principles. The program, launched in September 2018, replaces the Strategic Wildfire Prevention Initiative.The number of Community Resiliency Investment program grants allocated provincewide to date is now 209, amounting to more than $18.6 million.Mitigating wildfire threats is a shared responsibility of the provincial government, local governments, First Nations, industry, stakeholders and individual British Columbians. The Community Resiliency Investment program helps increase community resiliency by funding activities that promote FireSmart education, planning and opportunities for partnerships through regional FireSmart committees. A key component of the program is that it lets communities apply for funding to cover up to 100% of a wildfire risk reduction project.The Union of British Columbia Municipalities (UBCM) administers the Community Resiliency Investment program’s FireSmart Community Funding and Supports category and processes grant applications in partnership with the ministry and the First Nations’ Emergency Services Society of B.C. Eligible applicants facing a lower wildfire risk can apply for up to $25,000, while applicants facing a demonstrated higher wildfire risk can apply for up to $150,000.Quote:Karla Kozakevich, chair, Regional District of Okanagan-Similkameen –“Reducing wildfire risks and increasing our community’s resiliency to wildfire impacts are ongoing challenges.

Her life unravelled bit by bit. She had been sexually assaulted by the very person whose life she tried to share. He stole from her and tried to drain her bank account. She felt manipulated, threatened and afraid. It took her a long time to find the courage to ask for help. She let her employer know that she needed support. But in response her employer demanded that she show up at work happy. For her, it was impossible. She was let go after more than three years on the job.Today is International Women’s Day. Thousands of B.C. women will start their day happy, cared for by their families and full of ambition. So many others will face oppression, discrimination, poverty and violence.Every week in our province, there are an estimated 1,000 physical or sexual assaults against women. For Indigenous women and girls, gender-diverse people and those with disabilities, the incidents of violence are even greater. These women are our neighbours, friends, people we see in the grocery store and faces in a crowd.This week, I was so proud to be in the B.C. legislature, alongside the Minister of Labour, Harry Bains, to introduce changes to the Employment Standards Act that provide paid leave for people who have faced domestic or sexual violence. This means that someone facing this type of violence knows they can have the space and time to go to medical appointments, counselling and make the necessary changes to ensure they and their children are safe. For many, losing even a day’s wages traps them in an unsafe relationship and puts their safety in jeopardy.We all recognize the painful challenge for people who are trying to keep working when their life has been shattered. Often, their lives will never be the same. Thousands of businesses, communities, advocacy groups and individual British Columbians have come forward with their support for paid leave.But together, we can provide the supports for people to rebuild their lives when they need it the most. If it’s possible to help one person move forward, then we have made a difference.

Jeremy and Amanda knew that physical activity was important, but they did not know joining an urban soccer league in downtown Vancouver would be so rewarding.They are only two of the many active players in the Vancouver Street Soccer League (VSSL), a community sport program run largely in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside to support individuals who face barriers to participating in conventional organized athletics.“VSSL is a really important thing to have in a community where people are stuggling with at-risk behaviours, or they can’t afford to join a sport or they just don’t feel welcome,” said Jeremy. “The league accepts everyone who wants to join. I’ve made so many good friends through the league, it really feels like a family. I’m always telling other people they should come out and give it a try.”VSSL began 10 years ago as a mental-health program in the Downtown Eastside and has expanded considerably since then. It has partnered with several community organizations, including the Portland Hotel Society, the Carnegie Community Centre, Covenant House, the Aboriginal Friendship Centre, WorkBC and others.Over the years, approximately 325 youth from Covenant House have participated in the VSSL program, as well as hundreds of adults from at-risk groups, homeless shelters, Indigenous and immigrant/refugee communities. VSSL conducts special practice sessions for female and LGBTQ2S+ players in a secure and welcoming setting.“We have a wide variety of people from many different backgrounds participating in this league. We have come to understand just how important the VSSL community is to these players,” said Sarah White, VSSL’s president. “We practise every Thursday morning and every Sunday morning, without fail – we pride ourselves on our commitment to always be there for our players.”The social and cultural benefits of VSSL extend beyond athletics. The league invites players into a family of peers who are also trying to change their lives for the better, which can be a powerful force to inspire success.Players support and encourage each other, and espouse VSSL’s guiding principles of fair play, community building, supportive partnerships, and health and safety. League volunteers provide informal mentoring to players, including advice and support in pursuit of employment opportunities and further education.“Since joining VSSL, I’ve seen a big improvement to my fitness, my mental health and just my overall feeling about myself,” said Amanda. “That’s what sport can do for you – you get a solid foundation to build a better lifestyle for yourself.”White said, “Many of our players are First Nations, and we also have volunteers and supporters from First Nations. VSSL is regularly invited to the Father’s Day weekend soccer tournament hosted by the ‘Namgis First Nation each June at Alert Bay. Each year, it has proven to be profound and life changing for many of our league’s members. The village parade and traditional longhouse ceremonies that kick off the tournament resonate deeply with many of our players, particularly those who rarely leave the Downtown Eastside neighbourhood.“We have a growing number of recent immigrant and refugee players from every corner of the world. Soccer is the common language. With support from our sponsors, we are very excited to expand the league’s programming to increase access to as many people as possible.”This spring, the Province provided a $5,000 grant to VSSL to expand its programming to support a women's/LGBTQ2S+ team. The program is supported through the BC Sport Participation Program (BCSPP), funded equally by the governments of Canada and British Columbia, which includes sport programs, activities, and coach and leadership training in communities throughout B.C.  The BCSPP also funds the Urban Native Youth Association in Downtown Eastside Vancouver with $50,000 annually for its youth sport and recreation programs. Activities range from ju-jitsu and canoeing to lacrosse and wrestling, and are provided to about 700 youth annually. Youth are also offered training in the National Coaching Certificate Program, first aid, the High Five quality standard for children's programs, belay and canoeing.Learn More:Vancouver Street Soccer League: https://vancouverstreetsoccer.comBC Sport Participation Program: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2019TAC0102-001733

Premier John Horgan and Mitzi Dean, Parliamentary Secretary for Gender Equity, have issued the following statement celebrating International Women’s Day on March 8, 2020:“On International Women’s Day, we honour and celebrate the many women, girls, non-binary and two-spirit people in B.C. who are changing our province for the better. From well-known public figures to young activists, to those working quietly behind the scenes, they are standing up for equality. We stand with them.“No one deserves to be held back by their gender, their ethnicity or other parts of their identity.“From day one, our government has taken steps to address discrimination. These include major investments in affordable child care, which will create more opportunities for women to join the workforce or advance their careers. This addresses one of the major factors in the gender pay gap. We’re also creating bursaries and increasing wages for early childhood education workers, most of whom are women.“We are supporting women and other marginalized groups who face family-law issues, domestic and sexual violence, and poverty by improving access to legal aid and dispute resolution services. When passed, a new law giving survivors of sexual and domestic violence paid leave from work will give women the time they need to access justice and leave their abusers behind. And, as we move forward with the first major investments in transition homes for women and children leaving violence, more women and their children will have a safe place to go when they need one.“To bring down barriers for women in trades, we’ve created the Community Benefits Agreement for major projects that prioritizes hiring and training women, Indigenous peoples and others who traditionally have been shut out of these jobs.“While we have taken meaningful strides in British Columbia, there is still much more to do to achieve gender equity. Working alongside community partners, we aim to build a brighter future, where no one is left behind because of who they are.”For a Traditional Chinese translation, visit:  http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/20200308_PJH_PS-Dean_STM_IWD_TraditionalChinese.pdfFor a French translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/20200308_PJH_PS%20Dean_STM_IWD_V6_FR.pdfFor a Punjabi translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Statement_on_IWD.pdf

The kids of 4-H British Columbia will put on aprons and get into the kitchen this summer to participate in a new challenge to get creative with B.C. ingredients.“The province’s agriculture industry produces so many fantastic, great tasting local ingredients that the options are endless for 4-H to choose from,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “Our government is committed to investing in the next generations of B.C. farmers, and I can’t wait to see what the participants cook up!”Popham announced $50,000 for the Field to Fork Challenge while visiting 200 youth, parents and volunteers at the 4-H To the Extreme event in Abbotsford.“The Field to Fork Challenge is a new competition designed as a unique learning opportunity for 4-H members to express their passion and further their knowledge of B.C. agriculture. I am very excited to see what these youth will create,” said Aleda Welch, manager, 4-H BC. “4-H BC is grateful to the BC Investment Agriculture Foundation and the Ministry of Agriculture for their commitment and support. Together we work to advance positive youth development in B.C. by providing the skills and tools necessary for youth to become responsible, caring and contributing youth leaders in their communities.”Beginning June 1, 2020, 4-H members will create and submit videos of themselves preparing a recipe highlighting a B.C. ingredient, such as produce, meat, dairy, grain or honey. The video will include information about how the ingredient was farmed, raised or processed and how it can be used in culinary creations.Winners from two categories, junior and senior, will be awarded cash prizes. Winners from the senior category will also go to Vancouver to attend the Field to Fork Challenge Weekend, along with some special guest participants from the Agriculture in the Classroom Take a Bite of BC program. The trip includes four days of touring farms, meetings chefs, participating in a cooking challenge and spending a day at the Every Chef Needs a Farmer, Every Farmer Needs a Chef 2020 event, giving them an opportunity to interact with leading chefs and farmers from around the province.Ministry of Agriculture youth development staff guide 4-H club members in farming by providing expertise and hands-on experience in organizational management, agriculture and community leadership education. The ministry also works closely with registered 4-H volunteers who dedicate their time to mentor and inspire young British Columbians.Quick Facts:
The 4-H To the Extreme event is a regional one-day event in the Fraser Valley.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) response in British Columbia:""We are announcing six new cases of COVID-19, for a total of 27 cases in British Columbia. The individuals are in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser Health regions, and were confirmed positive based on testing by the BC Centre for Disease Control.“Case 22 is a man is his 50s, who recently returned from travel in Iran. Case 25 is a woman in her 50s and a close household contact of case 22. Both individuals reside in the Fraser Health region.“Cases 23 and 24 were passengers on the Grand Princess cruise ship from Feb. 11 to 21. They are a man and woman, both in their 60s, and are receiving care in hospital in the Fraser Health region.“Cases 26 and 27 are residents of a long-term care facility, the Lynn Valley Care Centre in North Vancouver. These cases were identified as part of an outbreak assessment at the facility in response to a staff member testing positive for COVID-19. The staff member is Case 21, a woman in her 50s, who has no recent travel history.“All residents of this facility have now been screened and Vancouver Coastal teams are on site to support the families and continue to investigate in detail. Public health teams have notified facility staff and residents, and are meeting with their families.“Case 13, a woman in her 80s, continues to receive care at Vancouver General Hospital. She is now in stable condition. All precautions have been taken to ensure the safety of other patients and health-care workers, while providing her with the care she needs. “All other individuals with COVID-19 are stable and in isolation at home with support and monitoring from public health teams. So far, four of B.C.’s 21 individuals who tested positive for COVID-19 have fully recovered.“There has been a notable transmission of COVID-19 at events, such as religious gatherings. As a result, we recommend social distancing and forgoing usual greetings. As an alternative, we recommend considering virtual online gatherings.“Cruise ships continue to be a high-risk environment for transmission. As result, we recommend reconsidering any cruise-ship travel at this time.“We continue widespread testing by screening British Columbians and travellers with symptoms, along with their close contacts, to identify cases of COVID-19 and take immediate action as we have seen today. As of March 6, 2020, 2,803 samples have been tested.“The British Columbia Pandemic Provincial Co-ordination Plan details the preparations and comprehensive toolkit to respond to the evolving outbreak.

To protect people in B.C. against novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and mitigate the impact of this illness on communities, the B.C. government and the provincial health officer have developed the British Columbia Pandemic Provincial Co-ordination Plan to respond to the evolving outbreak.  Premier John Horgan has appointed a deputy ministers' committee to oversee a whole-of-government approach to implementing the plan, reporting directly to a new cabinet committee that he and Health Minister Adrian Dix will co-chair.“From the first day the world learned of this outbreak, B.C.’s public health officials have delivered the most robust response of any jurisdiction in this hemisphere. Through this co-ordination plan, we will ensure they have the support they need so we are prepared for all possibilities,” Premier Horgan said.B.C.’s COVID-19 pandemic response plans include a wide range of planning and preparedness actions to help individuals, local governments, health-sector organizations and businesses to plan for the possibility of a pandemic. The plan focuses on delaying, containing and preparing the province to minimize serious illness and economic disruption.“The COVID-19 situation continues to evolve here in B.C., Canada and other countries in the world. We are at a critical point in the fight against the virus and we will ensure B.C.’s health system and population are ready for any scenario,” Dix said. Phase 1 of the plan is underway, addressing identification and containment -- continuing strong public health testing and close collaboration with the federal government on border surveillance, to identify and isolate individuals who test positive for the virus and their close contacts. The priority is to delay the onset of widespread community transmission for as long as possible.Phase 2 would escalate cross-government co-ordination to quickly direct actions and resources, as required. It also prepares for the use of emergency powers set out in the Emergency Program Act and Public Health Act. It would ensure provincial business and service continuity – with four priorities:

Protecting Population
Protecting Vulnerable Citizens
Protecting Health Workers
Supporting Health-care Capacity

Protecting Population actions would include increasing testing capacity and expanding communication with at-risk groups. It would also enact government continuity plans to prepare for the possibility of high absence rates due to illness, or if employees are absent in order to care for family. It would also provide supports for businesses and institutions to manage the same challenges through a sustained three- to four-month outbreak; including grocery stores, public transportation, schools and the tourism sector.
Protecting Vulnerable Citizens actions would include ways to protect seniors in long-term care, assisted living and home and community care, which could include reducing the number of people coming into facilities, screening visitors and increasing testing for illness of residents and health-care workers.
Protecting Health Workers actions would include implementing standardized preparedness plans at the local level to support health-care workers to respond to a wider outbreak and provincially manage and co-ordinate supply chains for hospital, community and primary care. It would also bring in additional health-care capacity for specific communities under stress by establishing a list of health-care workers who could be rapidly redeployed for a sustained period. 
Supporting Health-Care Capacity actions would use established emergency operation committees across health authorities to assess the ability to plan and respond at a local level to a community-wide outbreak and create capacity, as needed, in hospitals for:

discharging low-risk patients;
deferring scheduled surgeries and procedures;
identifying capacity for new care spaces within hospitals; and
ensuring bed equipment capacity.
It would also ensure readiness to implement hospital-wide protocols to safely triage and separate anyone presenting with respiratory illness. “The COVID-19 pandemic response plans and materials are developed in partnership with our experts at the BC Centre for Disease Control, based on our provincial influenza pandemic plans that all health authorities had implemented in 2012, as well as the lessons we had learned from H1N1 and SARS in the past,” said Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer. “Thanks to the great efforts made by our public health leaders and health-care workers, we have kept the risk of COVID-19 spread low in B.C., but it is important for people, communities and organizations to build resiliency and have plans in place, not just for the possibility of a pandemic but emergency in general.”Of British Columbia’s 21 confirmed COVID-19 cases, four B.C. patients have now fully recovered. With the exception of one patient who is in the intensive care unit at Vancouver General Hospital, all other individuals with COVID-19 are in isolation at home with support and monitoring from public health teams.As of Friday, March 6, 2020, the BC Centre for Disease control has tested 2,803 samples for 2,008 people.Learn More:For the COVID-19 pandemic preparedness and planning materials, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/about-bc-s-health-care-system/office-of-the-provincial-health-officer/current-health-topics/pandemic-influenza.For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community, visit: http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19For more information and latest updates on COVID-19, follow the BC Centre for Disease Control on Twitter @CDCofBC or visit the website: http://www.bccdc.ca/

Feedback will help guide the development of a potential regulatory framework for money services businesses in the province.Money services businesses are separate from traditional financial institutions, like banks and credit unions. These businesses provide a range of financial services to British Columbians, such as foreign-exchange dealing and money transfers.Although all money services businesses must be registered with the Financial Transactions and Reporting Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), there is no current provincial regulatory framework for money services businesses in British Columbia, which puts them at risk of being used to launder dirty money.Submissions to the money services businesses consultation will be accepted until 4 p.m. (Pacific time) on Friday, April 30, 2020.

The B.C. Procurement Strategy Update 2020 outlines work the Province has been doing – in collaboration with businesses and communities, as well as Indigenous peoples – to modernize its procurement system. Key highlights in the update include:
advancing the Indigenous Procurement Initiative by completing a provincewide consultation and releasing the “Report on What We Heard,” which reflects feedback from more than 300 Indigenous partners and businesses;
launching the Procurement Concierge, a collaborative way for vendors to engage with government and suggest innovative solutions to government’s business challenges;
starting user testing on the new BC Bid system, which will modernize and streamline how companies access and respond to government procurement opportunities;
issuing 86 contracts to dozens of small- to medium-sized tech companies through the new Sprint With Us and Code With Us programs; and
introducing other priority initiatives underway to improve procurement processes in the social services and agricultural sectors, such as Feed BC.
The Province launched B.C.’s first-ever procurement strategy in June 2018 to take full advantage of its buying power to drive economic growth, create well-paying jobs and harness made-in-B.C. innovation.The plan is guided by four main goals:
To realize best value and increased benefit to British Columbians.
To make it easier to do business with government.
To create more opportunity for businesses of all sizes.
To build greater capacity for procurement in the B.C. Public Service.

The interim report from Phase 2 of the BC Hydro Review has been released, focusing on leveraging B.C.’s clean hydroelectricity to meet the Province’s climate goals, support economic development and make life more affordable.The report describes the scope, context and work to date for Phase 2 of the review. It presents a number of ideas for discussion, including:
optional rate designs to encourage the shift from fossil fuels to electricity in vehicles, homes and businesses and achieve the emission reduction targets in CleanBC;
measures to expand the electrification of B.C.’s growing economy and attract new, clean businesses to B.C., creating jobs and opportunities;
changes to give BC Hydro more flexibility to meet future demand for clean electricity at the least cost to keep rates affordable;
a 100% clean electricity standard, which would be the first provincial standard of its kind in Canada; and
key issues and themes related to enhancing Indigenous Nations’ participation in the energy sector and furthering reconciliation.
The Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources will now gather further feedback from stakeholders, customer groups and Indigenous Nations and organizations based on the interim report. This feedback will support the development of recommendations for a final report to be completed later in 2020.Phase 2 of the review will position BC Hydro for long-term success and support the development of its Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) to be filed with the B.C. Utilities Commission in early 2021. The IRP outlines how BC Hydro plans to safely provide reliable, affordable, clean electricity to meet customers’ needs now and into the future.Phase 1 of the review was completed in February 2019. It resulted in immediate actions to contain BC Hydro’s costs, keep rates affordable and expand independent oversight by the B.C. Utilities Commission. BC Hydro’s five-year rates forecast is now approximately 55% lower than the 13.7% cumulative increase for the same period under the previous government’s 10-year rates plan, and more than 40% lower than the 10.7% forecast rate of B.C. inflation over the same period.CleanBC is a pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. CleanBC was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s emission targets.Learn More:To view the interim report on Phase 2 of the BC Hydro review, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/electricity-alternative-energy/electricity/bc-hydro-review-phase-2

The Province is making affordable, quality child care more accessible for families in the Capital Regional District (CRD) by investing in 462 new spaces, including seven projects with local school districts. “Adding child care to school grounds is a win for everyone – it gives kids a smoother transition into elementary school and offers convenience for parents,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “This partnership with the local school districts is bringing hundreds of spaces to families across the city. With proposed changes to the School Act, making it easier for school districts to deliver child care, we hope to see even more of these partnerships in the future.”Partnerships with both the Greater Victoria (SD 61) and Saanich (SD63) school districts will bring more than 300 child care spaces to elementary schools across the region. These spaces will be operated by local non-profit societies, with programming to be inclusive and teach children about local Indigenous cultures.“The news of increased before- and after-school child care for Cordova Bay Elementary couldn't come at a better time,” said Heidi Low, president, Cordova Bay Elementary Parent Advisory Council. “As our school and community populations increase, we are thrilled to be able to offer more child care spaces for our families.”Recent changes to the School Act will make it easier for school boards to create and operate before- and after-school care. The changes will also require school boards to create an inclusive child care policy, and prioritize space that is not being used for K-12 students for child care.“We know families want safe and convenient after-hours school care and we are committed to supporting them with programs on school grounds that are already designed to help grow young minds,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “Our record, $2.8-billion school capital budget is allowing us to continue adding new child care spaces at neighbourhood learning centres as part of our plan to build, expand and replace schools in every corner of B.C.”Four other projects in the Victoria region will create an additional 150 spaces for families. The City of Colwood is partnering with West Shore Parks and Recreation Society to create 40 school-age spaces, while the Esquimalt Nation is building a new 36 space child care centre. Saanich Neighbourhood Place is adding 49 spaces to its child care facility and Christ Church Cathedral Education Society is opening a new junior kindergarten with 25 spaces for children, ages 3 to 5.The investment means that since the New Spaces Fund launched in July 2018, almost 1,400 new, affordable licensed child care spaces in the CRD have been funded as part of the fastest creation of child care spaces in B.C.’s history.Since launching in February 2018, the Childcare BC plan has helped parents in the Capital Regional District save nearly $30 million through the Affordable Child Care Benefit and Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative.Investing in child care and early childhood education is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Tim Dunford, board chair, Saanich Board of Education –“The Saanich Board of Education is proud to partner with the Province to provide families with much-needed child care space expansion. We understand how important accessibility to child care is for families and that additional space is needed in our community. The board of education is excited for this opportunity to collaborate with the Province and our valued child care operators to better support students and families by expanding accessible child care spaces on our school sites.”Mitzi Dean, MLA for Esquimalt-Metchosin –“For too long, families in Greater Victoria haven’t been able to access quality, affordable child care. By partnering with school districts, our government is making it easier for families to access child care exactly where they need it – before and after school in the same facility. By working together, we are making it more convenient and efficient to access these important services.”Carole James, MLA for Victoria-Beacon Hill –“We are thrilled to be able to collaborate with school districts to create more child care spaces for families right here in Victoria and across the province. It is just one way we are making things more affordable for families.”Adam Olsen, MLA for Saanich North and the Islands –“The first years of a child’s life are a phase of incredible neural development, and every child deserves care that is nurturing, engaging, safe, fun and close to home. This work has been foundational to the minority government, and the BC Green caucus will continue to prioritize the creation of new public child care and early childhood spaces, as well as strive to better support the dedicated educators caring for our youngest citizens.”Lana Popham, MLA for Saanich South –“I’m so excited that families in Saanich South will soon benefit from 60 new child care spaces. There are many young families in this community that have told me that access to child care will make a big difference in their lives.”Quick Facts:
The Greater Victoria and Saanich school districts have been leading the way in creating school-based child care for local parents. Since July 2018, they have received funding for more than 800 new licensed child care spaces in the region.
Two child care centres in Victoria are also providing child care for no more than $10 a day, as part of the Childcare BC Universal Prototype Sites Program.
The municipalities of Central Saanich, Highlands, North Saanich, Saanich, Sidney and Oak Bay are sharing a $150,000 grant through the UBCM Community Child Care Planning Grant Program to help create a long-term child care plan to support families in the community. The City of Victoria also received $23,300 to develop a child care plan.
To date, the Province has invested more than $19 million to provide more than 11,500 early childhood educators with a $1-per-hour wage enhancement, with another $1-per-hour lift to come in April 2020. The Province has provided more than $1.4 million to early childhood educators in the CRD through the wage enhancement.

Michelle Mungall, Minister of Jobs, Economic Development and Competitiveness, has issued the following statement on the release of Statistics Canada’s Labour Force Survey for February 2020:“Since our government was elected more than two and a half years ago, B.C.’s labour market has been one of the strongest in the country. By putting B.C. workers into family-supporting jobs and providing the services that people count on, we’re building a strong, sustainable economy for the future.“British Columbia’s unemployment rate of 5% remains among the lowest of all provinces in Canada.“A good job makes all the difference. It means being able to build a better life for your family. In February, average hourly wages rose 30 cents to $29.13. Over the past year, hourly wages have increased by $2.12 (7.8%), leading the country in year-over-year wage growth.“Higher wages combined with the 19,500 full-time jobs that have been created over the past year are further proof that our blueprint for building a prosperous B.C. is working.“On the heels of Budget 2020 — widely praised by all of Canada’s major financial institutions — and our government’s commitment to building a stable, people-focused economy, B.C. will continue to be the most desirable place to live and work in Canada.“B.C.’s resilient economy and workforce will also help us respond to global economic uncertainty, including the temporary impacts of novel coronavirus (COVID-19).”

First Nations people can look forward to significant changes in the justice system following a decision by the BC First Nations Justice Council (BCFNJC) and the Province to endorse and sign a new First Nations Justice Strategy.The BCFNJC’s action is supported by resolutions from the BC Assembly of First Nations, the Union of BC Indian Chiefs and the First Nations Summit.“It is an honour to be part of the first justice strategy for Indigenous peoples in British Columbia that is authored by Indigenous peoples themselves,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “That it took this long to happen is tragic. That it is finally happening should bring hope for a better future. I look forward to working with Indigenous peoples and leaders across the justice sector on this historic initiative.”The First Nations Justice Strategy sets a path for the partners involved in the strategy and the criminal justice system to work together to:
reduce the number of First Nations people who become involved with the criminal justice system;
improve the experience of those who do;
increase the number of First Nations people working within the justice system; and
support First Nations to restore their Indigenous justice systems and structures.
“The First Nations Justice Strategy provides direction for the transformation of a system that has been pulverizing our people for generations,” said Doug White, chair, BCFNJC. “We have sought partnership with the Government of B.C. to reshape the criminal justice system and to begin to build the path to true Indigenous justice systems that are rooted in Indigenous self-determination and authority.”Work will begin by engaging impacted government ministries on the development of a joint implementation plan, recognizing that many of the strategies will take further engagement and funding, along with the involvement of the federal government. The joint strategy is born out of a 2017 memorandum of understanding between the Government of B.C. and BCFNJC. It is based on engagement with First Nations leadership, ministries, non-profits and police services that work within the existing criminal justice system.“Under the strategy, BC Corrections will play a critical role in improving the experience of Indigenous people who become involved with the criminal justice system,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “So much of what’s happening in corrections is being led and shaped by Indigenous peoples. That’s what makes the joint strategy so promising: it’s First Nations led.”Strategy highlights include:
a two-path approach that transforms the existing criminal justice system and builds the path toward restoring First Nations laws and justice systems;
establishing a network of 15 regional First Nations Justice Centres around the province;
developing a systemic approach to implementing the Gladue decision;
establishing a presumption of diversion to divert First Nations people from the court system, wherever possible;
improving cultural competency in the justice system;
establishing roles for Elders and Knowledge Keepers within the justice system; and
increasing community justice programming in each First Nations community.
Over the coming months, Ministry of Attorney General staff and the BCFNJC will continue working together to develop plans to implement the strategy.Quotes:Don Tom, vice-president, BC Union of Indian Chiefs – “Indigenous women and girls are over policed and under protected. As reported by the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls report and Human Rights Watch, Indigenous women who are survivors of crime often don’t trust the police enough to report it and face criminalization when they do. When involved in the criminal justice system, Indigenous women and girls are more likely to plead guilty, receive longer sentences and less likely to have adequate legal representation. They serve longer sentences for most of their crimes, which are administrative in nature and poverty related, and Gladue requirements are rarely met. This strategy brings justice system attention and resources to creating better justice system outcomes for women and girls.”Regional Chief Terry Teegee, BC Assembly of First Nations –“This strategy creates the necessary space for recognition and implementation of Indigenous justice systems. First Nations will have the opportunity to restore and reclaim their legal systems and structures according to specific traditions, laws, knowledge, experiences and contexts. This will necessarily include the expansion of many community-based justice programs, which are vital to testing and advancing transformation of the justice system.”Lydia Hwistum, First Nations Summit Task Group –“Twenty-one years after the landmark Gladue court decision, Indigenous incarceration rates in B.C. have tripled to over 30%. This unjust reality amounts to an astonishing crisis in Canadian society arising from the failure of the criminal justice system to embrace clear direction from Parliament and the Supreme Court of Canada. Now, through the First Nations Justice Strategy, our shared commitment is to tackle this unjust intransigence and create systemic change in a comprehensive and integrated way across the criminal justice system to ensure fair and equitable treatment of Indigenous peoples.”Learn More:Read the 2020 First Nations Justice Strategy: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/First_Nations_Justice_Strategy_Feb_2020.pdf

New workers to the forestry sector will be able to train tuition-free for a range of forestry jobs in a 12-week course being piloted at three public post-secondary schools.“I was raised in a logging family and know first-hand the challenges this industry has faced over the decades. It is so important that we invest in the people and families that fuel communities across the province,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “These pilots are providing training opportunities and pathways for the next generation to thrive in the changing forestry industry.”The project will be led by the BC Forest Safety Council (BCFSC). On the Coast, the training materials will be integrated into existing programs at North Island College and  Vancouver Island University.“The forestry sector is facing slowdowns that were years in the making, but there remains a need in some areas for new workers,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “Ensuring students have the skills the forestry sector needs to grow supports economic development and provides good jobs for entry-level workers.”In addition to earning safety certificates, students will learn skills required for forestry jobs ranging from tending tree stands to mechanical harvesting. Small class sizes of six to eight students and interactive learning will allow students to gain knowledge and skills, including chainsaw operation and wildland firefighting.“Meeting the training needs of new workers ensures they’re not left behind as the forestry sector continues to adapt,” said Ravi Kahlon, Parliamentary Secretary for Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “Employers will also benefit when new employees come to the table job-ready with skills and improved safety awareness.”Approximately $500,000 for the project is from the Sector Labour Market Partnerships Program through the Canada-BC Labour Market Development Agreement.The funding is in addition to the $12 million the Province committed to retraining initiatives, as part of an overall commitment of $69 million to support impacted communities, workers and employers in the forestry sector.Quotes:Rob Moonen, CEO, BC Forest Safety Council —“The entry-level forestry worker training program provides students a basic understanding of general forestry occupational skills, legislation and regulation, and aligns with on-the-job worker competency assessments developed by BCFSC. That means future employers will be able to see what has already been covered in workers’ training, and what still needs to be taught on the job.”Jake Roos, Okanagan College instructor and owner, Loki Tree Service —“The strength of this program is that it combines the supportive learning environment of the college with local contractors and practical field experience. It recognizes that good, efficient forest work requires an early understanding of professionalism and safety. Students can expect to leave with knowledge about the fundamentals of modern forestry in B.C. and industry contacts with which to initiate their career.”Quick Facts:
Tuition-free programs are being offered by:
Coast Mountain College - Terrace
Selkirk College - Grand Forks
College of New Caledonia – Vanderhoof

Okanagan College delivered the program at its Revelstoke campus in 2019.
Students are advised to contact these post-secondary institutions directly for more details.

Volunteer and composite fire departments across B.C. have been approved to receive their share of $5 million in funding for equipment and training through the Province’s Community Emergency Preparedness Fund (CEPF).The funding is distributed through the Union of BC Municipalities.A total of 102 proposals have been approved so far for this newly established funding stream to help eligible applicants in local government and First Nations communities build resiliency with new or replacement equipment and firefighter training. Eligible fire departments include local governments, First Nations communities and society-run departments.“Volunteer and composite fire departments are vital public safety partners in B.C.’s local and First Nations communities,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “This funding for new equipment and training will support dedicated fire crews at more than 100 of these fire departments as they continue their work to keep communities safe.”This $5 million in funding is part of an additional $69.5 million investment in the CEPF with an expanded eligibility to include volunteer and composite fire departments in First Nations communities. This is part of an initiative by EMBC to increase resiliency across all communities in British Columbia and improve B.C.’s overall emergency management system.“It’s great to see so many communities take advantage of this funding,” said Jennifer Rice, Parliamentary Secretary for Emergency Preparedness. “It’s our hope that these funds will help build resiliency across B.C. by ensuring local governments and First Nations have the tools they need to be ready for all hazards.” Though the maximum amount of funding per applicant is $25,000, in many cases, regional districts submitted proposals involving many societies and fire departments. That means that in some cases, hundreds of thousands of dollars are going to regional districts to be further distributed.The Province announced this sixth stream of CEPF funding for volunteer and composite fire departments in May 2019. In addition, the Province created a seventh stream, with $1 million for Indigenous Cultural Safety and Cultural Humility Training.For a backgrounder, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/CEPF_$5M_FireDept_funding_backgrounder.pdf

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in British Columbia:""We are announcing eight new cases of COVID-19 for a total of 21 cases in British Columbia. The individuals are in the Vancouver Coastal and Fraser Health regions and were confirmed positive based on BC Centre for Disease Control testing.“Cases 14, 15, 16 and 17 are close contacts of case 10. They are a man in his 20s, a man in his 30s, a woman in her 50s and a woman in her 60s.“Cases 18 and 19 are a woman in her 50s and a man in his 60s who reside in a single household. They recently returned from Iran.“Case 20 is a woman in her 50s who frequently travels to Metro Vancouver from the Seattle, Wash. area. She is staying with family in the Fraser Health region.“Case 21 is a woman in her 50s  with no recent travel history who resides in the Fraser Health region. “Four B.C. patients have now fully recovered and one patient remains in critical condition in care at hospital.

Provincial health-care facilities are working hard to serve patients and residents more local food, supporting farmers, fishers, ranchers and processors, and connecting more people with food from B.C. communities.A new report shows that over 27% of the food served by health authorities in 2018-19 – the first year of Feed BC – was B.C. food, defined as a final product produced and/or processed within the geographic borders of the province.“When Minister of Agriculture Lana Popham first proposed the ambitious early goal of ensuring 30% of food offered in public health facilities is from B.C, I knew it was a challenge we could work to meet,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “I am proud to recognize health authorities that have led the way in increasing foods served in their facilities that are grown and processed in B.C. It’s a critical shift, and they have adapted and developed excellent strategies to showcase B.C. products while ensuring patients receive quality, nutritious, local food.”To encourage, inspire and support the shift to B.C. foods, the Ministry of Health partnered with the Ministry of Agriculture and all of B.C.’s health authorities to implement Feed BC in health-care facilities. The Ministry of Health directed health authorities to annually report their progress on tracking and sourcing more B.C. food, beginning in 2018-19.“The information is so important because it shows we’re making excellent progress toward achieving our Feed BC health-care target,” said Popham. “Serving B.C. food connects patients and residents to farmers, ranchers, fishers and food processors across the province, supports both the health and agriculture sectors, and contributes to provincial food security, helping build a more resilient and sustainable food sector in B.C.”Feed BC is a provincial government priority to increase the use of foods grown and processed in B.C. in government-supported facilities. Led by the Ministry of Agriculture, Feed BC builds capacity and support along the food service supply chain to bring more local foods to patients, residents, students and clients throughout the province.While procuring B.C. foods is a priority for health authorities, protecting the health and safety of vulnerable patients is paramount. All food products, including those produced and processed in B.C., must comply with the highest standards for food safety, nutrition, allergens and traceability.Feed BC has given health authorities clear direction and provided additional supports. Food budgets, however, have not changed. Containing costs, including food costs, is imperative for health authorities.Quick Facts:
In B.C., there are 168 health authority-owned and operated hospitals and residential care facilities. They are overseen by five regional health authorities and the Provincial Health Services Authority.
Health authorities found success in purchasing B.C. food through innovative solutions, such as introducing more local and seasonal fruit, vegetables and salads; offering a wider variety of locally baked goods and sandwich options, and when possible, making more items from scratch.

Regulatory changes introduced on March 5, 2020, by the provincial government will direct ICBC to offer a new insurance product for the taxi industry.

“We have been listening to the industry and to drivers, and we heard that offering a distance-based insurance product would help keep costs down for part-time drivers,” said Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “Our government will continue to look at ways to ensure fairness for the taxi and ride-hail industries.”These amendments will enable ICBC to offer a new, distance-based product to fleet and non-fleet taxis starting May 1, 2020. The insurance product will be based on the per-kilometre distance travelled, similar to ride-hailing vehicles.Taxi operators who are interested in this new product will be able to switch their insurance over starting May 1. Operators who wish to keep their current form of coverage will not be affected.

The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure is also talking with representatives from the taxi industry and other stakeholders to determine how to ensure funds collected from the 30-cent fee charged for each trip taken in a non-wheelchair-accessible ride-hailing vehicle will help support wheelchair-accessible vehicles on the road and other accessibility options.Learn More:

Drivers are advised that the intersection of Highway 97 at Juniper Road will be deactivated later this year.Travellers will be redirected, improving safety along this busy corridor in Quesnel.Following completion of the Quesnel Transportation Study, analysis determined the current configuration of this intersection, combined with the significant volumes of commercial traffic, contributes to a collision rate on Highway 97 that is higher than the provincial average.Once the intersection is deactivated this summer, access will be closed to all traffic at Highway 97 and Juniper Road and redirected to the adjacent Highway 97 intersections at Quesnel-Hydraulic Road and Larch Avenue.Once a definitive timeline is determined, signage and appropriate notice will be provided for people travelling through Quesnel. Juniper Road and the adjacent business accesses will not be affected by this intersection deactivation.The two-year Quesnel Transportation Study, which examined the corridor from the Highway 97/Barkerville Highway Junction to Basalt Road, was completed in 2018. Public input and consultation with community groups informed the study. The ministry will continue to use its findings to improve safety along the corridor.For more information on the study, including planned future improvements for the Highway 97 intersections at Racing Road and Quesnel-Hydraulic Road, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/quesneltransportationstudy

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in British Columbia:“We are announcing one new presumptive case of COVID-19 for a total of 13 cases in British Columbia. The individual resides in the Vancouver Coastal Health region and recently returned from travel to India and Hong Kong.“The individual is a woman in her 80s with no connection to any previously confirmed cases. She has other underlying medical conditions and is isolated in the intensive care unit at Vancouver General Hospital in critical condition.“All precautions have been taken to ensure the safety of other patients and health-care workers, while providing her with the care she needs.“A small number of close contacts have been identified and contacted by public health officials. They will be supported to self-isolate for 14 days and are being monitored for symptoms.“Four B.C. patients have now fully recovered. The remaining previously announced individuals with COVID-19 are in isolation at home with support and monitoring from public health teams.“While the risk of spread of COVID-19 within British Columbia remains low at this time, we continue widespread testing by screening British Columbians and travellers with symptoms, along with their close contacts, to identify cases of COVID-19 early.“Our public health officials continue to work closely with our federal partners to connect with all travellers arriving from Iran, to support them to self isolate for 14 days. This process was already in place for people arriving from Hubei, China.“We are also asking all other travellers who are returning to or visiting, B.C. from outside Canada to monitor themselves and their children closely for symptoms and if any arise, to limit their contact with others and call 811.

Depuis quelques années, des intervenants du milieu scolaire de partout au pays signalent une grave pénurie d’enseignants dans les écoles de la minorité francophone ainsi que dans les programmes d’immersion et de français langue seconde. Cette situation a des répercussions importantes sur les communautés en situation minoritaire et la promotion du bilinguisme.De passage à Victoria, l’honorable Mélanie Joly, ministre du Développement économique et des Langues officielles, a confirmé un soutien financier pour le recrutement et la rétention d’enseignants francophones en Colombie-Britannique. Une somme de plus de 2 millions de dollars sera accordée à la province pour soutenir l’éducation en français des jeunes. La ministre Joly était accompagnée de l’honorable Rob Fleming, ministre de l’Éducation de la Colombie-Britannique. Le gouvernement de la Colombie-Britannique, quant à lui, versera 300 000 dollars pour cette stratégie.Cet investissement aura une incidence significative sur le recrutement et la rétention des enseignants de français en Colombie-Britannique puisqu’il soutiendra des projets liés à l’enseignement dans la langue de la minorité ainsi que l’apprentissage de la langue seconde.La stratégie compte huit initiatives : l’amélioration du système de collecte de données pour les enseignants de français; la recherche sur les facteurs de l’offre et de la demande; l’amélioration des programmes de formation des enseignants; l’accélération du processus de certification des enseignants; le soutien aux nouveaux enseignants; le développement et le soutien des réseaux professionnels pour les enseignants de français; la formation en français des enseignants en service; et l’expansion des programmes de formation des enseignants. Toutes les initiatives s’appuient les unes sur les autres pour maximiser l’efficacité des efforts et des fonds afin de mieux répondre aux besoins des intervenants du secteur de l’éducation en français de la province.Citations""Au fil des générations, les francophones et francophiles de la Colombie-Britannique ont su garder leur langue et leur culture bien vivantes, notamment grâce au travail des enseignants francophones qui jouent un rôle essentiel auprès des jeunes. C’est d’ailleurs pourquoi nous investissons davantage pour inciter encore plus d’enseignants francophones à aller enseigner en Colombie-Britannique."" – L’honorable Mélanie Joly, ministre du Développement économique et des Langues officielles""Apprendre le français offre aux élèves des débouchés tout au long de leur vie. Cet investissement conjoint est une étape importante dans notre travail visant à donner à tous les élèves qui veulent apprendre le français en Colombie-Britannique, et qui le méritent, la possibilité de le faire."" – L’honorable Rob Fleming, ministre de l’Éducation de la Colombie-Britannique""Les francophones et les francophiles jouent un rôle important dans la riche histoire, la croissance économique et la diversité culturelle de notre province. Je suis fier du travail de nos gouvernements visant à augmenter le nombre d’enseignants francophones dans notre province, contribuant ainsi à continuer de reconnaître et de célébrer la communauté francophone dynamique de la Colombie-Britannique."" – L’honorable Adrian Dix, ministre de la Santé et ministre délégué aux Affaires francophones de la Colombie‑BritanniqueLes faits en bref
La communauté francophone de la Colombie-Britannique compte environ 64 200 personnes dont le français est la langue maternelle (environ 1,4 p. 100 de la population) et près de 315 000 francophiles et personnes qui parlent français. Parmi celles-ci, 59 p. 100 sont nées ailleurs au Canada et, parmi les francophones nés à l’étranger, 50 p. 100 viennent d’Europe.
Dans le cadre du Plan d’action pour les langues officielles 2018-2023 : Investir dans notre avenir, le gouvernement du Canada investit plus de 62 millions de dollars sur 4 ans pour appuyer le recrutement et le maintien en poste d’enseignants dans les écoles francophones en situation minoritaire, ainsi que les programmes d’immersion et de français langue seconde.

718,2020-03-04 14:00:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020AG0018-000372,Government Website,"Legislation introduced to transform ICBC, deliver lower rates","

Legislation has been introduced to transform ICBC, deliver lower auto-insurance rates and dramatically improve care benefits, making ICBC more accountable to British Columbians.“British Columbians deserve peace of mind that if they are injured in a crash, they’ll be looked after, instead of being fought for years in court,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “They deserve low and stable car insurance rates. This bill will achieve both goals, saving people an average of 20% on their insurance and taking care of people if they are injured. It is long overdue.”If amendments to the Insurance Vehicle Act are passed, this new way of doing auto insurance in B.C. will lower premiums on average by 20%, saving drivers about $400, starting in May 2021. ICBC’s proposed Enhanced Care coverage will also significantly increase the amount of care and recovery benefits available to anyone injured in a crash, providing enough care for a lifetime for those who need it, to a maximum of at least $7.5 million, up from $300,000 today.Wage loss payments will be 60% higher than today, to a maximum of up to $1,200 per week or 90% of net wage loss for those earning up to $93,400 annually. The most seriously injured will get even more care and recovery benefits, including a new permanent impairment benefit that will provide financial compensation of up to $250,000.Other proposed changes to the Insurance Vehicle Act formalize ICBC’s ability to offer injured people pre-litigation payments. By putting this process in legislation, an injured person who qualifies can have confidence that their ability to sue is preserved when they accept an up-front pre-litigation payment. Before this change was announced in January 2020, if a person decided to take ICBC’s settlement, they had to agree to not seek additional money through the courts. Pre-litigation payments can be offered to people injured in car crashes that occur prior to May 1, 2021, when ICBC’s Enhanced Care coverage would take effect.Amendments to the Insurance Corporation Act will eliminate the authority of any government to direct ICBC to make payments to government from its excess optional capital. Between 2009 and 2016, the previous government transferred $1.2 billion from ICBC’s excess optional capital to lower its own borrowing requirements.“ICBC should be accountable to British Columbians, and this bill, if passed, should give increased confidence that ICBC will be accountable to them by delivering lower rates and high-quality benefits in the event of a crash,” Eby said. “The changes in this bill won’t just benefit people injured in crashes next spring, they will benefit people injured now. The changes will also help us keep costs low for drivers until May 1, 2021, when drivers will enjoy some of the lowest rates in Canada.”Should the amendments be passed and receive royal assent, any government would be prohibited from accessing ICBC’s excess optional insurance capital as of the end of this fiscal, and the Enhanced Care coverage would apply to accidents on or after May 1, 2021.Quotes: Tanya Fawkes-Kirby, managing director, Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists, B.C. Branch – “It’s the goal of an occupational therapist to help clients to return to their daily activities as quickly as possible. But the reality is that it often takes a lengthy period of time to recover from an automobile accident. These changes will provide our clients with better recovery support, for as long as they need it so they can return, as much as possible, to their pre-crash activities.”Justina Loh, executive director, Disability Alliance BC –“If a person becomes catastrophically injured in a motor vehicle collision, we want to ensure that they will get the medical treatment and rehabilitative equipment they need. Even in situations where a person caused the collision, or was involved in a single-vehicle crash, we are encouraged that severely injured people will be able to access the increased care and benefits for their lifetime.”Learn More:For more information about changes to improve transparency and accountability at ICBC, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020AG0006-000165For more information about keeping ICBC surpluses within ICBC, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020AG0016-000358To see ICBC’s Enhanced Care coverage, visit: http://icbc.com/2021Government’s intended changes at ICBC can be seen here: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/download/000BAC79D98D4E14AAFCBBD582883BAD

To improve visitor experience, camping in Golden Ears Provincial Park will be 100% reservable during peak season, from May to September.The popularity of camping in BC Parks has grown significantly over the years. This has created a demand for more reservation opportunities, so everyone has fair and equal access to campsites regardless of where they live.Given its location in the Fraser Valley and proximity to Vancouver, Golden Ears is one of the busiest parks in the province, with approximately 132,000 campers in 2019 – a 20% increase since 2012. The park has 423 vehicle accessible sites, 20 walk-in sites, two group sites and 40 marine sites at Alouette Lake.Last year, 594 new campsites were added to 13 provincial parks and 12 recreation sites. Sixty-five of those sites were added to Golden Ears Park. In addition, the park now has a satellite connection that allows the public to see real-time inventory and vacancies, and make same-day reservations. Quick Facts:
Of the 10,700 campsites BC Parks manages throughout the province, 55% are reservable and 45% remain available on a first-come, first-served basis.
Ten campgrounds have 100% reservable sites during peak season – Rathtrevor Beach, Gordon Bay, Cultus Lake, Sasquatch, Alice Lake, Porteau Cove, Swiws, Bear Creek, Wells Gray and Okanagan Lake.
The campgrounds still permit first-come, first-served opportunities if campsites are available, which is often possible mid-week when the demand is lower.

Six new digital railway crossing signs are now live, helping reduce travel delays for drivers in the City of Langley, Township of Langley and Surrey.The Railway Crossing Information System (RCIS) will keep drivers informed with real-time train crossing information, allowing them to choose the quickest route.The RCIS operates by detecting trains approaching railway crossings, recording their presence, direction and speed. This information is sent to the central control system, which calculates the train direction and approximate arrival time at each crossing. Each sign displays the status of nearby railway crossings – open or closed – allowing drivers to make informed decisions to use nearby rail overpasses or local street networks. The signs also increase travel time efficiency and reliability for emergency responders.RCIS is the latest intelligent transportation system installed in the Lower Mainland to help reduce traffic congestion and lower greenhouse gas emissions, with fewer vehicles idling at blocked rail crossings. The signs complement the railway overpasses constructed in the Langley and Surrey area along the Roberts Bank rail corridor that were built to improve traffic flow, while enhancing trade with the Asia-Pacific region. The signs increase community liveability by mitigating the traffic impacts from increased goods movement along the Roberts Bank rail corridor, which has as many as 22 train crossings per day.The RCIS is a pilot project integrating train detection and intelligent transportation systems. It was developed specifically for the unique road and rail network in Surrey and Langley.The project is jointly funded by the Government of B.C., Transport Canada and the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority — each providing $300,000 — in addition to $2.9 million from TransLink, for a total project cost of $3.8 million. It is the final component in the $307-million Roberts Bank Rail Corridor Program completed in 2015.Learn More:For sign locations and to learn more about the RCIS, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation/transportation-infrastructure/projects/railway-crossing-information-system

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in British Columbia:“We are announcing three new cases of COVID-19 in B.C, for a total of 12 cases in British Columbia. All of these new cases reside in the Vancouver Coastal Health region and have recently returned from travel to Iran.“Case 10 is a man and in his 60s and case 11 is a woman. They have no connection to previous confirmed cases. Case 12 is a woman in her 30s and a close contact of the eighth case, previously reported on Feb. 29.“These new cases have been confirmed positive based on BC Centre for Disease Control testing. Four B.C. patients have now fully recovered, and the other individuals with COVID-19 are in isolation at home with support and monitoring from public health teams. “Vancouver Coastal Health continues to actively investigate these new cases. Close contacts are being identified and contacted by public health officials.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in British Columbia:“We are announcing one new case of COVID-19 in B.C., for a total of nine cases in British Columbia. The individual affected is a resident of the Fraser Health region, unrelated to any previously announced case. The patient is in isolation at home with support and monitoring from public health teams.“The patient has been confirmed positive based on BC Centre for Disease Control testing. The individual is male, in his 50s and recently returned to Canada from Iran.“Fraser Health is actively investigating; close contacts have been identified and contacted by public health officials.

We recommend cleaning your hands regularly, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow sleeve and disposing of tissues appropriately. To further contain transmission, we also recommend suspending usual greetings such as handshakes, hugs and kisses.“For you and your family, similar to how you may need to care for someone with influenza, you want to ensure you have sufficient food, medications and support in place to stay home for a number of days. These are normal preparations when someone in your family is ill – there is no requirement for British Columbians to stockpile supplies.“For employers, we recommend increasing cleaning and hand hygiene availability, in addition to thinking about how to manage absenteeism through steps such as remote working or virtual meetings.“Schools should be increasing cleaning and hand hygiene, educating students on respiratory etiquette, in addition to putting mechanisms in place to support students who may be away for extended periods.“Gathering large numbers of people together can increase the risk of transmission. Event organizers should ask all participants to stay away if they are sick, returning from affected areas or have underlying health conditions that may be impacted by respiratory illness. Organizers should also complete a risk assessment considering what is happening in the local community and who may attend the event. Local public health teams can assist with this assessment.“British Columbians with upcoming travel plans should continue to monitor the Government of Canada travel site for the latest travel advisories: www.travel.gc.ca/travelling/advisories“Travellers should understand that as global efforts to contain COVID-19 continue, the availability of health care services in some areas may be limited and travel restrictions may be put in place suddenly.“We are asking all travellers returning from Iran and China to self-isolate for 14 days upon their return home to Canada.

Up to five days of paid leave will be available for employees impacted by domestic or sexual violence, or parents of a child or dependent impacted by this kind of violence, thanks to new legislation.“People faced with domestic and sexual violence should not have to lose pay when dealing with the aftermath,” said Mitzi Dean, Parliamentary Secretary for Gender Equity. “The changes introduced today help support people so they can attend medical appointments and make the necessary changes to ensure they and their children are safe.”With up to five days of paid leave from work per year, employees will be able to attend to their needs, or the needs of their dependent children or adults, without the worry of losing income from missing work. Employees will have paid leave, allowing them to attend medical, counselling or other appointments, look for a new home or school for their children, and rebuild their lives.“Domestic and sexual violence are deeply traumatizing crimes,” said Tracy Porteous, executive director, Ending Violence Association of British Columbia. “Although the road ahead may be the most difficult one that survivors will encounter, it can make a huge difference having informed and respectful people and processes in place that provide those harmed by these crimes the time to begin to heal.“That’s where workplaces come in. In my 38 years working in this field, I have known too many survivors who have lost their jobs simply because they needed a few days away from work to deal with the aftermath of violence. Bravo to the Province for putting this support in place.” These amendments build on improvements made to the Employment Standards Act last year that provided up to 10 days of unpaid, job-protected leave from work for those impacted by domestic or sexual violence. If passed, the new amendments will mean five of these days will be paid days.“People facing domestic or sexual violence need far more supports to help them gain control of their lives than what was previously available in our province,” said Harry Bains, Minister of Labour. “We consulted broadly, we listened to what people said and we’re making another important step to add to existing supports that will make a real difference in a person’s life when they need it the most.”This legislation was shaped by feedback from 6,261 British Columbians, as well as input from stakeholder consultation sessions and written submissions from employers, business associations and employee organizations during fall 2019. The consultation found that most people, both employers and employees, as well as organizations, support some paid leave for people affected by domestic or sexual violence.“A person facing domestic or sexual violence needs and deserves any support their community can offer them,” said Ian Tostenson, president and CEO, BC Restaurant & Food Services Association. “Paid leave will make it easier, especially for people with children, to escape abusive situations. Our membership has expressed concern about affordability, but we all agree that we, as a part of our wider community, have a responsibility to help people escape abuse in any way we can.”Improving fairness in British Columbia's workplaces is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Learn More:The What We Heard report and more about the public consultation can be found here:

Students at Vedder Elementary will soon see their school grow along with them, thanks to a 10-classroom addition that will get students out of portables and into classrooms.“Chilliwack is one of the fastest growing communities in British Columbia, which means there is a huge demand for classroom seats,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “That’s why this investment – along with recent announcements of two new schools – is so important. We want students to thrive in dynamic, inclusive and safe learning spaces.”The Government of B.C. is investing $11.8 million for the 240-seat addition, allowing five in-use portables to be removed from the school. The construction, which will not require students to be displaced, includes a two-storey addition on the south side of the school and more parking.“This is great news for families in Chilliwack,” said Dan Coulter, chair, Chilliwack Board of Education. “Thanks to this government's commitment to investing in schools, our district will be able to get 240 kids out of portables.”The new addition is expected to be completed in time for the 2022-23 school year. “The Vedder Elementary Parent Advisory Council (PAC) is thrilled that the creation of more seats and the removal of portables was made a priority at our school, which is bursting at the seams,” said Melanie Reuter, Vedder Elementary’s PAC president.The Province is also providing $15.4 million for a new 600-seat secondary school at the former University of the Fraser Valley North campus and $48.6 million for South Side Elementary-Middle school, which will have capacity for 930 students.The Province has announced over $91 million for Chilliwack school expansion projects in the last two years, adding 1,770 new student seats, which should eliminate the need for up to 70 of the nearly 100 portables in the district.These investments are part of government’s plan to build new and expanded schools in fast-growing communities throughout B.C.Since September 2017, the Province has announced over $1.8 billion in school capital investments for 83 projects. Budget 2020 includes a $2.8-billion capital investment for new, expanded and seismically safe schools, the biggest capital budget in B.C.'s history.

The technical feasibility study of a potential high-capacity transit crossing from Vancouver across the Burrard Inlet to the North Shore has completed Phase 1.Six potential options have been shortlisted to be explored further in Phase 2.“We know that people living and working on the North Shore are frustrated with traffic congestion that has been increasing for years,” said Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “By investing in this study, our government is helping to take a serious look at solutions that expand our public transportation network to better connect communities and to help people move around freely. The results from this study will support the North Shore and surrounding communities with their long-term transportation planning.”The Province has partnered with local governments on the North Shore and in Vancouver on a feasibility study for a high-capacity transit crossing across Burrard Inlet. The first phase of the two-phase study, led by Mott MacDonald Canada, involved a brainstorm and preliminary screening of possible crossing points that could support a more transit-oriented North Shore with better connections to Vancouver and the rest of the region. It also considered the compatibility of a transit crossing with existing and future land use and the potential for affordable housing.This work resulted in six general routes that will be further explored in Phase 2 (type of crossing in parentheses):
downtown Vancouver to Lonsdale via First Narrows (tunnel crossing)
downtown Vancouver to Lonsdale via Brockton Point (tunnel crossing)
downtown Vancouver to West Vancouver via Lonsdale (tunnel crossing)
downtown Vancouver to Lonsdale via Second Narrows (new bridge crossing)
Burnaby to Lonsdale via Second Narrows (new bridge crossing)
Burnaby to Lonsdale via Second Narrows (existing bridge crossing)
Connecting Lonsdale City Centre with Vancouver’s metropolitan core and the regional rapid transit network is one of the recommendations put forward by the Integrated North Shore Transportation Planning Project (INSTPP), led by Bowinn Ma, MLA for North Vancouver-Lonsdale, in 2018. Work on the remaining recommendations of INSTPP continues through Next Step (NXSTPP), a working group that includes all levels of government on the North Shore that work in partnership to improve mobility both in and around the region. This study is one way that the Province and the City of Vancouver are helping support the NXSTPP working group.“I hear from community members every day about how transportation challenges on the North Shore impact their lives,” said Ma. “In addition to seeking convenient ways to get around, people are eager to embrace more socially, environmentally responsible modes of transportation. This technical feasibility study to find a rapid transit solution across the Burrard Inlet is an important step toward a third fixed-link crossing to the North Shore.”The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, the districts of North Vancouver and West Vancouver, and the cities of Vancouver and North Vancouver are contributing to fund the study. TransLink led the procurement process for this study. The results will be used to inform the development of Transport 2050, TransLink’s updated regional transportation strategy.Making investments to improve transit is part of the B.C. government’s CleanBC plan. Initiatives in the CleanBC plan aim to make transit a more-accessible and efficient option for all British Columbians – reducing congestion and carbon pollution. CleanBC was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus, and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s emission targets. A backgrounder, with what people are saying about the Burrard Inlet Rapid Transit Study, follows.

The Province is poised to introduce legislation that will prevent any B.C. government from directing ICBC to make payments to government from its excess optional insurance capital.This will ensure that any future surpluses remain with ICBC to be used for the benefit of drivers.“For many years, the old government treated ICBC like an ATM,” said David Eby, Attorney General. ""It raided ICBC’s profits to the tune of $1.2 billion – seriously eroding ICBC’s financial stability and leading to higher premiums. With these proposed changes, in those years when ICBC does make a profit, those funds will now stay within ICBC so they can be used to make auto insurance rates more affordable, and for other ICBC programs and services that benefit drivers.”  Government will propose changes to the Insurance Corporation Act to prevent any future provincial government from using ICBC’s excess optional insurance capital to lower its own borrowing requirements while eroding ICBC’s financial position, as was done in the past.Between 2009 and 2016, the previous government directed ICBC to make the following payments, totalling almost $1.2 billion, to the Province from ICBC’s excess optional capital:
$576 million: 2009-10
$101 million: 2010-11
$237 million: 2013-14
$139 million: 2014-15
$138 million: 2015-16
“This legislation to keep ICBC surpluses out of government coffers is another step our government is taking to restore ICBC to a sustainable financial position so that insurance rates can stay affordable,” Eby said. “Drivers can have confidence in knowing that their auto-insurance premiums are going toward benefiting drivers.”This proposed legislation will be introduced in the coming days. If passed, it will help ensure ICBC’s long-term financial stability. Upcoming legislation will also deliver the changes necessary to implement the new Enhanced Care coverage starting May 2021, so drivers can see their premiums decrease by 20% on average and have increased peace of mind knowing their medical and recovery benefits will take care of them for as long as they need, if they are injured in a crash.Learn More:More information about changes to improve transparency and accountability at ICBC:

Wet’suwet’en Hereditary Chief Woos, Scott Fraser, B.C.’s Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation, and Carolyn Bennett, federal Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations, have issued the following statement:“Over the past three days, we have had frank and substantive discussions, guided by Wiggus (respect), on issues around Wet’suwet’en rights and title.“These talks focused on two separate topics — the recognition of Wet’suwet’en rights and title throughout the Yintah (territory) and the issues arising out of the Coastal GasLink (CGL) project. The topics were discussed separately.“With respect to rights and title, the parties focused intensely on commitments to an expedited process to implement Wet’suwet’en rights and title. The result of these discussions was a draft arrangement that will be reviewed by the Wet’suwet’en clan members through Wet’suwet’en governance protocols for ratification.“If ratified, Minister Fraser and Minister Bennett have agreed to return to Wet’suwet’en territory to sign. If ratified, the parties agreed to implement title on an expedited basis, to co-ordinate how we work together.“This arrangement for the Wet’suwet’en will breathe life into the Delgamuukw-Gisday’wa decision so that future generations do not have to face conflicts like the one they face today. As the late chief Wah tah Kwets (Pat Namox) said in the Delgamuukw case, ‘It is up to us to create a new memory in the minds of our children.’“On the Coastal GasLink project, the parties engaged in direct discussions and explored means to come to a resolution. The Province agreed to provide further information on the project. All parties at the table recognize that the differences relating to the CGL project remain.”Debbie Pierre, executive director, Office of the Wet’suwet’en, also commented on the proposed rights and title arrangement:“This is a momentous moment. The Dini ze and Ts’ake’ze of our past left this world with no certainty and pain. Today our Dini ze and Ts’ake’ze have carried their words forward in principle. It is time now that all Wet’suwet’en unite to build success for all. I encourage all to look past the fear of success and embrace the change that our forefathers saw for us.”

People in Doig River First Nation will soon have better access to more nutritious food sources through a new grant for local food-security projects.Doig River First Nation is receiving $112,475 through Victoria Foundation’s Food Security - Provincial Initiatives fund. The funding will help create a community garden, community distribution centre and kitchen facility next to the community band office. The project is part of the Nation’s goal to increase members’ access to locally grown food and deliver programming that encourages learning, sharing of traditional and cultural knowledge and hands-on participation in food growing.“Thanks to the grant, Doig River First Nation will be able to build inclusive gardening infrastructure and partnerships that will promote local food production and act as a first step towards becoming a more food secure community,” said Chief Trevor Makadahay, Doig River First Nation. “Making a space where Elders and children can gather together will enhance the health and well-being of the community. Gardening spaces will provide the community with fresh produce, which will reduce the dependency on having to travel long distances to buy groceries.”The Province provided $3 million to the Victoria Foundation in March 2019. Of that, $1.9 million went to the Mustard Seed Food Bank to help buy its food distribution centre for southern Vancouver Island. The remaining $1.1 million helped establish the Food Security - Provincial Initiatives Fund. Six projects have received the grants available through this fund — Doig River First Nation being the sixth — for a total of $778,170.“I want to thank the Doig River First Nation for initiating this important project. Food security is a necessary part of reducing poverty and supporting strong communities,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “Projects like this and the other food-security projects announced late last year are working to bring people up and out of poverty in rural and remote areas of B.C.”TogetherBC, the province’s first poverty reduction strategy, was released in March 2019 as a cross-government plan to reduce poverty. The Victoria Foundation grant supports the Province’s work by helping organizations develop local food security programs that ensure reliable access to nutritious and affordable food for people. Food security is part of increasing inclusion, making life more affordable and supporting better opportunities and reconciliation in communities in B.C.“Food security starts at the ground level, through community-based knowledge and local food systems and economies,” said Sandra Richardson, chief executive officer, Victoria Foundation. “We are delighted to see these funds going to local organizations that understand their community’s needs and contribute to achieving food security through practical, ground-level solutions.”Addressing poverty is a shared commitment between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts

People living in East Vancouver now have better access to team-based urgent and primary care with the official opening of the new REACH Urgent and Primary Care Centre (UPCC). “The REACH UPCC will connect people in East Vancouver and the surrounding communities with the health care they need, when they need it,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “REACH has been supporting Vancouver residents for over 50 years. Through our partnership with community stakeholders, the UPCC will provide increased access to same day appointments for urgent needs and ongoing primary care to tens of thousands of area residents who lack a primary care provider.”REACH UPCC is a partnership between the REACH Community Health Centre, the Ministry of Health, Vancouver Coastal Health, Providence Health and the Vancouver Division of Family Practice. The new centre is the second UPCC to open in Vancouver. Fifteen UPCCs have been announced throughout B.C. under the government’s primary care strategy.More than 37,000 additional patients will benefit from the services at REACH UPCC each year. They will be seen by a team of health-care providers, including doctors, nurse practitioners, nurses, licensed practical nurses, social workers, a clinical pharmacist and office staff.“I know how hard it’s been for residents in East Vancouver to find a consistent primary care provider,” said Melanie Mark, MLA for Vancouver-Mount Pleasant. “This game-changing investment is a major win for constituents who often face long wait times at walk-in clinics. I’m proud that our government is taking action to connect patients with skilled health-care professionals that will ensure they have access to the comprehensive primary health care they need.”Shane Simpson, MLA for Vancouver-Hastings, said, “Comprehensive and patient-centred care is a much-needed service that connects patients with a network of health-care professionals, making sure their primary care needs are met. The REACH UPCC is an exciting step forward for the community of East Vancouver and will make a big difference in the lives of residents, including my family.”The centre serves two purposes. The first purpose is to provide care for people with non-life-threatening conditions who need to see a health-care provider within 12-24 hours but do not require an emergency department and do not have or cannot access their family practitioners.The second purpose is to help attach patients to a family doctor or a nurse practitioner through partnership with the Vancouver Division of Family Practice. To facilitate this, the UPCC will connect patients either to the REACH Community Health Centre (for those with complex health needs) or to local practices. For patients who do not have a family doctor or nurse practitioner, REACH UPCC will also engage in the necessary steps to best support their health-care needs.REACH UPCC is located in a renovated space in the REACH Community Health Centre at 1145 Commercial Dr. in East Vancouver.Quotes:Mary Ackenhusen, president and CEO, Vancouver Coastal Health —“Vancouver Coastal Health is pleased to be a key partner in enhancing access to care for more people. The new urgent and primary care centre, delivered with our partners at REACH Community Health Care, allows us to wrap health-care services around patients who need them within their own community, and provide ongoing care and support in a way that will result in better and more responsive care.”Dr. Kathleen Ross, president, Doctors of BC —“We look forward to the integration of the REACH UPCC in hopes it will strengthen primary care in the East Vancouver area and ensure people there have access to the health-care services they need, while also supporting a longitudinal relationship between patients and their family doctor.”Dr. Fiona Duncan, physician lead, Vancouver Division of Family Practice —“The Vancouver Division of Family Practice is excited to continue working to improve access to quality primary care for all patients. The UPCC serves patients who need access to care for urgent, non-life-threatening medical conditions and will play an important role in supporting family physicians to continue to provide high-quality primary care in the community.”Jacqollyne Keath, board chair, Nurses and Nurse Practitioners of BC —“Nurses and Nurse Practitioners of BC are pleased to see that the knowledge, skills and expertise of the entire health-care team will be utilized to improve access to health care for all British Columbians through urgent and primary care clinics. We believe that this approach will be pivotal in ensuring B.C. families can access health-care services, and we are excited to see the opening of another urgent and primary care clinic in B.C.""Nicole LeMire, executive director, REACH Community Health Centre —""REACH Community Health has been working to improve the health of area residents for 50 years and the new urgent and primary care centre will allow us to meet the health-care needs of even more people who live and work in this vibrant community.”Learn More:To learn more about the Province’s primary health-care strategy, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018PREM0034-001010To learn more about the Province’s strategy to increase the number of nurse practitioners, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018HLTH0034-000995To learn more about the Province’s strategy to recruit and retain more family medicine graduates, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018HLTH0052-001043

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in British Columbia:“We are announcing an eighth case of COVID-19 in B.C. The person affected is visiting from Tehran, Iran and arrived in British Columbia earlier this week. The patient is in isolation at home with support and monitoring from public health teams.“The individual has been confirmed positive based on BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) testing. The individual is female, in her 60s and is staying with family in the Vancouver Coastal Health region.“Vancouver Coastal Health is actively investigating. Close contacts have been identified and contacted by public health officials. Those who may be at risk are now in isolation for 14 days and are being actively monitored for symptoms.“We are pleased to report that three additional patients who previously tested positive for COVID-19 are now fully recovered, for a total of four fully recovered patients. The other individuals continue to recover in isolation at home and under the care of public health teams. The BCCDC has completed testing on 1,425 samples for 1012 individuals as of Feb. 27, 2020.“While the risk of spread of COVID-19 within British Columbia remains low at this time, we continue to focus efforts on containing and delaying the spread of transmission, as well as preparing for the possibility of a pandemic. A pandemic is the spread of an illness to a large number of people on a global scale.“We are asking all British Columbians to do their part to prevent the transmission of infections in our communities and in our health-care system to help protect everyone in B.C.“Similar to how you may need to care for someone with influenza, you want to ensure you have sufficient food, medications and support in place to stay home for a number for days.“Employers should increase cleaning and hand hygiene availability, in addition to thinking about how they will manage absenteeism through steps such as remote working or virtual meetings.“The most important measures people can take today is to proactively prevent the transmission of respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. This includes cleaning your hands regularly, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow sleeve and disposing of tissues appropriately. It is also very important to stay home and away from others if you or your family are sick.“British Columbians with upcoming travel plans should continue to monitor the Government of Canada travel site for the latest travel advisories: https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/travel-health-notices/210“Travellers should understand that as global efforts to contain COVID-19 continue, the availability of health-care services in some areas may be limited and travel restrictions may be put in place suddenly.“We ask all international travellers who are returning to B.C. to monitor themselves and their children closely for symptoms. If any symptoms arise, limit their contact with others and connect with their primary care provider, local public health office or call 811 to determine if COVID-19 testing is needed. This is an important way to reduce the possibility of transmission of illness to others.”Learn More:

Enhanced guides on starting and financing farm co-operatives in B.C. will help farmers build their businesses by providing information on how to pool resources and market their products collectively.The recently updated Agricultural Co-operatives Start-Up Guide outlines an easy five-step process to help farmers create a new local co-op, while the Financing Agricultural Co-operatives Guide provides funding options for co-op farms. Supports specific to agricultural co-operatives are unique, and the updated guides will help farmers throughout B.C. work together to build their businesses and develop new markets.“There are many leading examples of co-ops in British Columbia, and across Canada, but it can be hard for a group of producers to know how to go about creating one,” said Marie-Claude Bibeau, federal Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. “Our government is pleased to be teaming up with the Province to provide this guidance to producers, because the rewards of forming a co-op can be great. Co-ops continue to make important contributions to the sustainable development of our rural areas. They offer producers the advantages of large-scale business, while benefiting many individual producers.”Co-operative business models help groups of farmers by increasing their bargaining power, creating new market opportunities, lowering costs, decreasing business risks and taking advantage of economies of scale. Co-ops are often managed by members, and each member maintains their autonomy and independence, allowing farmers to support each other while also working toward a common business goal.Farmers operating small- or medium-sized farms benefit from a strengthened presence in the marketplace by working with other growers facing similar challenges and pursuing opportunities together. The co-op model helps producers of different sizes and in different locations enhance and grow economies in smaller B.C. communities.Originally produced in 1997, the updated guides include:
case studies to illustrate the types, benefits and impacts of agricultural co-ops;
guidelines for business operations;
financing practices; and
references to additional resources that will benefit farmers interested in starting their own co-operative business.
“We’re creating more opportunities for farmers to get into the field and bring additional farmland into production,” said Lana Popham, B.C.’s Minister of Agriculture. “With the updated guides, farmers can learn about the benefits of co-ops and how this model can help grow their businesses.”The guides are funded in part by Grow BC, a mandate commitment of the Ministry of Agriculture that supports new and existing farmers to develop their careers, expand local production and access affordable land. Additional funding to support the guides was provided by the governments of Canada and British Columbia through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership, a federal-provincial-territorial program to strengthen the agriculture, agri-food and agri-based product sector.Quotes:Andrea Harris, executive director, B.C. Co-op Association —“Co-ops have a long history of being part of B.C.’s agricultural sector. As a member services organization dedicated to supporting co-ops across the province, we’re pleased that resources such as the updated guides are available to support farmers interested in exploring co-operative solutions.”Chris Bodnar, manager, Close to Home Organics —“Co-operatives provide an alternative business structure that helps producers access services, resources and markets for their operations. It is a positive sign that B.C. is supporting a business model that helps to empower producers, reinvest profits in local communities and develop capacity within the sector.”Quick Facts:
In 2019, there were approximately 86 active agri-food co-ops in B.C.
An online survey of 34 B.C. agri-food co-ops conducted by Kwantlen Polytechnic University in 2019 noted that:
47% of respondents grow, process and/or market products produced by their members.
81% of respondents sell agri-food products and related farming supplies.
89% of respondents received $50,000 in net profits in 2018, approximately three co-ops received more than $100,000 and two received more than $5 million.

Forestry workers, contractors and First Nations in and around Clearwater, Vavenby and Adams Lake will benefit from the transfer of Canfor’s Vavenby forest tenures to Interfor.“Under the previous government, companies could trade tenure like they were hockey cards, and the people impacted were often the last to find out — even when it resulted in the loss of hundreds of jobs,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “Our government brought in changes so that the needs of Indigenous Nations, workers and communities would have to be considered before a transfer would be approved. The official Opposition voted against those changes. That says a lot about where their priorities lie, which isn’t with rural communities in B.C.”As a result of this transfer, Canfor has committed to create a $200,000 legacy fund with the District of Clearwater to be used at the district’s discretion. In addition, Canfor will provide $150,000 over five years to the United Way and will provide $500,000 in funding to the Wells Gray Community Forest.Effective Friday, Feb. 28, 2020, the approval is for the transfer of Tree Farm Licence (TFL) 18 and replaceable forest licence A18688, located in the Kamloops Timber Supply Area near Vavenby, from Canfor to Interfor. The two licences have a combined allowable annual cut (AAC) of approximately 349,000 cubic metres per year. This includes an AAC of approximately 164,500 cubic metres per year from TFL 18 and approximately 184,500 cubic metres per year from A18688.“I talked with community leaders when I was in Clearwater, and they were clear that this tenure transfer means people in their communities will continue to have jobs,” said Ravi Kahlon, Parliamentary Secretary of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “Transfer of these tenures provides a stable wood-fibre supply for the Adams Lake sawmill and Interfor’s Adams Lake division that will help those operations continue to provide jobs in the region for years to come.”The decision follows comprehensive engagement — including considerable response from the citizens of British Columbia, local governments and Indigenous Nations — to help the minister understand the extent of public interest in the transfer and to ensure it is not detrimental to the marketing of wood fibre in B.C.Further requirements include the need for Interfor to continue discussions with local secondary and value-added manufacturers in the North and South Thompson on log purchasing and wood-fibre supply agreements. Interfor must also work with displaced woodlands employees on further opportunities for employment.This is the second time Donaldson has approved a forest tenure transfer since Forest Act changes were passed in 2019. Last year, the minister approved a transfer between Hampton and Conifex that transferred tenure in the central Interior, with the requirement that Hampton would rebuild the sawmill in Fort St. James within three years.

A college or university education will be more affordable for thousands of students who are eligible for up to $4,000 per year through the new B.C. Access Grant program.“The new B.C. Access Grant will break down financial barriers and enable thousands more students to get a college or university education in their chosen fields,” said Premier John Horgan. “It’s part of our government’s work to build a strong economy for everyone, where people can get good, well-paying jobs that support them and their families, and business can access more skilled workers.”The new, needs-based B.C. Access Grant will target those who need it most: low- and middle-income students. Students will receive the grant at the beginning of their studies so they can pay for tuition, textbooks, lab supplies and other items needed for their program of study.For the first time, this funding will be available for students in programs under two years in length, including certificate and diploma programs, as well as for part-time students. The changes nearly double the number of students eligible for support.“Students have been calling for this moment for almost two decades,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “The new grant will open doors to post-secondary education for thousands of British Columbians who were shut out for far too long. This is a game changer that will benefit students who need it the most, especially with their up-front costs like tuition and books. I am so proud that our government is investing in the next generation of students.”The B.C. Access Grant complements the Canada Student Grant for Full-time Students, ensuring B.C. students attending public post-secondary institutions receive up to $4,000 a year to help with the cost of programs leading to a certificate, diploma or degree.Government is investing $24 million in new funding over three years. This is in addition to approximately $37 million that government is reinvesting from existing grant programs that do not help students with the up-front costs of their post-secondary education.More than 40,000 low- and middle-income students will be eligible for the new B.C. Access Grant, which will be available starting in the fall 2020 semester. Improving access and reducing the cost of post-secondary education for students are shared priorities between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and are part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:
This is the first new investment in post-secondary student grants in 15 years.
Students will automatically be assessed for their eligibility for the B.C. Access Grant when they apply for financial assistance from StudentAidBC.
Eligible students in programs that are under two years in length will receive up to $4,000 per year.
Eligible students in programs that are two years or longer will receive up to $1,000 per year.
These students may also be eligible for the Canada Student Grant for Full-time Students of up to $3,000 per year.

The funds may be used for tuition, living expenses or any eligible education-related costs students may have while working on their post-secondary education.

The Province is investing $1.7 million to help communities collect and analyze data on their housing needs so governments can deliver the right kind of homes for people in B.C.The data will inform housing needs reports, which will identify community housing needs, such as affordable housing, rental housing, seniors’ housing, as well as housing for people at risk of homelessness, families and people with special needs. The reports will also help local governments support local economic growth by assessing future employment-housing needs.“Housing needs reports are a way to gather important information as we partner with local governments to create the right housing for people in communities of all sizes around the province,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “The wave of enthusiasm and interest in applying for this grant tells us that local governments are eager to collect this information to help them build vibrant, thriving communities.”In 2018, the Province announced a $5 million investment over three years (2019-21) to help local governments collect and analyze data about their communities. The data is then combined with provincial data about household income and demographics to complete a housing needs report. The reports will help inform council decisions about development proposals and help determine what kind of housing is needed in neighbourhoods. Thirty-one applications were approved for this year’s funding allocation. The fund is administered by the Union of British Columbia Municipalities (UBCM).“This program is strengthening the data available on the housing supply in communities and its alignment with the current and projected needs of our residents,” said Maja Tait, mayor of Sooke and UBCM president. “Better data brings greater certainty about the types of homes that are most needed now and in coming years as demographics and populations change. I appreciate the provincial government’s continuing support to improve housing data in B.C.”Many of the successful applicants submitted proposals that include engagement with First Nations, neighbouring communities, housing providers and other stakeholders to gain a better understanding of the housing needs for their community.Since 2019, several local governments have completed their housing needs reports, including the District of Sooke, the Village of McBride, the Village of Harrison Hot Springs and the Town of Sidney, while many others are underway. Completed reports are presented to local councils and made available online to anyone seeking information on local housing needs.“The grant program enabled a detailed study that provides important data on demographics and the immediate and longer-term housing needs specific to our community,” said Cliff McNeil-Smith, mayor of Sidney. “As we now embark on a comprehensive Official Community Plan review, the report and its recommendations are a solid basis for developing targeted policies to address the ongoing housing challenges.”Delivering affordable housing is a shared commitment between government and the BC Green Party Caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Aaron Stone, board chair, Cowichan Valley Regional District –“Building on the establishment of our own affordable housing service, this grant will allow us to strengthen our community planning and our engagement with the development community. We appreciate this support to help ensure our investments are creating the right housing mix to serve our diverse and rapidly growing region.”Sean Bujtas, deputy mayor, Terrace –“The City of Terrace greatly appreciates the financial support to complete a housing-needs assessment. With the economic activity and the impacts of LNG and other resource projects in the northwest, housing pressure on residents in our community is significant. Funding for this assessment will allow us to move forward and address those challenges.”Quick Facts:
Under new requirements, local governments must produce their first housing needs report by April 2022 and every five years after that.
Housing needs reports are another tool to help the Province work with local governments and other partners to build 114,000 new affordable homes around B.C. by 2028.
In the first two intakes of the Housing Needs Reports Program, over $3 million in grants have been approved, supporting 101 municipalities and 18 regional districts with funding to help develop their Housing Needs Reports.

The miscellaneous statutes amendment act (Bill 13) was introduced in the legislative chamber on Feb. 27, 2020.If approved by the legislature, the amendments will affect the following provincial statutes:Adoption Act, Assessment Act, Building Act, Evidence Act, Land Title Act, Miscellaneous Statutes Amendment Act (No. 3) 2010, Motor Vehicle Act, New Relationship Trust Act, Trespass Act and Vital Statistics ActMinor amendments to these ten statutes would ensure the terms of the Nisga’a Treaty are referenced correctly and are consistent with the wording of the Treaty. Family Law Act, Family Maintenance Enforcement Act and Interjurisdictional Support Orders ActProposed amendments will lead to better assistance for British Columbia families by enabling family justice counsellors (Family Justice Services Division), search officers (Locate Services), and enforcement officers (Family Maintenance Enforcement Program) to obtain the information they need within the framework of the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.For example, amendments would clarify that parents who are receiving assistance from a family justice counsellor can share information, such as names and addresses, about other family members with the counsellor. Amendments also clarify that an enforcement officer with the Family Maintenance Enforcement Program may request the social insurance number of a debtor with significant arrears of child or spousal support to verify the debtor’s identity to enforce a support order. Guide Dog and Service Dog ActProposed changes would streamline certification processes and clarify the relationship between the act and B.C.’s Human Rights Code. Amendments will recognize the high standards of guide and service dog training schools accredited by the International Guide Dog Federation and Assistance Dogs International by deeming guide and service dog teams from those schools to be certified under the act.Requiring these teams to undergo the formal certification process is duplicative, time-consuming and unnecessary from a public safety standpoint. The requirement for trainers to get a separate certificate for a dog-in-training in addition to the trainer certificate will also be eliminated. The amendments will address a widespread misperception that certification is mandatory for guide and service dog teams to access public places and services. The act is not intended to take away from existing protections for persons with disabilities under the Human Rights Code.Labour Mobility ActProposed amendments will correct out-of-date references to the Agreement on Internal Trade, which was replaced with the Canadian Free Trade Agreement in July 2017. As a result of its reference to the Agreement on Internal Trade, some portions of the Labour Mobility Act ceased to have legal effect when the Canadian Free Trade Agreement was implemented.The proposed amendments will update the act with the necessary references to the Canadian Free Trade Agreement, restoring the act’s original effect retroactive to July 2017.Land Owner Transparency ActMinor technical amendments would clarify public search parameters, allow for the removal of out-of-date information from the public registry and provide for the collection of additional information from transparency declarations. The act was introduced in 2019 as a key tool to combat money laundering. Lobbyists Registration ActAmendments will correct a minor cross-referencing error. Pharmaceutical Services Act and E-Health ActProposed minor amendments will bring legislation in line with recent changes to the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, which were required to keep pace with current technology, such as cloud-based services.Supreme Court ActTo improve access to justice and reduce court delays, proposed amendments would allow the appointment of five more judges to the B.C. Supreme Court, for a total of 95 judges in addition to the chief justice and the associate chief justice. Water Sustainability Act The Water Sustainability Act governs the allocation and regulation of the diversion, use and storage of water from streams and groundwater in B.C. The amendments are intended to make administrative corrections and provide more authority for government to collect, use and disclose the personal information of water users to ensure authorization holders, applicants, emergency responders and the public have continued access to the information needed to manage water use in B.C.

Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, has granted approval to create a municipal police board for the City of Surrey — the next stage in the plan to transition from the RCMP to a municipal police department.Having considered the Provincial Municipal Policing Transition Study Committee’s report, as well as the recommendation of the director of police services, in line with section 3 of the Police Act, the minister is confident that the key aspects of the transition plan that required more detail have been thoroughly considered.Chaired by Wally Oppal, the Provincial Municipal Policing Transition Study Committee included representatives from the City of Surrey, the ministry and independent consultants with specialized expertise. The committee was established in August 2019 to ensure the City of Surrey’s transition plan addressed all key issues, and its work has now concluded.The Surrey police board, once established, will be responsible for creating and governing the Surrey police department. Responsibilities will include:
being the employer of the police and civilian employees;
providing financial oversight for the police department;
establishing policies and direction for the police department; and
managing service and policy complaints against the department.
To support the transition process, the Policing Model Transition Secretariat (established in spring 2019) and the director of police services will continue to provide oversight, leadership and support for the Province and the City of Surrey. This will ensure provincial accountabilities, public safety and police oversight are maintained throughout.All parties involved acknowledge the complex scale of a transition this size and are committed to co-operation and collaboration with Public Safety Canada and the RCMP.A timeline for the transition will be determined by key partners as this work progresses.In 2018, the City of Surrey initiated termination of its agreement with the RCMP and the transition to a municipal police force, in accordance with its powers under the Police Act.Learn More:For a factsheet on the transition process, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/factsheets/surrey-police-transition-processFor a Punjabi translation, visit:  https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Punjabi-IB-Police-Decision_on_Surrey_Police_Transition.pdf

Timeline:
November 2018 – the City of Surrey voted unanimously to terminate its agreement with the RCMP and move to a municipal police department.
May 2019 – the City of Surrey submitted its Surrey Policing Transition Report to Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, for review and approval in his capacity as solicitor general.
August 2019 – Farnworth and Doug McCallum, mayor of Surrey, released a joint statement stating the City of Surrey was given the green light required to establish Surrey’s municipal police department.
August 2019 – the Provincial Municipal Policing Transition Study Committee, chaired by Wally Oppal, was established to ensure all key issues and complex details were thoroughly addressed in the city’s transition plan.
January 2020 – the committee submitted its report to B.C.’s director of police services.
February 2020 – the director recommended to the minister to establish a police board for the transition to a municipal police department in the City of Surrey.
February 2020 – the minister granted approval to create a municipal police board for the City of Surrey, the next stage in the city’s plan to transition to a municipal police department.
Establishment of a police board:
Under the Police Act, a municipal police board, which requires the approval of the minister of public safety and solicitor general to be established, is required to establish and govern a municipal police department.
The establishment of a new police board will take place over the coming months.
Parties involved in the establishment of a new police board include the Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General, director of police services, minister of public safety and solicitor general, Crown Agency and Board Resourcing Office (CABRO), Legal Services Branch, cabinet, Office of the Lieutenant Governor in Council and Order in Council (OIC) Office.
The ministry will initiate the process to establish a police board by posting a notice of position (NOP) on the CABRO website.
The NOP will be posted for four weeks to recruit prospective candidates. Once closed, CABRO will route all online applicants to the ministry for screening and to identify suitable candidates to interview.
Ministry staff will interview candidates and provide a list of recommendations to the director, who will then conduct secondary suitability interviews.
Police record checks will be conducted on successful applicants. The director of police services, in accordance with their statutory authority, will make recommendations to the minister of public safety and solicitor general about appointments to the board, based on the overriding principle of merit.
Police board members must be appointed by an OIC by the lieutenant governor. 
Once established, the Surrey police board and the Surrey police department will be subject to oversight by the director of police services, who has the statutory responsibility to superintend policing throughout B.C.
Role of a police board:
Police boards have four main governance functions:
employer of the police and civilian employees;
provide financial oversight for the police department;
establish policies and direction for the department; and
manage service and policy complaints against the department.

A municipal police board consists of:
the mayor, who acts as board chair;
one person appointed by the municipal council; and
up to seven people appointed by the lieutenant governor in council.

A police board can have a maximum of nine appointees. Initially, the Surrey police board will have seven members, which includes five members appointed by the Province, one member selected by the municipality and the mayor, who will serve as chair of the board. The option to add two additional board members will be considered at a later date.
Initial board appointments will range from one- to three-year terms.
The director will communicate all expectations of the police board to establish a new police department to the board once the board is established.
Hiring of police chief and law enforcement officers:
In line with the Police Act, a municipal police board is required to establish and govern a municipal police department.
Once a police board is appointed, the board will be required to hire a chief constable.
Once the chief constable is selected, efforts can be made to hire additional exempt positions.
Hiring of unionized positions can only begin once a collective agreement has been negotiated. 
The proposed model for the Surrey police department recommends a progressive scale up of the new department while maintaining a fully funded police service at least equivalent to the current state and increasing in future years.
The Province does not have a role in staffing a municipal police department.
Other:
All decisions and responsibilities regarding direct costs for the Surrey police department rest with the City of Surrey and the Surrey police board, once established. 
The operational structure of the Surrey police department will be determined by the police board and chief constable.
The process for transferring investigative files from one police agency to another will be determined and co-ordinated by the RCMP, the police board and the chief constable. This will ensure a seamless transition that maintains the integrity of investigations and victims, and ensures other involved persons will not be negatively impacted.
The proposed model for the Surrey police department recommends maintaining participation in the integrated teams consistent with the levels that currently exist through the Surrey RCMP.
There are provisions in the existing policing agreements that address the process for transferring assets such as computers, tactical gear, uniforms and vehicles. These processes will be initiated and outcomes determined by the RCMP and the police board.

More options for before- and after-school care are on the way for parents with the introduction of new legislation that will make it easier for boards of education to deliver licensed child care for students.“Having child care on school grounds is a win for everyone – children remain in familiar surroundings throughout their day, parents save time and money, and it keeps costs down by using facilities already enriched for learning and play,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “Our government is committed to accelerating affordable, quality licensed child care spaces so families no longer have to face long wait-lists to access services that are often far from home and almost as expensive as their monthly rent.”This legislation puts into the School Act – for the first time – recognition that school boards can directly operate before and after school care. Currently, if boards want to offer child care they must offer it through a separate, licensed provider. Boards will be required to have a child care policy in place that addresses reconciliation and inclusive education commitments, while prioritizing available space on their properties not being used for K-12 students.  To ensure families continue to have services they can count on, the legislation will allow a minister’s order to protect any spaces funded specifically for child care on school property.“I’ve heard from too many parents and experienced first-hand as a family with a school-age child, that the lack of affordable before- and after-school care in our province has meant that they cannot return to work, even after their kids start kindergarten,” said Katrina Chen, Minister of State for Child Care. “Studies show having child care at schools ensures smoother transitions for children and better educational outcomes, and it also helps parents with a single drop off and pick-up location.” 

These improvements build on work underway that will make it easier for school boards to work with licensed child care providers, share professional development and create inclusive, welcoming spaces for children to learn.“Almost every parent has experienced the challenge of finding good quality before and after school care for their child,” said Stephanie Higginson, president, BC School Trustees Association. “This amendment to the School Act enables boards of education to offer that care directly, creating a natural alignment with the educational programming already offered during the school day. We applaud the government for taking this important step in ensuring more child care options for school-age children.”Families throughout B.C. have benefited from the fastest creation of child care spaces in the province’s history, with more than 10,400 being funded in 15 months. Since launching in February 2018, the Childcare BC plan has also helped parents save more than $320 million through the Affordable Child Care Benefit and Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative. Through these initiatives, nearly 29,000 families have received child care for no more than $10 a day, since September 2018.When a board of education wants to operate its own child care, it is eligible for operating and capital grants from the Ministry of Children and Family Development. Boards can use this funding to create non-profit child care programs based on the unique needs of their communities, with priority for culturally-relevant services for Indigenous families and support for students with special needs.  As part of the move towards making child care more accessible for families, personal education numbers (PENs) will also be expanded so children can be assigned a number before they formally start school – which is typically when they begin kindergarten at age 5. This change will reduce the paperwork that parents face and help provide seamless services from child care and early learning, to K-12 and post-secondary education throughout B.C.To ensure children have access to high-quality learning opportunities and smooth transitions throughout their entire educational journey, the Ministry of Education also updated its Early Learning Framework in November 2019 after consulting with over 600 early child care and education stakeholders. The revised framework focuses – for the first time ­ on reconciliation and inclusive education, while expanding its scope to include infancy to eight years of age (formerly birth to five years of age).“Before- and after-school care should be seen as part of a child's comprehensive educational experience, and this change supports child care providers in that aspect of their work,” said Sonia Furstenau, MLA for Cowichan Valley. “When we begin to tap into the full potential of B.C.'s underutilized educational infrastructure, our schools will be transformed into centres with the remarkable ability to transform not just our youth but entire communities.”

Investing in child care and early childhood education is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:

Andrea Sinclair, president, BC Confederation of Parent Advisory Councils (BCCPAC) —“Parents are pleased that the government will now allow licensed child care to be operated by school boards. More than at any other time, parents are in need of strong before- and after-school, pre-school and daycare programs. These legislative changes will provide school communities the ability to work together to create better local child care solutions. BCCPAC believes the extension of the personal education number into early child care programs will help the transition of all students, but especially those with unique learning needs.”Paul Faoro, president, CUPE BC —“In addition to our long-time support for a quality, affordable public child care system in B.C., CUPE BC has long advocated that public schools are a natural home for child care spaces. It’s great to work with a government that sees the enormous potential here, all over the province.”Sharon Gregson, provincial spokesperson, Coalition of Child Care Advocates of BC —“We welcome this move to ensure school boards can run their own quality school-age child care programs. Schools are public assets and it makes sense they include before- and after-school care. This move aligns with the popular $10-a-day child care plan and it’s a significant step towards meeting the urgent need for affordable, high-quality child care in communities throughout B.C.”  Quick Facts:
The Education Statutes Amendment Act, 2020, will also include amendments to improve how public K-12 education is delivered and funded in B.C.
Since 2017, the Province has approved over 2,600 new child care spaces on school grounds.
As part of funding for new, replacement or upgraded schools, the Ministry of Education also provides extra dollars for school districts to create neighbourhood learning centres, with child care as a top priority. 
The Province has also made investments to improve supports to B.C.’s early care and learning professionals, investing more than $19 million to provide over 11,500 early childhood educators with a $1-per-hour wage enhancement. Another $1-per-hour lift is to come in April 2020.
To help with recruitment and retention, the B.C. government has also created 600 new early childhood education seats at post-secondary institutions, with 4,500 post-secondary students benefiting from bursaries to pursue a career as a child care professional.
Funding for child care spaces and services, including before- and after-school care for school-age children, is separate from funding for K-12 education.

Students throughout the province are gathering together to share stories of positivity and kindness, and to say no to bullying.The theme of this year’s Pink Shirt Day is “Lift each other up.” Government has proclaimed Feb. 26, 2020, as Diversity and Acceptance Day, highlighting B.C.’s commitment to ensuring a safe and inclusive province.Attendees at the Pink Shirt Day event in Victoria were encouraged to spread kindness to speak out against bullying, using these hashtags: #LiftEachOtherUp, #PinkShirtDay and #ERASEBullying“I feel proud to stand together with B.C.’s courageous young people today, as we all work together to celebrate diversity and acceptance and say no to bullying,” said Premier John Horgan. “Bullying in all forms is unacceptable, whether it’s online or face to face. We need strong communities within our schools where no student feels alone. By working together to protect and support each other with kindness, tolerance and acceptance, we’re building a safer B.C. for everyone.”Premier Horgan and Rob Fleming, Minister of Education, and MLAs were joined at the Parliament Buildings by Tru Wilson, transgender advocate; Carol Todd, parent and founder of the Amanda Todd Legacy Society; Travis Price, co-founder of Pink Shirt Day; and local students.“We all have a role to play in making sure students feel safe in the classroom, at home and online. If we work together, we can help students feel safe and encourage respectful behaviour toward others,” said Fleming. “The Erase program is continuing to provide our students with additional tools and resources to support their well-being and make a huge difference in our schools and communities.”The Erase strategy continues to grow as a comprehensive resource to better represent the issues facing youth and their communities today. Priority areas include a focus on social media and online safety, mental health and wellness, substance use, gang prevention and supporting students of all sexual orientations and gender identities.Many new resources are available for students, parents, educators and community partners in B.C. schools this year as part of an over $5.4-million investment in Erase, including:
a $2-million provincewide investment in school-based student mental health to help ensure kids can access support when they need it, and so they feel safe and connected at school;
$50,000 for social media and online safety education sessions for B.C. students and parents throughout the province. These sessions are an extension of the sessions offered over the last two years;
a new video series, Raising Digitally Responsible Youth, was created in partnership with the BC Confederation of Parent Advisory Councils, to help parents and caregivers understand and teach kids how to safely navigate online and protect their digital reputation at the same time;
a new Community Violence Threat Risk Assessment Protocol Guide to foster cross-sector partnerships to keep school communities safe and provide wraparound supports to students in need; and
new trauma-informed practice resources for educators to develop compassion to help children, youth and adults, especially those who have experienced traumatic events and early hardships.
Quotes:Tru Wilson, 16-year-old trans advocate –“I am so happy to be a part of Pink Shirt Day again and to celebrate how this day has evolved. Today is not just about standing up against fear and hate, it's about celebrating each and every one of us who is different. Today is a day for all of us to stand together and truly lift each other up!”Carol Todd, parent and founder, Amanda Todd Legacy Society –“Together, we must actively work to ‘Lift Each Other Up’ in times when it is needed the most. Positive actions are needed in creating a society of respect and understanding. Pink Shirt Day allows us to make these changes for good by asking, ‘Who can I lift up to make a better tomorrow?’ and knowing that this is helping someone. For today and all the other days that follow, creating positive actions that make a difference is what is important and what is needed.”Travis Price, founder, Pink Shirt Day –“I am so excited to once again be part of British Columbia's Pink Day. Through the years, I have been part of these incredible events. It inspires and motivates me to see the excitement this day brings to so many on the West Coast. Pink Day's growth is a perfect example of the incredible things we can accomplish when we work together to tackle issues that we are all affected by.”Quick Facts:
The Adolescent Health Survey, 2018, shows:
14% of B.C students had been cyberbullied (including 23% of non-binary youth) in 2018.
54% of B.C.’s gay and lesbian high school students report experiencing discrimination because of their sexual orientation.

Bullying/cyberbullying is the top issue reported via the Erase online reporting tool in 2019-20 – 30% of reports.
This year's Pink Shirt Day Tour with Travis Price is partially supported by the TLC Fund for Kids and the WITS Programs Foundation, a non-profit that provides bullying prevention programs.
New trauma-informed practice resources are available to help educators with a compassionate lens of understanding that is helpful to all children, youth and adults, especially those who have experienced traumatic events and early hardships.

Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction, has released the following statement on Statistics Canada’s release of the Canadian Income Survey 2018, which shows declines in poverty rates in British Columbia:“The 2018 Canadian Income Survey demonstrates that TogetherBC, the province’s first poverty reduction strategy, is working. We set a target to reduce the overall poverty rate by 25% and the child poverty rate by at least 50% by 2024 based on 2016 data.“B.C.’s overall poverty rate was 8.9% in 2018 compared to 12% in 2016, while B.C.’s child poverty rate declined to 6.9% in 2018 from 12% in 2016. I’m pleased to see this Statistics Canada data confirm that our poverty reduction strategy is working to make life better for people. By investing in housing and child care, and by raising the minimum wage, we are helping to lift British Columbians out of poverty. These statistics are encouraging and confirm we’re on the right path, but there is still more work to do.“Since forming government in July 2017, we’ve been delivering on our priority of making life more affordable for British Columbians. We’ve increased income and disability assistance rates twice and made child care more affordable. In just over two years, 23,000 new affordable homes are completed or underway throughout the province and we’re taking action to make renting fairer for people in B.C.“With the release of the Canada Income Survey 2018, Statistics Canada also released its second comprehensive review of the market-basket measure, which establishes poverty thresholds based on the cost of necessities such as food, clothing, accommodation and transportation. It recommends increasing the costs associated with housing and accommodation, as well as transportation.“The previous government chose to ignore the housing crisis and left people behind. Our government is choosing to invest in people with a plan to build 114,000 new affordable homes through partnerships over 10 years. We also expect additional initiatives rolling out this year will reduce poverty rates. For example, the new BC Child Opportunity Benefit that comes into effect October 2020 is expected to help about 290,000 families. The elimination of MSP premiums, effective January 2020, and increases to the minimum wage are helping low-income individuals and families.”Quick Facts:
Statistics Canada proposes to finalize and start using the revised market basket sometime in the early summer. Applying these revisions will result in some changes to the number of people living below the poverty line but will still demonstrate a reduction in B.C.’s poverty rates.
As required by the Poverty Reduction Strategy Act, the first annual report on B.C.’s poverty reduction strategy will be released by October 2020.

While the risk of spread of this virus within British Columbia remains low at this time, we are watching the global evolution of COVID-19 carefully and are focusing efforts on containing the spread of COVID-19 in B.C. and in Canada.“We are preparing for all possibilities that may occur in the coming weeks, including the possibility of a pandemic. A pandemic is the spread of an illness to a large number of people on a global scale.“We are asking people to do their part in making sure they prevent transmission of infections to others in our communities and in our health-care system to best protect everyone in B.C.“The most important measures people can take to prevent respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, are cleaning your hands regularly, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately and staying home and away from others if you are sick.“We ask all international travellers who are returning to B.C. to monitor themselves and their children closely for symptoms. If any symptoms arise, limit their contact with others and connect with their primary-care provider, local public health office, or call 811 to determine if COVID-19 testing is needed. This is an important way to reduce the possibility of transmission of illness to others.”Learn More:

Fraser Health will stop funding the Delta Hospice Society (DHS) on Feb. 25, 2021, providing the required 365-days notice to end their service agreement without cause.The termination follows the DHS board’s refusal to comply with the provincial medical assistance in dying (MAiD) policy.The contract had provided DHS approximately $1.5 million annually. This covered 94% of the society’s costs to operate 10 beds at the Irene Thomas Hospice — a facility on land Fraser Health owns. Fraser Health will use the next year to ensure Delta residents continue to have access to those beds.“We have made every effort to support the board to come into compliance and they have been clear that they have no intention to,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “We are taking this action reluctantly, and when the role of the Delta Hospice Society concludes, patients in publicly funded hospice care will again be able to fully access their medical rights.”In 2016, the federal government passed legislation making it legal for Canadians who meet very specific criteria to have a medical professional assist them with their death. In response to that legislation, B.C. developed a policy that requires a hospice to allow patients to access MAiD in their facility, if their beds are more than 50% publicly funded.“I strongly support hospice care and we have made important investments to expand it across the province,” Dix added. “We will ensure hospice care services remain in Delta. To do that, we could restore the existing Irene Thomas Hospice site to public management. Given the significant financial contributions Delta community members made to build the facility, this would be the most desirable option. Alternatively, we could pursue another Delta site. In either scenario, the 10 hospice beds represented by the existing facility will stay in Delta.“Putting the patient first is what matters most. Patients make decisions about medical services in consultation with their doctor and their family. No organization can influence this decision or impose it. I respect anyone’s right to disagree, and no one has ever required hospice staff to deliver medical assistance in dying, but they must allow eligible residents who want the service to access it.”In the last three years, more than 3,000 British Columbians made the choice to have medical assistance in dying — the majority of those choosing to do so at home, often a long-term care facility or a hospice.

Parents in Kelowna and Kamloops are encouraged to attend upcoming education sessions in their communities as part of B.C.’s school-based gang prevention initiative.“These sessions are focused on raising awareness of local risks and giving parents the tools and supports they need to keep their children out of gang life,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “Training opportunities like these can help parents ensure their kids get the support they need earlier, so they can continue to work together toward positive futures.”The upcoming parent education session in Kamloops will be offered Tuesday, March 3, at 6:30 p.m. at Henry Grube Education Centre, located at 245 Kitchener Cres., Kamloops. No registration is required. Sessions run approximately 90 minutes.The upcoming parent education session in Kelowna will be offered April 2, from 7 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. at Hollywood Road Education Centre, Room 1. The centre is located at 1040 Hollywood Rd. South, Kelowna. No registration is required.“Prevention and intervention involves everyone, and parents can play an important role in keeping young people out of gangs,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “Sessions like this can dispel myths and help parents recognize the signs of at-risk behaviours, so they can help keep their kids on a positive path.”The gang prevention program provides education and training opportunities for students, parents, educators, law enforcement officials and representatives of community-based organizations. The Province is investing $4.93 million over the next three years to provide gang prevention and awareness training programs in 16 communities throughout British Columbia. This builds on an initial $1.12-million investment that has had more than 8,000 students, parents, educators and community partners participate in 110 training and education sessions.Parents will leave these sessions with a greater understanding of what they can do to prevent their child from getting involved in gang activity. Topics will include:
an overview of the current B.C. gang landscape;
information on how gang members are recruiting using social media; and
what attracts children and youth to the gang lifestyle.
Presenters will also discuss what gang membership entails and dispel some of the myths and realities of gang membership, as well as offer warning signs and steps to take if you think your child is involved in gang activity.Quotes:Alison Sidow, superintendent, Kamloops-Thompson School District –“In partnership with parents, our district plays a critical role in educating young people about healthy choices. The world is complex and we all have a responsibility to ensure our youth are equipped with the information they need to critically think about how their decisions affect their futures.”Kevin Kaardal, superintendent and CEO, Central Okanagan School District –“We are grateful for the Ministry of Education's continued support with the important work of gang prevention in our community. Our top priority is student safety and educating families is a key part of ensuring students have all of our support to make good decisions. We hope parents will take advantage of the information sessions again this year.”Quick Facts:
Kelowna and Kamloops are two of the 16 priority communities identified by police and safety experts as those that could benefit from additional gang prevention support.
Other communities include: Campbell River, Chilliwack, Courtenay, Hope, Abbotsford, Burnaby, Delta, Langley, Nanaimo, Prince George, Surrey, Vancouver, Victoria and Williams Lake.
The provincial Erase strategy offers services and resources to foster school connectedness, address bullying and prevent violence in B.C. schools, and provides support to school districts during critical incidents.
During the 2018-19 school year, Erase was expanded to be a more comprehensive resource. It now includes a focus on gang prevention, mental health and wellness, substance use, online safety, and sexual orientation and gender identity.
These sessions are being provided by Safer Schools Together, the Ministry of Education’s service-delivery partner for Erase.

BC Colleges and the Province are celebrating the fourth-annual BC Colleges Day, honouring the educators, staff, boards and administrators who are valued parts of the public post-secondary ecosystem.“The vital role of public colleges is felt across British Columbia,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “Colleges are creating economic opportunities and employment in every corner of the province and are leading the way by delivering dynamic and diverse academic, trades and vocational programs close to home. Through applied research and technical innovation, they are building the foundations of a thriving and successful B.C.”Presidents of the 10 members of the BC Colleges association gathered in Victoria to recognize the accomplishments of their students. For more than 50 years, B.C.’s 11 colleges have been vital community hubs throughout the province. These colleges deliver over 250 programs to more than 125,000 students annually through campuses and learning centres in 60 communities. “Colleges serve people and communities throughout B.C. with a wide range of programs,” said Sherri Bell, chair of BC Colleges and president of Camosun College. “BC Colleges Day celebrates the life-changing education and training that is helping create, build and maintain a thriving, healthy and vibrant British Columbia.”Indigenous students account for about 10% of the student population in the college system. At the 10 colleges in the BC Colleges association, there were 10,720 learners self-identified as Indigenous in the 2017-18 academic year, according to the ministry’s central data warehouse. “British Columbia’s colleges are working in collaboration with Indigenous leaders and students, governments, industry, communities and other partners to deliver on the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action for education and training,” Bell said. “Colleges are implementing programs and services to support true and lasting reconciliation.”In every corner of the province, there are stories of student success made possible by studying at B.C.’s colleges. As part of this year’s BC Colleges Day celebrations, some of these successes have been captured in a handbook.

I found many answers to those questions at CNC.”The recently released Good Jobs Guide notes that 77% of the 860,000 jobs expected in the next decade will require post-secondary education. To make post-secondary education more accessible and affordable for B.C. students, Budget 2020 provides $24 million over three years for the new B.C. Access Grant. Over 40,000 low- to middle-income students will be eligible for up-front grants of up to $4,000 starting in September 2020.Learn More:BC Colleges is an association representing 10 of the 11 public post-secondary colleges in the province: http://www.bccolleges.ca

An administrator has been appointed by Interior Health’s board of directors to manage the day-to-day long-term care operations of Summerland Seniors Village.The appointment is full time and effective immediately for a period of six months, subject to adjustments if conditions warrant.The board’s decision was based on a recommendation from Dr. Sue Pollock, chief medical health officer, Interior Health.“I strongly support the decision by the Interior Health board of directors to appoint an administrator,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “We have and will continue to put the care and safety of seniors first before any other consideration, which is what is happening here.”After numerous site visits by staff from Interior Health licensing and quality, Pollock determined that the operator of the long-term care facility was unable to meet the legislated standards of care for residents.“Ensuring that seniors living in publicly funded, long-term care are receiving the high quality, safe and dignified care they need and deserve is Interior Health’s top priority and is at the heart of this decision,” said Dr. Doug Cochrane, board chair, Interior Health.The chief medical health officer’s recommendation was informed by the findings of a diligent and thorough process, including a significant amount of support provided to the site by Interior Health.Pollock said despite efforts over many months, the operator was still not meeting expectations defined in the provincial Community Care and Assisted Living Act.Summerland Seniors Village has ongoing challenges with its site leadership, care planning, staff education and training, and reporting.The administrator will be responsible for the operation and management of the care home, and supporting critical functions, including:
care planning and delivery;
site management;
staff recruitment, orientation and education;
developing and implementing policies and procedures;
overall compliance with the legislated standards of care; and
reporting to the Interior Health board chair.
Vanda Urban, an experienced health-care leader with expertise in long-term care, will serve as the administrator. Urban has worked in health care for 35 years, 21 of them in long-term care in B.C. She has been in leadership roles with Interior Health for 14 years, most recently as director of long-term care. Urban also worked as a nurse in long-term care in both publicly owned and contracted provider care homes.Urban is also familiar with Summerland Seniors Village and was directly involved in recent quality reviews at the site.Summerland Seniors Village is a privately owned, long-term care home operated by West Coast Seniors Housing Management, which manages the Retirement Concepts group of companies.Summerland Seniors Village has 112 long-term care beds. Interior Health publicly funds 75 of the beds. Twelve beds are currently closed to admissions.West Coast Seniors Housing Management operates two other long-term care facilities in Interior Health – one in Kamloops and one in Williams Lake. Interior Health does not have similar quality or licensing concerns with these sites.In 2013, an administrator was appointed at Summerland Seniors Village for four months when the facility was under different ownership.

A new Interim Business Property Tax Relief program will allow local governments to provide immediate property tax relief for the 2020 tax year.This relief will apply to small businesses and non-profits, as well as arts and culture organizations, that are struggling with high lease costs as a result of years of rapidly increasing property values.“Years of an out-of-control real estate market have resulted in unexpected tax spikes for many small businesses that pay property taxes as part of their commercial leases,"" said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “People have been asking for help, and today we’re offering a way for local governments to provide that help. This new program empowers local governments to provide immediate relief to the small businesses and organizations most affected by skyrocketing property taxes in their communities.”Recognizing the challenges look different in each municipality, this tax relief program will allow municipalities to exempt, by bylaw, a portion of the assessed value of those properties most affected by this issue in a way that works for their community.The changes enable significant relief for small businesses and others who have been calling for changes for over a decade. It will reduce the taxes paid by these properties, reducing lease costs for tenants with triple-net leases. The legislation gives municipalities maximum flexibility to tailor the way they identify properties in need of relief in their communities and to set the amount of tax exemption for selected properties.To help communities meet the timeline to deliver relief for the 2020 tax year, ministry staff have worked with interested communities since advance notice of the legislation was given in January. The Province has worked with municipalities to help them prepare for implementation and will further support them by providing a model bylaw, staff advice, a user guide and procedural changes.This program is an interim solution while the Province continues to work with local governments and the Union of British Columbia Municipalities, as well as business and community stakeholders on a permanent solution that will work for communities of all sizes throughout the province.This legislation, the municipal affairs and housing statutes amendments act, also introduced four other minor amendments to the Assessment Act, Local Government Act, Community Charter and the Vancouver Charter.Quotes: Michael Hind, CEO, Tri-Cities Chamber of Commerce –“We appreciate the provincial government's efforts to address the large commercial-property tax increases threatening many small businesses around B.C., including in the Tri-Cities. The proposed interim measures are a step in the right direction, but we continue to stress the need for the provincial government to develop a comprehensive long-term solution.”Brian McBay, executive director, 221A –“Vancouver is being emptied out of music and performing art venues, art galleries and artist studios. The city reported over 20 cultural spaces with approximately 400 artists were closed in the last year. The cultural sector is in a crisis and the Province’s tax measures are the right step toward halting the closure of art spaces that bring joy and humanity to our democracy.”Learn More:For more information about the municipal affairs and housing statutes amendment act, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/21630A backgrounder follows.

The Province has proposed a number of legislative changes that will help strengthen local governments’ ability to enforce bylaws and maintain housing, provide more financial transparency for BC Assessment and streamline administrative processes for local governments.If passed, this legislation will amend the following provincial statutes:Assessment Authority ActBC Assessment is the only provincial Crown corporation that operates on a calendar-based fiscal year. This proposed amendment will bring BC Assessment’s fiscal year in line with the provincial government and all other Crown corporations, making its financial information and reporting more transparent and easier to understand.Local Government Act and Vancouver CharterA proposed amendment to both the Local Government Act and the Vancouver Charter will respond to the request by the Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM) to repeal its authority to administer the commercial vehicle licensing program on behalf of participating municipalities. Originally, the revenue from administering this program was collected and used by local governments. The request from UBCM is based on its evaluation of the program that found it was no longer cost-effective and did not meet the needs of its participating local governments.Vancouver Charter and Community CharterAn amendment to the Vancouver Charter and Community Charter strengthens the City of Vancouver’s bylaw enforcement tools to address poorly maintained buildings. In particular, this addresses concerns with low-income housing, such as single-room occupancy housing. The amendment requires property owners to complete necessary remedial repairs and work within 30 days — a reduction from the earlier 60 days. With this change, if a property owner fails to complete the remedial work within 30 days, or sooner in urgent cases, the city can step in and complete the work at the property owner’s expense.The proposed amendment also raises the fine for serious bylaw contravention – which can be imposed daily – from $10,000 to $50,000 per offence, to help local governments provide a significant deterrent against serious bylaw infractions.Vancouver CharterThis proposed amendment helps streamline the land development process by giving the City of Vancouver the same authority to enter into latecomer agreements currently available to other local governments and land or property developers of multi-phase projects. The latecomer agreements help a local government to plan for growth in an area by building anticipated infrastructure such as roads, sewer, water and drainage that goes beyond needs for the initial approved plan by the first developer.As an area grows and future developers submit plans to the city, it can collect a latecomer charge from the future developers to use the services and pay a portion to the initial developer for paying the up-front cost of building the infrastructure. Currently, due to the lack of this authority, Vancouver requires the initial developer to enter into an agreement to provide these services, which is a more cumbersome process.

Legislative amendments have been introduced that will reduce the cost and complexity of lawsuits under the current auto insurance system.  Proposed legislative amendments to the Evidence Act will limit the number of experts and expert reports that can be used in court on the issue of damages, while also providing judicial discretion to allow additional expert reports in appropriate cases. There will be a limit of one expert and expert report for each party for fast-track claims (e.g., claims under $100,000). A maximum of three experts and reports for each party will be set for all other claims. The parties can agree to use more experts without the need to file a formal application to the court.“With limits on the number of experts and expert reports, we are reducing the cost, complexity and delay associated with expensive duelling experts,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “It means that claims will be resolved more efficiently.”Should the legislation be passed, proposed regulations would place a limit on the amount recoverable from the unsuccessful litigant for the cost of each expert report in motor vehicle personal injury cases to $3,000. Total recoverable disbursements in motor vehicle personal injury cases would also be limited to 5% of the judgment or settlement. Disbursements include all expenses incurred for the purpose of a lawsuit, such as courier fees, process servers and photocopying, but will not include fees payable to the Crown, such as filing, court and jury fees. There are more than 90,000 active auto-insurance claims. There is potential for more claims to be brought forward between now and when ICBC’s new insurance system, Enhanced Care coverage, takes effect May 1, 2021.Quick Facts:
Since 2017, the increased use of experts has contributed to a 30% increase in the cost of ICBC injury claims that are litigated.
The limit on experts will not apply if the expert report was served before Feb. 6, 2020, or if a notice of trial was filed and served before Feb. 6, 2020, for a trial before Oct. 1, 2020.

On Feb. 24, 2020, the BC Coroners Service announced its 2019 Data Release for Illicit Drug Toxicity Deaths in British Columbia, reporting that last year, 981 people died due to a poisoned, unregulated drug supply. The number of deaths is down 36% from the year before.Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, has released the following statement:“Today’s release by the BC Coroners Service of the 2019 drug toxicity deaths is a sharp reminder of lives cut too short, and of devastated families and communities left behind in the wake of this collective tragedy. We mourn each and every person lost, not as a number but as a person whose life matters. No one should have to experience the pain of losing a loved one to the ongoing fentanyl-poisoning crisis.“While I am very encouraged to see the number of overdose deaths going down for the first time since this crisis began, and that fewer families will receive the terrible news of a loved one lost, our government is committed now more than ever to keep our foot firmly on the gas, to keep going and keep acting on what the evidence shows us is working.“We have scaled up more life-saving supports like naloxone and overdose prevention services and created more pathways for medication-assisted treatment and for recovery. Thanks to our partners at the BC Centre for Disease Control, we know these strategies have prevented thousands of deaths and are helping people become healthy again.“At the same time, we recognize that we still have an incredible amount of work to do. We know that more and more people are surviving overdose and living with long-term health impacts. We know that more people are seeking treatment and recovery and we are working tirelessly to meet those long-neglected needs.“We have more treatment beds coming online this year and tough new regulations in place so that people in recovery homes get better care. We are also working with health authorities to further expand access to medication-assisted treatment for people living with opioid-use disorder. And we are working in partnership with the First Nations Health Authority to build two new urban Indigenous treatment centres and rebuilding six more in rural B.C.“I want to extend my deepest gratitude to first responders, peers, families, health-care professionals and community workers who are dealing with the deeply emotional toll of doing everything they can to save lives and connect people to care time and time again. Our province owes you a debt we can never repay. “The way we act and speak can make a life-changing difference for someone who is living with addiction, to find a pathway to hope and to healing. We cannot afford to stop caring. It really will take all hands on deck to stem this terrible tide and reduce the stigma that leads to so many people using and dying alone. “As we look to the year ahead, we will continue to work closely with and listen to the valuable advice of our partners, including people with lived experience to save lives and build a better, more connected continuum of care options for people living with addiction.” A backgrounder follows.

As British Columbia approaches the four-year anniversary of the public health emergency related to illicit drug overdoses, the BC Coroners Service and partners are renewing calls for improved access to a regulated, safer drug supply in the province.The BC Coroners Service reports there were 981 suspected illicit drug toxicity deaths in 2019. This represents an average of 2.7 deaths per day and will likely increase as investigations conclude. Though the 981 illicit drug toxicity deaths in 2019 represent a 36% decrease from similar deaths in 2018, the number is virtually identical to the number of those who died in 2016, the year the provincial health emergency was declared.“More than 5,000 lives have been lost in B.C. since 2016 as a result of illicit drug toxicity. These deaths have deeply hurt families and communities across our province and represent an immense loss of potential in all walks of life,” said Lisa Lapointe, B.C.’s chief coroner. “The number of illicit drug toxicity deaths in 2019 remains higher than motor vehicle incidents, suicides and homicides combined, and B.C. continues to bear the heaviest toll of the impacts of the unpredictable, profit-driven, illicit drug market.“Collectively, we continue to urge for greater access to safe supply for those in our community who are experiencing, and struggling to live with, substance use disorder.”A continuing trend highlighted in the report is that middle-aged men are over-represented with more than three quarters of the suspected overdose deaths involving males and 71% involving people aged 30 to 59. Eighty-seven per cent of deaths continue to occur indoors, with more people dying on the days immediately following the issuance of income assistance payments than all other days in the year.“The decrease in the number of British Columbians dying from this crisis is encouraging and indicates that our harm-reduction measures to keep people alive are working,” said Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer. “We’re dealing with addiction. And addiction is an illness, a health condition. We are in no way out of this crisis yet. We continue to see very high rates of overdose events across the province and are seeing increased numbers of young people with long-lasting health effects after overdosing.“The measures we are taking to ensure access to services are there for people who use drugs when they are ready and able to start their path to recovery. And in the meantime, we need to change our approach so that people who use drugs are able to seek help without the fear of being charged criminally and with access to a pharmaceutical alternative, instead of what is clearly a toxic street-drug supply.”More than four in every five deaths in 2019 had fentanyl detected in post-mortem testing.""The effectiveness of the overdose response must be acknowledged, and our gratitude for the tireless work of those who are responding to overdoses when they occur cannot be overstated,"" said Dr. Perry Kendall, co-interim executive director at the BC Centre on Substance Use. ""We must also acknowledge that overdoses are still occurring at an equal or greater rate than ever as a result of the toxic drug supply, posing a significant public health threat that will impact a generation of British Columbians. An overdose can lead to long-term harms, such as traumatic brain injury that will last a lifetime. Lives are being saved, but saving lives alone is not nearly enough. We must now turn our attention toward implementing strategies to prevent overdoses from occurring in the first place — which must start with a legally regulated drug supply.” Despite a decrease of illicit drug toxicity deaths over the past year, the number of non-fatal events plateaued in 2019, according to data from BC Emergency Health Services.“While we're seeing a decrease in deaths, data from BC Emergency Health Services shows we were called to the same high level of overdoses in 2019,” said Lance Stephenson, director of patient care delivery with BC Emergency Health Services. “We are still getting called for more than 65 overdoses a day in B.C. We're still in a crisis.”Aboriginal British Columbians continue to be over-represented in the data proportionally – and following further review by the First Nations Health Authority, an Aboriginal-focused report will be published with more detailed data and analysis.“We can confirm we will be releasing our own data in partnership with the BC Coroners Service on the specific impact of this crisis on First Nations people in B.C. in the coming weeks,” said Dr. Nel Wieman, senior medical officer, mental health and wellness with the First Nations Health Authority. “But we know one thing for certain: the impact of this crisis on Indigenous peoples is proportionately greater than for the rest of the population.”Quick Facts:
The number of illicit drug toxicity deaths in 2019 equates to about 2.7 deaths per day for the year.
There was at least one illicit drug toxicity death in 330 of the 365 days in 2019.
The townships experiencing the highest number of illicit drug toxicity deaths in 2019 are Vancouver, Surrey, Victoria and Abbotsford.
Vancouver Coastal Health Authority had the highest rate of illicit drug toxicity deaths (23 deaths per 100,000 individuals), followed by Northern Health Authority (22.5 deaths per 100,000 individuals) in 2019.
Overall, the rate in B.C. was 19 deaths per 100,000 individuals in 2019;

By local health area, the rates of illicit drug toxicity deaths were highest in Princeton, Grand Forks, Hope, Keremeos, and Merritt, from 2017 to 2019.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in British Columbia:“We are announcing a seventh case of COVID-19 in B.C. The person affected was in close contact with the previously reported sixth case announced on Feb. 20, 2020. Both cases remain in isolation at home with support and monitoring from public health teams.“The individual has been confirmed positive based on BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) testing. The individual is male, in his 40s and lives in the Fraser Health region.“The BCCDC is now officially authorized for COVID-19 testing by the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) and therefore samples no longer require further confirmation by the NML in Winnipeg.“Fraser Health is actively investigating and close contacts have been identified and contacted by public health officials. Those who may be at risk are now in isolation for 14 days and are being actively monitored for symptoms daily.“Of these seven cases, the first case has recovered, as indicated by the resolution of symptoms, followed by two successive negative test results 24 hours apart. The other six B.C. patients with COVID-19 remain in self-isolation at home and under care by public-health teams.  “The risk of spread of this virus within British Columbia continues to remain low at this time. We are watching recent global developments very closely and will continue to adapt our response to developing evidence and ongoing assessment of COVID-19 should it be required. We will notify the public if the measures in B.C. change.“Given the changing dynamics of the outbreak in China and globally, and recognizing we are in the midst of influenza season, we ask all travellers who are returning to B.C. — no matter where they were in the world — to monitor themselves and their children closely for symptoms. If any symptoms arise, limit their contact with others and contact their primary care provider, local public health office or call 811. This is an important way to reduce the possibility of transmission of illness to others.“People who have recently travelled through the Hubei province of China or are returning from quarantined cruise ships are being contacted by public health officials and are self-isolating for 14 days upon arriving in B.C. after leaving the area of potential exposure.""If people have travelled to mainland China in the past 14 days, they are advised to monitor themselves and their children closely for symptoms (fever, shortness of breath, cough and breathing difficulties), and to contact their public health office if they have any concerns.“The most important measures people in B.C. can take to prevent respiratory illnesses including COVID-19 are cleaning your hands regularly, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately and staying home and away from others if you are sick.“Anyone who is concerned they may have been exposed to, or are experiencing symptoms of, COVID-19 should contact their primary care provider, local public health office or call 811. Translation services for 811 are available in more than 130 languages.”Learn More:For more information and latest updates on COVID-19, follow the BCCC on Twitter @CDCofBC or visit its website: http://www.bccdc.ca/

Monday is Mining Day, an annual opportunity for senior mining representatives to connect with B.C. government leaders to discuss the issues facing one of the province’s most important industries.Budget 2020 reinforced the Province’s commitment to implementing the Mining Jobs Task Force and to supporting the competitiveness of the mining sector. The new mine allowance under the Mineral Tax Act has been extended for five years, to the end of 2025.“Mining is a foundational industry in B.C. that supports communities and creates good jobs for people throughout the province,” said Bruce Ralston, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources. “Building on the work of the Mining Jobs Task Force, we are taking action to attract new investment, drive innovation in the sector and ensure British Columbia remains a world-class mining jurisdiction.”Budget 2020 will also make it easier for industry to invest in clean, low-carbon technologies. Businesses in the mining and resource industries can now obtain machinery and equipment for pollution control and waste management without paying provincial sales tax, regardless of where it will be used. Previously, this exemption was subject to geographic constraints.“B.C.’s mining industry is a world-leading provider of responsibly produced, low-carbon metals and minerals that are essential for a cleaner future and create economic and social benefits for all British Columbians,” said Michael Goehring, president and CEO of the Mining Association of British Columbia. “Our message to government and the public on Mining Day is simple: improving British Columbia’s ability to compete and succeed in global markets will lead to more economic opportunities and high-wage jobs in B.C., more opportunities to advance economic reconciliation with Indigenous communities and more government tax revenues to support the public services we all value.”The Province’s tax incentives for mineral exploration, focus on permitting efficiency and global reputation for environmental responsibility make B.C. an attractive place for investment. The Province has seen significant investments in mining operations over the past two years.In his recent mandate letter from the Premier, Ralston was tasked with taking further action to strengthen the mining sector. He was directed to prioritize work on regulatory efficiency initiatives, with a focus on expedited permitting processes and reconciliation in the mining sector. Ralston was also mandated to further connect the technology and innovation sector with industries, such as mining, and to showcase made-in-B.C. technologies that are contributing to industrial competitiveness or helping to reduce emissions.Quick Facts:
Mining and related sectors in B.C. provide jobs for more than 30,000 people throughout the province and have a production value of more than $9 billion.
In 2018-19, the B.C. mining industry paid over $400 million in mineral taxes to the Province.
Over 3,700 B.C. suppliers around the province provide $2.9 billion worth of goods and services to B.C. mining operations.
The mining sector in B.C. pays an average annual salary of $117,000; higher than forestry, manufacturing, finance and construction.

Local and regional governments in 18 communities have been approved to receive their share of more than $12 million in provincial emergency preparedness funding to support structural flood mitigation projects.The intent is to support eligible applicants to prevent, eliminate or reduce hazards through structural flood mitigation projects.Since the September 2017 Budget Update, communities and governments throughout B.C. have received more than $40 million through the Community Emergency Preparedness Fund (CEPF). The successful applicants for the latest round of funding are in every corner of the province.“In order to reduce the risk to British Columbians from hazards like flooding, we’re investing in mitigation projects,” said Mike Farnworth, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General. “We know that to improve public safety and create resilience among people and families, it’s critical to plan ahead with the aim of preventing disasters where possible and lessening the impact they have on our communities.”Funding for the structural flood project component of CEPF was announced at the September 2017 convention of the Union of British Columbia Municipalities (UBCM). This funding is part of a nearly $69.5-million plan designed to help communities prepare for, and respond to, disasters.“We’re proud to invest in disaster mitigation and improved resilience for British Columbians across the province,” said Jennifer Rice, Parliamentary Secretary for Emergency Preparedness. “This funding will help keep communities safer and improve outcomes in the event of an emergency situation.”  The CEPF is a suite of programs designed to enhance the resiliency of local governments, First Nations’ communities and their residents. The Province provides the funding, which is administered by UBCM, and is divided into seven streams:
flood risk assessment, flood mapping and flood mitigation planning
emergency support services
emergency operations centres and training
structural flood mitigation
evacuation routes
volunteer and composite fire departments equipment and training
Indigenous cultural safety and cultural humility training
In May 2019, the Province announced the above-mentioned new, sixth stream of CEPF funding for volunteer and composite fire departments. Proponents, including First Nations communities, local governments and society-run departments, were able to apply for their share of $5 million to go toward equipment and training.The Province created a seventh stream with $1 million for Indigenous cultural safety and cultural humility training. This brings the CEPF total to $69.5 million and opens eligibility to all First Nations’ communities.The next deadlines for applications are:
March 13, 2020, for emergency operations centres and training
April 17, 2020, for evacuation route planning

Premier John Horgan has issued the following statement in support of the Moose Hide Campaign’s Provincial Gathering and Day of Fasting on Monday, Feb. 24, 2020:“Over half of the women in our province have experienced physical or sexual violence at some point in their lives after age 16. In Canada, Indigenous women are three times more likely than non-Indigenous women to experience domestic violence and three times more likely than non-Indigenous women to be killed by someone they know.“There have been too many women and girls who have been hurt, murdered or gone missing, or do not feel safe in their own homes. The Moose Hide Campaign aims to change that and today, we recognize the hard work they’ve done over the past nine years to help end the violence against women and children.“The Moose Hide Campaign’s Provincial Gathering and Day of Fasting is an opportunity for people throughout the province to bring about positive change in our families and communities while encouraging men to speak up, speak out and take action against gender-based violence.“It’s my hope that by proclaiming Feb. 24, 2020, Moose Hide Campaign Day and by wearing the moose hide pin, we will spark millions of conversations in every corner of the province and across the country about how we can help end gender-based violence in our communities.“Our government is committed to developing a path forward to end violence against Indigenous women, girls, gender-diverse and two-spirit people that will be directly informed by survivors, family members and communities. We will work with partners and communities to take actions and develop a path forward to ending violence together.“The conversations we have today will help shape a safer, more secure future for tomorrow.”For a French translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Moosehide-Campaign-2020_French.pdf

Bailey Farm is celebrating 100 years of farming history at the Nechako Valley Regional Cattlemens Association’s Annual General Meeting this year.The farm’s history begins with James Bailey’s arrival to British Columbia aboard the ship Ascania in 1914. From the coast, Bailey travelled to the Nechako Valley, where he had family already settled. Bailey enlisted to serve in the First World War and in 1916, he fought in France for three years as part of the 102nd Canadian Expeditionary Force Battalion.“James’ journey, his service and his dedication to building a home and a farm for his family are an inspiration to many,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “Congratulations to the Bailey family on 100 years of contributing to B.C.’s farming, ranching and community history with best wishes for the years to come.”In 1919, Bailey received a land grant through the Veterans Land Act and built a tiny, two-roomed log house. Thirteen years later, in 1932, Bailey married Elizabeth Redmond. They raised three sons and expanded the family home to accommodate their growing family.The farm began with dairy cows, laying hens, beef cattle and horses. Beef cattle were raised for both food and income, while horses were bred to sell to other farmers and used to help with work around the farm. Milk, cream and eggs were sold locally to businesses in the community.“Life hasn’t always been easy, but we are very lucky folks who are blessed with a large family and a beautiful farm,” said Myrna Bailey. “We have five children, nine grandchildren and 16 great grandchildren who have all played a role in keeping up the family farm.”The Bailey family continues to raise beef and has expanded the farm to grow grain and hay.  Century Farm Awards honour agricultural organizations that have been active for a century or longer, as well as pioneers whose farms and ranches have been in families for 100 years or more. Each Century Farm Award celebrates the rich heritage of farming and ranching families and organizations in B.C.Learn More:For more information about B.C.'s Century Farm program, visit: http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/agriculture-seafood/programs/century-farm-awards

Lee’s death on Wednesday, Feb. 19, left me, and many others, feeling a mix of sadness and appreciation for a life well lived.“Bob made a mark on Vancouver and on British Columbia as a whole. A self-made B.C. real estate leader, he rose to success from humble beginnings and spent a great deal of his time and energy giving back to the communities that meant so much to him.“The values Bob learned from his father set the course for his life: to care for family and community first. Bob’s life embodied this philosophy and many people have benefited from his generous spirit.“As I reflect on Bob’s contributions to British Columbia, I think about his remarkable philanthropy at the University of British Columbia and beyond, how he was awarded the Order of British Columbia, was named a business laureate of B.C. and was honoured with the Order of Canada. I hope that his tremendous contributions to our province will offer comfort to Bob’s loved ones as they mourn the loss of a great man.“On behalf of British Columbians, I offer my condolences to his family and friends. Bob will be missed, but his legacy will live on.”For a Chinese translation: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.02.21PJH_STM_RobertLee.pdf

Twenty B.C. farmers and food processors are receiving support from the federal and provincial governments to upgrade equipment that tracks animal and product movement.Traceability plays a significant role in protecting animal health, public health and food safety, and improves emergency planning and response.The equipment upgrades include software and e-tools that monitor, trace and automatically update databases to track when animals or products arrive and depart farms, or transit to processing and distribution centres.The 20 farms and businesses receiving funding produce, process and handle foods such as bell peppers, grapes, cherries, organic greens, pork, sheep, seafood, egg and meat products, as well as salad dressings, fruit juice, crepes, breads and pastries. These companies operate on the Lower Mainland and Vancouver Island, and in the Thompson-Okanagan and Kootenays.The new equipment will track individual animals or food products on their journey along the supply chain, from farm to table. If a problem occurs and product recalls are needed, this information can help limit economic, social and environmental impacts, protect brand reputation and maintain market access for businesses and the sector.Funding for these projects was provided through a new $313,500 allocation to traceability programs in November 2019. This increase brings the total program funding in B.C. to about $1.75 million since January 2018.The traceability programs were oversubscribed in 2019, and the new funding ensures that all B.C. farmers and ranchers whose applications met the requirements in previous intake periods will receive support. The next round of applications for the new funding is now open.Traceability programs are supported by the Canadian Agricultural Partnership, which is a federal-provincial-territorial initiative to strengthen the agriculture, agrifood and agri-based product sector.Quotes: Marie-Claude Bibeau, federal Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food –“The Government of Canada is pleased to see so many farmers and food processors take advantage of the funding available to improve their traceability systems. Support through this program helps to further strengthen food safety from farm to table, and maintain trust and confidence in Canadian food products, both at home and abroad.”  Lana Popham, B.C.’s Minister of Agriculture –“When emergencies happen on the farm, the effects can be devastating for both farmers and consumers. Helping farmers and ranchers update their technology to better trace their products as they move from farm to plate quickens responses when they are needed and supports B.C.’s resilient food supply.”  Learn More:For information on traceability programs, visit:

After years of respectful dialogue, the B.C government has partnered with the Saulteau and West Moberly First Nations and the federal government to achieve a historic agreement that strives to protect southern mountain caribou in northeastern B.C., while considering the social and economic well-being of communities and stakeholders in the region.“From the beginning, our government committed to protecting this iconic species,” said Doug Donaldson, B.C.’s Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “There’s no question that we’ve had to overcome some challenges along the way, but I am proud of how the parties persevered to find solutions. This agreement is a significant step forward.”Dozens of First Nations representatives and stakeholders gathered in Vancouver on Feb. 21, 2020, to celebrate the signing of the amended partnership agreement by the provincial government, the federal government, the West Moberly First Nations and the Saulteau First Nation.In recent weeks, the West Moberly First Nations and Saulteau First Nation offered amendments to the partnership agreement that provide more opportunities for local government involvement in caribou recovery work.The number of caribou in British Columbia has dropped over the last century from about 40,000 animals to about 15,000. Southern mountain caribou populations now total fewer than 3,100. The population of the central group of southern mountain caribou is about 230.The partnership agreement reflects a collaborative approach to caribou conservation, which:
complements the leadership role that the Saulteau First Nation and West Moberly First Nations have already taken on caribou recovery efforts in the Peace region;
includes a commitment to protect over 700,000 hectares of important caribou habitat in northeastern B.C.;
builds on the work that the parties have already undertaken in habitat restoration, maternal penning projects and predator management. Through these efforts, the decline of the central group has been reversed. The population is now growing at an average rate of 15% per year; and
takes into account the social and economic well-being of communities and stakeholders in the region.
Donaldson signed the agreement with:
Jonathan Wilkinson, federal Minister of Environment and Climate Change;
Chief Ken Cameron of the Saulteau First Nation;
Chief Roland Willson of the West Moberly First Nations;
George Heyman, B.C.’s Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy; and
Bruce Ralston, B.C.’s Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources.
Habitat disturbance, predation, climate change and human activities on the landscape have led to declines in caribou populations in recent decades. The B.C. government has been taking concrete steps to address those concerns and develop a comprehensive, made-in-B.C. approach to managing the species.Part of that approach is the Provincial Caribou Recovery Program. It ensures that Indigenous Nations, local governments, stakeholders and the natural resource sector can participate in the planning and implementation of caribou recovery measures. Ongoing engagement with stakeholders has helped guide recovery efforts for the central group, including a Leaders’ Table meeting held in November 2019 and a series of stakeholder committee meetings that were initiated in January 2020.The partnership agreement includes new language that clarifies B.C.’s commitment to involving local governments in caribou recovery. Collaboration with local governments and tenure holders will continue to support the effective implementation of the partnership agreement.The partnership agreement also reconfirms the 2,689-hectare Klin-se-za Provincial Park (pronounced ""Klin-see’-za"") will be expanded by about 30,800 hectares. The Province previously committed to a park expansion (Area B2) in 2015, as part of the Saulteau First Nation-British Columbia New Relationship and Reconciliation Agreement. The enlarged park will cover over 34,300 hectares and incorporate two mountains known locally as The Twin Sisters. The Twin Sisters area is considered to be a sacred place by Indigenous peoples in the region and elsewhere, and supports caribou recovery.The B.C. government will continue to work with the federal government, First Nations, local governments and communities on these initiatives, in accordance with the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act. The Province also acknowledges the desire of local residents, industry and other stakeholders to pursue their economic goals and participate in other activities on the land base.Quotes:Jonathan Wilkinson, federal Minister of Environment and Climate Change —“The conservation agreements announced today represent bold action to support the survival and recovery of the iconic southern mountain caribou in British Columbia. It has taken a lot of hard work to get us here today. I wish to thank and recognize the leadership of Saulteau and West Moberly First Nations for their continued advocacy and leadership in this agreement. I would also like to thank the Government of British Columbia for its partnership. Today’s agreements are an important step to ensuring that our kids and grandkids can continue to enjoy this species now and into the future.”Chief Ken Cameron, Saulteau First Nation —“This is a powerful moment in history, and it’s a turning point for B.C. and Canada and First Nations. People working together to save a species from extinction – it’s real and we can do this – our new partnership agreement confirms it. I want to invite all people to join with us, support us and help make it happen for the future generations to come. Many years ago, our ancestors were given a prophecy from the Creator. The prophecy says that we will find sanctuary at the Twin Sisters mountains. Our people have always kept faith with the prophecy, we know it to be true. It is so fitting that by protecting the Twin Sisters area here today, we can now also give sanctuary to our endangered caribou in the future.”Chief Roland Willson, West Moberly First Nations —“For thousands of years, the caribou have given us food, clothes and tools to survive harsh winters. They are not just animals to us. They are our brothers and sisters, our friends and our ancestors. The caribou have been suffering for decades as their habitat is destroyed piece by piece. They need us now — all of us. This partnership agreement gives us hope. It means that help is on the way. To my fellow elected representatives of the Peace region, I thank each of you that worked productively with us at the Leaders’ Table and during engagement on this agreement over the last year. Now, the real work begins. Several doors have been opened for you to participate. We look forward to this collaboration and to joint efforts dispelling myths, combating racism and promoting a region rich in wildlife, culture and sustainable economic activity.”George Heyman, B.C.’s Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy —“Protecting and promoting at-risk species requires everyone to collaborate in order to do the important work of restoring habitat and piloting new ways to support a return to healthy numbers. We committed several months ago to completing this partnership agreement while also ensuring respectful engagement with local governments. The Saulteau and West Moberly First Nations have demonstrated leadership by putting in practice new ways to address the decline in the caribou population in the South Peace.”Bruce Ralston, B.C.’s Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources —“Collaboration has been at the heart of this partnership agreement. It’s a perfect example of how government can work with its partners to consider both economic and environmental interests while balancing community needs with caribou recovery.”Quick Facts:
The decline of caribou populations in British Columbia is a complex problem that requires a thoughtful, inclusive process to stabilize populations and build a broadly supported Caribou recovery program.
Through the Provincial Caribou Recovery Program, the B.C. government has committed $47 million over five years to support caribou recovery, using a comprehensive, science-based approach.
These initiatives include herd planning (a collaborative approach involving Indigenous Nations, industry, stakeholders and governments), habitat management, protection and restoration, maternity penning programs, a supplemental feeding program, animal relocations, predator management and other measures.

The B.C. government has also provided $8.5 million to the Habitat Conservation Trust Fund to implement caribou habitat restoration programs.

Drivers are advised that work will soon begin to replace the temporary structure on Beaton Road with a permanent bridge, improving safety and reliability for people travelling through the area.A temporary crossing has been in place since flood waters from Cherry Creek washed out the road at this location, west of Kamloops, in spring 2018. The new one-lane bridge will include rock armouring designed to protect it from potential damage during future high-water events.The east end of Beaton Road will be fully closed to traffic beginning Monday, March 2, 2020. A detour will be in place for local traffic via Gardi Road and Buckhorn Drive.Due to the tight nature of the location, the temporary crossing could not be maintained while the new structure is being built. This full closure will expedite construction of the new bridge and reduce total costs.A digital message sign has been installed on Highway 1 to alert drivers of the forthcoming closure, which will be followed by standard signage once the detour is in place. Work is expected to be completed by April 30.This project is part of the Cherry Creek flood recovery work that also included new structures installed on Rodeo Drive and Greenstone Road in 2019. Those bridges replaced culverts washed out in the spring 2017 flooding.The ministry appreciates the patience of all drivers and residents in the area affected by the flooding and repair work.

766,2020-02-19 13:50:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020AG0011-000295,Government Website,Province to modernize arbitration rules to improve access to justice,"

Government has introduced a new arbitration act to modernize the province’s domestic arbitration system and improve how British Columbians can quickly and finally resolve their disputes outside court.“Arbitration is a valuable way for people to resolve disputes in private by agreeing to be bound by the decision of an independent and impartial arbitrator,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “The current legislation reflects practices dating back to the 19th century and hasn’t been significantly changed since the 1980s. This new act reflects current best practices for fair, efficient and final resolution options for British Columbians.” Key changes include new provisions about:
how arbitration proceedings can be started;
clarification around the duties of the arbitrators, parties and expert witnesses;
simpler and faster appeals; and
improved confidentiality.
The proposed new legislation builds on recommended changes from the Uniform Law Conference of Canada’s Uniform Arbitration Act and will better align with similar B.C. arbitration legislation that covers disputes of an international nature.  The British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre (soon to be known as the Vancouver International Arbitration Centre) maintains a unique and prominent position in the arbitration act as the “designated appointing authority.” It will be authorized to quickly appoint an arbitrator when the parties are unable to agree, and resolve fee disputes between parties and arbitrators.The changes will also move family arbitration provisions from the Arbitration Act to the Family Law Act, which already deals with various aspects of family disputes and encourages out-of-court resolution of matters in the best interests of families and children. Quick Facts:
B.C. has two arbitration statutes: a domestic act (the Arbitration Act) and an international act (the International Commercial Arbitration Act). Arbitration is international if the parties are based in different jurisdictions.
The guiding principles of B.C.’s arbitration statutes are based on the UN Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL Model Law), which says arbitration should be fair to both parties, arbitrators should be neutral and unbiased, and parties to an agreement should be held to their bargain.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in British Columbia:“Today, we are announcing the first individual confirmed to have COVID-19 in B.C. has recovered. This is indicated by the resolution of symptoms, followed by two successive negative test results 24 hours apart.“The four remaining B.C. patients with COVID-19 are recovering in isolation at home with support and monitoring from public-health teams. The fifth case identified on Friday, Feb. 14, 2020, was confirmed by the National Microbiology Laboratory on Saturday, Feb. 15.“Over the next few days, Health Canada will begin releasing repatriated Canadians from 14 days of quarantine in Trenton, Ont. Fourteen days is believed to be the longest incubation period for COVID-19. These individuals will no longer be required to self-isolate or take any additional precautionary measures, beyond those measures that help protect us from other respiratory illnesses at this time of year. “We are working closely with our federal and global health partners to monitor the developing situations related to Canadians aboard the Westerdam and Diamond Princess cruise ships. Those people returning to Canada on a repatriation flight from Japan will be quarantined in Cornwall, Ont., for 14 days.“Public-health teams in B.C. have connected with other returning travellers to assess and monitor them for symptoms. At this time, Westerdam travellers require 14 days of self-isolation at home.“Public-health teams continue to be active in the community, supporting those who have self-isolated, or may be concerned about symptoms to ensure they are being assessed, tested and cared for. These teams also undertake the important tasks of monitoring the four confirmed cases and providing daily symptom checks for close contacts who are self-isolating.“In addition, public-health teams actively investigate the travel history of confirmed cases and contact people at risk of exposure to ensure they are isolated, if needed, and monitored for symptoms.“The risk of this virus spreading within British Columbia remains low at this time. We are closely monitoring the situation as it evolves and will notify the public if the measures in B.C. change.”Learn More:For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/BG_Coronavirus_Recommendations_Feb19.pdfFor more information and latest updates on COVID-19, follow the BC Centre for Disease Control on Twitter @CDCofBC or visit the website: http://www.bccdc.ca/Chinese translations:Chinese translation -  joint statement: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.02.19COVID-19_CN.pdfChinese translation - For recommendations on protecting yourself and your community, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020.02.19COVID-Recommendations.pdf

Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development, has released the following statement in response to the B.C. Forestry Alliance Save the Working Forest rally on Feb. 18, 2020, at the Parliament Buildings:“I spoke with members of the B.C. Forestry Alliance today because I wanted to hear about their concerns. I told them that our government will support the thousands of people who rely on the forest sector for their jobs and livelihoods.“We will continue to work with the sector to address challenges and ensure a bright and sustainable future. This includes our hard work on our Coast Forest Sector Revitalization plan to make sure more logs are processed in our province and reducing wood waste by redirecting it to our pulp and paper mills.“On the Coast, we’ve committed $5 million in bridging loans to help contractors impacted by the labour dispute make payments for their logging equipment. This is after we provided $69 million to assist workers impacted by the downturn in the Interior.“We know there is a greater need, which is why we have been pressing the federal government to bring resources to the table, as they did during the 2008 downturn. I spoke with Seamus O’Regan, federal Minister of Natural Resources, last week and let him know that British Columbians believe that worker support is a shared responsibility.“The B.C. Forestry Alliance and others have made it clear to us that they are concerned about how old-growth forests are managed. That’s why we commissioned an independent, two-person panel to hear people’s perspectives on the economic, ecological and cultural importance of old-growth trees and forests. We expect to hear back from the panel later this spring.“Our government is dedicated to putting people first when it comes to how we manage our forests. That’s why we’ve made changes to ensure proper oversight to tenure agreement transfers. This is good for workers, communities and companies, large and small.“I appreciate the input I received today from members of the B.C. Forestry Alliance, and I can assure them that our government is more than willing to work with them to build a better future for B.C.’s forestry sector.”

Budget 2020 moves British Columbia forward by building the infrastructure the growing province needs, supporting thousands of new jobs, strengthening investments in health and education and making life more affordable for everyone.“From new roads, hospitals, housing, schools and child care centres to better, more affordable services in every community, we’re seeing fundamental changes that are making life better for British Columbians,” said Carole James, Minister of Finance. “Together, we’ve made a lot of progress and we can’t turn back. Budget 2020 keeps our province moving forward by focusing on people.”Building a stronger B.C.Budget 2020 makes new commitments to bring capital spending over three years to $22.9 billion – the highest level in B.C.’s history. Work is underway on new and upgraded hospitals and health facilities, highway and transit projects, schools and new housing throughout B.C. that is stimulating more than 100,000 direct and indirect jobs during construction.“British Columbians are working hard to build a better future for their family, and so are we. By building the infrastructure our growing province needs, we’re making life easier for people and creating good jobs and opportunities in local communities,” James said.A stronger B.C. means ensuring there are opportunities for everyone. Budget 2020 takes another step forward toward reconciliation with Indigenous peoples by affirming the historic 25-year revenue-sharing agreement that will see $3 billion of gaming revenues shared with all First Nations.New opportunities in a sustainable economyOver the next decade, more than 860,000 jobs will open up throughout British Columbia. More than 75% of all jobs will require some post-secondary education or training.Budget 2020 creates a new, needs-based BC Access Grant for students to make sure all British Columbians can tap into these opportunities, while growing B.C.’s skilled workforce. This grant will provide up to $4,000 to help with the up-front costs of tuition for more than 40,000 low- and middle-income students.“B.C.’s future is bright and filled with opportunity. With the new BC Access Grant, we’ll put a college or university education within reach for thousands more British Columbians,” James said. “These grants will make a difference for students, and they’ll help B.C. businesses find the skilled people they need.”The Province continues to support struggling forestry workers through access to job placement, skills training, equipment loans, grants for hard-hit communities and programs to support early retirement. Budget 2020 adds $13 million for new forestry revitalization efforts, including revving up B.C.’s bio-economy with innovations that convert wood into value-added products like biofuels, bioplastics and textiles.A clean environment is the foundation of a prosperous and sustainable economy. Budget 2020 accelerates the transition to a cleaner future with an additional $419 million over three years for CleanBC, on top of the approximately $900 million invested in Budget 2019. This funding includes incentives to buy electric vehicles (EV) and build EV charging stations. Additionally, this year’s budget increases support for industries moving toward clean, low-carbon solutions and projects to make B.C.’s schools, universities, colleges and hospitals more energy efficient.Making life more affordable and improving servicesB.C. is one of Canada’s fastest growing economies. But while the economy has grown, life has become too expensive for many families.The new BC Child Opportunity Benefit, launching in October 2020, will provide 290,000 families with more money to support their kids. Combined with B.C.’s Affordable Child Care Benefit and the Fee Reduction Initiative for licensed child care spaces, families with one child may save up to $20,000. Families with two children could save up to $28,000 each year.These savings come on the heels of a transformation at ICBC that will reduce fees by an average of 20%, or $400 a year for all drivers, while improving care benefits. It also marks the first full year of the elimination of medical services plan (MSP) premiums — the biggest middle-class tax cut in a generation.Budget 2020 strengthens the health, education and community services that all British Columbians depend on. The budget delivers an additional $339 million to strengthen B.C.’s K-12 education system — building on recent investments to upgrade schools and hire more than 4,200 new teachers.An additional $1 billion in Budget 2020 will improve health care in British Columbia. New or upgraded hospitals are on the way for 13 communities, and 12 new urgent and primary care centres are open. Two more are coming.A balanced planBudget 2020 is a balanced plan focused on the priorities of British Columbians.Budget 2020 creates a new tax bracket for the top 1% of income earners in British Columbia. Nearly half the revenue generated will come from individuals who make more than $1 million annually.“Today, we’re asking the people at the top, the highest 1% of individual income earners, to pay a little more and help B.C. provide families and communities with better services and stronger infrastructure,” James said.To help address the growing health costs and impacts of sweetened drinks, B.C. will begin charging provincial sales tax (PST) on sweetened carbonated beverages. This is a step that has been advocated for by health professionals and an all-party committee, as young people between the ages of 14 and 18 are the top consumers of pop.The Confidence and Supply Agreement with the BC Green Party caucus continues to provide the basis for a strong, stable government for British Columbia. By working together, progress continues to be made on shared priorities, like climate change, tackling the housing crisis and building a strong, diverse economy.Quick Facts:
The budget is balanced in all three years of the fiscal plan with surpluses of $227 million in 2020-21, $179 million in 2021-22, and $374 million in 2022-23.
Last year, B.C.’s economy was among the top of the provincial real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rankings, led the country with the lowest unemployment rate, and was among the leaders in employment growth across Canada.
British Columbia is projected to continue to be among the top of the provincial real GDP growth rankings in 2020 and 2021.
Between 2001 and 2019, B.C.’s population grew by nearly one million people, with much of the increase concentrated in the Lower Mainland. By 2024, B.C.’s population is expected to grow by approximately 346,000 people and by more than one million people in the next 15 years.

Scott Fraser, B.C.’s Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation, and Carolyn Bennett, federal Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations, have released the following statement.The two ministers met in Victoria on Feb. 17, 2020, to talk about finding a peaceful resolution to the blockades across the country and other issues arising from the concerns of Wet’suwet’en Hereditary Chiefs.“There is no doubt that the blockades and other events of the past several weeks have been, and continue to be, a significant challenge. We agree that dialogue is the best and preferred way to deal with these issues. We share a deep commitment to relationships with Indigenous peoples based on affirmation of rights, respect, co-operation and partnership. We acknowledge that this is a difficult time for Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples and are determined to work with all our partners to find the solutions.“We have reached out through a joint letter to the Wet’suwet’en Hereditary Chiefs about meeting with us at the earliest opportunity and are hopeful we can all work together to establish a process for ongoing and constructive dialogue and action to address the issues at hand.“Our primary focus is everyone’s safety and ultimately, a peaceful resolution to the situation.”

Beekeepers around the province will be able to apply for the fifth round of Bee BC funding soon, enabling them to launch creative projects in their communities that support the health of bees in British Columbia.“Bees have always been part of my life, and as I grew up my passion for them only grew stronger,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “Its amazing to see the unique and innovative ways communities are getting involved through Bee BC to help support the province’s bees and find solutions to keep them safe and healthy.”The next application intake begins Monday, Feb. 17, 2020, for regional and community-based organizations, beekeeping associations and beekeepers in B.C. Each project is eligible to receive up to $5,000 to fund projects enhancing bee health.Projects can range from providing education in communities and planting bee-specific forage, to using innovation and technology to help protect and ensure bee health in B.C. The last round of projects included:
electronic monitoring of hives to assess hive conditions that studied brood quantification, brood-pattern assessment and examining early signs of disease in Rosedale;
the construction of a “bee barn” to improve overwintering and colony survival in the Kootenays; and
engaging with youth-led citizen science, monitoring native wildflower lawns and reporting results to the public in the South Coast.
Since launching in 2018, Bee BC has contributed almost $178,000 to fund 42 projects through four rounds of funding. The last round allotted close to $55,000 for 13 projects. Bee BC is a four-year, $400,000 provincial program that makes $100,000 of these funds available to projects investing in bee health each fiscal year.The Bee BC program provides funding to smaller-scale, community-based projects that support the health of B.C.’s bees. The fund provides support to research, explore, field test and share information about best management practices associated with bee health. The Bee BC program is administered by the Investment Agriculture Foundation of BC on behalf of the Ministry of Agriculture.Quick Facts:
May 29, 2019, was proclaimed Day of the Honey Bee in B.C.
B.C. beekeepers were represented at the 46th Apimondia International Apiculture Congress in Montreal in fall 2019, thanks in part to $20,000 in provincial support.
Honeybees are an important part of B.C.’s agriculture sector as pollinators of crops, contributing an estimated $560 million to the provincial economy.
The 2016 total annual economic contribution of honeybee pollination for major insect-pollinated crops (additional harvest value) was estimated at $2.57 billion. (Source: Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada)
In 2018, B.C. beekeepers produced over 1,400 tonnes of honey, valued at $13.7 million in farm cash receipts. This represents an 11% increase over 2017 and 7.6% above the previous five-year average receipts.

A fourth year of helicopter logging in the Williams Lake area is expected to start next week to help minimize the spread of Douglas fir beetles on Crown land. These native forest pests normally attack small groups of trees, and a significant infestation can weaken and eventually kill a tree over a period of about one year. However, helicopter logging that selectively removes infested trees and protects other trees nearby, and related containment treatments, have helped to slow the spread of the beetles in the Williams Lake area over the past three years.These logging activities are being conducted under the direction of the Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. Monitoring of Douglas fir beetle infestations in previously treated areas has identified fewer trees currently under attack, so the helicopter-logging project has been expanded to new sites around Williams Lake.Helicopter-logging flights are expected to begin as early as Tuesday, Feb. 18, 2020, in the Chimney Valley area southwest of Williams Lake. Once work at that site is completed, operations will move to the Anderson Road area and then to sites on Fox Mountain. Heli-logging activities should be completed by mid-March 2020.Residents can expect to see helicopters in the air as selective logging operations get underway, but no flights will occur over residential buildings. The aircraft will be flying only during daylight hours.Owners of livestock and pets are advised to take precautions to protect their animals from injuring themselves. Horses in particular can be sensitive to helicopter noise and may run if startled.For safety reasons, members of the public should stay away from active harvesting areas. They are also reminded that unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) must not be operated anywhere near the harvesting areas, since doing so can endanger the safety of pilots and workers on the ground.In addition to the direct harvesting of infested trees, the Williams Lake Beetle Management Unit 2020 Treatment Plan includes the following activities:
The anti-aggregative pheromone methyl cyclo hexenone (MCH) will be used to prevent or disrupt Douglas fir beetle attacks on small infestation sites. This naturally occurring pheromone can successfully repel the beetles from vulnerable areas and also help protect small stands of trees near parks, protected areas, campgrounds, residential properties or old-growth management areas. In some cases, the application of this pheromone has reduced Douglas fir beetle attacks by over 90%.
“Trap trees” will be established by cutting down large, healthy Douglas fir trees in accessible areas. The trees will be left on the ground to attract adult beetles in the spring. Trap trees are more successful in attracting adult beetles than standing trees and therefore can greatly reduce the number of attacks on healthy Douglas fir trees nearby. Once adult beetles and larvae are established within a trap tree, it will be taken to a mill where the beetles and larvae will be destroyed in the milling process.
Where appropriate, and if no other practical options are available, some infested trees may be cut down and burned on site to destroy beetles that are in the bark.
Funnel traps will also be deployed within mill yards and log storage areas to capture adult beetles.
The Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development is committed to addressing the spread of Douglas fir beetles in the Cariboo-Chilcotin Natural Regional District and mitigating impacts on the mid-term timber supply, wildlife habitat, recreational opportunities and wildfire management.Quick Facts:
The Williams Lake Timber Supply Area (TSA) contains 3.24 million hectares of forest, with 1.83 million hectares considered to be available for timber harvesting.
Douglas fir beetle infestations tend to be cyclical. The last major outbreak in the Cariboo-Chilcotin Natural Regional District, prior to the current outbreak, peaked in 2008, covering about 68,550 hectares. The volume of timber killed by the Douglas fir beetle in the Williams Lake TSA that year was about 172,534 cubic metres.
The shallow tunnels etched into the underside of the bark of an infested tree, called “galleries,” are created by the beetle adults and larvae as they feed on the wood.
When Douglas fir beetles attack, the needles of affected trees change colour in stages. The rate of colour change is highly variable, but a pale green or yellow colour indicates that the tree has been attacked recently. Bright red needles generally indicate that the tree was attacked the previous year. Brown trees with sparse foliage generally indicate that the trees have been dead for two or three years. A grey tree has lost all its needles, and this colour usually indicates that the tree has been dead for more than two years.
According to the ministry’s latest mapping data (based on aerial surveys conducted in the summer of 2019), Douglas fir beetles affected 52,791 hectares within the Cariboo-Chilcotin Natural Resource District in 2019. About 50,254 hectares were affected in the same region in 2018, with 46,231 hectares affected in 2017.

Since she was young, Breland Athies always felt disconnected from her Métis culture.Growing up in a Christian household, she says there was a lot of intergenerational trauma passed down from her family, which surfaced as mental health and addiction challenges.She remembered hearing her friends talk about their family crests and realized she didn’t know where she came from. Athies says as she grew up, she struggled with anxiety and depression in high school and university, in part because she didn’t know much about her background.For Athies, now 27, her anxiety was hard to talk about. “If you have a diagnosis of something, you’re seen as ‘crazy.’ I was lucky, I had groups to go to and talk about these things. It’s a way to normalize those feelings and acknowledge it’s a shared experience for teens and humans in general. That made me feel better — growing up and realizing (anxiety) is a human experience.”Since then, Athies has reconnected to her Métis culture, which has provided her an immense sense of belonging and helped reduce her anxiety.Learning to cope with anxiety is a strategy she hoped to pass along to others as a program facilitator with the YMCA’s Teen Mind Medicine program. The Teen Mind Medicine pilot project, with $300,000 in funding from the Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions, supports Indigenous teens ages 13 to 19 who are experiencing stress, worry and mild to moderate anxiety.As part of the program, trained community members such as Athies teach teens strategies and practical tools to cope with anxiety and provide a safe space for young people to connect with one another and share experiences.The YMCA worked in partnership with 13 Indigenous community partners to deliver the Teen Mind Medicine program to roughly 100 teens around the province in fall 2019.Athies helped facilitate the program in Trail, in partnership with the Circle of Indigenous Nations Society, which brought together teens from two local high schools once a week. Not only did the program teach students strategies to cope with anxiety, it included a cultural component.Each session started with a blessing and smudge from an Elder, drumming a traditional song and a check in with a talking stick to see how everyone was feeling that day. Common themes that emerged were the impacts of colonization, the disconnect many teens felt from their culture and how it impacted their anxiety.Athies says after talking about their issues, she saw a difference in the 15 participants. Students were nervous in the beginning. They were unsure of what to expect, but by the end of the six-week program, many were grateful to learn how to put a name to their emotions and reconnect to their Indigenous cultures.“Anxiety is such a big issue for teens these days, especially in the age of technology where everyone is looking at their screens,” Athies says. “This was a good chance to increase socialization and notice that anxiety is normal. It was really important for those kids to take time out of their day to check in with their emotions in a group so that they’re not holding it in.”Learn More: For more information about programs offered at the YMCA to deal with anxiety, visit: https://gv.ymca.ca/Programs/Health-Management/Teen-Mindfulness-Group

People living and working in long-term care homes throughout B.C. are benefiting from a $6.9-million grant to purchase new equipment that will help improve the safety and quality of life of residents.“Dignity, comfort, and security are what people and their loved ones expect and deserve when they are in long-term care,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “Government is investing in these long-term care homes by adding new and replacement items, like beds and mattresses, and ceiling lifts and sensory rooms, so people can feel comfortable in their surroundings and enjoy their home-like setting.”The Seniors Safety and Quality Improvement Program (SSQIP) is a three-year program that is managed by the BC Care Providers Association (BCCPA). BCCPA has provided funding to long-term care home operators for the purchase of new equipment.A total of $10 million was provided over three years to 186 long-term care homes to buy over 8,000 new items: beds and mattresses, shower chairs and tubs, mobility equipment – such as floor and ceiling lifts – lighting and visual aids, sensory rooms, music therapy and ergonomic furniture. The furniture includes specialized chairs and tables.An advisory group, which included representatives from the provincial government, BCCPA, Denominational Health Association and SafeCare BC, received applications and oversees funding allocation. Those approved received up to $500 per publicly funded bed to purchase equipment that enhances the safety and quality of life of seniors.“Our government is committed to improving care for seniors,” said Ronna-Rae Leonard, Parliamentary Secretary for Seniors. “The new equipment has helped ensure that their care is provided safely — for the people who live in long-term care, the families who visit them and the staff who care for them.”Daniel Fontaine, CEO of BCCPA, said, “We’re pleased to continue working with the Ministry of Health and other partners through this final round of SSQIP funding. The investments are aimed at creating more supportive environments for residents in long-term care and reducing injury rates among the workers who care for them.”Long-term care provides 24-hour professional care and supervision in a protective, supportive environment for people with complex care needs, who can no longer be cared for in their own homes or in an assisted-living residence.Government is investing more than $1 billion over three years to improve care for seniors, including investments in primary care, home health, long-term care, assisted living and respite services.The Province is also providing $240 million over three years to increase staffing levels in long-term care homes, with the goal of achieving the target 3.36 direct care hours per resident day – on average – across all health authorities by the end of 2020-21.

The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure is actively working to reduce traffic congestion in the Capital Regional District (CRD) through investments in infrastructure and public transit.A number of projects to improve efficiency and capacity are underway. The B.C. government will continue to identify and prioritize solutions to support these growing communities moving forward.South Island Transportation StrategyA study to determine long-term solutions for getting people moving more efficiently throughout south Vancouver Island is underway.The South Island Transportation Strategy will look to identify improvement options for transit, cycling, pedestrian movements, ferry services, rail and existing roads and the connections between them. The study area will go as far north as the Duncan area and as far west as the Sooke area. It will look at current transportation demands and develop a roadmap for future investments across all modes of travel. The study will be completed in spring 2020 and will identify specific transportation investment opportunities in the South Island region.Priority bus lanesPriority bus lanes along the Trans-Canada Highway are an efficient solution to gridlock in the CRD, which is why the Province has committed to accelerating work in this area. The Douglas Street/Highway 1 corridor currently supports as many as 1,700 vehicles per hour during peak travel times. At the same time, BC Transit transports 40% of people travelling this route during peak hours, while only making up 3% of the traffic. The ministry’s goal is to keep increasing the number of people who choose transit to help cut the congestion.Bus lane projects:
Southbound Burnside Bridge to Tolmie Avenue – completion in spring 2020 (Province of B.C.)
McKenzie Interchange (includes bus lanes) – completion in summer 2020 (Province of B.C.)
Northbound Tolmie Avenue to Burnside Bridge – completed in 2018 (Province of B.C.)
Southbound Tolmie Avenue to Hillside Avenue – completed in 2018 (City of Victoria)
Northbound Fisgard Street to Tolmie Avenue – completed in 2015 (City of Victoria)
Southbound Hillside Avenue to Fisgard Street – completed in 2014 (City of Victoria)
MalahatThe ministry wrapped up the $34-million Malahat Village Safety Improvement project in the fall of 2018, which included expanding five kilometres to four lanes, installing three kilometres of median barrier and improving highway access through a frontage road system. 65% of the highway is now protected with a median barrier, with more safety upgrades being explored.Work is underway to widen Highway 1 to four lanes between Leigh Road and the Westshore Parkway. This $14-million project will improve safety at the southern gateway to the Malahat.McKenzie InterchangeThe $96-million McKenzie Interchange is being built to reduce congestion and improve safety for drivers, transit users, pedestrians and cyclists along one of the busiest corridors in B.C. Fixing this bottleneck area along Highway 1 will save drivers an estimated 20 minutes in each direction, allowing families to spend more time together and less time stuck in traffic.In addition to a new interchange, the project includes bus priority lanes in both directions, new fully accessible, well-lit bus stops, improved pedestrian connections and widening of the Galloping Goose Trail with an overpass over McKenzie and a new bridge for pedestrians and cyclists over the highway.The traffic lights on Highway 1 were removed in December 2019 to allow traffic to flow freely on the highway. The entire project, including the loop ramp, landscaping and transit facilities, is expected to be completed by summer 2020.Highway 17/Keating Cross Road FlyoverThe project involves a new “flyover” overpass from the Pat Bay Highway (Highway 17) northbound to Keating Cross Road westbound, eliminating the left turn across highway traffic onto Keating Cross Road. The project will also include a realigned southbound on-ramp to Victoria.The initial project estimate is $44.3 million, with contributions from the Government of Canada, Province of B.C. and District of Central Saanich.Highway 14In January 2018, the B.C. government announced major upgrades to the Highway 14 corridor to improve safety and reduce congestion. The $10-million investment includes three new bus pull-outs on both sides of Highway 14 at the West Shore Parkway, Laidlaw Road and Harbourview Road, a slow-moving vehicle pullout east of Muir Creek, a new two-lane bridge on Gillespie Road (which is an important alternative route to Highway 14) and a new rest area at the Sombrio lookout.A new bus-queue jump lane at Jacklin Road and safety upgrades to the Sooke River Road intersection were completed in June 2019.In April 2019, the B.C. government announced the widening and realignment of approximately 1.5 kilometres of Highway 14 between Glinz Lake Road and Connie Road, a new park and ride on Gillespie Road, and shoulder widening between Otter Point Road and Woodhaven Road. Public consultation took place in late 2019/early 2020, with construction to begin in summer 2020.Island Rail (formerly E&N Rail) CorridorIn December 2018, the ministry led a historic roundtable meeting, bringing together the Premier, First Nations, local decision makers and the Island Corridor Foundation to openly discuss the future of the Island Rail corridor. This discussion marked a progressive step forward in ensuring that major stakeholders along the corridor have their voices heard.The ministry is currently completing a condition assessment to evaluation the condition of the Island Rail Corridor, as well as the costs to bring the corridor up to current standards.In addition, through its work on the South Island Transportation Strategy, the Province continues to evaluate options for the Island Rail Corridor, considering what will best meet the needs of local communities, First Nations and people in the region.

Premier John Horgan; Melanie Mark, MLA for Vancouver-Mount Pleasant; Mitzi Dean, Parliamentary Secretary for Gender Equity; and Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation, have issued the following statement to acknowledge the annual Women’s Memorial March for murdered and missing women and girls in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside:“Today, like every Feb. 14 for the last 29 years, families, survivors and allies will gather in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside for the Women’s Memorial March for murdered and missing women and girls. It takes place on the territories of the Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh First Nations.“The march honours the beloved daughters, sisters, mothers, aunties and friends whose lives were stolen by violence. It is also a tribute to the strength and determination of those, led by Indigenous women, elders, families and community members, who have been powerful activists to end violence against Indigenous women and girls. It is these grassroots advocates who have been first in line to hold authorities to account in the fight for justice to keep women and girls safe.“Ensuring the safety of Indigenous women requires listening to, and working with, Indigenous women. Our government is committed to doing just that. We need to improve the safety of Indigenous women and girls by addressing and educating people about the underlying causes of systemic violence and racism that lead to their victimization at home, in the workplace and in industry, including addressing the social effects of industrial work camps. Together, we must continue to raise awareness that gender-based violence has no place in our lives.“Today’s memorial march includes a private ceremony where friends and family share memories of the women whose lives were stolen. As the march progresses through the Downtown Eastside, stops are made where women or girls were last seen or where they were murdered. These women are not statistics – they are people, who are loved, and whose loss leaves a wound in those they left behind.“Today, let us join in remembering them, and resolve to work together toward a future in which Indigenous women, girls and two-spirit and gender-diverse people feel safe, secure and equal in every community in this province.”

To better understand local issues to help municipalities and local organizations best support people experiencing or at risk of homelessness, government is conducting a second provincial homeless count.The Province is partnering with the Homelessness Services Association of BC (HSABC) and BC Housing to complete 16 community counts throughout the province in March and April. Government has provided $900,000 to support the community counts, pilot an extended count in two communities and support additional research on homelessness among Indigenous peoples.Data from the counts will provide a better understanding of homelessness in British Columbia. This information will be used to improve supports and services, measure progress in addressing homelessness and increase public awareness.“Homelessness in B.C. continues to be a struggle for people, and the barriers that they face vary in different communities,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “Our second provincial homeless count is a way that, together, we can get a clearer understanding of what homelessness looks like in order to better support some of the most vulnerable people in B.C.”The homeless counts give government a better sense of the complex challenges that people are facing. This initiative is part of informing the Province’s actions to tackle homelessness in B.C., as outlined in the Province’s first poverty reduction strategy, TogetherBC. The strategy, released in 2019, outlines programs and policies across government that will lift people out of poverty by removing barriers, creating social inclusion and continuing to focus on reconciliation.The Province will use new and complementary methods in 2020. Two communities, Cranbrook and Port Alberni, will pilot extended, multi-day counts to provide information on people who may be missed in a one-day count. Government will work with Indigenous partners to highlight Indigenous perspectives of homelessness and create effective strategies for addressing and preventing homlessness among Indigenous peoples.“HSABC is working with our members and partners in participating communities to implement the 2020 homeless counts,” said Stephen D’Souza, executive director, HSABC. “It is the work of these local organizations that ensures the counts are a success. Across the province, there are teams of volunteers helping conduct the count and hosting community events for people to count themselves in.“We are still seeking volunteers to help with the homeless counts. This is a great opportunity for you to get involved with organizations working to help those in need in your community.”Addressing poverty and homelessness are shared priorities between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and are part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:
Organizations are recruiting volunteers to support local homeless counts.
The report from the 2018 homeless count stated that at least 7,655 people were experiencing homelessness.
Indigenous peoples and former youth in care are significantly over-represented in the homeless population.

Proposed amendments that clarify and update the Motor Vehicle Act have been introduced as Bill 2, the motor vehicle amendment act, 2020.Proposed changes to the Motor Vehicle Act support road safety and better trained drivers by enabling government to require standardized training as a pre-licensing requirement for various classes of drivers’ licences. Amendments would require any prescribed training courses to be approved by the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) and provided by a person or organization authorized by ICBC.The proposed amendments afford government the authority to provide exemptions and to delegate authority to ICBC to provide exemptions. They also delegate to ICBC the authority to determine if training received in other jurisdictions meets B.C. standards.The proposed amendments also include various minor clarifications in the Motor Vehicle Act that respond to requests from road safety stakeholders. Notably, if passed, changes will include adding sheriff vehicles under the definition of emergency vehicle and enabling sheriffs to activate emergency lights and proceed through red lights in certain circumstances – for example, when a prisoner is in medical distress.As well, the changes will clarify residency requirements that entitle a person to hold a B.C. driver’s licence and allow ICBC to extend driving privileges during a state of emergency to people whose licences are expiring or have just expired.

Students at Campus View Elementary in the Greater Victoria School District can better focus on their studies, knowing their school is seismically safe, thanks to recent upgrades.“The safety of our students matters, and that’s why I’m thrilled the students at Campus View Elementary are now learning and playing in a seismically safer school,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “We have moved quickly as a government to prioritize safety investments in schools, giving families and communities greater piece of mind that children are protected in the event of an earthquake.”Campus View’s 440 students were able to remain in their school throughout the $2.4-million seismic upgrades.“Keeping our students and staff safe is always our first priority,” said Jordan Watters, chair, Greater Victoria School Board. ""The Greater Victoria School District has a very ambitious seismic mitigation program, so we’re pleased to see the completion of another seismic upgrade in our school district. Preparing for potential earthquakes is a reality of living in the Cascadia subduction zone, and every step we take toward ensuring safety and preparedness for our learning community is one worth celebrating.” Seismic upgrades, with a combined value of $104.6 million, have been approved for five schools in Greater Victoria in the last two years. Students will be better protected in the event of an earthquake once work is complete. This work includes:
Campus View Elementary;
Keating Elementary (plus a 100-seat expansion);
Braefoot Elementary;
Children’s Development Centre; and
Victoria High (plus a 200-seat expansion).
“The families at Campus View are thankful to the ministry for undertaking the seismic upgrades required to keep our students and staff safe in the event of an earthquake,” said Karen Watson, president, Campus View Parent Advisory Council. “We appreciate that the government is working toward providing a seismically safer place for all students to learn.”There are more investments to come, as the Province remains committed to accelerating the Seismic Mitigation Program. This is possible through a record $2.7-billion budget for school capital investments, including $791 million for seismic upgrades at high-risk schools throughout British Columbia.Since September 2017, the Province has announced more than $1.8 billion in school capital funding. This funding includes nearly $930 million for seismic upgrades at 41 B.C. schools, creating nearly 25,000 safer student spaces.Learn More:Learn more about the Seismic Mitigation Program:

More people with Parkinson’s are benefiting from treatment with deep brain stimulation (DBS), a program developed to help people whose symptoms can no longer be controlled with medication.On Feb. 5, 2019, government announced improved access to DBS for people with Parkinson’s disease through establishing and expanding a provincial program with a five-point plan that the Ministry of Health developed with Vancouver Coastal Health to address wait times.“Since we first introduced our action plan in 2019, there has been significant progress and the Province has doubled the number of primary insertion DBS surgeries,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “When I first became minister of health, the number of surgeries performed was 31. I’m proud to report that we are on track to achieve Vancouver Coastal Health’s target of 72 primary insertions for fiscal year 2019-20, up from the existing 36, which will represent a 125% increase over the previous fiscal year. We’ve also reduced wait times by 13 weeks in the first year. The number of patients on the wait-list has dropped and will continue to drop with more progress to come. This is excellent news for those with Parkinson’s disease.”Dr. Gary Redekop, head of neurosurgery, Vancouver Coastal Health, said, “People throughout B.C. with Parkinson’s disease have already benefited from expanded access to deep brain stimulation procedures. We are committed to continue to support the health, wellness and active lifestyles of our patients, and with these expanded services, we are seeing more people with Parkinson’s disease accessing this life-changing surgery.”The plan used public health-care system solutions to increase the number of procedures by 100%. Beginning April 1, 2019, this program began maintaining a centralized wait-list and increased operating room time for DBS procedures. This plan has addressed wait times for almost all DBS patients, with the number of patients waiting for DBS and their average wait time decreasing between January 2019 and January 2020 from 74 patients waiting 53 weeks to 39 patients waiting 40 weeks.DBS is a highly specialized procedure, with few clinicians across the country trained to perform it. In British Columbia, DBS patients receive care at Vancouver acute sites and from one surgeon located at Vancouver General Hospital. DBS uses electrical impulses to stimulate a target area in the brain. The stimulation affects movement by altering the activity in that area of the brain. The procedure does not destroy any brain tissue, and stimulation can be changed or stopped at any time. Surgery is required to implant the equipment that produces the electrical stimulation.The formal establishment and expansion of the provincial DBS program is in addition to the government’s surgical strategy to increase surgical volumes through targeted investment and maximizing best practices and efficiencies. The surgical strategy is supported with ongoing targeted funding of $75 million in 2018-19, increased to $100 million in 2019-20.Quick Facts:
Parkinson’s is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. Symptoms may include tremors, stiff muscles, slow movement and/or problems with balance or walking.
Patients are typically eligible when medications to control motor function are ineffective.
Benefits of DBS can include fewer tremors, improved facial expression and reductions in medication.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, British Columbia's provincial health officer (PHO), have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in British Columbia:“On Tuesday, Jan. 27, 2020, we confirmed that our BC Centre for Disease Control public health lab had identified a positive test for 2019-nCoV. Following this, samples were sent to the National Medical Laboratory in Winnipeg for additional testing. On Wednesday, Jan. 28, Dr. Henry confirmed that those tests returned positive for 2019-nCoV. As of today, B.C. continues to have only one confirmed case.”“In our statements, we committed to regularly provide the public with the number of cases tested each Friday. Going forward, the public are invited to visit the BC Centre for Disease Control’s website for an updated testing number each Friday.“As of today, we have tested 114 samples for 2019-nCoV, with one positive. Please note that there are more samples tested than patients, as some patients have had more than one sample tested.“We want to reassure people that the risk of this virus spreading within British Columbia remains low at this time. All necessary precautions are being taken to prevent the spread of infection. We have multiple systems in place to prepare for, detect and respond to prevent the spread of serious infectious diseases in the province.“It is not necessary for the general public to take special precautions beyond the usual measures recommended to prevent other common respiratory viruses during winter. Regular handwashing, coughing or sneezing into your elbow sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately and avoiding contact with sick people are important ways to prevent the spread of respiratory illnesses, generally.“Anyone who is concerned that they may have been exposed to, or are experiencing symptoms of, the coronavirus should contact their primary care provider, local public health office, or call 811.

Le premier ministre John Horgan a publié la déclaration suivante à propos des manifestations ayant eu lieu devant les édifices du Parlement à Victoria et dans certaines collectivités à travers la Colombie-Britannique :« Les résidents de la Colombie-Britannique ont le droit d’organiser des manifestations pacifiques. Nous appuyons les personnes dans l’exercice de leurs droits démocratiques – dans le respect de la loi.Cela dit, je comprends la frustration de nos concitoyens qui, aujourd’hui, n’ont pas pu se rendre au travail, pénétrer dans les édifices gouvernementaux ou se déplacer dans leurs collectivités.Mon gouvernement, représenté par Scott Fraser, ministre des Relations avec les Autochtones et de la Réconciliation, a participé à des rencontres d’urgence pendant deux jours, en février, pour tenter de trouver une solution pacifique à l’impasse concernant le projet de gazoduc de Coastal GasLink. Les pourparlers n’ont malheureusement pas abouti.Mon gouvernement reste ouvert au dialogue avec les chefs héréditaires Wet’suwet’en dans le cadre de pourparlers à la table Wiggus. Nous participons également à des échanges continus sur la réconciliation, axés sur les droits, les titres, l’autonomie gouvernementale et l’autodétermination. Ces voies de communication restent ouvertes.Ces événements nous montrent pourquoi nous aspirons tous à une réconciliation véritable avec les peuples autochtones et en quoi elle est cruciale pour notre province et notre pays. Il s’agit là d’un engagement que mon gouvernement a pris de bonne foi il y a deux ans et demi et, en tant que premier ministre, j’entends mener cette mission à terme.L’assemblée législative a voté à l’unanimité en faveur de l’adoption de la Loi relative à la Déclaration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones (Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act). Notre travail ne s’achève pas à cette étape – il ne fait que commencer.La réconciliation est une lourde tâche. Ni son début ni sa fin ne sont déterminés par une décision, un événement ou un moment unique. Aucun d’entre nous ne décide de la forme que peut ou doit prendre la réconciliation. Elle constitue un parcours commun où nous cheminons ensemble.Nous savons que ce ne sera pas de tout repos. Si nous voulons y parvenir, nous devons rester engagés dans ce processus, continuer de nous consulter les uns les autres et trouver un terrain d’entente.Dans notre démarche vers un plan d’action en collaboration découlant de l’adoption unanime de la Loi relative à la Déclaration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones, je suis convaincu qu’ensemble, nous obtiendrons les résultats escomptés. »

Today’s speech from the throne marks the positive changes people across B.C. are starting to see through stronger public services, policies that are making life more affordable, and the opportunities a strong, sustainable economy can provide for everyone.“British Columbians are starting to see the benefits of a government that puts people first,” said Premier John Horgan. “After years of falling behind, people are starting to make progress – but we’re not done yet. Today’s throne speech shows how our government is going to keep B.C. moving forward and build a stronger province for everyone.”Government is continuing with its plan to address the housing crisis by building homes for people and cracking down on speculation and fraud. Two years after the launch of Homes for B.C., 23,000 new affordable homes are underway or complete. This year, government will keep building more affordable housing for people, and will also give renters more security and protections against unfair or illegal renovictions. A public inquiry into money laundering will make sure B.C.’s economy is working for people, not organized crime.For a long time, B.C. families have struggled to find affordable child care. Two years ago, government put B.C. on the path to universal child care. Government cut fees and brought in the Affordable Child Care Benefit, saving parents $320 million so far. More than 10,000 new child care spaces have been funded in two years. This year, government will continue progress by creating more child care spaces, training more early childhood educators and partnering with school districts to create more before- and after-school care.In less than three years, the B.C. government has moved on 13 hospital projects and opened 12 urgent and primary care centres with two more on the way.Improvements to Fair PharmaCare have made prescription drugs more affordable. Wait times for hip and knee surgeries are down and the number of MRI exams are up. And seniors in long-term care are getting more direct hours of support. In the year ahead, government will keep working to deliver better, faster health care.Reconciliation with Indigenous peoples remains an important cross-government priority. In two years, government has made significant investments in priorities identified with Indigenous peoples, including long-term revenue sharing, language revitalization, funding for Aboriginal friendship centres, culturally appropriate health care and mental-health supports, and Indigenous housing on- and off-reserve. Building on the legislature’s unanimous passage of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act, the next step is an action plan, which government will develop in consultation and co-operation with Indigenous peoples.CleanBC is a critical part of this government’s strategy to grow a sustainable economy that works for people. As CleanBC enters its second year, B.C. will keep working to reduce emissions and grow opportunities in B.C.’s technology and innovation sectors. This year, B.C. will release a climate adaptation strategy to make sure communities are ready for changes in weather and other climate impacts, and an action plan to reduce plastic pollution and keep it out of B.C. landfills and waterways.Investments in technology and innovation are transforming B.C.’s economy across all sectors. This year, government will work with business to promote B.C. industries as competitive suppliers of low-carbon products. Technology and innovation are combining with B.C.’s long-standing strengths in natural resources to help ensure a resilient, sustainable economy that creates good jobs and opportunities for people. Government continues to support forestry workers and communities as the industry transitions, and is bringing industry, workers, local governments and First Nations together to find local solutions to help the industry stay competitive. Forestry, mining, agriculture and energy continue to generate good jobs for people. These industries will play a leading role in supporting innovation that helps B.C. achieve its economic, climate and reconciliation goals.B.C. remains an economic leader in Canada, with the lowest unemployment rate for two years running, and high business optimism. Government will continue to grow a strong, sustainable economy by investing in people and the services they count on, promoting a competitive business environment, and moving forward on its commitments on climate action and reconciliation.“British Columbians are more prepared to face the challenges of today and tomorrow, because they have a government that is a partner in their future,” Premier Horgan said. “We’re going to continue the work we started two and a half years ago, to make life better for people, so that B.C. can once again be a place of hope and opportunity – a stronger province, for everyone.”Government is making progress on the shared priorities outlined in the Confidence and Supply Agreement, with the BC Green Party caucus.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in British Columbia:“B.C. continues to have only four confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV. All four cases are in stable condition and are recovering in isolation at home. All close contacts of these cases are being followed closely by public health officials and remain asymptomatic.“On Tuesday, Feb. 4, the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) public health lab identified the second presumed positive test for 2019-nCoV in British Columbia. On Thursday, Feb. 6, two additional presumed positive cases were identified in the same household. Samples were sent to the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg for additional testing. Those results returned positive for 2019-nCoV, bringing the total number of cases confirmed by the NML in B.C. to four.“As of Feb. 7, BCCDC has tested a total of 371 samples for 2019-nCoV. The testing numbers are posted each Friday on the BCCDC website. In B.C., we have selected testing criteria with an intentionally low threshold to ensure a wide range of people are eligible for 2019-nCoV testing.“The second Canadian-operated repatriation flight carrying returning Canadians from Wuhan, China, arrived at the Vancouver International Airport late on Monday, Feb 10. The aircraft refuelled and proceeded to Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Trenton in Ontario. No crew members or passengers remained in B.C.“The returning Canadians will spend 14 days at CFB Trenton, which is the 2019-nCoV maximum incubation period, so they can be assessed and monitored, and to support their transition back to Canada.“We want to reassure people that the risk of this virus spreading within B.C. remains low at this time. We are watching the evolution of the outbreak in China closely and will notify the public if the measures we need to take in B.C. change.“Now is the time for tolerance. We call on all British Columbians to come together as a community to help one another. In this time of uncertainty, this is not only the right response, but the necessary one. Fear obstructs the important work of our public health officials to protect the health and safety of British Columbians.“Together with our federal and provincial partners, we ask people who have recently visited, or who have been in close contact with, someone who has recently visited the Hubei province in China to call public health officials and self-isolate for 14 days.“The most important measures to prevent all respiratory illnesses, including 2019-nCoV, remain cleaning your hands regularly, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately and staying home and away from others if you become sick. “Anyone who is concerned they may have been exposed to, or are experiencing symptoms of, 2019-nCoV should contact their primary care provider, local public health office or call 811.

Michelle Mungall, Minister of Jobs, Economic Development and Competitiveness; Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training; and Mitzi Dean, Parliamentary Secretary for Gender Equity; have issued the following joint statement on International Day of Women and Girls in Science:“Today, we join voices around the world to recognize International Day of Women and Girls in Science – a day that promotes full and equal access to participation in science for women and girls.“Gender equity has been a priority for our government since our very first days. We stand together to acknowledge the immense contribution that women continue to make to science and other fields like technology, engineering and mathematics. We pledge to do all that we can to remove the barriers that hold girls and women back from participating fully in these fields.“We know that gender equity supports a strong, inclusive economy. That is why we are taking real steps to make life more affordable, improve the services people count on and build that strong, inclusive economy. For example, our investments in child care, the largest in B.C.’s history, will help parents, especially women, raise families while pursuing their careers.“The pathway to inclusion is supported through education. Our government is investing in the futures of girls and women through scholarships and co-op opportunities, and through projects that look at how best to attract, retain and support the career advancement of equity-seeking groups, including women in tech-related sectors. These investments will inspire a new generation of women to consider science and technology-based professions.“Let’s all work together to bridge the gender gap and open doors to a future free of any inequalities.

In the past 15 months, the Province has supported the fastest creation of licensed child care spaces in B.C.’s history.Government has provided funding for more than 10,400 new spaces through its three space-creation initiatives – the Childcare BC New Spaces Fund, Start-Up Grants and neighbourhood learning centres – with thousands more to come.Due to the success of the biggest of these programs, the Childcare BC New Spaces Fund, the Province is updating guidelines and sharing best practices with applicants to better support projects in communities with an acute need for new child care spaces.Starting Feb. 10, 2020, the Childcare BC New Spaces Fund will accept applications through two application windows. The first of these will open Feb. 10 and end May 11, 2020. Successful applicants will be notified by August 2020. A second application window is scheduled to open in November 2020, ending Feb. 10, 2021.This approach enables the Province to compare applications over a set timeframe. This will allow funding to be targeted to organizations and communities best able to meet child care shortages in their areas and to prioritize applications that create child care spaces that will remain community assets for the long term. As well, communities that have recently completed child care needs assessments will have more time to develop targeted applications based on what they have learned.In addition, to ensure funding is being used for new licensed child care spaces in as many communities as possible, and based on best practices identified through the 15 months of the program, the Province will prioritize projects with a cost per space of $40,000 or less.Applicants will be required to demonstrate:
the link between their proposed project and the need within their community;
reference to a community child care plan or needs assessment, such as those created through the Union of British Columbia Municipalities’ Community Child Care Planning Grant program; and
that any necessary professional, administrative and consulting services total no more than 15% of the total provincially funded project cost.

The contract for the Pattullo Bridge replacement has been awarded, creating good jobs and training opportunities for workers who will help build the toll-free crossing to better connect communities in the Lower Mainland.“People in the Lower Mainland depend on the Pattullo Bridge every day, and they deserve safe, easy, toll-free commutes,” said Premier John Horgan. “The current bridge has needed to be replaced for years, and I’m proud our government is getting it done in a way that benefits the local community with good jobs and training opportunities. This is all part of our work to keep people and goods moving as we build a strong, sustainable B.C.”The nearly $1.4-billion Pattullo Bridge Replacement Project is being delivered under the Province’s Community Benefits Agreement (CBA), which prioritizes hiring local workers, including Indigenous peoples, women, people with disabilities and other under-represented groups who are qualified to do the work, in a safe, welcoming work environment. This project will help diversify and grow B.C.’s skilled workforce by providing opportunities for Red Seal apprentices to work on site and gain the experience they need to launch good careers in the trades.“The Pattullo Bridge is a critical crossing for residents and commercial truck drivers,” said Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “With today’s milestone announcement, we’re one step closer to a safer, more efficient crossing that will benefit thousands of people every day. What’s also great about this project is that it will – using the Community Benefits Agreement – provide jobs for local people, increase work experience opportunities for apprentices and help mobilize a strong construction workforce for British Columbia.”The four-lane bridge will have wider lanes and better connections into Surrey and New Westminster, improving ease of travel on this corridor for locals and commercial vehicles. The design includes dedicated pedestrian and cyclist lanes, separated from traffic, that will improve safety for all road users and encourage active transportation options. The bridge will be built to allow for potential future expansion to six lanes. Construction will begin in the coming months. The new bridge is scheduled to open in fall 2023.“Women in the trades have been under-represented for decades, and so I am excited that Indigenous peoples, women and other equity-seeking groups will be seen as assets to this project,” said Danielle Shaw, a recently journeyed welder from Ironworkers Local 97. “Priority apprentice hiring on a job like the Pattullo Bridge Replacement project ensures that under-represented groups have more access to these living-wage careers.

A renewed provincial council will advise government and track progress on CleanBC initiatives to reduce pollution and create new opportunities for people around the province.Members of the Climate Solutions Council were announced by George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, at GLOBE 2020 – a sustainable business and innovation summit focused on climate action.“As part of our commitment to action and accountability on climate change, this new group of independent advisors will strengthen our CleanBC plan to build a cleaner future and improve peoples’ lives here in B.C.,” Heyman said. “Their extensive experience and perspectives will help us expand and improve on the significant actions taking place through CleanBC, while supporting B.C. businesses as they reduce their carbon footprint and keeping daily life more affordable for the rest of us.”The independent council will continue the advisory role of the previous council, which completed its mandate at the end of 2019. The new members represent environmental organizations, businesses (including large industry), Indigenous peoples, local governments, academics, youth, unions and people living in rural and remote communities. The council will play an important role by advising the Province on further actions to reduce carbon pollution, while ensuring that B.C. industry remains competitive. It will provide public comment every year on progress. “As British Columbians, we have an incredible opportunity ahead of us as the world moves towards a clean economy and begins to address climate change,” said Colleen Giroux-Schmidt, co-chair of the new Climate Solutions Council and vice-president of corporate relations for Innergex Renewable Energy Inc. “I look forward to working with my new council colleagues to help build on the success of CleanBC and monitor progress as the plan develops over time.”In addition, the government released its 2019 Climate Change Accountability Report for CleanBC, which details a range of actions over the past year to reduce emissions and build a cleaner economy.Results show a range of positive trends, including record-setting sales of electric vehicles, increases in transit ridership, improvements in energy efficiency and emission intensity, reduced emissions from large industry and lower methane emissions from the natural gas sector. The report provides detailed emission forecasts and breakdowns by sector to help guide future improvements and track progress.“B.C. has come back as a global climate leader. And while we still have work to do, the Province has laid down the right foundations,” said Merran Smith, co-chair of the Climate Solutions Council, and executive director of Clean Energy Canada. “We’re already seeing the benefits, from surging electric car sales to real accountability measures, to a thriving clean energy sector that’s putting B.C. on the clean energy map. As co-chair of this new council, I’m excited to build on that progress.”CleanBC is the Province's pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. It was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s emission targets.Quotes: Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure –“People want to spend less time in traffic and more time with their friends and families. They want faster, more affordable and cleaner transportation options. With CleanBC, we are supporting these goals by investing in public transit, active transportation and one of the most extensive electric-vehicle charging networks in the country.”Bruce Ralston, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources –“Through CleanBC, our government is helping people and businesses benefit from a cleaner economy, with support to improve the way we get around, heat our homes and fuel our economy. British Columbia is leading the shift to clean, renewable energy as we continue to grow our economy and create good jobs for people.”Adam Olsen, interim leader, BC Green Party –""To truly seize the opportunities that CleanBC presents us as an economic framework, we need to fully embrace innovation across our economy and ensure communities throughout our province can prosper in a changing future. The transparency and accountability mechanisms included in CleanBC will be crucial to tracking our progress – as embodied in this first annual report – identifying where additional action is required going forward.​”Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head –“I was pleased to collaborate with government on legislation that mandates annual reporting on climate action, adding credibility to the commitments in CleanBC. I welcome this first climate change accountability report, which shows that we’ve accomplished a great deal together and that we have much more to do. I remain committed to the task.” Quick Facts:
Changes to the Climate Change Accountability Act require the Province to establish an independent council to provide advice to government on actions to meet emission targets, build a clean economy and mitigate risks from climate change.
The new council will meet three times a year, with additional meetings to be held virtually. It will provide feedback to government on a regular basis.
Changes to the act also require government to table detailed annual reporting on CleanBC progress in the legislature, with the first official report for 2020 expected later this year.
Since the launch of CleanBC, more than 17,000 new zero-emission vehicles have been sold, more than 40 fast-charging electric vehicle sites have been installed and more than 6,700 households have upgraded to heat pumps in homes and non-profit housing.

A new government-to-government partnership will help ensure long-term water sustainability in the Koksilah Watershed south of Duncan and explore the benefits of a water sustainability plan for the area.Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development, met with Chief William Seymour of Cowichan Tribes in Duncan on Feb. 7, 2020, to sign an interim letter of agreement for the project.“This agreement is an excellent example of how governments can work together to benefit residents and help protect valuable natural resources,” Donaldson said. “Effective stewardship of the Koksilah Watershed is a goal that we all share.”During recent dry summers, water flows in the Koksilah River have been low enough at times that the survival of resident and migrating salmonid species could be threatened. To ensure water sustainability, ministry staff, in partnership with Cowichan Tribes, are looking at the feasibility of using new tools in the Water Sustainability Act to better manage the Koksilah Watershed.“Cowichan Tribes appreciates that action is being taken by the Province to look after the Koksilah Watershed in partnership with us. Help for the Koksilah River is long overdue,” said Chief William Seymour of Cowichan Tribes. “Climate change is causing repeated droughts year after year and massive flooding like we saw this week. We can’t wait any longer. We need to work together, government to government and with all the affected people in the community, to deal with this and plan for a better future. A water sustainability plan sounds like a possible way forward, and we’re pleased to have the opportunity to pursue that together with the Province in our territory.”The Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development has the jurisdiction to implement the provincial Water Sustainability Act. However, the newly signed interim letter of agreement commits the ministry and Cowichan Tribes to collaborate and jointly oversee and participate in a long-term planning process for the management of the Koksilah Watershed.“I was truly heartened to witness the signing of this agreement between Chief Seymour and Minister Donaldson today,” said Sonia Furstenau, MLA for Cowichan Valley. “This type of government-to-government agreement is an example of reconciliation in action and something we need to see more of. It is an important step towards the long-term protection of the Koksilah Watershed.”This agreement also reflects the B.C. government’s commitment to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.Quick Fact:
In August 2019, a ministerial order under the Water Sustainability Act was issued to specific water users (including surface and groundwater licensees, and unlicensed groundwater users) to stop using water, in an effort to help protect fish populations in the Koksilah Watershed. It was the first time that such an order was issued in the West Coast region.

The Province is partnering with Baptist Housing and Vancouver Coastal Health on a proposal to redevelop Inglewood Care Centre, which is aging and in need of extensive renovations.On Feb. 3, Baptist Housing, a non-profit provider, took over operations of the 230-unit care centre located at 725 Inglewood Ave. It is working with residents and Vancouver Coastal Health to improve day-to-day management of the building and the quality of services.BC Housing, through the HousingHub, provided financing of approximately $114 million to Baptist Housing to purchase the care centre and three adjacent lots. Baptist Housing provided an additional $14.5 million of its own equity toward the purchase.As planning moves forward, project partners will work with the District of West Vancouver on rezoning and permit applications. This redevelopment would replace the existing 230 beds, with the potential of adding more beds in the future. Existing residents would not be displaced as a result of this project.In addition to the proposed redevelopment, Baptist Housing will explore additional opportunities to expand housing and care services on the property. Once a proposal is ready, partners will ask the public for input.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing – “We are thrilled to partner with Baptist Housing and Vancouver Coastal Health to help seniors stay in the community where they have connections. I’m also looking forward to seeing how we can bring more affordable housing options onto this site, so that more seniors in West Vancouver can have a home close to friends and family.”Adrian Dix, Minister of Health --“Our government is committed to improving care for seniors. We’ve invested in the Inglewood Care Centre to raise the standard of care to the level that seniors deserve. I’m pleased about this partnership moving forward so that this site can continue to support seniors to age with dignity.”Howard Johnson, president and CEO, Baptist Housing –“As a non-profit, our focus is always on people and service instead of profit, and that allows us to bring a unique approach to this exciting project. We want to do more than just run the residence the same way it's always been run. We’re blessed to be given the opportunity to serve in West Vancouver, and we want to make sure Inglewood, its residents and our team are part of the community. We’ll do our utmost to ensure this campus of care reaches its full potential for the benefit of everyone.”Mary-Ann Booth, mayor, West Vancouver –“Providing housing and support for our seniors as they age and their needs change is a priority for West Vancouver council. Baptist Housing has demonstrated an excellent standard of care in many B.C. communities, and we look forward to working with them here to meet these critical community needs.”Mary Ackenhusen, president and CEO, Vancouver Coastal Health – “Vancouver Coastal Health welcomes Baptist Housing as a new long-term care partner to ensure seniors on the North Shore have the quality, supportive care they need.”Quick Facts:
The HousingHub is a division within BC Housing established in 2018 as part of B.C.’s 10-year housing plan to seek innovative partnerships with local governments, non-profit and co-operative housing organizations, community land trusts, Indigenous groups, faith-based groups, charities, financial institutions and other industries to create affordable rental housing and homeownership options for middle-income British Columbians.

Child care is getting less expensive and easier to find in the Cowichan Valley as the Province invests in nearly 120 new child care spaces to give more parents the option to return to work, go back to school or pursue other opportunities.“As a working mom, I understand the challenges that parents face in trying to juggle their work and home life,” said Katrina Chen, Minister of State for Child Care. “By partnering with the local school district, we’re ensuring that more families have access to inclusive child care that ensures all children have what they need to thrive.”Through the Childcare BC New Spaces Fund, the Cowichan Valley School District (No. 79) is receiving funding to support the creation of three new school-based child care centres. They will be located at Alexander Elementary, Mill Bay Elementary and Palsson Elementary. Each centre will provide 37 licensed child care spaces – 12 infant/toddler spaces and 25 spaces for children aged three to five. The school district expects the new centres to open in September 2020. The centres will offer a variety of wraparound services, including support for families with lower incomes, such as providing free snacks to children, as well as clothing, books and blankets, if needed. The school district will work with Sun Drops Supported Child Care Centre to make programming more accessible for children who need extra supports. In addition, supports will also be available to young parents and families who are new to Canada.“These new child care spaces will create a strong foundation for children in the Cowichan Valley, setting them up for life-long success,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “The centres will be learning hubs where children begin their educational journeys, as well as inclusive, safe spaces where families can come together to benefit from many other programs and opportunities.”As well as the three school-based facilities, Britters Critters Daycare is receiving both a startup grant and funding through the Childcare BC New Spaces Fund to create seven new spaces for children under the age of 12. Programming will include outdoor activities, such as gardening, to encourage children to learn through exploring nature, as well as teaching children about the culture and history of the local Cowichan Tribes and other Indigenous peoples. In addition, the provider will work closely with Sun Drops to ensure that programming is inclusive for children with extra support needs.“I am delighted about the newest investment in child care spaces in the Cowichan Valley,” said Sonia Furstenau, MLA for Cowichan Valley. “The BC Green caucus is a strong advocate for investing in child care and wraparound services for young families, recognizing both are critical to supporting healthy, resilient communities. Aligning early childhood care and learning with our existing schools is a wonderful way to further invest in our public education system, while we create spaces that work well for parents with multiple kids.”Since launching in February 2018, the Childcare BC plan has helped parents in the Cowichan Valley region save more than $5.2 million through the Affordable Child Care Benefit and Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative.Investing in child care and early childhood education is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Candace Spilsbury, chair, Board of Education for the Cowichan Valley School District –“The board of education is thrilled at the continued investment into child care spaces in the Cowichan Valley. These additional spaces will continue to help families in our communities access good quality, reliable and professional child care for their little ones. We continue to be grateful to work alongside the ministry and our service providers to deliver these child care spaces to our communities.”Brittnie Schwab, owner, Britters Critters Daycare –""When I began looking for child care for my young son, I found that every centre had no spaces and long waitlists. When I began looking into opening my own centre, the local child care resource and referral team told me about the grants that were available to apply for. These grants have made it possible for me to build a fence and purchase resources and toys for my facility. I felt very supported while working through the application process.

For the first time, B.C.'s children and youth in care will be recognized through a new supplement when funding is allocated to school districts next month.This change will also expand priority funding to more children with mental-health challenges and those living in low-income families.“We’ve heard loud and clear that years of neglect have left far too many of our most vulnerable children not getting the supports they need to be engaged and successful in school,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “Our government is doing things differently by putting the success and well-being of students first, while ensuring equity in the way we fund public education.”Money allocated for this new supplement will be provided to school boards to deliver services based on local needs. These funds are intended for supports like trauma counselling, school breakfast or lunch programs, additional support in the classroom, recognizing mental-health issues and early intervention, or tutoring. Recognizing these students for priority funding will ensure the more than $6 billion in record operating funding is distributed in a way that better represents the number of vulnerable students in B.C. schools. The amount of money allocated for the supplement will be announced following Budget 2020.This is part one of a two-phase plan to improve the way education is delivered in B.C., following the completion of a comprehensive review that examined ways to ensure every child has equal and consistent access to a quality education, no matter their circumstances or where they live. The review involved an unprecedented level of consultation, including all 60 school districts and over 350 education stakeholders.  Former youth in care already are benefiting from the post-secondary Tuition Waiver Program, and these changes will pave the way for success beginning at an early age. The move builds on broader government efforts, including the poverty reduction strategy TogetherBC, a Pathway to Hope roadmap for mental health, and prioritizing children and youth in care.“We want to give every child and youth in care the chance to thrive and overcome challenges they could face,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “From an early age, right through school, high school and post-secondary, we’re working to support children and youth, help guide them and make sure they can access the services they need in order to succeed.”In 2018, the Province appointed an independent review panel to undertake a review of how public education is funded for the first time in almost 30 years. The panel recommended making improvements to ensure greater equity, accountability and financial management, so all students are supported to reach their full potential.As part of the equity recommendations, Indigenous students will continue to benefit from targeted funding for culturally appropriate support and services. There will also be added accountability through formal processes, so Indigenous parents, communities and governments can provide input into how educational services are delivered to their children. This builds upon ongoing work to prioritize Indigenous students, including a 30% increase in funding since 2016-17.The Ministry of Education will work collaboratively with school boards and other partners to implement improved public accountability, including ensuring school districts: 
engage parents, caregivers and community members in the development of school districts' strategic plans, well in advance of setting their budgets, to meet student needs;  
continuously monitor and publicly report on student outcomes, such as numeracy, literacy and graduation rates, so gaps in student achievement are identified and services can be planned based on proven strategies; and  
ensure strategic plans and financial decisions are focused on improving student outcomes and meeting all students’ needs, including inclusive education, Indigenous education, students from low-income families and other vulnerable students.
These new accountability and transparency measures will give parents and caregivers a stronger voice, while making sure students’ needs are put first. The ministry will continue to work on the remainder of the recommendations with school boards and other partners – including parents, support staff, teachers, Indigenous communities and inclusive-education advocacy groups.This work will include testing and piloting strategies to improve how inclusive education is delivered so students receive the services and supports they need, when they need them, no matter where they live. Ongoing work will ensure the unique costs of running schools in rural and remote districts throughout the province are recognized and prioritized when funding is allocated.  “The previous government imposed decisions with no consultation, and that’s why we said all along that we will take the time necessary to get this right. We need to make sure all children can benefit from the changes we make,” Fleming said.  “We’re glad that the ministry is taking the initial step in moving forward with the necessary process of improving the funding model,” said Stephanie Higginson, president, BC School Trustees Association. “This process has given us critical information about the student population that was unavailable when the current model was created. We remain committed to working with the ministry toward finding a more student-focused way of distributing education dollars to local boards of education.”Education funding is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.“The BC Green caucus supports the funding model changes announced today, particularly the emphasis on supporting vulnerable children and youth in care,” said Sonia Furstenau, MLA for Cowichan Valley. “Our collective goal must be to ensure that all children have the opportunity to thrive. This means continuing to work with our partners in the education system to find the best ways to fund the supports that our students need.”Quick Facts:
Government is supporting B.C. students with a record $6.6 billion a year, which is $1 billion more than in 2016-17.
Since 2016-17, student enrolment has increased by 3.2% while, at the same time, education funding has increased by 17.1%, including a 30% increase to support Indigenous education and a 29% increase to support inclusive education.
More than 1,100 former youth in care are benefiting from post-secondary or trades training through the Tuition Waver Program program, which was introduced in the 2017-18 school year. 
In early 2019, the Province launched TogetherBC, British Columbia’s first-ever poverty reduction strategy. It aims to reduce the province’s overall poverty rate by 25% and the child poverty rate by 50% over the next five years.
A Pathway to Hope, launched in June 2019, is a 10-year mental health plan, with an immediate focus for the next three years on improving wellness for children, youth and young adults, supporting Indigenous-led solutions, improving substance use care, and improving access and quality of care throughout B.C.

In January, B.C.’s unemployment rate fell further to 4.5% — well below the national average.“Since forming government, our province has created more than 67,000 jobs, including 3,400 jobs last month. Yesterday, the 2019 Labour Market Outlook showed B.C. is on track to create more than 860,000 jobs this decade.“Wages also saw an increase in January. Average wages went up to $28.83/hour. In the last year, wages have gone up $1.73/hour (6.4%) and have increased $3.43/hour (13.5%) over the life of our government.“While our labour markets remain strong across most communities, we recognize there are workers who have been affected by market shifts in the resource sectors.

Child care is getting less expensive and easier to find in Castlegar as the Province invests in eight new child care spaces, giving more parents the option to return to work, go back to school or pursue other opportunities.“It’s important for parents to feel confident that their child is being well cared for in a nurturing, enriching environment,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “Knowing their child is playing, learning and having fun gives parents peace of mind while they’re away from their kids during the day.”Through the Childcare BC New Spaces Fund, Blueberry Creek Early Learning & Care Centre in Castlegar is creating eight new infant/toddler spaces. The centre overlooks 1.6 hectares (four acres) of green space and gardens where the children will be able to experience the natural world by planting and harvesting fruit and vegetables. It also offers programs for children with extra support needs, as well as Indigenous early learning programs.""Blueberry Creek Community School Council is grateful to the Province for the funding and opportunity to expand the Early Learning and Care Centre at our Community Hub,” said Rebecca McDonnell, executive director, Blueberry Creek Early Learning & Care Centre. “We are pleased to be able to add these new spaces and to support more children and families in our engaging, nurturing and inclusive environment.""So far 23 new, affordable licensed child care spaces in Castlegar have been funded by the Province since the Childcare BC New Spaces Fund launched in July 2018. They are part of the fastest creation of child care spaces in B.C.’s history, with more than 10,400 funded in the past 15 months.With the addition of 900 spaces funded through partnerships with the Union of British Columbia Municipalities and Aboriginal Head Start using federal funding, and 4,100 spaces created through the 2017 Budget Update, more than 15,400 spaces have been funded in B.C.Since launching in February 2018, the Childcare BC plan has helped parents in Castlegar save more than $776,000 through the Affordable Child Care Benefit and Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative.Investing in child care and early childhood education is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:

The Province continues to act on the recommendations of the BC Mining Jobs Task Force and has released the What We Heard report from public consultation on proposed changes to strengthen the Mines Act.“Our government is spending $20 million to act on the recommendations of the BC Mining Jobs Task Force and to speed up permitting and improve safety in the mining sector,” said Bruce Ralston, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources. “As the newly appointed minister, I look forward to building on the work we have done so far to strengthen the mining sector and create good jobs for people throughout the province.”The Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources has published a What We Heard report as a followup to the public comment period in fall 2019 on proposed changes to strengthen the Mines Act. The report’s key findings indicate:
the environment and human health are top priorities for British Columbians;
respondents want mines held accountable to follow the rules, with appropriate enforcement action;
there needs to be clear separation between permitting and health, safety and enforcement for decision makers;
support for the establishment of an independent oversight unit; and
permitting processes need to be more efficient and result in more timely decisions.
In recognition of the foundational role mining plays in B.C.’s economy, Ralston will start a provincial tour by visiting two mines in the Kamloops area — New Gold Inc.’s New Afton site and Teck Resources Ltd.’s Highland Valley Copper Mine.Quick Facts:
B.C.’s mining industry had an estimated value of production of nearly $10 billion in 2018. 
In 2018-19, the B.C. mining industry paid over $400 million in mineral taxes to the Province.
Each direct job at a mine or smelter in B.C. supports at least two jobs in supply or services.

Renters will be able to receive their security and pet deposits back in a fair and timely manner, thanks to changes made by the Government of B.C.“Renters should not have to go through a time-consuming process to have their deposits returned to them,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “We are taking action to make the residential tenancy system work better for landlords and tenants, and this is another step in making sure everyone is treated fairly.”Under the old process, renters had to apply for a dispute resolution hearing if their landlord did not return their uncontested deposits within 15 days of the end of the rental agreement. This formal hearing with the Residential Tenancy Branch (RTB) meant that renters had to wait to have their money returned to them.To solve this, the Province is creating an expedited process. Renters with successful applications will receive an order for the return of the deposit that they can then serve to their landlord or enforce through the small claims court. The RTB has a similar process in place to help landlords recover unpaid rent or utilities. These changes give renters the ability to use the same simplified process to get their deposit back.“The Tenant Resource and Advisory Centre (TRAC) supports the decision to make the RTB’s direct request process available to tenants seeking the recovery of their security and pet damage deposits. We regularly hear from tenants whose landlords refuse to return deposits without justification, knowing that the time and hassle of the standard dispute-resolution process will lead many to simply give up,” said Andrew Sakamoto, executive director, TRAC. “TRAC hopes this change will both enable tenants to better stand up for their rights and discourage unscrupulous landlords from illegally retaining deposits.”Renters can apply for this expedited process in person at the RTB office in Burnaby, at any Service BC location or online (effective Feb. 18, 2020).“The use of a direct request for the return of security deposits is a constructive step to improve the efficiency of the process for both tenants and landlords,” said David Hutniak, chief executive officer, LandlordBC. “Landlords claiming to retain part or all of the deposits to recoup the cost of damages to their rental suites will continue to have access to a participatory hearing, which ensures that they will be able to state their case to an arbitrator. Overall, we expect this new process to work well.”This new process is the next step in the phased implementation of the Rental Housing Task Force’s recommendations to make B.C.’s rental housing system fairer, more affordable and more secure.Action on housing and ensuring fairness for renters and landlords are shared priorities between government and the BC Green Party caucus and are part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts: 
This change is in response to recommendation 18 of the Rental Housing Task Force, which was to speed up the return of security deposits by allowing tenants to make a direct request to the RTB where the landlord has not made a claim.
The new process is among the many changes that government has made to improve renting in B.C., including:
changing the laws to provide stronger protection for renters facing eviction as a result of renovations or demolitions by increasing compensation for bad-faith evictions, strengthening requirements for eviction notifications, allowing more time to find alternative housing and giving renters the right of refusal to return to a unit following renovations;
updating tenancy laws to close what is known as the fixed-term lease loophole, eliminating the geographic rent increase clause and better protecting people living in manufactured home parks;
investing $6.8 million in new funding for the RTB to reduce wait times for tenancy disputes, hire new staff to reduce wait times and address backlog and create a new compliance unit to take action against serious offenders;
cutting the annual allowable rent increase by 2%, limiting it to inflation, to help ease pressure on renters; and
improving the Rental Assistance Program and Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters to give families and seniors on fixed income a break from rising costs.

The Vancouver Resource Society has partnered with the Province, through BC Housing, to purchase four senior housing facilities in Surrey, Kelowna and Nanaimo, preserving a total of 475 residential suites at affordable rental rates.“Seniors should be able to find a home in their community, close to their friends, families and the services they count on,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “We are proud to be partnering with Vancouver Resource Society to provide good, safe and affordable homes for hundreds of seniors.”The Province provided financing of approximately $147.5 million to the non-profit to purchase the four projects. This means these homes will not be sold into the private market, which would have put seniors at risk of losing their homes to redevelopment or having to pay market-level rents.“It is very important that we help seniors maintain healthy independence as long as possible,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “We know many seniors in British Columbia may have housing affordability challenges. This seniors’ housing announcement will help more seniors on fixed incomes continue to live independently with dignity.” Through the HousingHub, the Building BC funds and other provincial investments, more than 22,000 new homes are complete, under construction or in development for people with a range of incomes throughout the province. ""We are very excited to be working with BC Housing to deliver affordable housing for seniors in the communities of Surrey, Kelowna and Nanaimo,"" said Ken Fraser, executive director, Vancouver Resource Society. ""We will also be working towards offering on-site services to ensure seniors can live in their homes as long as possible and never have to move again.""Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:Four properties have been purchased in three communities:

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in British Columbia:“We are announcing two new cases of novel coronavirus in B.C. The people affected are in the same household and have been in close contact with the previously reported second confirmed case announced on Feb. 5. The three cases and all close contacts remain in isolation at home.“The two individuals are presumed positive based on local testing, and samples have been sent to the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg for final confirmation. One individual is male, the other female, and both are in their 30s. They are visitors to the Vancouver Coastal Health region from Hubei province, China.“Vancouver Coastal Health continues to investigate. Their close contacts have been identified and continue to be followed by the health authority.""Our knowledge of 2019-nCoV continues to grow as new information becomes available. Across the country, the federal, provincial and territorial governments are using this new evidence to inform and adjust our public health actions as circumstances develop globally.“We want to reassure people that the risk of spread of this virus within British Columbia remains low at this time. We are watching the situation very closely and will notify the public if measures in B.C. change. The goal is rapid identification of potential cases, timely care for those who need it and prevention of local transmission.“Now is the time for tolerance. We call on all British Columbians to come together as a community to help one another. In this time of uncertainty, this is not only the right response, but the necessary one. Fear obstructs the important work of our public health officials to protect the health and safety of British Columbians.“The most important measures to prevent all respiratory illnesses, including this novel coronavirus, remain cleaning your hands regularly and avoiding touching your face, as well as coughing or sneezing into your elbow sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately and staying home and away from others if you become sick.“As we recommended in our last briefing, and together with our federal and provincial partners, we ask people who have recently visited, or who have been in close contact with someone who has recently visited the Hubei province in China, to call public health officials and self-isolate for 14 days.“Anyone who is concerned they may have been exposed to, or are experiencing symptoms of, the coronavirus should contact their primary care provider, local public health office or call 811.

Government is transforming ICBC by removing lawyers and legal costs from the system to reduce rates and substantially increase care benefits, making public auto insurance work for British Columbians again.Legislation will be introduced in the coming weeks that will lower ICBC premiums by approximately 20% – an average of $400 in savings per driver. At the same time, maximum care and treatment benefits for anyone injured in a crash will increase to at least $7.5 million, and new benefits will provide care for those most seriously injured, for as long as they need it. These benefits will be available to every British Columbian without having to hire a lawyer.These improvements will be achieved by removing the majority of legal fees and other costs associated with the current litigation-based system. The new care-based insurance system is forecast to remove more than $1.5 billion in the first full year, savings that will be passed on to ICBC customers through lowered insurance rates.To give British Columbians confidence that they will be treated fairly, the planned legislation will require ICBC, by law, to assist every person who makes a claim and endeavour to ensure they receive all of the care and benefits to which they are entitled. Customers who still have complaints or disputes about their claim, benefit payments or fairness issues will not need a lawyer to have them resolved. They will have recourse through:
the Civil Resolution Tribunal, which is independent of ICBC;
the B.C. ombudsperson; and
the upcoming ICBC fairness officer, who will be appointed by government to ensure greater independence from ICBC.
As ICBC transitions to this new care-based model, government’s previous work to improve the finances at ICBC means there will be no basic rate change this year. The 0% basic rate change that takes effect on April 1, 2020, is the lowest any government has delivered in almost a decade. Without significant changes, rates would need to continue to rise by about 35% over the next five years.Highlights of Enhanced Care coverage:Government will introduce legislation to create the new care-based system, which would take effect on May 1, 2021, so that British Columbians will benefit from:
average savings of $400 on their premium, compared with the previous full-year policy;
care and treatment benefits that are 24 times higher than today, up to at least $7.5 million;
wage loss coverage that is 60% higher than today; and
new benefits – such as benefits for full-time students, caregivers, those working in the family business or those approaching retirement, who suffer income loss following a crash – replacing lump-sum payments that were previously awarded only through lengthy and expensive litigation.
Quotes: Premier John Horgan –“It’s time for change at ICBC. The old government ignored ICBC’s problems, allowing it to become a system that made lawyers rich, while drivers paid too much for insurance. We’re going to transform ICBC to lower rates for B.C. drivers – saving you an average of $400 on your insurance, while also improving care for people who have been injured in a crash.”David Eby, Attorney General –“You shouldn’t need a lawyer to access the benefits you’ve paid for. By removing expensive lawyers and legal fees from the system, we are making ICBC work for British Columbians again with more affordable insurance rates and much better coverage, so anyone injured in a crash gets the care they need.”Christine Bradstock, CEO, Physiotherapy Association of BC –“As physiotherapists, we often see patients who require longer treatment times in order to fully recover or get back to full function. With these changes, patients will have the peace of mind knowing that their care and treatment benefits will be there when they need them and for as long as they need to get better and return to their daily lives.”Dr. Kathleen Ross, president, Doctors of BC –“As physicians, our priority is to ensure that patients get the best possible care. The new care-based model provides significantly better coverage for people injured in traffic accidents through major increases in the level of medical care and supports for recovery. Doctors of BC looks forward to working with government and ICBC to help inform the transition to this enhanced care model.”Quick Facts:
Similar care-based insurance systems exist in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Those systems have kept rate changes steady, near 0%.
Under Enhanced Care coverage, a driver who is responsible for a crash will continue to be found at fault. This will remain a primary factor in what drivers pay for their insurance. If a driver causes a crash, their premiums will go up.
Those injured by dangerous drivers convicted of certain Criminal Code offences, such as impaired driving, will still be able to sue for additional compensation.

People injured in automobile crashes under the existing auto insurance system will be able to resolve their accident claims more quickly and get their compensation sooner, thanks to forthcoming regulatory changes.The B.C. government will place a limit on the maximum amount recoverable from an unsuccessful litigant to $3,000 for the cost of each expert report in motor vehicle personal injury cases. Total recoverable disbursements in motor vehicle personal injury cases will also be limited to 5% of the judgment or settlement. Disbursements include all expenses incurred for the purpose of a lawsuit, such as courier fees, process servers and photocopying, but will not include fees payable to the Crown, such as filing fees, court fees and jury fees.Government will also proceed with amendments to legislation to limit the number of experts and expert reports that can be used in court on the issue of damages, while providing judicial discretion to allow additional expert reports in appropriate cases. For fast-track claims (e.g., under $100,000) there will be a limit of one expert and expert report for each party. A maximum of three experts and reports for each party will be set for all other claims. The parties can agree to use more experts without the need to file a formal application to the court.These changes will be put forward during the spring 2020 sitting of the legislature.Quick Facts:
ICBC vehicle injury claims increased by 43% from 2014-18.
Since 2017, the increased use of experts has contributed to a 30% increase in the value of ICBC injury claims that are litigated.
The limit of three experts will not apply if an expert report has been served before Feb. 6, 2020, for a trial before Oct. 1, 2020.
The $3,000 limit to recoverable expert reports will not apply if the cost has already been incurred before Feb. 6, 2020, or if a notice of trial has been filed and served before Feb. 6, 2020, for a trial before Oct. 1, 2020.

Students, workers and employers in B.C. have a new tool to help them prepare for a career or plan for staffing with the introduction of the Good Jobs Guide.The Good Jobs Guide uses data from the 2019 Labour Market Outlook to provide a practical resource with examples of real careers and clear pathways for individuals to upgrade their skills or train for new opportunities.“British Columbia has job opportunities for everyone, regardless of where they live and what their educational background is,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “Our economy is strong, and forecasts show that employers will need people with a wide range of education and skills. Government is making education and training accessible where people live so that everyone can get good, family-supporting jobs in or near their communities. The Good Jobs Guide shows people real, practical ways they can prepare themselves for future employment in their chosen field.”The Good Jobs Guide will be a valuable information resource for all British Columbians, especially parents, prospective students, job seekers, educators and businesses. The guide shows where, when and what kinds of jobs are expected to be available in B.C. between 2019 and 2029, along with wages and the type of education and/or training required.“The Good Jobs Guide is an excellent tool to help grow B.C.’s talent pool and support economic development throughout all regions of the province,” said Michelle Mungall, Minister of Jobs, Economic Development and Competitiveness. “With a strong workforce in place, we are attracting more investments, expanding the innovation economy and adding more family-supporting jobs throughout the province.”As in past years, the forecast shows that there will be a wide range of job opportunities – good news for people looking for their first job, thinking of changing jobs, or getting back into the job market.“When people have meaningful work, it improves their quality of life and provides them with opportunity, while connecting them to their community,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “In the next 10 years, there will be hundreds of thousands of new job openings throughout the province. The Good Job Guide will help people find career paths that are right for them and their families. Initiatives like these are an investment in our communities and help us in building a stronger B.C.”The Good Jobs Guide shows how people can prepare for work by using existing supports such as WorkBC centres, WorkBC.ca, the education planner and the career guide for Indigenous peoples. The Good Jobs Guide also features British Columbians who share stories of their journeys to better jobs, demonstrating the types of opportunities open to everyone in B.C.Quotes:Lorri Fehr, chief executive officer, Columbia Lake Technology Centre –“Tech businesses are increasingly becoming a part of the rural landscape, and we need to be prepared as economic drivers shift. Having the right talent in place is crucial to advancing projects like the world-class Technology Innovation Centre we are building in the East Kootenays. I’m pleased to see initiatives like the Good Jobs Guide, which offers guidance on how to obtain jobs of the future.” Cindy Oliver, chair, Industry Training Authority –“With thousands of jobs being created in skilled trades careers over the coming years, this is a game-changing resource to help students who are exploring the 100-plus trades professions in B.C. available to all abilities and skill levels, and also for people of all ages considering a shift to interesting, rewarding and high-opportunity employment.”Val Litwin, president and CEO, B.C. Chamber of Commerce –“This province is a a place of vast opportunity. In the coming years, our economic development will rely on getting the right people, with the right skills, to the right parts of B.C. Our network wants to see the current labour-market issues addressed, and we applaud the B.C. government for creating a tool that will help people make informed career plans, and also determine how these plans align with current and future employment opportunities throughout the province.”Quick Facts:
The Labour Market Outlook forecasts 861,000 job openings over the next decade. Of those, 69% will be to replace people leaving the workforce, e.g., retiring. The remaining 31% will come from economic growth.
Nearly 80% of jobs will require some type of post-secondary (after high school) education or training.
41% of job openings will need a certificate, diploma or apprenticeship training; 36% will need a bachelor’s, graduate or first professional degree; 23% of the jobs will require people with a high-school diploma, on-the-job training or less.

Funding is in place and plans are moving ahead to rebuild and realign West Fraser Road, replacing the road that was heavily damaged by flooding in 2018.Once complete, the new road will provide local people with a safe, reliable and efficient roadway to get to and from their homes, schools, jobs and appointments.“The West Fraser Road washout has had significant impacts to people and local communities, and we are committed to a long-term solution,” said Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “I appreciate people’s patience throughout this very challenging time. The ministry continues to work on maintaining the alternative route, while ensuring safe travel through the area by building a new road.”In April 2018, high water levels from the spring freshet caused Narcosli Creek to erode five sections of West Fraser Road on the west side of the Fraser River, approximately 17 kilometres south of Quesnel. The damage was severe, resulting in the road being closed over a three-kilometre section.“We are pleased the funding is in place and the rebuilding of the West Fraser Road will start,” said Chief Roy Stump and Councillors William Baptiste, Howard Johnny and Chad Stump of the ?Esdilagh First Nation. “There has been a significant impact to our community since the washout of the West Fraser Road. With the washout, we travel a longer distance to get to Quesnel and our children have had to endure additional travel time to get to school, reducing their time at home. Realigning the West Fraser Road will provide ?Esdilagh with the proper egress route to Quesnel and decrease the amount of industry traffic we have to encounter – overall, providing more safety for our members.”The ministry is finalizing the detailed design for the new road, which will bypass the active slide areas along the section washed out in 2018. Work will include the construction of five kilometres of two-lane road on a new alignment, a new bridge crossing Narcosli Creek and rock stabilization work along the new route.Upon completion of the final engineering design activities, the ministry will hold a public information session in spring 2020 to share the finalized design and project timelines. Construction is expected to begin later this year. Completion is slated for late 2022.Since the washout, a detour route has been in place via the Garner and Webster Lake Road system. Government has invested nearly $2 million to improve the route. Local ministry staff and the maintenance contractor continue to ensure the detour remains safe and reliable for road users.Quick Facts:
The project, which is estimated to cost up to $103.4 million, has been approved in principle for funding support through Public Safety Canada’s Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangement.
West Fraser Road provides access to the ?Esdilagh First Nation community, ranches, logging activities, farming lands and local residences.

The accessibility consultation summary report shows strong support for government to develop legislation to make B.C. more inclusive and accessible.The public consultation ran from Sept. 16 to Nov. 29, 2019. The Province heard that people support developing accessibility legislation as outlined in the Framework for Accessibility Legislation.Nearly 500 people attended one of the 10 community meetings around the province, while 75 independent community consultations were held and over 50 formal submissions were received. Of the 6,352 people who filled out the online questionnaire, 3,776 identify as having a disability. There were more than 23,000 visits to the accessibility engagement website.The input and feedback heard will help inform the development of new accessibility legislation, which will complement the federal Accessible Canada Act.Government will continue to engage with persons with disabilities, local governments, Indigenous peoples and key stakeholder groups and organizations in developing future standards and regulations.Quick Facts:
As of 2017, there are more than 926,000 British Columbians over the age of 15 with some form of disability. This represents almost 25% of the population.
As the population ages, the number of people with disabilities and the severity of their disabilities are likely to increase.
The federal government, Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario and Manitoba have accessibility legislation in place.

Rural communities affected by mill closures throughout British Columbia will benefit from $1 million in funding to develop tourism opportunities, creating new jobs for people.“British Columbia is an amazing place with unparalleled natural beauty that we are proud to invite the world to come explore,” said Premier John Horgan. “This tourism investment will help bring new visitors to rural communities throughout the province, while also helping diversify and boost local economies.”Tourism contributes significantly to the economies of many communities in B.C. This funding from the Province will be provided through Destination BC to the five regional destination marketing organizations (RDMOs). Each RDMO will receive $200,000 in catalyst funding to support strategic planning and destination development in rural communities impacted by mill closures.“As the tourism market continues to expand globally, there are many communities in B.C. that hold great potential for tourism growth,” said Lisa Beare, Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture. “This funding will help rural communities impacted by mill closures develop new tourism opportunities, create good-paying jobs and give residents access to all the things that make an area attractive to visitors.”RDMOs will work in collaboration with the affected communities and government to prioritize the needs of the people who live there and determine what tourism investments will have the greatest impact.Quotes:Marsha Walden, CEO, Destination BC —“The world’s travellers have thousands of places to choose from, but when they choose B.C., they bring economic, social and cultural benefits to our province. This funding is intended to help communities access economic development funding that supports investments in tourism experiences. Those investments will help us collectively grow a thriving and diversified visitor economy in many parts of our province.”Clint Fraser, CEO, Northern BC Tourism Association —“We are extremely pleased to receive this funding as it will assist in further developing the visitor economy in northern British Columbia. Economic diversification is a top priority in communities across the region, and this funding will help support planning and development projects that ensure long term growth of the tourism sector in northern B.C.”Quick Facts:
Government and Destination BC have led destination development planning for the last three years. This work is the first of its kind in B.C. and focuses on the supply side of tourism, rather than demand: www.destinationbc.ca/what-we-do/destination-management/destination-development/
Over 70% of Destination BC’s program support is directed towards tourism marketing and destination management programs in small and rural communities throughout B.C.
B.C. welcomed 6.1 million international visitors in 2018.
Tourism employs over 137,000 people and generated $18.4 billion in revenue for B.C. in 2017.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, have issued the following joint statement regarding updates on the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in British Columbia:“We are announcing a second presumptive positive case of novel coronavirus in B.C.“The second person who tested positive is a woman in her 50s who resides in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. Laboratory testing results returned positive from the BC Centre for Disease Control late Monday, Feb. 3, and samples have been sent to the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg for confirmation. Vancouver Coastal Health is undertaking a detailed case investigation and will follow up with each of her close contacts. The individual had close contact with family visitors from Wuhan city and is in isolation at home.“Our knowledge of 2019-nCoV continues to grow as new information becomes available. Across the country, federal, provincial and territorial governments are using this new evidence to inform and adjust our public health actions as circumstances develop globally.“As the federal government works to bring returning Canadians home from Wuhan, the decision was made to quarantine passengers from the special charter flight for 14 days. These individuals are returning from the most intensely affected areas of China, and they will receive psychosocial and medical support upon their return, as well as consular services.“We are working closely with public health officials across Canada. Our focus is on people in British Columbia. Given the changing dynamics of the outbreak in China and globally, and recognizing we are in the midst of influenza season, we ask anyone here in B.C. who has been in Hubei province to consider staying home and keeping their children home until 14 days have passed from their last visit to Hubei. Monitor yourself and your children closely for symptoms, and if any symptoms arise, connect with your primary care provider, local public health office or call 811. This is an important way to reduce the possibility of transmission of illness to others.“We want to reassure people that the risk of this virus spreading within British Columbia remains low at this time. We are watching the evolution of the outbreak in China very closely and will notify the public if the measures we need to take in B.C. change.“The most important measures to prevent all respiratory illnesses including this novel coronavirus remain cleaning your hands regularly, avoiding touching your face, coughing or sneezing into your elbow sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately and staying home and away from others if you become sick. “Anyone who is concerned they may have been exposed to, or are experiencing symptoms of, the coronavirus should contact their primary care provider, local public health office or call 811.

Each of these returning Canadians, including staff and flight crew, will remain at CFB Trenton for 14 days to receive the necessary social and medical support they may need.“We have been working closely with the federal government to ensure the repatriation process is smooth and conducted in a way that best protects the returning Canadians and the public here at home. It is expected that B.C. will be the final destination for some of the returning Canadians, and we will continue liaising with the federal government as it identifies passengers for the repatriation flight.“The returning Canadians will spend 14 days at CFB Trenton, which is the 2019 novel coronavirus maximum incubation period, so they can be assessed and monitored, and to support their transition back to Canada.“In B.C., we have chosen testing criteria with an intentionally low threshold to purposely ensure a wide range of people are eligible for novel coronavirus testing. On Friday, Jan. 31, we reported testing 114 samples and one confirmed case. Updates will be published each Friday at: www.bccdc.ca“There continues to be one confirmed case in B.C.“We want to reassure people that the risk of this virus spreading within British Columbia remains low at this time.

More students in the Comox Valley, on the west coast and north island will now have access to health-care assistant education programs.This increase in these high-demand programs is thanks to a seat expansion and new state-of-the-art learning space at North Island College (NIC).“Investing in more student spaces for in-demand health-care assistant programs, like the one at North Island College, means we are creating better access to education for students while ensuring British Columbians will have the top-quality health care they need for generations to come,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “We need people on the Island to have access to local education and training opportunities so they can offer much-needed supports closer to home.”More than $1 million in one-time funding enabled the college to lease and renovate the first floor of the former St. Joseph’s General Hospital in Comox. Seats at the college will be added so six additional health-care assistant certificate cohorts can run through 2019 and 2020.“We’re so thankful to the Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training for providing the funding for NIC to renovate, lease and equip the space at St. Joe’s,” said John Bowman, president, NIC. “We’re now able to meet increasing demand for high-enrolment programs while we seek more permanent solutions to deal with space constraints at our Comox Valley campus.”One-time program funding of $494,000 was provided to NIC to create 60 new seats in one-time health-care assistant programming and health-care assistant prerequisite programming. These NIC programs provide learning and training opportunities close to home for students in the Comox Valley at St. Joseph’s, as well as Campbell River, Port Hardy and the Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation on the west coast of Vancouver Island. The 60 new seats are in addition to the existing 40 seats the college already has for health-care assistants.“Increasing the number of health-care assistants in B.C. is a part of government’s commitment to strengthen the staff available to provide services for seniors to ensure they can receive the care they need and deserve,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “Health-care assistants have one of the most important jobs of making daily life better for seniors by providing compassionate personal care and social interaction, which are essential to healthy aging.”An additional capital investment of $600,000 went to renovate this new space and to purchase the equipment that will help students be industry ready. The college signed a four-year lease for the former surgical daycare space on the first floor of the the former St. Joseph’s General Hospital, which has been renovated to include two classrooms, study areas, meeting rooms and teaching labs.NIC’s health-care assistant students began their program in August 2019. A second program started in January 2020 at St. Joseph’s.These investments at NIC are part of a bigger investment government has made in health-care assistants through the ministries of Health, and Advanced Education, Skills and Training. In October 2019, the ministries announced $3.64 million in operating funding over the next two years to create 418 new health-care assistant seats in 14 post-secondary institutions throughout British Columbia.Quick Facts:
Health-care assistant is considered a high-demand health occupation by B.C.’s Ministry of Health. B.C.'s 2018 Labour Market Outlook predicts around 82,000 job openings in the health sector through 2028.
Health-care assistants provide personal support services for seniors, people with disabilities and people with acute or chronic illnesses.
Health-care assistants work in a variety of settings, including home support, assisted living and long-term care homes.

Il met à la disposition des parents et des pédagogues des outils en français et en anglais destinés à faciliter l’apprentissage de la langue française et le suivi des progrès des élèves.« L’immersion en français est une expérience à valeur pédagogique bien établie qui peut transformer une vie. Les parents de toute la Colombie-Britannique affluent vers ce programme depuis plus de 24 ans », affirme Glyn Lewis, directeur général de Canadian Parents for French – British Columbia & Yukon. « Nous invitons les conseils scolaires à poursuivre leur concertation avec les parents de leur district pour satisfaire à la demande d’immersion en français et ne laisser aucun enfant pour compte. »Pour fêter la Semaine de célébration de l’immersion en français, les élèves du programme d’immersion de plusieurs collectivités pourront profiter d’activités divertissantes : un festival du cinéma francophone, du patinage avec le Bonhomme Carnaval et des ateliers de théâtre offerts par le Théâtre la Seizième, pour n’en nommer que trois. Ces activités sont organisées par Canadian Parents for French, un réseau national de bénévoles ayant pour mission de faire la promotion de l’apprentissage du français langue seconde par les jeunes Canadiens.Pour renforcer le programme d’immersion en français dans les écoles de la province, le gouvernement a accordé un brevet d’enseignement à 36 nouveaux enseignants originaires de France et de Belgique; 60 autres candidatures sont en instance d’évaluation. Les nouveaux enseignants participent à un programme d’échange créé en 2019 pour répondre à la demande accrue visant le programme d’immersion en français.« Je suis très heureux d’avoir eu la possibilité d’étudier en français et de devenir enseignant en Colombie-Britannique », explique Mahdi Zahouani, un nouvel enseignant breveté originaire de Paris. « Le programme me permet de vivre et de travailler à Vancouver.

Les éducateurs et éducatrices à la petite enfance (EPE) de la Colombie-Britannique pourront désormais bénéficier d’un programme élargi de perfectionnement professionnel qui mise sur l’examen des dernières philosophies et techniques d’enseignement, et des derniers programmes scolaires en ce qui a trait aux services de garde.Dirigé par le Early Childhood Pedagogy Network (ECPN) (réseau de pédagogie de la petite enfance), le programme prévoit un investissement de 2 millions de dollars qui permettra l’embauche de 32 spécialistes de l’enseignement – appelés pédagogues – à l’échelle de la province. La mise en poste de ces pédagogues favorisera l’accès au perfectionnement professionnel des EPE, et améliorera la qualité des services de garde au profit des enfants et de leurs familles.Chaque pédagogue sera appelé à encadrer jusqu’à 45 éducateurs à la petite enfance dans son secteur par le biais de centres communautaires aménagés dans 8 établissements d’enseignement postsecondaire, dans 10 centres d’orientation pour la garde d’enfants et dans 7 collectivités autochtones, en collaboration avec la BC Aboriginal Child Care Society (société de services de garde d’enfants autochtones de la Colombie-Britannique).Le programme est le fruit d’un partenariat entre le gouvernement de la province et les chercheurs de l’Université Capilano et de l’Université Western, en Ontario. Cette initiative contribue au rayonnement de la Colombie-Britannique en tant que l’une des deux seules provinces canadiennes à offrir cette forme de soutien aux éducateurs à la petite enfance.« Un engagement envers la prestation de soins de qualité est au cœur de notre plan appelé Childcare BC (plan en matière de services de garde d’enfants de la Colombie-Britannique). En réunissant des éducateurs à la petite enfance pour qu’ils puissent partager leurs expériences et apprendre les uns des autres, il nous est possible d’améliorer la qualité des services de garde d’enfants au profit des familles à l’échelle de la Colombie-Britannique », a affirmé Katrina Chen, ministre d’État chargée des Services de garde d’enfants. « Notre gouvernement est déterminé à aider nos professionnels de l’apprentissage et de la garde de jeunes enfants à réussir. La mise en place de programmes, comme celui-ci, accroît l’attrait et la viabilité d’une carrière en services de garde d’enfants, et est porteuse de changement pour un secteur qui a été trop longtemps négligé. »Le programme offre de nouvelles possibilités en matière de perfectionnement professionnel, autres que sous forme de formations ponctuelles, comme des ateliers, en vue de favoriser l’apprentissage continu qui mise sur le perfectionnement au quotidien, dans le cadre de programmes individuels de garde d’enfants.« En tant qu’ancienne éducatrice à la petite enfance, je sais que mon apprentissage ne s’est pas arrêté au moment où j’ai décroché mon diplôme. Tous les jours, j’ai dû adapter et affiner mes techniques d’enseignement afin d’offrir de meilleurs services aux familles qui y avaient recours », a déclaré Katrine Conroy, ministre des Enfants et du Développement de la Famille. « La mise en place de ce réseau permettra aux éducateurs à la petite enfance de collaborer, d’apprendre les uns des autres et d’intégrer de nouvelles théories en matière d’apprentissage à la petite enfance à leur pratique, pour qu’il devienne plus facile pour les familles de poursuivre leur éducation et leur carrière, tout en sachant que l’on veille à l’épanouissement et à l’inspiration de leurs enfants alors qu’ils reçoivent des services de garde. »Investir dans les services de garde d’enfants et dans l’éducation à la petite enfance est une priorité commune du gouvernement de la province et du caucus du BC Green Party. Cette priorité fait partie de l’accord de confiance et de soutien, le Confidence and Supply Agreement. Citations :Sheila Malcolmson, députée provinciale de Nanaimo –« Le fait de pouvoir compter sur plus d’éducateurs à la petite enfance dans Nanaimo se traduit par un soutien accru permettant à nos enfants de grandir et de s’épanouir. Les éducateurs à la petite enfance créent des programmes qui sont une source d’inspiration chez les enfants et qui alimentent chez eux le goût d’apprendre. »Sonia Furstenau, députée provinciale de Cowichan Valley –« Ce fut un réel plaisir de travailler avec la Dre Pacini-Ketchabaw et avec ses collègues, et d’apprendre sous leur tutelle. Je suis ravie de constater que le programme va de l’avant. L’apprentissage dans les premières années de la vie d’un enfant est d’une importance vitale, tout comme le sont les éducateurs à la petite enfance qui enseignent aux jeunes enfants de la Colombie-Britannique, et qui contribuent à leur épanouissement. Nous ne pouvons pas nous intéresser uniquement au nombre de places en service de garde que nous créons. Bien que cela soit important, nous ne devons pas oublier la nécessité de promouvoir et d’améliorer la qualité. J’ai confiance que ce programme nous permettra d’y parvenir. »Veronica Pacini-Ketchabaw, codirectrice, B.C. ECPN –« Nous souhaitons créer un système dans le cadre duquel les programmes de formation pour EPE sont élaborés à même les collectivités locales, de manière à répondre aux besoins propres à chacune d’entre elles. La mise en place de ce réseau offrira de nouvelles possibilités de perfectionnement professionnel pratique qui sont fondées sur les défis auxquels sont confrontés les EPE et sur les occasions qui s’offrent à eux. En octroyant ce financement, le gouvernement contribue à la création d’un système unifié d’apprentissage et de garde de jeunes enfants, au sein duquel tous les enfants de la Colombie-Britannique peuvent s’épanouir. »Sabrina Limas, étudiante de première année, programme de soins éducatifs à la petite enfance –« Travailler avec le pédagogue m’incite à réfléchir aux nouvelles expériences que je peux offrir aux enfants dans le cadre de mon stage. Nous examinons de nouvelles méthodes d’apprentissage et de nouveaux moyens d’utiliser la technologie. Le fait de miser sur ce soutien me permet d’améliorer l’apprentissage des enfants dont j’ai la charge, et me permet de contribuer à ce qui importe le plus – faire de ces enfants de meilleurs êtres humains. »Pour en savoir plus :Pour plus de renseignements au sujet de la stratégie de recrutement et de maintien en poste concernant la garde et l’apprentissage de la petite enfance, veuillez consulter : www.gov.bc.ca/childcare/ecestrategy (en anglais seulement)Pour en savoir plus au sujet des services de garde en Colombie-Britannique, veuillez consulter : www.gov.bc.ca/childcare (en anglais seulement)Fiche de renseignements sur les services de garde d’enfants : https://news.gov.bc.ca/18430 (en anglais seulement)Pour obtenir un document d’information sur les emplacements où seront dépêchés les pédagogues, veuillez consulter :https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Backgrounder_Early_Childhood_Pedagogy_Network.pdf (en anglais seulement)Vous trouverez ci-dessous un document d’information qui renferme des faits à l’égard de l’éducation à la petite enfance en Colombie-Britannique.

The Province is launching the next phase in its process to develop a vision for British Columbia’s coastal ferry services and is inviting British Columbians to share their views.“Significant investments are being made in ferry infrastructure, with decisions being made today defining the service long into the future,” said Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “We’re asking people what the coastal ferry service could look like in 20, 30 or 40 years, and how services should be delivered to better support people and families who live and work on our coast.”From Feb. 2 until March 20, 2020, people can share their input and feedback at: engage.gov.bc.ca/coastalferries“We’re asking people to weigh in and share their thoughts on what they would like to see for the future of ferry travel,” said Ronna-Rae Leonard, MLA for Courtenay-Comox. “Transportation needs are changing, and coastal ferries should also evolve. We want to ensure we have a system in place that is adaptable, dependable and convenient.”In October and November 2019, the Province held pre-engagement forums, attended by Trevena, to share ideas on the future of coastal ferry transportation and how ferry service could evolve. Seven meetings were held, where 130 stakeholders shared their ideas. The key themes heard at these meetings indicated that coastal ferry services should:
support efficient end-to-end travel of people and goods;
be equitable and accessible;
mitigate and be responsive to climate change; and
reflect the values of coastal communities.
The information gathered from the public engagement process will be used to develop a provincial vision to guide the future of British Columbia’s coastal ferry service.

Premier John Horgan has issued the following statement on Black History Month, February 2020:“Today we begin Black History Month, a time to honour and celebrate the stories, experiences and accomplishments of Black Canadians here in British Columbia and across the country.  “Black history is foundational to our province’s history.“We think of the contributions the jurist Mifflin Wistar Gibbs made to our province in the 1860s, as a Victoria city councillor and as a delegate to the Yale Convention – which guided us toward confederation in 1871. And we remember how, a century later, Rosemary Brown led the fight on issues of housing, employment and human rights in, and outside of, the B.C. legislature. These are just two of the many Black British Columbians who helped make our great province what it is today.“This month, I encourage everyone in British Columbia to take part in community events for Black History Month and learn about the significant efforts made by Black British Columbians to better our province.“It is the people of this province that make it strong. When we come together and celebrate our diversity, we are not only standing up to racism and discrimination, we are also building a better, stronger British Columbia.”For a French translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/2020_Black-History-Month_FR.pdf

Adrian Dix, ministre responsable des Affaires francophones et Rob Fleming, ministre de l’éducation, font la déclaration suivante au sujet des messages haineux à l’École Au-coeur-de-l’ile située à Comox sur l’ile de Vancouver:« Hier matin, les élèves sont arrivés à l’École Au-coeur-de-l’ile, qui est une école francophone, pour trouver des messages haineux et racistes peints sur les murs et le sol de l’établissement.  C’est inacceptable.« En Colombie-Britannique, nous sommes fiers de compter parmis nous des communautés riches en diversité et en culture. La diversité est une force qui joue un rôle important dans la croissance de notre pays et notre province.« Les francophones et Francophiles contribuent de façon significative à l’histoire, à l’économie et à la diversité culturelle de notre province.« C’est pourquoi les écoles en C.B. doivent être exemptes d’actes de discrimination, d’intimidation, de harcèlement et de violence.“Le Gouvernement de la Colombie-Britannique a veillé à ce que toutes les écoles de la province aient des politiques de lutte contre l’intimidation et le harcèlement, conformément au Code des Droits de la personne de la Colombie-Britannique.« Il y a des conseillers sur le terrain à l'École Au-coeur-de-l'île pour aider les élèves touchés.« Le Gouvernement de la Colombie-Britannique condamne toute forme de discrimination. Nous continuerons à nous opposer contre le racisme, la violence et la discrimination alors que nous travaillons pour bâtir une province meilleure et plus équitable pour toutes et tous. »

Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure, has issued the following statement in response to the Mayors’ Council endorsement of an inter-municipal business licence (IMBL) for ride hailing:“I would like to thank the Mayors’ Council and the TransLink Working Group for its progress in encouraging municipalities to adopt an IMBL for ride-hail companies.“This framework will streamline the business licence application process – eliminating a patchwork system across the Lower Mainland, allowing pickup and drop-off between participating municipalities. This will make it simple for Region 1 and Metro Vancouver municipalities to issue business licences to ride-hailing companies.“Yesterday, I shared that our government has been working with ICBC and the taxi industry to create a new insurance product for taxi drivers. This product will be based on the per-kilometre distance travelled and will be more affordable for the industry overall. “The independent Passenger Transportation Board is responsible for supply caps. The board has confirmed that it will monitor ride-hailing performance data and has stated that, as information becomes available, fleet size may be reassessed.“Our government continues to work to support accessible transportation options with a fee of 30 cents for every trip in a ride-hail vehicle. We are working with industry and stakeholders as fees are collected on how to best allocate these funds.“We will continue working to ensure the system works, prioritizes safety and is fair for ride hailing, the taxi industry and all road users.”

North Island College (NIC) students will have better access to state-of-the-art facilities and programs to help them become career-ready following the opening of the expanded Campbell River campus.“This campus expansion project means that students on the North Island won’t have to leave home to gain the skills they will need to participate in the economy of the future,” said Claire Trevena, MLA for the North Island. “I am pleased that the next generation of tradespeople, business leaders and health-care professionals will be able to complete their training in Campbell River.”The official opening of the $18-million project was celebrated with Claire Trevena, MLA for the North Island, on behalf of Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training; John Bowman, president, NIC; and NIC students, faculty and staff. The expansion was made possible thanks to $5.8 million from the Government of Canada’s Post-Secondary Institutions Strategic Investment Fund, $8.6 million from the Government of British Columbia and $3.6 million from NIC and its donors.“Modern learning spaces are a critical part in supporting skills development to prepare students for the jobs of today and tomorrow,” said Navdeep Bains, federal Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry. “The expansion of the Campbell River campus will help students on Vancouver Island advance the next generation of leading-edge research and innovation in Canada.”The project expanded and consolidated learning space at NIC’s Campbell River campus. All students on the campus will benefit from an expanded and updated cafeteria space, a library and learning commons, bookstore and an enhanced learning environment.“We’re thankful for the partnership between the Government of Canada, the Province of B.C. and NIC on this project,” Bowman said. “The expanded facilities at our Campbell River campus ensure we can continue to provide students an exceptional learning experience, expanded programming and will make NIC an educational destination of choice on Vancouver Island.”More than 175 students will learn in the new industrial trades facilities and culinary students will benefit from the new kitchen facilities. The expansion also includes Campbell River’s first health simulation lab, for use by practical nursing and health-care assistant students.The campus expansion will also allow for the delivery of a new computer information systems program, expanded business administration and the intake of over 80 international students.Investments through the Post-Secondary Institutions Strategic Investment Fund (SIF) are being used to modernize facilities at Canadian universities and colleges, as well as improve the energy efficiency of these facilities and reduce their impact on the environment.British Columbia has received $257 million through the Post-Secondary Institutions SIF. Twenty public post-secondary institutions and one private First Nations institution in B.C. are benefiting from 30 individual projects throughout the province.Quotes:Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training —“Having access to modern training facilities and equipment close to home means students can save more money on accommodation, food and transportation. This campus expansion will empower students in Campbell River and the northern region of Vancouver Island to get the hands-on learning experiences they need to go after rewarding career opportunities in their communities.”Tina Tang, NIC culinary alumna, chef and member of Culinary Team BC —“I wanted to come back to school just so I could learn in this kitchen. The culinary program here was extraordinary before, but this new facility really steps it up to that next level.”Quick Facts:
There is a growing demand for skilled-trades workers throughout the province, with 71,000 job openings in the trades over the next decade.
There are 11,500 expected trades openings on Vancouver Island and West Coast in the next decade.
This is the final of 30 SIF projects to be completed in B.C.
Total capital funding for all B.C. SIF projects is $710 million:
$257 million from the Government of Canada;
$278 million from the Province of British Columbia; and
$175 million from post-secondary institutions and donors.

A new protected area next to the recently established Nlhaxten/Cerise Creek Conservancy will help conserve biodiversity, support traditional Indigenous land-use activities and protect cultural landmarks.“We know Pipi7iyekw is a culturally important area for resource gathering, history and learning to the Lil’wat Nation and the St’at’imc Nation,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “Protecting it helps fulfil our land-use planning agreement commitments and makes sure that the forest will remain in place to protect their cultural values.”Pipi7iyekw (pronounced pippy yook) totals 864 hectares of old-growth forests and sensitive ecosystems within the Lillooet Timber Supply Area of the Cascades Natural Resource District. The protected designation ensures that the Lil’wat and St’at’imc Nations’ ongoing, traditional use of cultural heritage resources, such as gathering wild plants for food and botanical medicines, and culturally modified trees and artifact sites in the area, will remain unaffected by development.“Since time immemorial, the people of the Lil’wat Nation have depended on Pipi7iyekw for food, medicine, resources, teaching and to practice our culture, traditions and spirituality,” said Political Chief Dean Nelson, Lil’wat Nation. “Many people have used this area over the years and continue to. Our late Elder Morgan Wells would regularly gather plants here, so much so that it became a place known as Morgan’s Garden. Pipi7iyekw is just one of many important places within our territory that Lil’wat people actively use. We’ve worked hard with the Province to protect this area and are proud of this collective achievement.”In 2008, the Province and Lil’wat Nation entered into a land-use planning agreement associated with the Sea-to-Sky Land and Resource Management Plan. The agreement includes a commitment for Lil’wat to identify up to 2,000 hectares of “old-growth forest and sensitive areas” within its territory for protection. With the establishment of Pipi7iyekw, more than two-thirds of the committed area has been established as protected area.“Last fall, we passed legislation to implement the United Nations’ Declaration, recognizing in law the human rights of Indigenous peoples,” said Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. “As stewards of the land since time immemorial, an important part of reconciliation is to work with Nations on decisions that affect their territories — and as government, we make better decisions when we incorporate the wisdom and guidance that First Nations have to offer.”Pipi7iyekw’s legal designation removes 0.2% from the Lillooet Timber Supply Area’s timber harvesting land base — the area where timber harvesting is legally and economically feasible. As a protected area, it will, in the long term:
maintain representative examples of old-condition, forested stands in culturally and ecologically important areas;
maintain habitat for old-growth-dependent species;
maintain recruitment habitat for cultural cedar and other culturally important species; and
maintain culturally and ecologically important ecosystems, including, but not limited to, riparian areas, red- and blue-listed species habitat, and traditional and cultural use sites.
Existing infrastructure, such as highways and associated buildings, is not affected. Exceptions on timber harvesting also remain to address forest health concerns, such as insect infestations or disease, and to remove safety hazards within road right-of-ways, recreation sites and trails.Learn More:Find out more about the Lil’wat Nation: https://lilwat.caThe minister’s order and a map of Pipi7iyekw is available: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and-industry/natural-resource-use/land-water-use/crown-land/land-use-plans-and-objectives/thompsonokanagan-region/lillooet-lrmp/lillooet_lrmp_luor_30jan2020.pdfInformation on Nlhaxten/Cerise Creek Conservancy is available: http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/cnsrvncy/nlhaxten-cerise-crk

Indigenous families, individuals and Elders will soon have new affordable rental homes in their community as the Westbank First Nation (WFN) and the Province partner to build 17 homes on the Westbank reserve.“Our Council strives to ensure that all WFN Members are afforded housing opportunities that meet current needs and our long-term housing goals,” said Chief Christopher Derickson, WFN. “We are very pleased with both housing projects that will be developed in partnership with BC Housing on Falcon Lane and Fox Road. Providing 17 new housing options allows us to continue to support our Membership with affordable housing while working towards our long-term vision of revitalizing our community core.”In 2018, B.C. became the first province to invest in on-reserve housing for First Nations people through the Indigenous Housing Fund, a $550-million investment over 10 years to build and operate 1,750 new homes, both on- and off- reserve. These homes with the WFN are part of the first series of projects that were selected in November 2018 to receive funding through the Indigenous Housing Fund.“Housing is the foundation on which people build their lives. With these homes, more WFN Members will be able to stay in their home community, surrounded by their culture and tradition,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “Our government is proud to be working in partnership with First Nations, Indigenous leaders and Indigenous housing providers to build much-needed new, affordable homes like these for Indigenous peoples throughout B.C.”The first complex, a two-storey apartment building at 1920 Falcon Lane, will include 14 apartments for WFN Members. The building will have a mix of one- and two-bedroom units, with the ground floor and two-bedroom units serving Elders and Members who require an accessible layout. Monthly rents are projected to be $400 per month for the eight one-bedroom units and $570 per month for the six two-bedroom units. The Province is providing a $2.8-million grant through the Indigenous Housing Fund for the project, as well as an annual operating subsidy.Located at 1910 Fox Rd., the second complex will include three townhomes for Member families.

Coastal logging contractors affected by the ongoing labour dispute between the United Steel Workers and Western Forest Products can now apply for bridging loans to help them make payments on their logging equipment.The provincial government established the $5-million Coast Logging Equipment Support Trust (CLEST) on Jan. 16, 2020, to help avert foreclosure of logging equipment on the coast. Through the trust, eligible independent coastal logging contractors will be able to borrow bridging funds.Earlier this month, the Province appointed Eric van Soeren as independent trustee with full oversight of the CLEST. In this role, van Soeren will be responsible for all financial decisions for the trust, independent from government. The trust will provide qualified applicants with long-term loans at commercial rates for their eligible logging equipment assets.  Van Soeren will undertake all financial assessments and negotiate the structure of the loans. Eligible coastal logging contractors (applicants) who are approved for funding through the CLEST will not receive money directly. The trustee will co-ordinate all loan payments with the leaseholders, financial institutions and equipment companies for logging equipment that is in arrears. Eligibility and application details for the CLEST are available online: www.clest.ca

Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture, has released the following statement celebrating three decades of BC VQA wines:“Over the last 30 years B.C. grape growers and winemakers have worked with the BC Wine Institute and the British Columbia Vintners Quality Alliance’s (BC VQA) certification and label to achieve amazing results. They have seen the growth of B.C. wines from a small, unrecognized industry, to a strong and respected brand, enjoyed throughout our province, country and world.“BC VQA wines have a maturity well beyond their years, and have grown to include almost 300 wineries and 1,000 vineyards, creating jobs and supporting tourism in communities throughout the province. The B.C. government is proud to support the family-run vineyards and wineries that continue to produce award-winning wines in our province and partner with them to help market B.C. wine locally and internationally, as well as creating resources and programs to support winemaking and grape growing in B.C.“The sector has grown through the emergence of the BC VQA designation as a trusted symbol of quality and the hard work and dedication of the BC Wine Institute. The institute has spent three decades introducing, explaining and sharing the B.C. wine experience with locals and visitors. From helping them learn about B.C. terroir and local food pairings, to exploring our designated wine regions, they have been tireless as advocates and champions of our province’s winemakers and wines. I want to acknowledge that and thank them for it.“In the last 30 years, we have enjoyed B.C. wine at meals and celebrations with family and friends. It is only fitting that as we celebrate this anniversary of VQA, we share a toast to the people who built winemaking in B.C. and those who continue to work in our award-winning wine industry. Happy 30th and many more to come!”

The B.C. government is increasing funding available to farmers in crisis.“When disaster strikes, farmers can’t afford to wait for help,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “Whether it be wildfires, army worms, devastating weather conditions for grain or extreme market-price fluctuations, we are making changes to better help farmers when they most need it.”New funding for the B.C. AgriStability Enhancement Program means that up to an additional $9 million is available for qualifying farmers over the next two years.AgriStability is a national program providing protection to Canadian agricultural producers against large declines that threaten the viability of their farms and are beyond their capacity to manage. The B.C. AgriStability Enhancement Program is available to B.C. farmers who were enrolled in 2019 and those who enrol in 2020.“We are increasing the compensation rate from 70% to 80%, which means that every payment in 2019 and 2020 from AgriStability will be increased by 14.3%,” Popham said. “Currently, farms with the widest margins receive the least support. We are eliminating the reference margin limit and that will address this problem.”B.C. farmers already participating in AgriStability will automatically receive the increased protection. Those who are not participating can still enrol for 2020. There are no additional enrolment requirements beyond what is normally required to participate.The changes announced on Jan. 30, 2020, will complement B.C.’s ongoing work with the federal, provincial and territorial partners to improve AgriStability nationally. The next meeting is in Ontario in the summer.Quick Facts:
The B.C. AgriStability Enhancement Program:
eliminates reference margin limits, thereby increasing support; and
increases the compensation paid from 70% to 80% when margins fall below the 30% payment threshold.

Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure, has issued the following statement outlining new government initiatives designed to benefit the passenger transportation industry and passengers:“As part of our continued efforts to ensure fairness and opportunity for those who make a living in the passenger transportation industry and the passengers they carry, I am pleased to share two additional government initiatives.“For the past several months, our government has been working with ICBC and the taxi industry to create a new insurance product option for taxi drivers. The insurance product will be based on the per-kilometre distance travelled with passengers aboard and is equivalent to what is available for ride-hailing vehicles.“In the near future, taxi drivers who want this new product will be able to switch their insurance, with coverage beginning in the spring. Drivers who wish to keep their current form of coverage will not be affected.“Secondly, the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure is talking with representatives from the taxi industry and other stakeholders to determine how to ensure funds from the 30-cents-per-trip fee being charged on ride hailing will help support a sustained and improved level of accessible vehicles on the road.“I want to thank all those who have been in contact with my office on these issues, particularly my colleagues in the legislative assembly who have been strong advocates for their constituents.“While efforts continue to ensure safety and fairness, I am proud that our government refused to back down against pressures to abandon our regulatory measures on ride hailing.

B.C.’s Food Security Task Force has provided recommendations to government outlining new ways to use technology and innovation to strengthen B.C.’s economy and the agriculture sector, today and for generations to come.“The recommendations released today by the Food Security Task Force will help grow more food and more jobs in B.C.’s strong agriculture sector,” said Premier John Horgan. “By embracing innovation and using new technologies, we can make sure our province is supplying a bounty of delicious and affordable food to people for generations to come. I thank the members of the task force for their work on this important report.”  The task force’s findings include:
applying the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals to agricultural policies;
establishing an incubation/acceleration strategy for B.C.’s agritech sector;
creating an agriculture and agritech institute in B.C. in partnership with post-secondary institutions; and
reviewing land-use planning policies and regulations to ensure B.C.’s agritech sector has a place to grow.
“Our government recognizes the tremendous potential of applying new technologies to agriculture to help strengthen the sector,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “Targeted initiatives, such as the Agritech Innovation Challenge, ongoing connections with major strategic agritech cluster areas, regional food innovation hubs and cost-shared funding through the Canadian Agriculture Partnership align with the recommendations of the task force and will help the agriculture industry continue to thrive in British Columbia.”The three-member task force was led by Peter Dhillon as chair, with Arvind Gupta and Lenore Newman. The task force was mandated to make recommendations that support food security and the economic growth of B.C.’s agricultural sector, focusing on the following three areas:
Using technology and innovation to increase competitiveness, efficiency and profitability.
Growing the agritech industry as a standalone economic sector capable of developing technologies that will be applicable both locally and globally.
Supporting the development and application of technologies that can protect the industry against the effects of climate change and support environmentally sustainable agricultural practices.
Raghwa Gopal, president and CEO, Innovate BC, participated on the task force as an ex-officio member.“We are excited to have the report released to the public and hope that British Columbians will take an interest in thinking about how the future of our food system has significant potential to provide a consistent, high-quality and affordable supply of food anywhere in the province, all year round,” said Dhillon. “Our recommendations are intended to build on B.C.’s bold leadership in protecting the environment and help increase food security in the face of climate change.”From July 11 to Oct. 15, 2019, British Columbians were invited to share their views on ways in which B.C. can harness new technologies and innovations to efficiently produce more food, jobs and prosperity, while reducing waste. Almost 450 people, ranging from farmers, consumers and others involved in the industry, participated in the online survey. The task force also met in-person with over 100 people from the agriculture industry, as well as the business and academic communities in B.C. and elsewhere. This input was considered as part of the task force’s final report.“Technology opens up exciting possibilities for the future of food production in B.C.,” said Michelle Mungall, Minister of Jobs, Economic Development and Competitiveness. “With a strong tech sector and top-notch talent, we are well positioned to develop solutions that advance agriculture in our province and enhance economic prosperity for everyone.”Quick Facts:

People in communities throughout British Columbia will soon benefit from expanded composting facilities that will reduce the amount of organic material sent to B.C. landfills, create jobs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To ensure B.C. communities are clean and healthy places to live, the Province is partnering with the federal and local governments on the new Organics Infrastructure Program. The $30-million program will help communities expand their infrastructure, diverting organic waste away from landfills. It will also help the Province meet its CleanBC commitment to help communities achieve 95% organic waste diversion for agricultural, industrial and municipal waste.“This program will help communities, the Province and Canada meet our shared climate action goals,” said George Heyman, B.C.'s Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “It will also help build B.C.’s clean economy by creating green jobs and setting the stage for the economic opportunities that come from the reuse of organic materials.” Organic waste currently represents 40% of material sent to municipal landfills in B.C. and generates 7.5% of the province's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In total, the projects are expected to reduce nearly 300,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent over the next decade. This is like removing more than 100,000 cars from the roads for a year.“Investing in better infrastructure for waste management will divert organic waste from municipal landfills and turn it into clean and useful compost,” said Jonathan Wilkinson, federal Minister of Environment and Climate Change. “Initiatives such as this one are key to fighting climate change and helping us reach net-zero emissions by 2050. I congratulate the Province of British Columbia for its leadership in this effort.”The Organics Infrastructure Program combines $10 million in federal funding from the Low Carbon Economy Leadership Fund, $10 million from the Province and $10 million in matching funds from local government applicants and their partners. Among the projects are two from the Central Kootenay Regional District — Central landfill composting facility and the Creston landfill composting facility — that, together, provide the region with food-waste processing capacity for the first time. Another recipient is the Northern Rockies Regional Municipality’s worm composting facility. It will divert organic waste from Fort Nelson's landfill and create high-quality soil.“These new projects will improve organics diversion across the province,” said Maja Tait, president, Union of B.C. Municipalities. “The result will be reduced GHG emissions from landfills, moving the needle forward in the attainment of CleanBC goals. I am very appreciative of the continuing support provided by the federal and provincial governments to expand organics infrastructure in B.C. communities.”Twelve projects have finalized agreements to date. Additional projects are expected to come on board in the coming months. The initial projects are expected to break ground starting in the spring.CleanBC is the province's pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. It was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus, and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s emission targets.Learn More:For more information on the Organics Infrastructure Program, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/waste-management/food-and-organic-waste/organic-waste-diversion/organics-infrastructure-programA backgrounder follows.

The Province is delivering close to 250 new affordable rental homes for people in the Kelowna region.Construction is beginning on two rental developments, and families have moved into a newly completed townhome complex.“People deserve safe and secure homes, but even middle-income people like teachers and small business owners have struggled to find affordable housing in the Kelowna area,” said Selina Robinson, B.C.'s Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “These new homes will mean that people – from young families to seniors – can stay in their community, close to their friends and family.”Construction has started on a four-storey building at 1060 Cawston Ave. that will provide 40 affordable rental homes for low- to middle-income individuals, families, and women and children. This project is a partnership between the governments of Canada and B.C., the City of Kelowna and NOW Canada Society. Monthly rents are projected to range from $375 for a studio to approximately $1,835 for a three-bedroom rental.Work is also underway on Carrington View, which will provide 186 new rental homes for people with middle incomes. The Province, through BC Housing’s HousingHub, is partnering with Highstreet Ventures to deliver net-zero energy-ready homes, built to Step 4 of the provincial Energy Step Code, for households making between $50,000 and $100,000 each year. Projected monthly rents for the studio, one- and two-bedroom homes range from approximately $1,210 to $1,590. Located at 2200 Majoros Rd. in West Kelowna, the development will consist of three four-storey apartment buildings.As well, the Province partnered with the City of Kelowna and the Society of Hope to build 21 affordable rental homes at 165 Celano Cres. Families moved into their new homes in November 2019, and all of the homes are fully occupied. Monthly rents for the development, named Providence Boulevard, are $915 for a two-bedroom townhome and $1,100 for a three-bedroom townhome.These projects are part of more than 22,000 new homes that are complete or underway around the province, including over 1,200 in the Kelowna area, as part of the Homes for B.C. housing plan.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Ahmed Hussen, federal Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister Responsible for the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation –“Through the National Housing Co-Investment Fund, our government is investing in affordable housing here in Kelowna and across Canada to help create jobs and improve quality of life for those who need it most. NOW Canada Society’s project at 1060 Cawston Ave. will also focus on housing for women and their children, who are a core target group identified by the National Housing Strategy. These 40 new homes will add much-needed affordable housing capacity to this community.”Colin Basran, mayor, City of Kelowna –“The rental vacancy rate and costs in Kelowna makes it a struggle for many to pay market rents due to supply and demand. That’s why these developments are so important, adding to the ‘missing middle’ of housing inventory identified in the city’s 2017 Housing Needs Analysis.”Liz Talbott, executive director, NOW Canada Society –“NOW Canada is delighted to be partnering with all levels of government to create more affordable housing for Kelowna residents. This is another step forward in addressing the lack of housing for people with low to moderate incomes in our region.”Scott Butler, president, Highstreet Ventures –“Highstreet is excited to make Step 4 of the Energy Step Code a reality for affordable rentals, 12 years ahead of the provincial requirement. We’re demonstrating to the industry that we can build a sustainable community at a reasonable cost of $185 per square foot. We’re pleased to see that the Province is supporting affordable housing.”Luke Stack, executive director, the Society of Hope –“Our society is so pleased to partner with BC Housing and the City of Kelowna to deliver quality affordable housing to working families.

The Forest Enhancement Society of BC has allocated another $2,737,764 in grants for four projects that will support forestry contractors and increase the use of wood fibre that otherwise would have been burned.Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development, made the announcement at the Western Forestry Contractors’ Association conference in Prince George on Jan. 30, 2020.“Our government’s focus is creating jobs in the forest sector by getting the most out of the fibre that comes out of our public forests,” said Donaldson. “Our partnership with the Forest Enhancement Society of BC is making sure that more fibre gets turned into viable products — supporting good jobs in rural B.C. — and less is left on the forest floor.”These projects will turn wood waste from slash piles into wood pellets and pulp products, and they will help achieve B.C.’s and Canada’s climate change targets. The grants are being allocated as follows:
$408,320 to Skeena Bioenergy Ltd. to use material from slash piles to make wood pellets (about 22,000 cubic metres or 440 truckloads) in the Coast Mountains Natural Resource District.
$1,080,000 to Taan Forest Products to use material from slash piles to make pulp for use in paper products (about 51,000 cubic metres or 1,020 truckloads) in the Haida Gwaii Natural Resource District.
$880,000 to Skookumchuck Pulp Inc. to use material from slash piles to make pulp for use in paper products (about 110,000 cubic metres or 2,200 truckloads) in the Rocky Mountain Natural Resource District.
$369,450 to RPP Holdings Inc. to use material from slash piles to make pulp for use in paper products (about 36,000 cubic metres or 720 truckloads) in the Quesnel Natural Resource District.
As of Jan. 30, 2020, the Forest Enhancement Society of BC has supported 250 projects valued at $233 million, in partnership with the B.C. government and the Government of Canada.“As I’ve travelled around the province, I’ve seen first-hand how these grants from the Forest Enhancement Society of BC are making a difference in our communities,” said Ravi Kahlon, Parliamentary Secretary for Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “It’s encouraging to see wood debris diverted from slash piles and used to make value-added products instead.”Projects funded by the Forest Enhancement Society of BC help minimize wildfire risks, enhance wildlife habitat, improve low-value and damaged forests, re-plant damaged forests and utilize fibre for green energy production. Many of these projects also result in carbon benefits and contribute to climate change mitigation.“Assisting the Province to reduce greenhouse gases, add value to forest fibre and maintain jobs for workers and communities are some of our key objectives,” said Wayne Clogg, board chair, Forest Enhancement Society of BC. “There are many society-funded projects throughout B.C. that are making a difference right now. The amount of biomass (woody debris) that will not be burned as slash — but instead used this winter season to fuel a greener economy — is expected to exceed 1.6 million cubic metres by March 2020. Funding has been committed to continue some of these projects to 2022 to further help forest workers and communities who are most in need.”Quick Facts:
The Forest Enhancement Society of BC is a Crown agency. It was established in 2016 to advance the environmental and resource stewardship of the province’s forests by:
preventing wildfires and mitigating wildfire impacts;
improving damaged or low-value forests;
improving wildlife habitat;
supporting the use of fibre from damaged or low-value forests; and
treating forests to improve the management of greenhouse gases.

The B.C. government has invested $235 million in the Forest Enhancement Society of BC, which has supported 250 projects to date related to wildfire risk reduction, reforestation, forest rehabilitation, wildlife habitat restoration and raising awareness of the FireSmart program.
The Forest Enhancement Society of BC is a partner in the Forest Carbon Initiative, which is funded in part through the federal government’s Low Carbon Economy Leadership Fund. This initiative assists with B.C. government priorities, such as:
revitalizing the forest sector;
partnering with First Nations;
supporting the Province’s CleanBC commitment to transition to a low-carbon economy; and
providing economic benefits for rural communities.

The economic certainty that will come from this co-operative relationship will pave the way toward economic prosperity for all communities in the North.""Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation –“This agreement will help stimulate business ventures and social enterprise in the area, which will lead to regional spinoffs, more employment opportunities and certainty for everyone in the region. It also includes important supports for Carrier Sekani Nations to establish comprehensive self-government structures and processes that will be critical for moving forward as self-determining Nations.”Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations, and Rural Development –“This agreement provides unprecedented forestry certainty with the largest collective of First Nations people that government has signed a reconciliation agreement with, and whose territories are in the heart of forestry in the Interior. Bringing predictability to the forest sector in this region not only benefits the Carrier Sekani Nations – it also benefits other forestry operators in the area.”Bruce Ralston, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources –“Our government is committed to doing resource development the right way, ensuring it creates jobs and opportunities, benefits local communities and advances reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. Mining and energy projects are key to growing B.C.’s economy, and this historic agreement will provide significant new investments to support economic development across the region.”Chief Alexander McKinnon, Nak'azdli Whut'en – “The Pathways Forward Agreement is a step in the right direction in implementing UNDRIP. It is a step forward out from the darkness of the ugly history of the relationship we had with governments. It is a step forward in giving us back our rightful spot in society as strong, vibrant, governing people of our unceded and unsurrendered lands. It is a step towards true reconciliation. The work does not stop here – the heavy lifting and hard work begins now. We will continue to work to create certainty for all governments; we will continue to work towards strong regional economic stability. This is not only a win for First Nations, it is a win for industry, B.C. and for all Canadians. This agreement, along with future agreements, will be built on respect, unity, transparency and accountability for all, keeping in mind the economy, the culture, our stewardship and our governance.”Dolores Funk, mayor, Village of Burns Lake – “Congratulations to the Carrier Sekani First Nations and the provincial government for the successful negotiation of this historic agreement. My hope is that this agreement builds strong, healthy relationships and partnerships that result in better communities for all.”Gerry Thiessen, mayor, Vanderhoof – “As we go through reconciliation, we find places that will make a significant difference. To see seven First Nations sign an agreement of this magnitude is incredible. This will build First Nations economically and will be a great step forward. We in Vanderhoof really look forward to the future of the Carrier Sekani First Nations and the region as a whole.”Sarrah Storey, mayor, Village of Fraser Lake – “On behalf of the Village of Fraser Lake, we want to congratulate the Carrier Sekani and the seven communities on finalizing this agreement. We are excited to see the economic, social and reconciliation opportunities that will unfold over the course of this agreement. What happens in one community impacts the next, supporting our neighbours and friends, and working together will truly add to the strength and sustainability of our region and province.”Lyn Hall, mayor, Prince George – “Meaningful advancement of reconciliation is always a reason for celebration. As mayor of Prince George and on behalf of council, I congratulate the Carrier Sekani First Nations and the Government of British Columbia on the signing of the Pathways Forward 2.0 Agreement.”Quick Facts:
The seven Carrier Sekani First Nations are the Stellat'en First Nation, Nadleh Whut'en, Ts'il Kaz Koh First Nation (Burns Lake Band), Saik'uz First Nation, Nak'azdli Whut'en, Takla Nation and Tl'azt'en Nation.

Technical excellence and innovation were honoured at the 2020 B.C. Highways Consulting Engineers Awards on Jan. 28, 2020, in Vancouver.The categories for this year’s awards included design and contract preparation for roads, design and contract preparation for structures, construction management and supervision services, specialized engineering services and alternate transportation.Design and contract preparation – roadsThe winner in this category is ISL Engineering and Land Services for its work on the North Fork Bridge Replacement and Four-Laning project on the Trans-Canada Highway, approximately 28 kilometres east of Sicamous. The old North Fork Bridge was built in 1958 and was the last remaining metal-truss bridge along Highway 1. ISL worked with a ministry structural engineering team to replace the two-lane narrow steel truss bridge with a new, 66-metre, four-lane concrete bridge.ISL came up with a creative design to allow construction of a westbound structure while traffic remained on the existing bridge. This allowed an eastbound structure to be constructed after traffic shifted to the newly built bridge. The project also included 1.7 kilometres of new frontage roads and two new protected T-intersections. This work boosts capacity and safety for people travelling along this corridor.Design and contract preparation – structuresThe top honour in this category went to Stantec Consulting Ltd. for its work on the Nass River Bridge Replacement on Highway 37, approximately 76 kilometres east of Stewart. This project demonstrated engineering excellence with the construction of a new two-lane, approximately 130-metre bridge to span the Nass River. This replaced the former single-lane bridge.The new bridge meets modern design criteria for heavy industry routes, set to accommodate large transport trucks. The design had to consider the remote northern location of the bridge in conjunction with the shortened construction season and logistics when rocky terrain and varying rock quality posed challenges.Construction management and supervision servicesThe award in this category went to WSP Canada Inc. for extraordinary construction supervision on the Highway 1 Mountain Highway Interchange project in North Vancouver. The project includes a new, improved alignment and the construction of a full interchange two kilometres north of the Ironworkers Memorial Bridge, which will significantly shorten commute times and improve safety for drivers, pedestrians and cyclists on the North Shore. As crews worked on this project, the Mountain Highway Interchange was constrained by steep terrain and tight work spaces. WSP was instrumental in ensuring the contractor managed its work efficiently and safely. WSP did an excellent job monitoring the operation and safety of traffic management plans, detour plans, temporary pedestrian and cycling connections, intersection operations and lane closures.Specialized engineering servicesThe top honour in this category went to R. F. Binnie & Associates Ltd. for the Alex Fraser Bridge Capacity Improvement project on Highway 91 in Delta. This project involved adding a seventh lane to the bridge, along with a moveable barrier system and a zipper truck, which is being used to create counterflow for traffic during peak times.Binnie’s quality management processes provided an efficient and seamless transition from project development, through design and into construction. The new zipper system is unique to Western Canada. It is making a difference for the almost 120,000 people who drive across the Alex Fraser Bridge every day.Alternate transportationThe recipient of this award is AECOM Canada Ltd. for the Commercial Broadway SkyTrain upgrade in Vancouver. This is Canada’s first dual platform transit station within Metro Vancouver’s busiest transit hub, with approximately 150,000 commuters on a typical weekday.AECOM’s station design includes universal fare gates, two new elevators, four new escalators, wayfinding tiles and handrail upgrades to ensure a safe and convenient station for people with accessibility challenges. This project represented several engineering firsts for TransLink and a significant investment in this busy transit hub. The upgrades serve transit riders daily and enhance capacity, safety, efficiency and accessibility for this key interchange station.Learn More:2020 B.C.

Government is making changes to help ensure that ICBC is more transparent and accountable to its customers.The purpose is to give British Columbians greater confidence that the corporation is treating them fairly when challenges arise, while better supporting people injured in crashes.Government will be taking steps to appoint a new fairness office – focused on customer fairness – that is more independent from ICBC. The office will be required to report out publicly, in plain language, on the type and number of issues it hears, along with recommendations to ICBC. ICBC will also be required to report publicly on actions it takes to respond to these recommendations.“British Columbians should have the peace of mind that they will be treated fairly after they’ve been injured in a crash,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “With this change, British Columbians can have confidence that the fairness office has greater independence from ICBC and has the impartial authority to review the fairness of their situation with the ability to make recommendations to ICBC.”The fairness office will be appointed by cabinet and be independent from ICBC’s claims arm. This office will review and make recommendations to ICBC to resolve individual customer complaints, as well as policy and process, related to customer fairness. The new office will be in place by spring 2021.The fairness office does not overlap with the role of the ombudsperson, who continues to have independent authority to resolve ICBC issues.The Civil Resolution Tribunal (CRT) will continue to resolve disputes for ICBC claims of $50,000 and under, separate from the courts and independent of ICBC. When there is a disagreement between the customer and ICBC on certain decisions made by ICBC (e.g., matters involving minor injury determinations, accident benefit entitlement and fault determinations or claimed amounts $50,000 and under) the matter will be decided by the CRT, rather than the fairness office.“Each of our three million customers should have confidence in knowing that they’ll be treated fairly when they deal with us, and we welcome the fairness office to assist in that regard,” said Nicolas Jimenez, president and CEO, ICBC. “British Columbians must also have the opportunity to tell us directly about how ICBC can be improved, and I believe today’s changes will give our customers confidence in knowing that when they speak up, ICBC will be listening and accountable to them.”Additional reforms to improve how ICBC is accountable to its customers will include:
a requirement to produce a customer-friendly summary of its annual report directly to its customers and in plain language, so that people can see how their premium dollars are spent;
enhancing ICBC’s existing customer panel to provide more British Columbians a greater opportunity to offer input on a wider range of topics, including future changes at the corporation; and
improving online services for booking road tests.
Another change that will be made by government to build trust and better support people who have been injured in a motor vehicle accident is pre-litigation payments. For those who are injured and qualify, ICBC will be offering pre-litigation payments up front without the need to waive the ability to sue if they so choose. Previously, if a person decided to take ICBC’s settlement, they had to agree to not seek additional settlement money through the courts.The intent of this program is to help injured customers receive full and fair compensation as quickly as possible. It will also help those injured keep more of their settlement, instead of paying it to lawyer and legal fees, which can total as much as 33% of the total settlement and can require a lengthy court process.The ability for ICBC to offer pre-litigation payments will take effect as of Jan. 29, 2020, and will be formalized through legislation in spring 2020. The new fairness office will be formalized in legislation in fall 2020. Government will monitor all of the aforementioned changes to ensure ICBC continues to be accountable to its customers and all British Columbians.

Hundreds more Vancouver students will soon be learning in a safe school as seismic upgrades are coming to David Livingstone Elementary.“Nothing is more important than the safety of our students,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “We’re working hard to give every student a seismically safe place to go to school, and we’re making great progress, with 41 schools approved for upgrades in just two and a half years.”The Government of B.C. is providing up to $17.3 million for seismic upgrades at David Livingstone Elementary, which are expected to begin in fall 2021 and to be completed in spring 2023.“People in our community have been waiting for David Livingstone Elementary to be upgraded, so we can be sure that children will be protected at school,” said Mable Elmore, MLA for Vancouver-Kensington. “This school has been a great hub for our community for over a century, and with these upgrades, it will be able to continue to serve local families for decades to come.”The school was first built in 1913 and is rated as having a high risk of damage in a major earthquake. When the upgrades are complete, parents will benefit from the comfort of knowing their children will be learning in a seismically safe school.“We are pleased to be closer in ensuring all our students are in seismically safe schools,” said Janet Fraser, chair of the Vancouver School Board. “We’re grateful for ministry funding to upgrade Livingstone Elementary.”Suzanne Hoffman, superintendent, Vancouver School Board, said, “We want to move our students into seismically safe schools as quickly as possible. This announcement brings us one step closer to ensuring current and future Livingstone students will be in an upgraded school in the event of an earthquake.”This investment is part of the Province’s work to accelerate the Seismic Mitigation Program and provide safe spaces for students throughout B.C. as soon as possible.Since September 2017, the Province has announced $900 million for seismic upgrades or replacements, giving nearly 25,000 B.C. students a seismically safe school. This includes $289 million to upgrade or replace 11 schools in Vancouver, for a total of over 6,500 safe seats.To continue this momentum, Budget 2019 includes a record $791 million over three years for seismic upgrades throughout B.C.

More B.C. ingredients are coming to the nearly five million meals served in hospitals and care facilities in Fraser Health, resulting in more local food for people and expanding an important market for B.C. farmers, ranchers and food processors.“Hospitals and other government facilities offer B.C.’s farmers, ranchers and food processors a significant market with exciting growth potential,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “I’m so pleased Fraser Health is working closely with the government’s Feed BC program to grow the amount of B.C. food served in its facilities. We are seeing an increase in the amount of local food served in B.C.’s hospitals and care facilities already, and we are just getting started.”To help B.C. farmers and processors navigate the complex food supply system and sell their products to provincial government facilities, the ministry is providing much-needed information and guidance, including on-farm food-safety training, new technology and business advice. To date, over 200 B.C. food and agriculture businesses have participated in business-development related training offered through Feed BC, building their capacity and readiness to sell to public facilities.“I am proud to recognize Fraser Health and other health authorities, including Interior Health, which has led the way in offering B.C.-grown produce and foods in its facilities,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “It’s a big shift, and it has adapted and developed excellent strategies to prioritize B.C. in food services.”Fraser Health delivers a wide range of health-care services to more than 1.8 million people living in communities stretching from Burnaby to Hope and operates 12 acute care hospitals and a number of long-term care facilities. While procuring B.C. foods is a priority for health authorities, protecting the health and safety of vulnerable patients is paramount. All food products, including B.C. produced and processed foods, must comply with the highest standards for food safety, nutrition, allergens and traceability.Quotes:Parm Bains, president and CEO, Westberry Farms – “As a farmer in B.C., Feed BC is opening new lines of business that will boost sales and get local food to more people around the province. This opportunity means a lot to the industry and I am looking forward to watching its continued success.”Dr. Victoria Lee, president and CEO, Fraser Health –“We’re excited to partner with the B.C. government and local producers to provide more fresh and local food to our patients and residents. Good nutrition plays a fundamental part of a person’s health, well-being and recovery and is complimentary to the care we provide.”Lisa Beare, MLA for Maple Ridge-Pitt Meadows – “Feed BC is creating more opportunities for the region’s farmers and helping grow the local economy. An initiative like this really pulls the community together to help bring more B.C. food to patients and residents in Fraser Health facilities.”Bob D’Eith, MLA for Maple Ridge-Mission –“Farmers and processors in B.C. now have the government support needed to help them get their products to patients and residents in hospitals and long-term care facilities like Fraser Health, helping connect the community to B.C.’s agriculture industry and the people who grow their food.”   Quick Facts:
Interior Health was first to introduce Feed BC in its health-care facilities and received support to implement strategies to increase its purchase of local foods starting in 2019.
Health authorities have found success in purchasing and using more B.C. food by introducing more local and seasonal fruit, vegetables and salads; offering a wider variety of local baked goods and sandwich options; and making more items from scratch when possible.
In 2018, B.C.’s agriculture, seafood and food-processing sectors hit record revenues of $15 billion.
B.C. food consumption accounted for $6.5 billion, showing strong local support for B.C. food products.

More than 2,000 new jobs were created in 2017, bringing the total number of people working in B.C.’s agriculture industry in 2018 to more than 63,000.
In 2018, B.C. food product sales reached $4.5 billion in international exports and more than $6 billion domestically.

The Province has selected Morneau Shepell to develop a free mental health counselling and referral service for post-secondary students throughout British Columbia.After a rigorous procurement process, Morneau Shepell was chosen to create and operate a 24/7 mental health counselling and referral service for post-secondary students at all public and private post-secondary institutions in B.C. The company will provide on-demand, immediate counselling and referral support to almost half a million students in B.C.’s public and private post-secondary institutions. “Mental health is an issue our government takes seriously,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “Post-secondary students have told me there is a gap in mental heath support services. The stress students feel at university or college can be significant, and can lead to serious isolation and potentially deadly outcomes. I am proud our government is responding to this call to action by creating a place for students to reach out for help 24/7.”This mental health service will mean for the first time in B.C., every student – whether rural, urban, domestic, international, public, private, full-time or part-time – will have access to 24/7 services to supplement services on campus and in the community. As this provincewide program is a new service, the ministry will take the time to engage with students and post-secondary institutions on the design of the service before launch in spring 2020.“Many students don’t come forward and ask for the help they need because of the stigma that still surrounds mental health issues,” said Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions. “This service will meet young people where they are at and provide them immediate access to someone to talk to, without shame or judgement.” Morneau Shepell administers the largest clinical network in Canada. It has delivered mental health solutions since 1974 and services more than 20,000 organizations world-wide. Morneau Shepell supports more than 3,800 clients across all services in B.C. and more than 200 post-secondary institutions across North America, directly and via partnerships, through its student support programs.The three-year contract has a budget of $1.5 million per year.Improving mental health in schools is an integral part of government’s actions outlined in A Pathway to Hope, B.C.’s roadmap for making the system of mental health and addictions care better for people no matter where they live in the province.Implementing A Pathway to Hope is a shared priority with the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.

Up to 25 British Columbians who have been affected by the downturn in the forest sector will receive training and work experience in asphalt paving and heavy construction, thanks to more than $450,000 in provincial government funding.“We know that heavy equipment operators and similar construction occupations will be in great demand over the next 10 years,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “The provincial government is working with industry and unions to hire trainees and provide training for new career path opportunities that will allow British Columbians to support themselves and their families.”The International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE) Local 115, in partnership with Emil Anderson Construction, Dawson Blacktop and Dawson Group, is delivering road-building and heavy-construction training programs for people from the Clearwater, Merritt, South Cariboo and Kamloops areas.“Providing new skills to workers is a much-needed solution to addressing the worker shortage in B.C.,” said Brian Cochrane, business manager, IUOE Local 115. “The IUOE Local 115 is a leader in teaching new workers heavy equipment operating skills and is proud to be working with the B.C. government to train them to rise above in B.C.’s Interior communities.” Participants' training will include classroom instruction in computer and communications skills, technical training in asphalt paving and heavy equipment operations, on-the-job work experience with an IUOE Local 115 signatory employer, and follow-up support and mentoring to help participants find jobs in the road-building and heavy-construction industry.“Our priority is supporting workers and their families when it comes to the challenges facing British Columbia’s forestry sector,” said Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “Training and employment opportunities like this help impacted workers expand their skills and open up more job options for them, enabling them to support themselves and their families.”The Roadworks in the B.C. Interior Project Based Labour Market Training (PBLMT) project is recruiting for Feb. 18 and April 6, 2020, start dates in Kamloops and 100 Mile House. There are spaces for 25 participants in the two projects. Anyone interested in applying or attending an information session can contact their local WorkBC centre or IUOE Training Association: IUOEtraining@iuoe115.ca“We are making investments in the Interior to support the forestry workers, their families and communities impacted by the challenges facing our forestry sector,” said Ravi Kahlon, Parliamentary Secretary for Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development. “This employment program will help meet the immediate needs facing many forestry workers and provide them with additional employment opportunities.”Quick Facts:
The Ministry of Social Development and Poverty Reduction is providing $451,927 through the PBLMT stream of the Community and Employer Partnerships (CEP) program. CEP’s goal is to increase employment and work experience opportunities in communities throughout B.C.

Surrey families and future residents will benefit as the Province confirms the acquisition of two more school sites.Securing the sites will help with future planning, so schools can be built more quickly.“Our government is acting now to make sure land is in place to build new schools for students, as Surrey’s population continues to grow,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “These are forward-thinking investments that will be vital to getting more students out of portables and into the positive, engaging and inspiring classrooms that they deserve.”The Government of B.C. is providing $25.5 million for the Surrey School District to purchase a school site in the Redwood Heights neighbourhood. The school district has also secured a school site for a new elementary school in the South Newton neighbourhood. These land purchases are in addition to the land that was purchased for an elementary school in Sunnyside Heights last year. The site purchases are part of the collaborative, ongoing work by the Province, the Surrey School District and the City of Surrey, with a common goal to find new ways to accelerate the pace of school construction for Surrey students and families. The three parties met on Jan. 28, 2020, at the fifth Surrey Schools Summit to continue that work.New schools will be needed soon in Redwood Heights, South Newton and Sunnyside to accommodate new and existing developments that are adding thousands of new families to the communities.“Today’s announcement of new school sites for Surrey lines up with the Smart Development initiative my council colleagues and I have put in place for our city,” said Doug McCallum, mayor of Surrey. “It’s no secret that for far too long, developments in Surrey were being approved without the essential infrastructure, such as schools, needed to support a new community. With Smart Development, the City of Surrey has purchased property for parkland use that will complement the new school and any future development in the Redwood Heights neighbourhood.”Smart Development is at the centre of the City of Surrey’s long- and short-range development planning that focuses on offering residents diverse housing options near essential infrastructure, such as schools and parks. It also prioritizes the conservation of sensitive ecosystems, while ensuring that Surrey continues to advance as one of Canada’s most liveable cities, with safe routes for walking, cycling and recreation.Since September 2017, the Province has announced $270.5 million for new and expanded schools, seismic upgrades, and land purchases for future schools in Surrey. This is helping to add nearly 7,500 new student seats in Surrey between 2018 and September 2022.The district has also been supported to develop business cases for more expansion projects that are expected to add an estimated 2,000 additional student seats to fast-growing communities in Surrey. “The Surrey School District is the largest and fastest-growing district in the province. Our student population has been steadily increasing every year,” said Laurie Larsen, chair, Surrey Board of Education. “We currently have almost 74,000 students, and we’re projecting an additional 1,000 students for the next school year. This type of growth requires strong partnerships with all levels of government. I am so proud of the collaborative relationship we have with the Ministry of Education and the City of Surrey. Together, we are addressing the growth our community is experiencing and finding sustainable solutions that work for parents and students.”Government is making record investments in B.C. schools to give every student the best learning experience possible. In two and a half years, the Province has approved nearly $1.8 billion in school capital investments, creating almost 11,000 new student seats and 24,000 seismically safe seats.To continue this momentum, Budget 2019 includes a historic $2.7 billion for school capital investments over three years.A backgrounder follows.

Adrian Dix, Minister of Health, and Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.'s provincial health officer (PHO), have issued the following joint statement regarding a case of a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV):“Late yesterday, our BC Centre for Disease Control public health lab confirmed a positive test for 2019-nCoV.“The person is a male in his forties and a resident in the Vancouver Coastal Health region. He travels regularly to China for work and was in Wuhan city on his most recent trip. He returned to Vancouver last week and had an onset of symptoms after his return.“On Sunday, Jan. 26, he followed public health messaging, contacted a primary health-care provider to notify them that he had travelled to Wuhan city, was experiencing symptoms and would be coming for assessment and care.“Following established protocols, the primary-care provider notified the Vancouver Coastal Health medical health officer and administered the diagnostic test.“Late last night, the test came back positive.“Public health officials are in regular contact with the individual and a small number of close contacts. He is in isolation at home.“The risk of spread of this virus within British Columbia remains low at this time. All necessary precautions are being taken to prevent the spread of infection. We have multiple systems in place to prepare for, detect and respond, in order to prevent the spread of serious infectious diseases in the province.“The BC Centre for Disease Control has a team of experts that support the Province’s operations in monitoring and controlling communicable and vaccine-preventable diseases. The team has developed a diagnostic test for this new coronavirus and is co-ordinating staff and supplies to ensure potential cases can be detected quickly and accurately.“The PHO is responsible for monitoring and assessing the health status of the population, making recommendations for strategies to address health issues and implementing immediate actions when necessary to protect the health of the public. The PHO has directed health-care workers to be vigilant and to take a travel history for anyone reporting respiratory symptoms.“It is not necessary for the general public to take special precautions beyond the usual measures recommended to prevent other common respiratory viruses during the winter period. Regular handwashing, coughing or sneezing into your elbow sleeve, disposing of tissues appropriately and avoiding contact with sick people are important ways to prevent the spread of respiratory illness generally. “Anyone who is concerned they may have been exposed to, or are experiencing symptoms of the coronavirus should contact their primary-care provider, local public health office or call 811.”Learn More:For more information and latest updates on 2019-nCoV, follow the BC Centre for Disease Control on Twitter @CDCofBC or visit the website: http://www.bccdc.ca/For a Chinese translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Joint_Statement_Coronavirus__Traditional_Chinese.pdfFor a Punjabi translation, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Joint_Statement_Coronavirus_Punjabi.pdfA backgrounder follows.

The Province has awarded a permit to the Fort Nelson First Nation to advance a geothermal energy project with the potential to produce clean, renewable electricity for people in the Fort Nelson area.“Fort Nelson is not connected to B.C.’s electricity grid, so geothermal energy could replace power currently generated from fossil fuels or imported from Alberta,” said Bruce Ralston, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources. “This permit gives the Fort Nelson First Nation the certainty it needs to attract investment and move forward with developing a geothermal energy project that will reduce climate pollution while creating new jobs and opportunities.”The permit grants geothermal resource rights (tenure) to Deh Tai GP Inc., a development company of the Fort Nelson First Nation. The rights will be for 25 parcels of land, totalling about 6,800 hectares, in the mature Clarke Lake gas field near the community of Fort Nelson in the northeast corner of the province. With tenure secured, Deh Tai can apply to the BC Oil and Gas Commission for well authorizations to conduct exploratory drilling to assess geothermal potential.  Under CleanBC, the Province is working in collaboration with Indigenous peoples to seize new clean energy and economic development opportunities.“With the Clark Lake Geothermal Project, Fort Nelson First Nation is proudly demonstrating Indigenous leadership that will help pave the way for Western Canada’s transition toward a cleaner and more energy secure future,” said Chief Sharleen Gale, Fort Nelson First Nation. “We look forward to continuing to work with our federal and provincial partners to make this project a model success that benefits our community members and the surrounding territory.”The Province and BC Hydro are encouraged by the potential of geothermal to add to British Columbia’s mix of energy resources, particularly in remote areas of northeast B.C. where past exploration activities have reduced the risks and costs associated with drilling and gathering critical temperature and reservoir data required to advance geothermal projects. Unlike wind, solar and run-of-river projects, which are intermittent, geothermal is a firm, reliable source of generation providing electrical capacity whenever it is needed.CleanBC is a pathway to a more prosperous, balanced and sustainable future. CleanBC was developed in collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus and supports the commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s emission targets.Quick Facts: 
In Budget 2019, the Province provided $5 million to Geoscience BC to launch several new projects, including a regional assessment of the geothermal energy potential in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt.
The Fort Nelson First Nation received $1 million from Natural Resources Canada in August 2019 for the assessment of geothermal energy at Clarke Lake.

People who live and work in the North will be able to continue to rely on inter-city bus services, with funding provided by the Province and Government of Canada, through to March 31, 2021.The Government of Canada, through Western Economic Diversification, is contributing 50% of the costs to continue northern inter-city service until March 31, 2021. The Province will cover the other half of this funding. Each are contributing approximately $1 million for BC Bus North operating costs over the next 14 months.“Our government is delighted to partner with British Columbia to address gaps in inter-city bus services,” said Marc Garneau, federal Minister of Transport. “We know how important it is for Indigenous communities and Canadians living in rural areas to have access to affordable transportation services, whether to visit family members or to attend a medical appointment.”One of the conditions for federal funding was that a competitive process be conducted to choose an operator. Diversified Transportation, the current operator of BC Bus North, was the successful proponent following a procurement process for BC Bus North’s current routes. Diversified will provide service until the contract expires in March 2021. “Bus service is more than a transportation link – for many people in northern B.C., it’s a lifeline,” said Mélanie Joly, federal Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages. “From seniors heading to medical appointments to young people who work in neighbouring towns, we know just how important this service is for so many. Our federal-provincial partnership will ensure that residents, visitors and businesses continue to have safe and affordable transportation options.”BC Bus North fares will move toward the industry standard of aligning fares with distance. The outcome is that some fares will increase, though new routes have been created with lower fares. Fare updates will be made available on the BC Bus North website on Friday, Jan. 31, 2020.“When Greyhound stopped its service in the North, we didn’t want to leave people without a reliable and affordable transportation option,” said Claire Trevena, B.C. Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure. “That’s why we started BC Bus North and why we’re now partnering with the federal government to continue to fund B.C.’s northern inter-city bus service through March 2021.”The Province will continue to closely monitor the BC Bus North service to better understand the demand for inter-city transportation. A BC Bus North travellers’ survey will be conducted in the spring.Quick Facts: 
BC Bus North offers four routes, between Prince George and Prince Rupert, Valemount and Prince George, Prince George and Fort St. John, and Dawson Creek and Fort Nelson.
BC Bus North covers nearly 7,000 kilometres every week, or about 28,000 kilometres per month.
BC Bus North has provided rides for almost 9,000 people since the service was launched in 2018.

The Province is proposing more residential flexibility for people living in the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR) as outlined in a new policy intentions paper released Jan. 27, 2020, by the Ministry of Agriculture.In order to support farmers and non-farmers living in the ALR, government is considering regulatory changes to enable landowners to have both a principal residence and a small secondary residence on their property, provided they have approval from their local government. ALR property owners would not be required to apply to the Agricultural Land Commission (ALC) for approval.“We are continuing to do the work necessary to help farmers farm and protect farmland for future generations,” said Lana Popham, Minister of Agriculture. “The ALR is B.C.’s best food-producing land, and is just 5% of our province’s land base – it’s so important for food security. The proposed changes, if implemented, would provide additional residential flexibility in the ALR. Publicly sharing this proposed policy direction now gives those interested an opportunity to review and comment, leading to better outcomes. We recognize that rules by the previous government do not reflect the needs of British Columbians and as a result, we are proposing to allow more flexibility for small secondary residences. Under the proposal, a small secondary residence would be available for farm-workers, family members or anyone else, provided there is local government approval.”The new ALR residential options and specific conditions with each option such as size, siting, and quantity being considered by government include:
garden suites, guest houses or carriage suites;
accommodation above an existing building;
manufactured homes; and
permitting a principal residence to be constructed in addition to a manufactured home that was formerly a principal residence.
The Province would not require the small secondary residence be a manufactured home only for an immediate family member, as was the case in regulations under the previous government. The new residential options do not include reconsideration of the maximum size of a principal residence. The ALC will remain the decision maker for additional residences for farm use in the ALR. Any new permitted secondary residences should be registered with the ALC for long-term land-use planning purposes.The policy intentions paper resulted from collaborative work with the Union of B.C. Municipalities, the ALC and the BC Agriculture Council, and responds to feedback the ministry heard during recent public consultations. The policy direction is also guided by the results of the Minister of Agriculture’s Advisory Committee on ALR Revitalization. People are asked to provide their feedback by April 17, 2020, on the residential options via email: ALR_ALCRevitalization@gov.bc.caWhile the ministry finalizes its policy direction, the grandfathering period for manufactured homes in the ALR for immediate family members has been extended to Dec. 31, 2020. This means people wishing to place manufactured homes on their ALR property will be required to get the necessary permits and authorizations from their local governments, but do not have to apply to the ALC for approval.Quotes:Jill Azanza of K & M Farms in Abbotsford – “Farmers need farmland to farm. Farmers that are growing and looking to the future support measures like these. This change will help young and new farmers get established on the land, and help retiring farmers stay on the farm.”Maja Tait, president, Union of B.C. Municipalities – “Local governments support greater flexibility for residential arrangements that support farming on ALR land. I appreciate the work the Ministry of Agriculture has undertaken on this issue in consultation with local government and others. This next phase will provide an opportunity to refine the concepts developed, and I encourage local governments to provide input to the ministry's process.”Fred Haynes, mayor, District of Saanich – ""This proposed change would benefit Saanich residents who live or farm in the ALR because it creates more options for residences, while maintaining strong protections for farmland.”Jennifer Dyson, chair, Agricultural Land Commission – “This approach by the Province helps the ALC be less reactive and more focused on proactively seeking opportunities to improve agricultural land utilization, encourage farming and address emerging and strategic issues.”Quick Facts:
During the 2019 public engagement, 613 British Columbians registered to participate in the eight in-person sessions.
The ministry received 1,580 online survey submissions, 87 personal submissions and 19 formal submissions from associations, farmers’ institutes and local governments.
Farmers have always had the option to build additional residences in the ALR (two, three or more), provided they are needed for farming and have approval from the local government and the ALC.
The primary use of ALR land is agriculture, therefore additional residences must minimize disturbance to farm land.

A new supportive housing building is open in Kamloops, providing safe, warm homes with around-the-clock care and supports to help people experiencing homelessness in the community.“Everyone deserves a good, safe place to call home,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “We’re proud to be working with our partners to create homes like these that help people stabilize their lives and build a better future.”Located at 259 Victoria St. West, Rosethorn House is a four-storey modular apartment building with 42 self-contained studio homes. Each of the units includes a private washroom and mini kitchen. The building also includes a commercial kitchen, dining and lounge areas, storage and amenity space, and laundry and medical examination rooms.“We’re happy to see Kamloops residents moving into housing stability at Rosethorn House,” said Ken Christian, mayor, City of Kamloops. “This development is a welcome addition to the housing continuum in Kamloops, as we continue to look for opportunities to address housing affordability and homelessness.”Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA) Kamloops will operate the building and provide residents with support services, including meal programs, life and employment skills training, health and wellness supports and opportunities for volunteer work. At least two staff members will be on-site 24/7.“Everyone deserves a safe and secure place to call home,” said Jonny Morris, CEO, CMHA BC Division. “Rosethorn House provides a critical opportunity to increase housing capacity for vulnerable citizens in Kamloops who can benefit from housing and key programs, services and supports. Safe and secure housing is fundamental to mental health and well-being, helps build a sense of community, and provides a foundation to help people seek meaningful training and employment. CMHA is proud to be a partner with the Province on this initiative.”Residents will begin moving in to the building on Jan. 29, 2020. All 36 residents from The Branch, Kamloops’ temporary bridge housing building for people experiencing homelessness, will move into Rosethorn House.“Today is an exciting moment for Kamloops and a clear sign of the historical, unprecedented investment in affordable housing by our government,” said Katherine McParland, board member, BC Housing. “As a resident of Kamloops, I am excited to see first-hand the impact this government is having on responding to the urgent need of homelessness with tangible units of housing and the supports people need to thrive. This type of investment is how we will end homelessness in B.C.""Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:
The Province provided $10.2 million to the project through the Rapid Response to Homelessness program and will provide an annual operating subsidy of $980,000.
B.C.-based manufacturer Horizon North was selected by the Province to manufacture the homes in Kamloops, and several other modular projects in B.C., supporting jobs and local economies.
With the opening of this building, there are now 155 supportive homes in Kamloops, including Spero House (58 homes) and Mission Flats Manor (55 homes).
In just over two years, government has built more than 2,100 supportive homes, with over 800 more underway and a goal of 4,700 over 10 years.

These were friends and neighbours, mothers and daughters, fathers and sons.“As we remember those who are gone, we are also reminded about what happens when we remain silent or indifferent in the face of hate.“When we say, ‘never again,’ let’s all pledge to follow this promise with action. We must continue to share the stories of those who survived the horrors that took place during the Shoah. We need to make sure younger generations do not forget what happens when people don’t stand up and speak out against anti-Semitism, prejudice and violence.“By learning from the past, we can begin to build a better, more inclusive future.

Highway 4 at Kennedy Hill is now open to single-lane alternating traffic, allowing commercial vehicles, RVs and other larger vehicles to travel through the corridor.Specialized bridge crews worked throughout the day to install a pre-fabricated 20-metre single-lane bridge. Installation of the bridge was quicker than expected because bedrock was deeper than expected. This allowed for the bridge to be inset into the road grade, rather than above it, which would have required a substantial amount of approach ramp work. Construction time was also reduced by bringing in additional bridge crews and equipment.  All vehicles are now able to safely travel the corridor, which remains under single lane alternating traffic conditions through the project site. Drivers should expect delays through the night and morning.The regular project closure schedule will resume Sunday night to allow construction to continue on the project. Drivers are encouraged to check DriveBC for the Kennedy Hill project closure schedule, along with current road conditions throughout the province.The project team is evaluating how construction will progress around the new bridge.The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure thanks motorists and residents on both sides of the closure for their patience. The ministry also recognizes the crews who worked around the clock to open the highway as quickly as possible.The damage to Highway 4 was caused by an unexpectedly large volume of rock falling on rain-saturated ground during a scheduled blast early on Thursday, Jan. 23, as part of the Highway 4 - Kennedy Hill Safety Improvement project. The highway was closed to traffic at the time of the blast.When completed later this year, the Highway 4 - Kennedy Hill Safety Improvement Project will create a safer and more reliable connection between Port Alberni and the west coast of Vancouver Island.Learn More:General project information and traffic schedules are available here: www.gov.bc.ca/highway4kennedyhillVisit the project page on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/eac.bc.ca.kennedy.hill/Follow @DriveBC and #BCHwy4 on Twitter and visit: www.drivebc.ca

B.C. businesses are partnering with the federal and provincial governments to help their businesses grow, produce and pollinate.Beekeepers looking for new ways to produce more honey and cranberry producers seeking more pollinators are two examples of the 28 projects that received over $2.7 million in support.An innovation project proposed by the University of the Fraser Valley (UFV) and the Worker Bee Honey Company was selected to receive $170,320 to help create an automated honey extraction information system to improve honey harvesting in B.C.The proposed system will increase efficiency, reduce processing time and help address the shortage of skilled labour in the honey industry by automating harvesting through improved technology. The system will be able to monitor each hive’s honey yield and provide insight into superior breeding stock of male and queen bees, hive diseases and the impact of environmental variables, such as climate and weather on each hive. The results of this project will help beekeepers better care for their hives and improve honey yield.Similarly, an innovation project submitted by the BC Cranberry Marketing Commission (BCCMC) was selected to receive $10,725 to support a study on pollination across different varieties of cranberries. Researchers are looking into how to increase cranberry yield through artificial pollination. They will monitor how often pollinators visit different varieties of plants during peak bloom, which will help growers plan for future seasons.These projects are examples of the innovative ideas that B.C.-based organizations are working on to build a more sustainable future for agriculture in British Columbia. Projects under the Canada-British Columbia Agri-Innovation Program have received over $5.3 million in funding from the Canadian Agricultural Partnership. The partnership is a five-year federal-provincial-territorial agreement that includes $2 billion in cost-shared strategic initiatives delivered by the provinces and territories, and $1 billion for federal programs and services through March 2023.Quotes:Marie-Claude Bibeau, federal Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food –“Time and again, producers prove their ingenuity in finding solutions to the challenges they face. Our government is very excited to collaborate with industry and the Province on the introduction of these innovations, which help our British Columbian agriculture industry grow in sustainable ways.”Lana Popham, B.C.'s Minister of Agriculture –“The innovative projects coming out of B.C. are impressive! This research is helping producers make better use of technology and pollinators to increase the amount of honey and cranberries they harvest and grow their businesses. Results from these projects and the other exciting initiatives underway are improving farming in B.C. and driving the industry forward.”Lin Long, associate professor, engineering and physics, University of the Fraser Valley –“The Canada-British Columbia Agri-Innovation Program enables a prototype of an automated honey extraction system. By reducing costs to beekeepers, this will help to ensure a sustainable bee/honey sector, which is essential for the long-term success of B.C. and Canadian agriculture. Moreover, the funding enhances the partnership between academia and industry, and gives UFV engineering students real work experience.”Jack Brown, chair, BCCMC – “Co-funding from the Agri-Innovation Program is helping B.C. cranberry producers better understand how to manage pollinators to support cranberry production. This project will help B.C. cranberry farmers continue to grow quality fruit with greater efficiency.”Quick Facts:Cranberries
In 2017, farmgate sales for cranberries reached more than $43 million.
Over 42,000 tonnes of cranberries were harvested in B.C. in 2017.
Honeybees
Honeybees play a major role in agriculture as pollinators of crops, contributing an estimated $538 million to the B.C. economy and over $3.2 billion across Canada.
There are almost 2,700 beekeepers throughout B.C., operating as a hobby, part-time or full-time business, with more than 52,000 total colonies.
In 2018:  
B.C. colonies produced over 1.5 million kilograms of honey.
British Columbians bought over $10.5 million of B.C. honey.
Over 29,000 colonies were contracted to pollinate B.C. crops.

Construction is beginning on the new and improved Richard McBride Elementary School, giving New Westminster students and families the quality education and child care they deserve.                                    “Our government is working hard to give all students the best learning experience possible, and the replacement of Richard McBride Elementary is a great example of that,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “We’re replacing the school with a new, expanded and seismically safe facility that will eliminate the need for portables and provide new, much-needed child care spaces for New Westminster families.”The replacement of Richard McBride Elementary will provide up to $35 million for a modern school built with 65 additional student seats. The school will open in 2022, with a total capacity for 505 students. The New Westminster School District is providing $1 million toward the replacement.“Our government acted fast to bring this school to local families, so their children could go to school in a safe building that gives them the best opportunity to thrive,” said Judy Darcy, MLA for New Westminster. “This is what we’ve been waiting for in New Westminster, and I can’t wait to see students walking through the doors of what will be an amazing new school and a true hub in New Westminster.”To further benefit local families, the new school will also feature space for StrongStart and before and after school care programs, as well as a neighbourhood learning centre, where additional childcare spaces will be a priority.“The board is very excited to award Heatherbrae Builders the contract to build the Richard McBride replacement school,” said Anita Ansari, chair of the New Westminster Board of Education. “The design proposed is innovative, focused on accessibility and grounded in the natural geography of the area. We are so pleased that the design plans on paper will now become a reality for our students in the Sapperton neighbourhood, with the generous funding provided by the Province and City of New Westminster.

Many students throughout the province will commemorate the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz with age-appropriate lessons about how, where, what and why the Holocaust happened, including survivors’ personal stories.Every year on Jan. 27, Jewish communities around the globe observe International Holocaust Remembrance Day by holding vigils, discussions, film screenings and more.International Holocaust Remembrance Day commemorates the six million Jews who were murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators during the Holocaust. Victims of Nazism included half of the world’s Jewish population, people who were Roma, disabled and LGBTQ2+, as well as political dissenters.  “While the horrors of the Holocaust happened more than 75 years ago, with recent and troubling anti-Semitic incidents, harassment and hate crimes, these lessons are as important today as they were then,” said Rob Fleming, Minister of Education. “It’s critical our kids understand the role indifference and apathy played in these atrocities, and how they can use their voices to speak out against injustices they encounter in their own lives.”Teachers are encouraged to share a new video resource with students 14 and older. “Leo’s Journey – In My Father’s Words” recounts 15-year-old Leopold Lowy’s struggle to survive the Mengele twin experiments at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Richard Lowy, Leopold’s son, brings this story to life with a word-for-word recital based on interviews recorded before his father’s death in 2002.“Though heartbreaking, the horrific implications of my father's story is truly a gift,” said Lowy, who produced the video in Vancouver. “The burden is now all of ours. How we choose to incorporate this profound understanding into our lives is up to us.”Rita Akselrod, a Holocaust survivor and human rights activist, said, “Although it’s sad that Richard should have to tell his father’s story, it has such an important message. I just want the students to listen and understand they can make the world a better place.”The Vancouver Holocaust Education Centre (VHEC) offers age-appropriate school programs and resources designed for the B.C. curriculum, to teach youth about the Holocaust and challenge them to become committed global citizens, aware of discrimination, racism and genocide in today’s world. As Western Canada’s leading Holocaust teaching museum, the VHEC reaches more than 25,000 students and teachers annually in British Columbia and beyond.  Students in B.C. begin learning about the Holocaust in both history and social studies courses in Grade 6. They learn about other discriminatory policies and injustices in Canada and the world, with a focus on analyzing what happened in the past to prevent similar human rights abuses in the future. Students benefit from a new curriculum that weaves social responsibility throughout all grades to ensure every child learns respect for others.Quotes:Phil Levinson, president, Vancouver Holocaust Education Centre –“Engaging with eyewitness testimony is a uniquely powerful way to learn about the Holocaust and its lessons for present day. The story of our former VHEC board member and speaker, Leo Lowy, is a compelling entry point for teachers and students on this 75th anniversary.”Teri Mooring, president, British Columbia Teachers’ Federation –“With fewer survivors of the Holocaust still alive to tell their stories, it’s critical we pass on the lessons of the Holocaust to future generations to ensure it never happens again.

January 22, 2020 – Victoria, BCToday, federal, provincial and territorial (FPT) ministers responsible for justice and public safety concluded a one-day meeting to discuss key priorities of Canadians.With several new federal and provincial government mandates, this meeting was an opportunity to build upon relationships and outline key priorities of the different jurisdictions, such as Indigenous justice issues, restorative justice, medical assistance in dying, conversion therapy, rural crime, firearms, money laundering, cannabis enforcement, human trafficking, and online child sexual exploitation.Ministers acknowledged the Calls for Justice contained in the final report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls. Ministers will continue their collaboration to reduce violence against, and victimization of, Indigenous women, girls, and LGBTQ2S persons.  Ministers also recognized that, in partnership with Indigenous Peoples, all governments have a responsibility to address overrepresentation of Indigenous peoples in the justice system as both victims and offenders.Ministers reiterated their commitment to building safer and healthier communities through the expanded use of restorative justice in the criminal justice system – an approach that seeks to repair harm and provide accountability – where and as appropriate. In 2018, ministers underscored the importance of restorative justice in addressing repeat offences and overrepresentation of Indigenous and vulnerable populations in the criminal justice system. At the time, they also committed to a goal of a 5% increase in the use of restorative justice, where possible, by 2021. With this in mind, ministers agreed to release a summary report identifying our country's existing restorative justice programs and agencies, referrals made, and concrete steps jurisdictions have taken to increase the use of restorative justice.In light of the recent Québec Superior Court ruling on medical assistance in dying, ministers discussed the challenges of, and possible responses to, this difficult, personal, and complex issue. Ministers also affirmed their commitment to high quality hospice or palliative care. Following an update on its ongoing consultations with Canadians, the federal government reiterated its commitment to amend its medical assistance in dying legislation. Ministers affirmed their commitment to protecting vulnerable individuals and the equality rights of all Canadians.Ministers discussed the dangerous and harmful practice of conversion therapy and support was expressed for legislative and other measures to ban this practice, including the federal government's intention to introduce amendments to the Criminal Code.   Ministers underscored the impact of rural crime and ways to reduce it, including criminal law reform and enhanced police response, so all Canadians, no matter where they live, feel safe, secure, and protected in their communities. Ministers agreed to examine the problem closely and revisit it at the next FPT meeting later this year.Ministers were also provided with an update on federal measures to reduce gun and gang-related violence across Canada, and discussed related issues such as drug trafficking, illegal gun sales and smuggling, and border security. As part of this conversation, they acknowledged the importance of treating law-abiding firearm owners fairly and with respect.Ministers discussed money laundering, which is a crime that can affect all Canadians by undermining the integrity of Canada's financial institutions and facilitating organized crime, gang activity, and gun smuggling. Ministers reiterated their support for a coordinated approach to better address this problem.Ministers shared their views on the impact of the legalization of cannabis and enforcement issues, including the need for resources and tools to continue meeting the shared goals of protecting youth, eliminating illicit sales, combatting organized crime, and addressing drug-impaired driving.Ministers discussedhuman trafficking, which disproportionately affects women and girls, particularly Indigenous women and girls. Ministers supported further work to strengthen the response to this serious problem. Following a presentation by the Canadian Centre for Child Protection, ministers affirmed their commitment to combatting online child sexual exploitation and assisting victims.Ministers will reconvene again in the fall to further collaborate and discuss these and other issues of importance to all jurisdictions. Prior to the FPT meeting, Hereditary Chief and Songhees Elder, Elmer Seniemten George, welcomed ministers. Ministers had a conversation with representatives from the Assembly of First Nations and the Métis Nation. Participants discussed the federal government's commitment to introduce legislation to implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Ministers also received a presentation on B.C.'s Indigenous-led, co-developed Indigenous Justice Strategies.Quick Facts

More than 475 people in Indigenous communities throughout British Columbia are gaining skills to succeed in high-opportunity trades careers, with six new two-year training programs.“For years, Indigenous leaders have been calling for skills training opportunities closer to home to support their community’s needs and self-determination,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “Our government is responding to this Call to Action by working in partnership with Indigenous communities, the Industry Training Authority and employers. These new programs will create pathways for Indigenous workers to take advantage of the tens of thousands of in-demand jobs forecasted in the trades over the next decade.”Supported by the Industry Training Authority (ITA), the programs will address community priorities and opportunities with courses ranging from exploratory and introductory trades to construction and electrical training.“ITA’s committed to building strong partnerships with industry, training providers and Indigenous communities to create innovative programs that enable Indigenous people to gain exposure to the skilled trades and find meaningful careers,” said Shelley Gray, CEO, ITA. “These new programs will ensure more individuals have opportunities to access training and become apprentices while giving them the tools to be successful.”Programs include Kitselas First Nation’s Kitselas Community-Led Apprenticeship Development. Over two years, an estimated 48 people will receive introductory trades training that will pave the way to apprenticeships.“Investments from industries, such as LNG, mean it’s busy right now in northwest B.C., with tremendous opportunities to secure long-lasting careers in the skilled trades,” said Judy Gerow, Chief Councillor, Kitselas First Nation. “Making sure our members, and members of neighbouring Nations, have access to those opportunities is critical. The community-led program is one way we can do that. A successful career in the trades translates into economic security for families in our communities.”ITA is providing $7.5 million to support the six Indigenous training programs, with funding from the Canada-BC Workforce Development Agreement (WDA).B.C.’s Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act passed unanimously in November 2019, establishing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) as the framework for reconciliation in B.C.Skills training that improves employment opportunities responds to UNDRIP Article 21.1, asserting the rights of Indigenous peoples to improve their economic and social conditions, including through education and employment. It also responds to Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Call to Action 7, to eliminate educational and employment gaps between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians.Quick Facts:
The 2018 Labour Market Outlook projected nearly 71,000 trades job openings in the province through 2028.
Trades careers, in which skilled workers are in demand, include millwrights, heavy-duty mechanics, carpenters and electricians.
Signed in 2018, the WDA between the federal and provincial governments provides $685 million over six years and the flexibility to design and deliver locally driven, responsive and inclusive labour market programs for British Columbians.

Claire Trevena, Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure, has issued the following statement in response to application decisions by the independent Passenger Transportation Board on ride-hailing companies:

“British Columbians have been asking for new ride hailing services since 2012, but the old government failed to get it done. Our government did the hard work and delivered.“Over the last two years, our government has been diligent in developing a framework that puts passenger safety first, and we remained steadfast against pressures to abandon the safety measures we put in place. Road users can now be confident that B.C.’s ride-hailing services will comply with some of the highest safety standards in North America.“Since September 2019, the Passenger Transportation Board has been reviewing applications from 29 ride-hail companies and submissions from stakeholders. In the board’s decisions, it has committed to closely monitoring fleet sizes and minimum pricing to avoid potential impacts on traffic congestion and to ensure adequate incomes for drivers.“Our government is committed to work with both the ride-hail and taxi industries to address outstanding areas in the coming months and futures issues as they arise. We will continue to support a passenger transportation industry that gets people safely where they need to go and ensures sustainable livelihoods for drivers.”Quick Facts: 
In fall 2018, the provincial government passed the Passenger Transportation Amendment Act permitting ride-hailing companies to apply to the Passenger Transportation Board to enter the B.C. market in a way that protects passenger safety.
Subsequent regulations require ride-hail drivers to hold a Class 4 driver’s licence and undergo a vulnerable sector check – the most stringent type of police information check.
On Dec. 12, 2019, the TransLink Mayor’s Council endorsed an inter-municipal business licence in order to have ride-hailing companies obtain a single licence to be able to operate across Metro Vancouver.
Government is committed to working with both ride-hail and taxi companies to address concerns moving forward.

The Cascadia Timber Supply Area (TSA) has a new allowable annual cut (AAC) for timber harvesting.Harvesting will continue at a sustainable level and generate economic prosperity for British Columbians.The Cascadia TSA is dispersed throughout the Interior of British Columbia, mainly in the northwest and southeast of the province. Diane Nicholls, B.C.’s chief forester, announced that the new AAC is 356,230 cubic metres, effective Jan. 23, 2020. It will provide a reliable supply of Crown timber through competitive auctions.The new AAC is 10% lower than the current AAC of 397,818 cubic metres. The reduction was made to account for new information regarding forest-management practices and economic operability for the TSA.The Cascadia TSA is assigned to BC Timber Sales (BCTS) and consists of 11 timber-supply blocks. The new cut level includes the following partitions:
101,420 cubic metres for the BCTS Kootenay Business Area;
63,000 cubic metres for the BCTS Okanagan-Columbia Business Area;
65,740 cubic metres for the BCTS Cariboo-Chilcotin Business Area; and
126,070 cubic metres for the BCTS Skeena Business Area.
The partitions consider that the TSA is widely spread throughout the province in four unique business areas.“After reviewing all of the available information on timber and non-timber resources for the distinct areas of this TSA, and consulting with First Nations, I am satisfied the new cut level will support a sustainable forest industry, while taking into consideration local social and economic objectives,” Nicholls said.The Cascadia TSA occupies a total area of over 316,000 hectares. It was created in 2011 by combining areas tree farm licences (TFL) and areas transferred from the Revelstoke and Arrow TSAs.BCTS auctions the timber from this TSA to the highest bidder and uses the bid information to support the provincial market pricing system for setting stumpage rates.The Cascadia TSA overlaps the traditional territory of 24 First Nations and First Nations groupings: Neskonlith Indian Band; Secwepemc Reconciliation Framework Agreement; Okanagan Nation Alliance; Okanagan Indian Band; Adams Lake Indian Band; Westbank First Nation; Splats’in First Nation; Shuswap Indian Band; Little Shuswap Lake Indian Band; Ktunaxa Nation Council; Tsilhqot’in Engagement Zone ‘A’; Lhatko Dene Nation; Xats’ull First Nation; Tsilhqot’in Nation, Notice of Civil Claim; Nazko First Nation; Kitsumkalum Band Council; Gitxsan Hereditary Chiefs; Kitselas First Nation; Skin Tyee First Nation; Wet’suwet’en First Nation; Metlakatla Band Council; Lax Kw’alaams Band; Office of the Wet’suwet’en; and the Haisla Nation.Along with this AAC decision, the chief forester issued an order reducing the AAC attributable to the BCTS Skeena Business Area by 7%, to account for the Kitsumkalum-Kitselas Designated Area.The chief forester’s determination takes into consideration requirements for old growth management areas, riparian areas, wildlife habitat areas and species at risk, such as caribou, bull trout, grizzly bear and ungulates (mountain goats, moose and deer).Quick Facts:
The chief forester’s allowable annual cut determination is an independent, professional judgment based on information ranging from technical forestry reports, First Nations and public input to the government’s social and economic goals.
Under the Forest Act, the chief forester must determine the allowable annual cut in each of the province’s 37 timber supply areas and 34 tree farm licences at least once every 10 years.

Doug Donaldson, Minister of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development, has issued the following statement in response to the Jan. 23, 2020, crash of a firefighting aircraft in New South Wales, Australia.“Shortly before 1:30 p.m. – local Australian time – on Jan. 23, 2020, Australian wildfire officials lost contact with a C-130 airtanker operated by B.C.-based Coulson Aviation, which was assisting with firefighting activities in the Snowy Monaro area of New South Wales.“On board were three American citizens, who did not survive the crash. No Canadian personnel were on the aircraft.“Our thoughts are with the family and friends of everyone involved in this incident. On behalf of all British Columbians, I extend our deepest sympathies to the families and friends of the flight crew and to the staff of Coulson Aviation.“The international firefighting community has rallied this year to help Australia during its catastrophic fire season.

Farmers, ranchers and food processors in Yukon and northern B.C. may soon have more local customers, as the two governments connect to build food security and increase the supply and production of local food in the North.“Working together is key to life in Canada’s north, and the partnership between farmers, Indigenous communities, experts and governments will help increase local food production and economic activity,” said Lana Popham, B.C.’s Minister of Agriculture. “Our co-operative efforts will encourage greater involvement and awareness of local food, and help more people in Yukon and northern B.C. enjoy the flavours and benefits of products from their communities.”Ranj Pillai, Minister Responsible for Yukon Agriculture, said, “Yukon and British Columbia share common challenges and opportunities in our efforts to encourage local food production in northern communities. The new memorandum of understanding emphasizes that by working together and sharing expertise, we can better promote food security, promote agricultural production, develop sustainably and grow market opportunities for northern farmers and ranchers.”The governments be partner with the agricultural sector, as well as academic and community leaders, to develop and share expertise specific to growing in northern latitude. Topics of discussion will include limitations in temperature and duration of seasons, offset by long summer days, as well as supporting business relationships amongst different farmers, food processors and agriculture service suppliers in both areas. Targets include:
expanding local food and beverage production through a farmer/rancher forum that supports networking, knowledge transfer and business relationships;
developing and sharing expertise around farm management in remote settings;
partnering with academic institutions to help northern growers and food-processing sectors grow and commercialize products;
reducing barriers to agricultural trade between neighbouring jurisdictions; and
increasing producers’ access to processing and retail markets and shared inspection services. For example, increasing access to meat inspections through shared inspection services or mobile abattoirs.
The governments also committed to supporting a larger role for Indigenous peoples in northern agriculture and food production by working with Indigenous communities to:
increase Indigenous involvement in sustainable food production and agricultural business opportunities; and
facilitate Nation-to-Nation dialogue in and between both jurisdictions to build capacity and develop agriculture and traditional food-based activities and initiatives.

Consultations are underway to identify measures that could build on government investments and initiatives already underway to help more people find affordable housing in British Columbia.In September 2019, the governments of Canada and B.C. created the Expert Panel on the Future of Housing Supply and Affordability.The panel has begun consultations to seek feedback and ideas from experts, academics, researchers, urban planners, urban economists, municipal housing policy-makers and members of the public who are familiar with the housing challenges in B.C. and similar high-priced housing markets around the world.“People who are making a decent income, whether renting or wanting to purchase a home, can’t find accommodation that’s affordable in the urban centres of British Columbia,” said Joy MacPhail, chair, Expert Panel on the Future of Housing Supply and Affordability. “The panel has set up a website in order to get input from a diverse and robust cross-section of British Columbians who can provide insight and suggest solutions to address the issues of supply of affordable housing.”Experts, organizations and citizens are invited to share ideas on ways to address housing challenges in British Columbia. The consultations will be open until April 3, 2020.The panel will post an interim report of its findings from these consultations on its website in summer 2020, and provide a final report to the federal and provincial governments by the end of 2020.Quick Facts:
The members of the panel are leaders and specialists in a wide range of fields. They will identify additional measures that federal and provincial governments, and possibly municipal governments, non-governmental organizations and other actors in housing markets, could undertake to improve supply and affordability in B.C.’s high-priced housing markets.
Since 2017, the B.C. government has taken a number of steps to tackle the housing crisis and deliver the affordable homes British Columbians need, including the largest investment in housing affordability in B.C.’s history — $7 billion over 10 years.
Through a 30-point housing plan launched in 2018, the provincial government is working with partners to deliver 114,000 affordable homes over 10 years. The plan has introduced new measures aimed at curbing speculative demand that has driven up the cost of living.
To help more Canadians access affordable housing that meets their needs, the Government of Canada launched the National Housing Strategy — a 10-year, more than $55-billion plan designed to build 125,000 new affordable housing units, repair 300,000 others and reduce chronic homelessness by 50%.
The federal government has taken concrete steps to make homeownership more affordable for first-time buyers by implementing a first-time home buyer incentive, a shared-equity mortgage program that would reduce the mortgage payments required to own a home.
Twelve provinces and territories have signed bilateral agreements under the multilateral Housing Partnership Framework, which will flow more than $7.7 billion in new federal funding to provinces and territories over the next decade to support the stock of community housing and address regional priorities.

Two Indigenous communities in central B.C. have signed an agreement with the Province in support of the recently approved Blackwater Gold Mine within their shared territories. The agreement supports the development of the proposed gold mine, located in the heart of the Cariboo, and commits to sharing the future mineral revenue generated by the mine.The agreement between the Province, the Lhoosk’uz Dené Nation and Ulkatcho First Nation (UFN) commits to share a portion of the provincial mineral tax revenue collected from the planned Blackwater Gold Mine project near Vanderhoof. This agreement is an important next step in moving the project toward a final investment decision, construction and long-term operation. The mine received both federal and provincial environmental assessment certificates in 2019.“First Nations should share in the wealth from natural resource projects in their territory, and agreements like this one create a true partnership for economic development in the territory,” said Scott Fraser, Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation. “When Indigenous communities are partners in the economy, we can build a stronger B.C. that includes everyone, creating opportunities for Indigenous peoples, B.C. businesses, communities and families everywhere.”In addition to creating a new source of revenue for the two Nations, the agreement commits to collaborative work to develop a process for engagement on future permitting associated with the mine.“On behalf of my community, we are pleased to support the Economic and Community Development Agreement (ECDA) with B.C. and look forward to the long-term stability it will provide for my current and future generations,” said Chief Liliane Squinas, Lhoosk’uz Dené Nation.Chief Lynda Price, Ulkatcho First Nation, said, “Ulkatcho First Nation agreed with the project only after our environmental concerns and conditions were addressed. This is another opportunity for UFN members to participate in the economy. The ECDA will support capacity development and prepare UFN moving forward in a positive direction. UFN acknowledge this has been a long process, which began in early 2012, and are grateful to have reached this milestone.”The revenue shared through the agreement could be worth as much as $217 million while the mine is operational. Mineral tax revenue will be shared equally between the two Nations. Total mineral tax revenue during the life of the proposed Blackwater mine is currently estimated to be approximately $722 million.“The partnership that has been reached with the Lhoosk’uz Dené and Ulkatcho Nations is a pathway to real economic benefits and community support for the project,” said Michelle Mungall, Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources. “It ensures the Nations have a voice in the decision-making process and supports the future development of the mine in a way that reflects the principles of the new Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act.”The Blackwater Gold Mine project by New Gold Inc. will be an open-pit gold and silver mine on 4,400 hectares, about 110 kilometres southwest of Vanderhoof. New Gold expects the mine to operate for 17 years.The two Nations have also entered into a separate agreement with New Gold Inc. that affords them direct participation in the Blackwater Gold project.Quick Facts:
The Blackwater Gold Mine project is expected to create 1,500 jobs during construction and 495 during operations.
Lhoosk’uz Dené Nation has 243 members and is located 173 kilometres west of Quesnel. Ulkatcho First Nation has 1,062 members and is located 100 kilometres east of Bella Coola.
Both Nations are members of the Southern Dakelh Nation Alliance and the Carrier Chilcotin Tribal Council.

910,2020-01-21 11:30:00,Canada,British Columbia,,https://news.gov.bc.ca/stories/new-canada-line-trains-increase-service-for-customers,Government Website,New Canada Line trains increase service for customers,"

January 21, 2020 RICHMOND, B.C. – Four new Canada Line trains begin service today, increasing customer capacity by 15 per cent during peak hours. The brand-new trains will provide more space, frequency and comfort to customers. These are the first of 12 new trains, which are being rolled out as part of Phase One of the Mayors’ 10-Year Transit Expansion Plan. Once more trains are in service later this year, there will be a total increase in capacity of approximately 35 per cent compared to 2019 service levels. Delivered through the Public Transit Infrastructure Fund (PTIF), this $88 million investment is funded 50 per cent by the Government of Canada, 33 per cent by the Province of British Columbia, and 17 per cent by TransLink. To support this increase in service, the Canada Line Operations and Maintenance Centre was upgraded and three additional escalators were installed at Canada Line Stations in 2019. This $36 million investment was also funded through PTIF. The remaining trains are in the process of being delivered from Hyundai Rotem in South Korea. Upon arrival, the new trains will go through testing and commissioning before being certified for revenue service later this year. Quick Facts: 
In 2019, for the first time, there were more than 50 million boardings on the Canada Line 
With more than 150,000 trips taken on an average weekday in 2019, that is an increase of about 3 per cent compared to 2018 
Canada Line is a 19-kilometre route with 16 stations, two bridges and nine kilometres of tunnel 
21 per cent of travellers use the Canada Line for their journey to or from YVR 
Improving transit and transportation infrastructure is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement 
Quotes: Honourable Catherine McKenna, Minister of Infrastructure and Communities – “Good public transit builds strong communities and helps create jobs. Adding more trains on the Canada Line will help residents by providing more frequent service. Our historic investments in transit infrastructure are making a real difference in the lives of the people of Metro Vancouver.” Bowinn Ma, Parliamentary Secretary for TransLink – “The addition of these new Canada Line cars will help more people get to where they need to go faster, whether it is downtown Vancouver, YVR or Richmond, letting them avoid congestion and giving them more time to spend with friends and family. This service increase is one more example of how our shared goal of reliable and efficient transit is making a difference for people. Our government’s commitment to fund 40% of the capital costs of each phase of the Mayors’ Council’s 10-Year Vision will result in continued transit improvements throughout the region making life better for everyone.” Malcolm Brodie, Mayor of Richmond – “Since its inception just before the 2010 Olympics, the Canada Line has played a vital role in the development and growth of Metro Vancouver. Investments like these not only make our transit system more accessible and enjoyable, but it also ensures that we can keep up with the demand as more people are choosing to take transit to get to where they need to go.” Kevin Desmond, CEO, TransLink – “The Canada Line is an integral part of the transit system and its booming ridership reflects that. Ridership has been strong since it opened, and regular weekday ridership has grown 25 per cent since then. This increase in service and the upcoming increase later this year will provide relief to our customers who depend on the Canada Line every day.”

People who own homes in communities where the speculation and vacancy tax applies will soon receive a declaration package in the mail.The declaration must be completed by March 31, 2020.“Based on the first successful year of the speculation and vacancy tax, we expect more than 99% of British Columbians to be exempt from the tax, while speculators, foreign owners and people who leave their home vacant will continue to pay as intended,” said Carole James, Minister of Finance. “The revenue generated will help create affordable housing solutions for the people who live and work where this tax applies.”Declaration packages will arrive in mailboxes between Jan. 24 and Feb. 21, 2020.Residential property owners can complete their declaration as soon as they receive their package, which will include an informational brochure and letter. It takes less than 10 minutes to complete.  The quickest way is online: gov.bc.ca/spectaxAll owners on the title, including spouses and relatives, must complete a declaration in order to claim an exemption or to determine eligibility for a tax credit. If owners are not exempt, they must pay their assessed amount by July 2, 2020. In addition to previous exemptions, military families and those with water-access-only properties will be exempt.“Some would have us give tax breaks to speculators and return to out-of-control housing price increases, but we’re committed to cracking down on speculation and increasing affordable housing options,” James said. “We’re beginning to see moderation in the housing market, and over the past year we’ve seen more rental condos being put on the market and an increase in purpose-built rentals. These are encouraging signs for making housing more affordable for families in B.C.”According to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation’s 2019 rental report, the number of apartments in the long-term rental stock in Metro Vancouver in 2019 increased by nearly 19% from 2018 – the most significant annual increase in more than a decade. The report further states that policies introduced at the government level are contributing to the number of condos available in the long-term rental stock, with BC Housing data confirming that purpose-built rentals represented nearly 30% of units registered in 2019, compared to 16.4% in 2018.If people have questions or need help completing their declaration over the phone, they can call: 1 833 554-2323 (toll-free Canada/U.S.) or 1 604 660-2421 (international), Monday to Sunday, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Service is available in multiple languages.Learn More:To learn more about the speculation and vacancy tax and exemptions, visit: gov.bc.ca/spectaxTo learn more about government’s 30-point plan for housing affordability, visit: https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/A backgrounder follows.Translations:For a French translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Declaration_Begins_SVT_French.pdfFor a Punjabi translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Declaration_Begins_SVT_Traditional_Punjabi.pdfFor a Traditional Chinese translation, visit: http://news.gov.bc.ca/files/Declaration_Begins_SVT_Traditional_Chinese.pdf

The Province is partnering with the Aboriginal Housing Society of Prince George to purchase a six-unit apartment complex, preserving rental housing and providing affordable options for Indigenous peoples in the community.“By helping to purchase this building, we are protecting these affordable homes for people in Prince George,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “Through this partnership with the Aboriginal Housing Society of Prince George, we’re keeping rents for these homes affordable for the residents and ensuring that needed upgrades are made to the building.”Located at 2541 Oak St., the federal and provincial governments are providing joint funding of approximately $840,000 to finance the purchase and renovation of the building. Funding is being provided through the HousingHub, a BC Housing branch that works with community, government and non-profit and private-sector stakeholders to increase affordable rental housing and home ownership options for middle-income British Columbians. It acts as a centre for housing expertise and collaboration and helps create housing either through new construction or through redeveloping existing sites.The complex consists of two one-bedroom units and four two-bedroom units. Renovations to these units will increase the building’s lifespan and ensure six homes for low- and middle-income Indigenous individuals and families remain accessible.“We are excited to be able to keep these homes on the market,” said Christos Vardacostas, executive director, Aboriginal Housing Society of Prince George. “Having a home is fundamental, and this is a great opportunity for us to work with the Province to make sure these spaces stay affordable and available.”The society has assumed ownership and operations of the residence. The current tenants of the building will not be affected by the acquisition. Monthly rents will be carried over at the same rates.The society provides safe, healthy and affordable housing for Indigenous peoples in the region and serves approximately 500 people in Prince George on Lheidli T’enneh traditional territory.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Fact:
Through provincial investments, more than 22,000 new homes are complete, under construction or in development for people with a range of incomes around the province, including close to 220 homes in Prince George.

The Province and the First Nations Health Authority (FNHA) are collaborating on a unique partnership to provide temporary housing near medical facilities for those who are travelling from remote communities.“Many Indigenous communities in remote northern communities aren’t located close to health care, and people may have to travel a long way to access health care, including women travelling to give birth,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “This partnership will make it much easier and more affordable for FHNA clients to attend their medical appointments, especially for long-term medical stays.”The agreement will reserve temporary housing in existing BC Housing buildings that are close to medical centres in Prince George and Fort St. John for FHNA clients who need to attend medical appointments. Additional locations could be added in the future. All clients in these units will have access to FNHA’s Medical Transportation program, which assists in moving people to and from their community.“We are all looking forward to supporting families to have healthy and supportive stays when travelling far from home to access health care,” said Richard Jock, interim CEO, FNHA. “The First Nations Health Authority is looking constantly for creative ways to address access to needed medical care in ways that are culturally relevant.”In the coming months, partners will identify the exact locations and numbers of units that will be reserved for FNHA’s use.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Learn More:A map showing the location of all announced provincially funded housing projects in B.C. is available online: https://www.bchousing.org/homes-for-BCTo learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit: https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/A backgrounder follows.

Ted embodied the honour and integrity of a true public servant.“Ted was B.C.’s first-ever conflict-of-interest commissioner. He also led investigations into some of the most prominent and challenging cases in our province’s history. His work resulted in systemic improvements that we still benefit from today. It was because of his review on child deaths within the foster care system that government established an independent watchdog for children’s services. And his leadership on the Justice Reform Committee led to significant changes in B.C.’s judicial structure.  “Ted was not afraid to stand up for what he thought was right – no matter who he was standing up to. He held powerful people accountable.“Even in retirement, Ted worked in service to our province and helped the most vulnerable among us.“Ted Hughes leaves behind a legacy that will be felt for generations to come. He will be very missed.”

The public is invited to attend a community open house and participate in a discussion about the 2020 gypsy moth aerial spray treatment program in Lake Cowichan.The meeting will be held on Tuesday, Jan. 28, 2020, from 4:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. at Lake Cowichan school gymnasium on 190 S. Shore Rd.Members of the B.C. gypsy moth technical advisory committee will be joined by representatives from the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy, Ministry of Agriculture and Canadian Food Inspection Agency, as well as other experts, to answer questions and provide information about the 2019 trapping season and the planned 2020 aerial spray program.The 2019 trapping data shows that a population of moths in Lake Cowichan has persisted for at least two years and appears to be growing. The gypsy moth technical advisory committee has determined that it is necessary to treat 231 hectares of residential and municipal land to eradicate gypsy moth.The planned treatment will use aircraft to apply Bacillus thuringiensis var kurstaki (Btk), a biological insecticide that occurs naturally in soil and is commonly used in organic agriculture. Btk is effective at treating gypsy moth. It affects only caterpillars that eat sprayed leaves and has a proven safety record around humans. Livestock, pets, birds, fish, spiders, bees, ladybugs and amphibians are not impacted by Btk.The gypsy moth is an introduced pest species. The caterpillars feed on tree leaves and can damage forests, farms and orchards. Large gypsy moth populations have defoliated sections of forests and residential areas in Ontario and the eastern United States in recent years.Learn More:To learn more about gypsy moths, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/gypsymothOr call toll-free: 1 866 917-5999For information about the permit application and to view a map of the treatment zone, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/managing-our-forest-resources/forest-health/invasive-forest-pests/gypsy-moth/newsThe permit application and maps are also available at:

Les familles francophones de Penticton ont désormais la certitude que l’école Entre-lacs continuera de servir en permanence les élèves du système d’écoles publiques de leur collectivité.« Dans un pays de deux langues officielles, il est vital que les élèves francophones puissent disposer des mêmes possibilités que leurs camarades anglophones », déclare Rob Fleming, ministre de l’Éducation de la province. « Voici pourquoi nous investissons dans une école permanente pour les francophones de Penticton et nous nous appliquons à trouver des possibilités similaires ailleurs dans la province. »Le Gouvernement de la Colombie-Britannique a alloué au Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique (CSF) une somme de 11,5 millions de dollars, qui servira à acquérir certains biens fonciers du conseil scolaire Okanagan-Skaha (SD67), dont l’école Entre-lacs, une école francophone de la maternelle à la 12e située à Penticton.Le CSF, auquel le SD67 cédait le droit d’usage depuis septembre 2017 en vertu d’un bail à court terme, sera désormais propriétaire de l’école et pourra l’utiliser de manière indépendante.« Nous sommes satisfaits de voir que le travail de collaboration avec le ministère de l’Éducation ainsi qu’avec le Conseil scolaire de Okanagan-Skaha (SD67) dans ce dossier ait pu permettre l’acquisition d’une école pour la communauté francophone de Penticton », indique Marie-Pierre Lavoie, présidente du Conseil d’administration du CSF. « Nous nous réjouissons de cette annonce qui contribue à soutenir la mission du CSF tout en permettant d’accroître l’accès à l’éducation francophone en Colombie-Britannique ».L’école Entre-lacs dispose d’un espace suffisant pour accueillir non seulement chacun des élèves francophones de Penticton, mais également pour tenir compte de la croissance anticipée. Elle possède plusieurs salles de classe standard et spécialisées, un gymnase et une bibliothèque. De plus, un service de garde à la petite enfance est assuré par la Société de la petite enfance de l’école Entre-lacs.Il est prévu, à long terme, que l’école Entre-lacs intègre progressivement un programme d’enseignement secondaire, mais cette intégration n’aura aucune incidence négative sur les élèves du CSF qui sont inscrits à l’heure actuelle au programme francophone de l’école secondaire de Penticton.Par la même occasion, le CSF acquiert les installations de l’ancienne école intermédiaire Nkwala, qui a fermé ses portes en 2016 par manque d’élèves. De concert avec le CSF et la Ville de Penticton, le ministère de l’Éducation décidera du sort de l’école Nkwala de manière à optimiser les avantages pour la collectivité.Enfin, grâce à cette vente, le conseil scolaire SD67 disposera de fonds suffisants pour financer ses priorités en matière d’expansion, de rénovations et autres.Cet investissement s’inscrit dans les efforts du gouvernement provincial visant à promouvoir l’égalité des chances en éducation pour les élèves francophones de la Colombie-Britannique. Le ministère de l’Éducation continue sa collaboration avec le CSF en vue de financer l’acquisition de sites destinés aux élèves francophones dans les collectivités désignées de la province.

ICBC and industry partners have worked together to redesign collision and glass repair programs to generate savings for ICBC and promote high-performing shops to serve drivers better.Once fully implemented, repair shops will be ranked by performance based on various metrics. The ranking will be placed on a shop-locator ICBC webpage, enabling drivers to make informed choices about where to take their vehicles for repair, while encouraging shops to be top performers.“After consulting with industry leaders, the redesign of the collision and glass repair programs will improve transparency and accountability of repair shops for drivers who get into accidents and need to choose which repair shop they go to,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “By publicly ranking the repair shops by performance, where repair shops strive to be the top performers, we expect that this will help curb some of the rising claims costs and pressures that ICBC is facing.”The new collision program will take effect Feb. 3, 2020, and the new glass program will take effect March 2, 2020. Combined, both programs will encompass approximately 1,000 collision and glass repair shops throughout the province. However, the repair shop ranking will be made available only after significant data is collected.“ICBC appreciates the repair industry’s willingness to work with us to manage performance effectively, and we will continue to consult with our industry advisory committee and technical working group to continuously improve the new programs over time,” said Nicolas Jimenez, CEO, ICBC.The changes to the glass and collision repair programs come after government launched an operational audit of ICBC, which resulted in recommendations on ways to improve management of material damage vendors.Quotes:Adrian Scovell, president and CEO, Automotive Retailers Association – “The Automotive Retailers Association represents 1,000-plus automotive service providers throughout B.C. We are pleased to have been a part of developing new standards of performance, which will reduce costs and improve service to industry stakeholders and B.C. drivers.”Michael Shurink, chief operating officer, Lift Auto Group – “The new collision repair program is a step in the right direction. The program helps drive efficiencies that benefit both the shop and ICBC.”Christine Perry, regional manager, Skidmore Group’s NOVUS Glass – “As a member of the industry advisory committee, NOVUS Glass appreciates ICBC working with industry leaders to design the new glass repair program. It’s great to see the Province working to develop a program that elevates performance through a new tiered model.”Quick Facts:
The redesigned programs were developed after more than a year of consultation with industry, including 33 sessions with collision shops and 31 sessions with glass repair shops throughout the province.
Savings will come from improved performance and enhanced governance that drives higher efficiencies via faster processing of claims, faster repair cycle times and greater autonomy for high-performing suppliers.
The new programs are another initiative of government to improve the financial sustainability of ICBC, in addition to improvements to road safety, high-friction pavement and limits to minor injury payments.

A new affordable rental housing project for seniors and families on Southwest Marine Drive is part of the 3,500 new homes underway or completed in Vancouver, thanks to partnerships between the Province, the City of Vancouver and community partners.“People in Vancouver deserve safe, secure and affordable housing, but the last provincial government chose to ignore the housing crisis,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “We’re making different choices and investing in the housing people need. Working with our community partners and the City of Vancouver, we’re delivering thousands of homes so people have housing that works for them.”The Province is partnering with the City of Vancouver and New Chelsea Society to build 102 affordable rental homes at 75 and 95 SW Marine Dr. Comprised of two six-storey buildings, the development will provide studio, one-bedroom, two-bedroom and three-bedroom homes for individuals and families with low to middle incomes.“Using city-owned land to provide homes for low- and middle-income residents is critical in tackling the lack of affordable housing in Vancouver,” said Kennedy Stewart, mayor, City of Vancouver. “But, the real magic comes from the partnerships we forge with local non-profit organizations and senior levels of government. We’re grateful for our partnership with BC Housing and New Chelsea Society on this project, which will provide homes for hundreds of people who live and work in Vancouver.”New Chelsea Society is receiving $10.2 million from the Province’s Building BC: Community Housing Fund, as well as construction financing and annual operating funding, for the project. The city is providing the land valued at $22.7 million and will waive development cost charges of approximately $1.6 million.“New Chelsea Society is very proud to be partnering with the Province and the City of Vancouver, and to have been selected to be the owner/operator of this affordable housing project for seniors and families in Vancouver,” said Pat Buchannon, CEO, New Chelsea Society. “This year, New Chelsea Society celebrates its 65th anniversary of welcoming our first resident into our housing. At a time when more affordable housing is so desperately needed in our city, we look forward to that day when we can welcome our newest residents to their new Southwest Marine Drive home.”Construction is expected to begin in spring 2020.These homes are part of the more than 22,000 new homes that are completed or underway throughout B.C. because of provincial investments.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:
This housing development is funded through the Building BC: Community Housing Fund, a $1.9-billion investment over 10 years to build more than 14,000 mixed-income rental homes throughout the province.
More than 5,200 of these homes are in development and under construction, including more than 1,000 homes in Vancouver.

The project on Southwest Marine Drive will reflect the following mix of incomes:
20 units for people with annual incomes up to approximately $26,000;
51 units for households with incomes ranging between approximately $25,000 and $73,000; and
31 units for households with incomes up to approximately $113,000.

The new, state-of-the-art Stuart Lake Hospital that will provide better health care and create more jobs for people is ready for construction, following the Province’s approval of the project business plan.“For more than 12 years, people in Fort St. James were promised a new hospital, but the old government failed to act and patients were left waiting without the health care they need and deserve,” said Premier John Horgan. “After years of delay, I’m proud that our government is getting it done, so people can get the health care they count on. This project will give the community an economic boost, with hundreds of new construction jobs and the highest quality health care for people in the region. This is all part of our plan to deliver better health care, closer to home.”The new hospital will be three times larger than the current facility with 27 beds, including 18 long-term care beds. There will be an emergency department with two treatment rooms, a trauma bay and ambulance bay. A laboratory and diagnostic imaging will also be part of the new facility.The hospital will include a primary care centre that will consolidate services currently being offered in Fort St. James to one location, reducing the distance patients and staff need to go for diagnostic imaging and lab services. It will be home to physicians, visiting specialists, substance-use supports, home and community care, and public health.   Approximately 450 direct and 300 indirect jobs will be created during construction.The estimated project cost is $116 million, shared between the Province through Northern Health, and Stuart-Nechako Regional Hospital District, which will contribute $20 million.With government approval of the business plan, the project will proceed to procurement. Construction is expected to begin in summer 2021. The hospital is targeted to open for patients in 2024.“We are moving forward with a new hospital for people in Fort St. James and area, which will bring high-quality public health care, as well as community-based services in one location to the region for decades to come,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “Many partners helped get us to this important milestone, and I want to thank Stuart-Nechako Hospital District, the community of Fort St. James, and the Nak’azdli Whut’en, Yekooche First Nation, Tl’azt’en Nation (Tache, Binche, Middle River) and Takla Lake First Nation.”The new hospital will be built on the same site as the existing one. Once complete, the existing facility will be demolished to make way for parking.The current hospital opened in 1972 and is outdated in terms of space, functionality and technology. The hospital has 12 beds and offers emergency, acute and complex care, as well as residential care, lab and X-ray services, as well as mental-health and addictions counselling.Discussions regarding the replacement of the hospital have been ongoing since 2008. In September 2015, Northern Health submitted a concept plan to the Ministry of Health. Northern Health submitted a revised concept plan to government in summer 2018, which was approved in October 2018. The business plan phase finalizes details, such as scope and budget.All new hospitals in B.C. are planned to a LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Gold standard.The investment in a new Stuart Lake Hospital is part of a wide range of work underway to deliver comprehensive health services for people in the Northern Health region. This includes a redeveloped and expanded Dawson Creek and District Hospital, a new Mills Memorial Hospital in Terrace, two new urgent and primary care centres in Prince George and Quesnel, as well as progress made for a new emergency department and intensive care unit with redevelopment of the G.R. Baker Memorial Hospital in Quesnel.Quotes:Colleen Nyce, board chair, Northern Health –“We are thankful to Premier Horgan, Minister Dix and the provincial government for the decision to move to the next steps in replacing the Stuart Lake Hospital and for investing in health care for the people in Fort St. James and area. This collaborative project was brought together by the Province of B.C., the Stuart Nechako Regional Hospital District, Northern Health and the people residing in the communities and area served by Stuart Lake Hospital.”Jerry Petersen, chair, Stuart Nechako Regional Hospital District –“This investment announcement within our region is tremendous news for the community of Fort St. James and the surrounding rural and First Nation populations that rely on the invaluable local health services provided from this facility, not only today, but now secured for the future. A long-term commitment to health care in Fort St. James alleviates pressures in our neighbouring communities, and for that, a well-deserved thank you to the provincial government, Northern Health and regional hospital district elected officials and staff for your dedication and commitment to this project.”A backgrounder follows.

Small businesses, non-profits and arts and culture organizations paying high property taxes through their commercial leases will be able to get relief through interim business property tax relief legislation that is under development.The legislation, to be introduced this spring, would give municipalities the ability to provide property tax relief to small businesses and organizations that they identify as paying high property taxes. These taxes are a result of the combination of years of increasing real estate values and their commercial lease terms, including triple-net leases.“I understand people’s frustration after years of an out-of-control real estate market have left many small businesses, non-profits and arts organizations struggling with unexpectedly large tax increases,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “With this interim legislation, we are giving municipalities the tools they need to provide immediate property tax relief to targeted properties, for 2020, while we continue to work with stakeholders on a permanent provincewide fix. The old government heard concerns and did nothing – we listened and got to work on solutions for people.”Under the current assessment system, properties are valued based on “highest and best use,” which means land with a single-storey commercial building on it may be valued as if it were being used as a multi-storey residential tower. Though “highest and best use” is a standard industry appraisal principle in many jurisdictions, it can result in an increased tax burden for tenants when there is an unexpected spike in value due to factors such as zoning changes or changes to an official community plan.The interim legislation would allow municipalities to exempt a portion of the value of a subset of commercial properties from taxation, easing the tax burden for tenants responsible for property taxes through their commercial leases.The proposed legislation would apply to the 2020 tax year and be in effect for a maximum of five years. It is being designed to provide a way for municipalities with enough flexibility to provide tax exemptions to target specific businesses and non-profit organizations to support those most impacted by the current framework, without changing an already complex assessment system.As this legislation is still under development, the Province will provide more information in the coming weeks.Learn More: For an overview of BC Assessment's work, services and more, visit: https://www.bcassessment.ca/

Child care is getting less expensive and easier to find in Chase as the Province invests in 13 new child care spaces to give more parents the option to return to work, go back to school or pursue other opportunities.“Parents throughout the province, and especially in rural areas, have been struggling to find quality affordable child care for too long,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “We’re making progress, and the new spaces at Growing Minds Childcare will give local families peace of mind, knowing their children are well cared for and spending their days in a quality learning environment.”  Through Childcare BC’s New Spaces Fund, Growing Minds Childcare is creating five spaces for children aged three to five and eight for children under 12. The centre offers flexible hours to accommodate parents who work or are in school and offers a wide range of programs for children, including fostering learning about Indigenous culture and language.“With the help of the Province and its funding, we are able to create a safe, healthy and welcoming space for the children of our community,” said Candice Smith, owner, Growing Minds Childcare. “The space will provide care that supports and guides all ages in their physical, social, emotional, intellectual and language developmental domains.”The spaces are part of the fastest creation of child care spaces in B.C.’s history with more than 10,400 funded in the past 15 months. With the addition of 900 spaces funded through partnerships with the Union of British Columbia Municipalities (UBCM) and Aboriginal Head Start using federal funding, and 4,100 spaces created through the 2017 Budget Update, more than 15,400 spaces have been created in B.C.Since launching in February 2018, the Childcare BC plan has helped parents in the Chase region save almost $200,000 through the Affordable Child Care Benefit and Child Care Fee Reduction Initiative.Investing in child care and early childhood education is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:
The Village of Chase received a $25,000 grant to help it undertake a needs assessment and create a child care action plan to support local families over the next ten years. This funding comes from the Community Child Care Planning Program, a $3-million partnership between the Province and UBCM.
The Province has made significant investments to improve supports for B.C.’s early care and learning professionals.
To date, the Province has invested more than $13 million to provide more than 10,000 early childhood educators with a $1-per-hour wage enhancement, with another $1-per-hour lift to come in April 2020. This includes almost $3,000 to early childhood educators in the Chase region through the wage enhancement.

Students from British Columbia and around the world can now study for careers in the life sciences, such as genetics, health care, conservation and ecology, in the renovated and expanded Undergraduate Life Sciences Teaching Laboratories at the University of British Columbia (UBC).The $91.4-million project increases capacity and provides life-sciences students with opportunities to learn in well-equipped and spacious teaching laboratories, modern classrooms and study areas with greater possibilities for collaboration and hands-on learning.“This building supports the next generations of researchers finding ways to combat disease, protect agriculture and create innovative medicines,” said Melanie Mark, B.C.’s Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “We expect thousands of careers in science and technology in the next decade, and this state-of-the-art building will empower students to get the hands-on experience they need to thrive and build the best B.C.”The multi-year life-sciences facilities overhaul at UBC’s Vancouver campus was made possible by joint federal-provincial funding through the Post-Secondary Institutions Strategic Investment Fund. The project received $32.5 million from the Government of Canada, $11.8 million from the Government of British Columbia and $47.1 million from UBC.The official opening of the new facility was celebrated with Joyce Murray, federal Minister of Digital Government; Bruce Ralston, B.C.’s Minister of Jobs, Trade and Technology, on behalf of Mark; David Eby, MLA for Vancouver-Point Grey; Santa J. Ono, UBC president and vice-chancellor; and university students, faculty and staff.“This historic investment by the Government of Canada is a down payment on the government’s vision to position Canada as a global centre for innovation,” said Navdeep Bains, federal Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry. “This means making Canada a world leader in turning ideas into solutions, science into technologies, skills into jobs and startup companies into global successes.”The project demolished, renovated and expanded decades-old teaching spaces in the Biological Sciences Centre, north wings and Wesbrook and D.H. Copp buildings at UBC. It consolidates all undergraduate life and biological sciences on campus into one space, including botany, zoology, microbiology and immunology, physiological sciences, biochemistry and molecular biology, with physical space for faculty and over 2,600 students in UBC’s life-sciences programs.“When students learn in modern, cutting-edge laboratories, they get to explore practical problems in a supportive environment that prepares them for the job market,” said Ralston. “The new Undergraduate Life Sciences Teaching Laboratories will help students lead in exciting fields of discovery and succeed in our growing life-sciences sector.”Investments through the Post-Secondary Institutions Strategic Investment Fund are being used to modernize facilities at Canadian universities and colleges, as well as improve the energy efficiency of these facilities and reduce their impact on the environment.The project renovated 5,490 square metres, renewed 5,348 square metres and added 9,069 square metres. It also improved the environmental performance of the facility to be consistent with CleanBC and is targeting LEED Gold standard certification.CleanBC is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and supports a commitment in the Confidence and Supply Agreement to implement climate action to meet B.C.’s targets.This new facility supports programs that can contribute to a cleaner B.C. For example, students can go on to work in the biotechnology sector, developing bacteria that consume toxic chemicals and reduce pollution, or research environmental degradation.Quotes:Joyce Murray, federal Minister of Digital Government –“The Government of Canada’s investment in The University of British Columbia is creating the right conditions for innovation and long-term growth, which will keep the Canadian economy globally competitive. It’s not only about creating jobs today; we are helping prepare young Canadians for the well-paying middle-class jobs of tomorrow.”David Eby, MLA for Vancouver-Point Grey –“UBC is an integral part of a vibrant Vancouver community and a global leader in teaching, learning and research. The new Undergraduate Life Sciences Teaching Laboratories allow it to continue to provide world-class education to its students and to develop tomorrow’s scientific leaders who will make life better for future generations of people in British Columbia and beyond.”Santa J. Ono, president and vice-chancellor, UBC –“This unique partnership between the Government of Canada, the Province of B.C. and the University of British Columbia will further enable UBC to attract leading life-sciences researchers and ensure our students are inspired to innovate and discover in exceptional learning facilities.”Learn More:Canada’s innovation agenda: http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/062.nsf/eng/homePost-Secondary Institutions Strategic Investment Fund: http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/051.nsf/eng/homeCleanBC strategy: https://cleanbc.gov.bc.ca/University of British Columbia: https://www.ubc.ca/A backgrounder follows.

People in Oliver and the surrounding communities will have access to improved patient care, thanks to construction upgrades completed at South Okanagan General Hospital (SOGH).“Our government has invested in an upgraded emergency department at SOGH so that the people living in this community can receive quality health-care services when they need it,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “I saw first-hand the need to upgrade the emergency department after touring the hospital in the fall of 2017 and am pleased that health-care workers can continue to provide exemplary care to local residents in the improved space that they deserve.”The project cost was $970,000. The provincial government contributed 60%. The Okanagan Similkameen Regional Hospital District funded 40%. Work was bolstered by a further $280,000 commitment from the South Okanagan Similkameen Medical Foundation.Construction upgrades were done to meet staff and patient requirements as outlined in the project business plan. They included developing a new waiting and triage area, a quiet room for families and a separate emergency department entrance. The admitting and administration services were relocated. This will mean more privacy and convenience for patients.A new team-care station will also enhance working conditions for staff. A private area for physicians enables them to consult with specialists as required.The renovated emergency department opens to patients on Jan. 21, 2020.Quotes:Doug Cochrane, board chair, Interior Health –“People who come to the emergency department are often arriving when they are most vulnerable. These renovations will not only give patients and their families more privacy, but the new entrance also provides clear and direct access to immediate care when it’s needed most.”Petra Veintimilla, chair, Okanagan Similkameen Regional Hospital District –“This project was very important specifically for residents of Oliver and Osoyoos, but also for residents right across the Okanagan-Similkameen. We are pleased to support these renovations to SOGH to create a more patient-friendly emergency department, including space for families.”Carey Bornn, executive director, South Okanagan Similkameen Medical Foundation –“We’re very excited to see this project completed at South Okanagan General Hospital. This type of bright, patient-friendly space enhances both the care of patients and working conditions for staff. We were very happy to be able to help fund this project.”

Delivering on its commitment to enhance access to justice for British Columbians, the Government of B.C. has provided a $250,000 grant to establish a new legal clinic at the Kamloops and District Elizabeth Fry Society.“Cuts to legal aid by the previous government meant that often times residents of the Kamloops area had to seek legal assistance and advice over the phone with lawyers in Vancouver, if they could find help at all,” said David Eby, Attorney General. “With the new legal clinic here in Kamloops, residents are now able to connect in person with a lawyer who is able to provide legal aid face to face.”  The Kamloops and District Elizabeth Fry Society is a community-based non-profit agency that offers programs and services related to housing and community, with a focus on women and youth. The society provides programs, services and public education aimed at building a healthy and safe community by minimizing barriers, meeting the needs of marginalized people and fostering personal growth and self-sufficiency.The grant, which was awarded through the Law Foundation of BC, is part of a $2-million commitment by government that will support eight advocacy clinics in the province to hire experienced lawyers and staff who can offer legal advice to their clients and act as legal counsel in proceedings. The foundation will provide coaching, tools and support to enhance the services provided by the society, all at no cost to their clients.“Navigating the justice system can be a costly and stressful experience, particularly for the most vulnerable residents of our province,” Eby said. “This funding sends a clear message that our government is helping ensure that all British Columbians are able to access the legal assistance they require whenever they need it.”Quotes:Cassandra Schwarz, executive director, Kamloops and District Elizabeth Fry Society —“The new poverty law clinic significantly improves access to justice for low-income individuals in our community. Many of our clients were previously forced to access lawyers outside of our community, creating barriers to services that many do not have the ability to overcome. The addition of a poverty law clinic in our community is a great step forward in reducing these barriers and supporting the rights of low-income individuals that has been ignored for too many years.”Josh Paterson, executive director, Law Foundation of BC —“The Law Foundation of BC is pleased to support the people of Kamloops and the Thompson-Nicola region through this announcement. There is no substitute for face-to-face interactions when it comes to legal counsel, and we are confident this funding will only enhance the Kamloops and District Elizabeth Fry Society’s ability to provide support and improved outcomes for vulnerable people.”Brandy, client, Kamloops and District Elizabeth Fry Society —“When my case needed assistance from a lawyer, I had to contact an organization in Vancouver. This is an awesome idea. I like talking face-to-face, not over the phone. Being a visual person, I find it better to have the personal contact.

Mount Elphinstone, located on the west side of Howe Sound between Gibsons and Sechelt on British Columbia’s Sunshine Coast, is designated as provincial forest. Current land use supports management for a variety of values, including forestry, water, wildlife and recreation.Mount Elphinstone land use
All forestry activities on Crown land are managed according to established legal objectives for protection of recreation, soils, timber supply, wildlife, water, fish, biodiversity (e.g., old forest representation), visual landscapes and cultural resources.
Currently, parkland and open space available for recreation in the Sunshine Coast Regional District total 15,400 hectares, with approximately, 12,200 hectares classified as provincial park.
Mount Elphinstone Provincial Park, which has three separate units totalling 139 hectares, was established in 2000 as part of the Lower Mainland Protected Areas Strategy.
Since its inception in 2003, BC Timber Sales (BCTS) has operated on Mount Elphinstone to support timber pricing that ensures British Columbians get a fair return for use of Crown resources and to generate revenue for the Province.
BCTS has consistently worked with local stakeholders to meet community concerns that include the addition of new old growth management areas, buffering trails of importance to the local community and incorporating specific measures to protect riparian and aquatic areas.
There are no provincial plans to expand the existing provincial park. However, the Province is cognizant of aspirations of the Sunshine Coast Regional District and some community groups to enhance protection in the Mount Elphinstone area. Initiatives, such as modernized land-use planning (jointly lead by the Province and the shíshálh Nation) and the Old Growth Strategic Review, may influence future land management or use in this area.
Management strategies to address key values on Mount Elphinstone
Old growth management areas are used to help achieve biodiversity targets and provide protection for a variety of forest values on the land base. There are more than 2,900 hectares in old growth management areas in the Mount Elphinstone area and some are established along Mount Elphinstone Park boundaries.
At-risk rare plant communities exist across the landscape, including the Mount Elphinstone area, and are managed by maintaining or improving the amount and distribution of mature and older-age forests over time. 
As the forests grow older, particularly in areas designated to conserve or protect forest values across the landscape, the risk of losing adequate representation of these plant communities decreases. Ongoing BCTS management practices will result in an increase in the amount of older forests in this landscape unit, while still accommodating some timber harvesting.
At the site level, rare plant communities are managed by foresters who locate the communities and incorporate management strategies into forest harvest and silviculture plans. At a site level, wildlife tree retention areas can provide additional representation of and protection across the landscape in conjunction with forest development planning as management strategies may specifically involve adjusting the shape or position of the cutblock to avoid the rare plant community or using the rare and endangered plant community to “anchor” a wildlife tree retention area.
The Province continues to assess the effectiveness of this management approach for rare plant communities and will present a report to the Forest Practices Board, specific to Mount Elphinstone, by the end of 2019.
In recognition of the importance that this area has to local residents, BCTS has reduced the average harvest rate to about 27 hectares per year on the south-facing slope of Mount Elphinstone – a rate of harvest approximately half the rate that the area can support.
Over the years, BCTS has responded to input from various stakeholders who participated in the BCTS community consultation process, and blocks have been dropped or converted into old growth management areas.
Timber Sales Licence A93884
Timber sales licence A93884, known as Clack Creek, first appeared in the 2008 BCTS operating plan that was shared with community groups, First Nations and local governments.
As a result of stakeholder input, the size of the harvest area has been reduced by 30% and wildlife tree retention areas have increased by 20%.
A93884 is comprised largely of second-growth forest with scattered Douglas fir veteran trees that survived historical fire or harvesting on the south face of Mount Elphinstone. Specific measures incorporated into the final design of A93884 exceed legal requirements, including:
buffering a popular mountain bike trail from harvest;
placing additional setbacks on streams;

These co-ordinators understand what clients are experiencing and are trained to assist others in finding new jobs or training opportunities.  Eligible forestry workers will have their needs and goals assessed, before being connected to government programs or services that match them with other jobs, supports or training. This can include education upgrades, special designations, credentials or certifications ranging from trade tickets to driver’s licence classifications.Part of the assessment will look at other factors, such as a worker’s willingness to move to where similar job vacancies are available, or hobbies and skills such as carpentry or cooking, where with additional help, the worker can participate in different sectors and trades facing labour shortages.The job placement co-ordination offices have received nearly 100 job-match forms. Outreach to workers is underway.The job placement offices are open 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday to Friday. For questions about the program or eligibility, call 1 844 778-2200 (toll-free).Learn More:For office locations or to apply to the job matching program online, visit:

New data released by BC Housing shows a significant increase in the number of purpose-built rental homes registered in British Columbia, while continuing to show high levels of new home registrations overall.The December 2019 New Homes Registry Report shows that in 2019, 12,289 purpose-built rental homes were registered in B.C., a 64% increase compared to 2018. Compared to 2016, the increase is even more significant, at more than double the 5,173 rentals registered that year. Data from the most recent three years, 2017-19, shows 28,642 new purpose-built rental homes were registered, which is more than the previous decade’s combined total.“Our government’s record investments in housing affordability, along with measures to reduce speculation in the market and stimulate an increase in rental supply, are delivering much-needed rental homes for people throughout the province,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “This data is an encouraging sign that we are heading in the right direction and that our policy actions are shifting the market toward delivering more of the right type of housing that meets the needs of the people who live here.”Purpose-built rentals represented more than a quarter (28.2%) of all housing units registered in 2019, up from 16.4% in 2018 and the highest proportion achieved since BC Housing started collecting this data in 2002.This increase in purpose-built rentals comes in the context of continued high levels of new home registrations, with the last three years representing record levels, well above the 10-year average. Registered new home data is a leading indicator of housing activity in B.C. as the data is collected at the beginning of a project before building permits are issued.Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quick Facts:
Under the Homeowner Protection Act, all new homes in the province are required to be registered with BC Housing. The registration must occur prior to the issuance of building permits.
Budget 2018 launched the most significant investment in housing affordability in B.C.'s history – more than $7 billion over 10 years. As a result of that investment, more than 22,000 new homes are completed or underway in communities throughout B.C. (as of Aug. 31, 2019).

The gypsy moth technical advisory committee has determined it is necessary to treat 167 hectares to eradicate gypsy moth.The planned treatment will use aircraft to apply Bacillus thuringiensis var kurstaki (Btk), a biological insecticide that occurs naturally in soil and is commonly used in organic agriculture. Btk is effective at treating gypsy moth. It impacts only caterpillars that eat sprayed leaves and has a proven safety record around humans. Livestock, pets, birds, fish, spiders, bees, ladybugs and amphibians are not impacted by Btk.The gypsy moth is an introduced pest species. The caterpillars feed on tree leaves and can damage forests, farms and orchards.

The BC Coroners Service continues to work with the RCMP, New York Academy of the Arts and the Nova Scotia Medical Examiner on a unique project that combines art and science and solicits help from the public to identify decedents using reconstructed faces.The BC Coroners Service provided the RCMP with skulls from 14 unidentified human remains investigations in B.C. dating back to 1972. The skulls were then recreated with 3D printing and transported to the New York Academy of the Arts. Facial reconstruction was done by students in New York with the hope that, with the public’s help, they will soon be able to put names to these faces.“The 14 skulls provided by the BC Coroners Service as reference material are part of the B.C. inventory of cold cases,” said Eric Petit, director, Special Investigations Unit, BC Coroners Service. “Specifically, these are investigations where we have reached an impasse in terms of identifying the deceased individuals.”In total, 15 skulls were provided for the project, including one from Nova Scotia. However, these victims could be from anywhere. Anyone who thinks they might recognize a face is asked to submit tips on the Canada’s Missing website.“This partnership is a unique opportunity to try to draw new breath into otherwise stalled investigations,” Petit said. “Our hope is that these reconstructions will trigger a memory that results in someone connecting with us or the RCMP, which will lead us to identifying these individuals. This collaborative project builds on other identification tools, including our unidentified human remains viewer, to help us close cold cases in our province.”Traditionally, when human remains are found, investigators use a variety of methods to identify the person. They may compare the remains to descriptions of reported missing persons. They can send samples for DNA testing or search dental records. Often, these methods yield results, but when they are unsuccessful, police, coroners and medical examiners might turn to more creative methods.“This project was a true collaborative effort by many agencies within Canada, and we are grateful to the BC Coroners Service for  their significant contribution,” said Marie-Claude Arsenault, RCMP chief superintendent and the officer in charge of the RCMP’s sensitive and specialized investigative services. “Every face tells a story, and these are 15 individuals who deserve to have their stories told. Any detail, no matter how small it may seem, could be the missing piece of the puzzle.”Students at the academy’s forensic sculpture workshop reconstructed the faces under the guidance of Joe Mullins, a senior forensic artist with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in the U.S. The BC Coroners Service and the Nova Scotia Medical Examiner provided information such as sex, ethnicity and height for the unidentified human remains investigations. Armed with that knowledge, as well as their anatomical expertise and artistic skills, the students spent the week reconstructing the faces by applying clay to 3D-printed versions of actual skulls.The reconstructed faces will go on display in New York in April 2020 as part of the New York Academy of Art’s Open Studios event.Quick Facts:
The New York Academy of Art has hosted its forensic sculpture workshop annually since 2015.
Since 2015, four visual identifications have been directly attributed to facial reconstructions performed during the workshop.
In B.C., there are 179 unidentified human remains investigations open.
There are currently over 700 unidentified remains in the RCMP’s national database of missing persons and unidentified remains.

The provincial government is more than doubling the number of specialty nurse training opportunities in the province by funding 1,000 seats each year at the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT).This increase will help meet growing demand for care throughout British Columbia. Specialty nurses work in high-skill areas ranging from emergency settings to intensive care units for high-risk cardiac care patients, to delivering babies and providing newborn care, to working with complex patients with multiple health challenges.“Specialty nurses help us when we need emergency care; they help deliver our babies and they care for us when we are seriously ill,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “Increasing the number of specialty nurse seats helps people get trained for some of the most important and in-demand jobs in B.C. That is why we created more training opportunities for nurses – so they have the tools they need to be there for British Columbians when we need them most.”BCIT’s specialty nursing training program is one of Canada’s most comprehensive, providing nurses advanced hands-on training for work in hospital and community settings. “BCIT offers a balanced education of theory and hands-on experience for its nursing students to be job-ready. I am surrounded by a small cohort of classmates and passionate instructors who are supportive and empowering,” said Christina Dixon, BCIT nursing student, school of health sciences. “It feels like a community and team, making a strong parallel to the clinical setting. As an Indigenous nursing student, I am honoured and prepared to make a long-term difference, while creating a culturally safe and supportive environment for patients from all backgrounds.” Starting in 2018-19, the Province added 611 training seats to the previous 389 seat baseline for a total of 1,000 seats. The Province is providing funding at that level for 2019-20 and 2020-21 and will continue to provide support going forward to help ensure B.C.’s health-care workforce is ready to meet patient needs.“Caring for B.C.’s growing and aging population is a priority for this government, which is why we’re investing in specialty nursing programs so students can train for high-demand careers that are critical for modern health care in our province,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “We are expanding nursing and health-care programs across the province including in the North, the Northeast and on Vancouver Island because we understand British Columbians need and deserve top-quality health care.”Nursing is one of the fastest-growing job sectors in the province, due to a growing and aging population. Approximately 60% of B.C.’s nurses work in complex or acute settings in health authorities – up from 44% four years ago. The demand for specialty nurses, such as perinatal, emergency and critical care, is increasing throughout the province.“This funding will give more nurses the professional development they need to accelerate their careers and to apply for leadership, teaching and community health positions,” said Jacqollyne Keath, board chair, Nurses and Nurse Practitioners of British Columbia. “Specialty nursing is a rewarding and in demand career with positions available around the province.”Doubling the number of specialty nurse seats is part of ongoing efforts from the ministries of Health and Advanced Education, Skills and Training to ensure the number, type and location of health-care training opportunities meet B.C.’s patient and population needs.“With one of the most comprehensive specialty nursing programs in Canada, BCIT is proud to support the thousands of nurses that are a cornerstone of the B.C. health-care system,” said Kathy Kinloch, president, BCIT. “This investment from the provincial government enables BCIT to expand quality specialty nursing training that directly supports B.C.’s health-care sector.”  The ministries of Health and Advanced Education, Skills and Training work closely with health authorities and other partners to align the number, type and location of health-care workers to meet patient and population needs.“On behalf of nurses around this province, the BC Nurses’ Union welcomes this significant investment in specialty education,” said Christine Sorensen, president, British Columbia Nurse’s Union. “Today’s announcement is a promising step toward addressing the province’s nurse shortage and the impact it’s having on patient care. We look forward to continuing to work with government and all stakeholders to ensure a comprehensive health human resources plan is in place to manage this complex issue.”This increase supports additional actions by the government to ensure expanded nursing education opportunities in B.C. In June 2019, the first nursing degree program in the Northeast was announced. The University of Northern British Columbia’s program is a five-semester, two-year bachelor of science in nursing program, which will support 32 students at full capacity. The first class of 16 student spaces, to be operated out of Northern Lights College in Fort St. John, is expected to be up and running this fall.Learn More:For more information on the specialty nursing program at BCIT, visit:

A previously announced inquest into the death of Dylan Levi Judd has been cancelled.Judd died in custody at the Kamloops Regional Correctional Centre in November 2014.An inquest into Judd’s death was originally announced in 2015 when it was determined that the public had an interest in being informed of the circumstances surrounding the death.Subsequent investigation led to an individual being charged with second-degree murder in connection with Judd’s death. A B.C. Supreme Court trial ran for approximately nine days and concluded in 2019 with an acquittal. The reasons for judgment of Justice Sheri Ann Donegan are publicly available.The chief coroner has determined that the criminal trial served to inform the public of the circumstances of this death and, therefore, there is no longer a need to hold an inquest for that purpose. As a result, the investigation into Judd’s death will be concluded by way of a coroner’s report.

Le gouvernement du Canada est heureux de travailler avec le gouvernement de la Colombie-Britannique pour aider à la formation d’un nombre encore plus grand d’éducateurs qualifiés. »Le gouvernement de la Colombie-Britannique a lancé l’ECE Education Support Fund en septembre 2018, avec comme objectif de venir en aide à 4 000 étudiants d’ici la fin de mars 2020. À ce jour, ce programme a remis plus de 5 400 bourses afin de permettre à encore plus de futurs éducateurs de compléter leur formation en éducation à la petite enfance. Pour ce faire, 1,9 million de dollars ont été ajoutés aux 10 millions déjà investis.« Pendant trop longtemps, les fournisseurs de services de garde ont dû livrer bataille pour trouver du personnel qualifié. Pour bien des parents, cela a fait en sorte qu’il était impossible de trouver des services de garde de qualité pour leurs enfants, a déclaré Katrina Chen, ministre d’État chargée des Services de garde d’enfants. Depuis trois ans, l’intérêt des étudiants pour l’éducation à la petite enfance a été tout simplement extraordinaire, et ces bourses permettront d’aider encore plus de gens à acquérir la formation nécessaire pour cette profession très demandée. Nous progressons vers notre engagement à l’égard des familles de la Colombie-Britannique pour des services de garde d’enfants universels, abordables et accessibles en investissant dans les gens qui sont au cœur de tels services. »À la suite du succès de ce programme de bourses, le financement prévu a été épuisé plus tôt que prévu et on a cessé d’accepter des demandes dès le 11 octobre 2019. D’autres fonds sont maintenant disponibles pour les étudiants qui s’étaient inscrits sur la liste d’attente en automne et pour les étudiants qui suivront un programme d’études postsecondaires reconnu au cours de la session d’hiver.« Le développement du cerveau de l’enfant a majoritairement lieu avant l’âge de 5 ans, a déclaré Katrine Conroy, ministre des Enfants et du Développement de la famille de la Colombie-Britannique. En tant qu’ancienne EPE, je sais à quel point cette profession est valorisante et je suis consciente du rôle crucial des éducateurs à la petite enfance quand vient le temps d’aider les enfants aux premiers stades de leur vie, et c’est pour cette raison que je suis si fière de l’aide qu’offre notre gouvernement grâce à ce programme et du travail important effectué par les EPE. »Cet investissement fait partie de la stratégie de recrutement et de maintien en poste concernant la garde et l’apprentissage de la petite enfance en Colombie-Britannique, lancée en septembre 2018. Dans le cadre de cette stratégie, le gouvernement a investi depuis 2017-2018 près de 16 millions de dollars, par le biais de l’Accord entre le Canada et la Colombie-Britannique sur l’apprentissage et la garde de jeunes enfants, afin de soutenir les étudiants.« Ces bourses d’études supplémentaires sont une autre mesure qui tombe à point pour un programme qui connaît déjà un vif succès, a commenté Emily Gawlick, directrice générale d’Early Childhood Educators of BC (ECEBC). Des éducateurs à la petite enfance bien formés sont l’épine dorsale d’un réseau de services de garde d’enfants efficace, et ces fonds seront fort utiles pour aider encore plus de gens à terminer leurs études. »Par ailleurs, plus de 10 000 éducateurs à la petite enfance ont reçu une augmentation de salaire de 1 $/heure, et une autre augmentation de 1 $ est prévue en avril 2020. Plus de 600 nouvelles places ont été ajoutées aux programmes d’études postsecondaires en éducation à la petite enfance, ce qui aidera encore plus de gens à entreprendre une carrière en services de garde, alors qu’un financement pour le développement professionnel aidera les éducateurs déjà en poste à maintenir leurs compétences et à en acquérir de nouvelles. « Je suis reconnaissante pour cette aide financière offerte sous forme de bourse, qui m’aide à devenir encore plus autonome, a souligné Friday Bailey, étudiante éducatrice à la petite enfance. Je peux maintenant acquérir des compétences supplémentaires et mieux servir ma communauté. Je remercie ce gouvernement et l’ECEBC d’avoir cru en moi et investi dans une formation de haute qualité en services de garde et en éducation à la petite enfance. Cette bourse a vraiment eu un effet positif pour toute ma famille. »  Investir dans les services de garde d’enfants et dans l’éducation à la petite enfance est une priorité commune du gouvernement de la province et du caucus du BC Green Party. Cette priorité fait partie de l’accord de confiance et de soutien, le Confidence and Supply Agreement.  Quelques faits :Les personnes souhaitant travailler à l’éducation de jeunes enfants à titre d’EPE, ainsi que celles qui exercent déjà cette profession, peuvent profiter de bourses d’un montant pouvant aller jusqu’à 4 000 $ et à 5 000 $. Pour en savoir plus :Des bourses d’études en éducation à la petite enfance sont présentement offertes dans 32 établissements d’enseignement postsecondaire en Colombie-Britannique.

People living in the Central Okanagan now have better access to team-based day-to-day public health care with the opening of the new Kelowna Urgent and Primary Care Centre (UPCC).“The Kelowna UPCC will help connect more people in Central Okanagan communities with the health care they need, when they need it,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “Thousands of area residents who currently lack a primary-care provider will benefit from increased access to same-day appointments for urgent needs and ongoing primary care, as well being able to find a doctor or care provider for regular, ongoing primary care.”The Kelowna UPCC is one of three centres now open in Interior Health. Fourteen UPCCs have been announced throughout B.C. under the government’s primary-care strategy. The Kelowna UPCC is a partnership between the Ministry of Health, Interior Health, the Central Okanagan Division of Family Practice and the Doctors of BC. Interior Health also collaborated with the Westbank First Nation, patient partners and the Central Okanagan Regional Hospital District to develop the UPCC.The centre will provide urgent primary care for Central Okanagan residents by a team of health-care providers, including doctors, nurse practitioners, nurses, social workers and office staff.The centre will serve two purposes:
to provide care for people with non-life-threatening conditions who need to see a health-care provider within 12 to 24 hours, but don’t require an emergency department and who do not have or cannot access their family practitioner;
to help attach patients to a regular primary-care provider.
To facilitate this, the centre will attach patients to health-care providers in the community in collaboration with the Central Okanagan Division of Family Practice. Unattached patients will be provided with ongoing wraparound care on an interim basis, while arranging for patients to be connected to other local practices for their care.Net new clinical staffing includes 22 full-time equivalent practitioners, including physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, social workers, respiratory therapists and physiotherapists, working together to provide team-based care for patients.The Kelowna UPCC is located at 1141 Harvey Ave.This is the third UPCC to open in Interior Health, following the Vernon UPCC, which opened in October 2019, and the Kamloops UPCC that opened in June 2018. Since opening, the Vernon UPCC has had 1,274 patient visits and the Kamloops UPCC has had 20,810 patient visits.Learn More:B.C.’s UPCC locations can be viewed by visiting: https://news.gov.bc.ca/files/bc-urgent-and-primary-care-centres.pdfTo learn more about the Province’s primary health-care strategy, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018PREM0034-001010To learn more about the Province’s strategy to increase the number of nurse practitioners, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018HLTH0034-000995To learn more about the Province’s strategy to recruit and retain more family medicine graduates, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018HLTH0052-001043Two backgrounders follow.

People experiencing poverty now have better access to income and disability assistance through a series of changes designed to give them the help they need, when they need it.“We took a careful look at the existing policies for income and disability assistance and asked if they’re helping or harming the people they are meant to support,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “All of these changes are removing unnecessary barriers that prevent people who were already struggling to get the support they need to break out of the cycle of poverty.”Changes to the Employment and Assistance Act and the Employment and Assistance for Persons with Disabilities Act and regulations took effect on Jan. 1, 2020. These include:
ending the requirement for seniors to pursue Canada Pension Plan retirement benefits before the age of 65;
expanding access to security deposits and introducing a pet damage deposit;
amending the definition of spouse; and
eliminating the two-year independence rule.
Simpson made the announcement while meeting with one of the new community integration specialists (CIS) at the Vancouver Aboriginal Friendship Centre Society. Through the Ministry of Social Development and Poverty Reduction, the CIS position is designed to bridge the gap between some of B.C.’s most vulnerable people and supports and services. CIS workers go into communities to connect people to their local agencies and organizations.The CIS team and policy amendments are part of a cross-government effort to better connect people with the services they need. Barriers, like a lack of identification or a security deposit for a home, can prevent people from receiving important services, accessing income assistance or finding stable housing. Government is identifying and reducing barriers by updating policies and ensuring that the changes reach the people they are designed to help.The changes are part of a series of amendments. The first set of changes took effect in July 2019 and included expanding access to the identification supplement, removing the $10,000 asset limit on a primary vehicle and expanding the moving supplement for people to move anywhere in B.C. All of the changes reflect the principles of affordability, accessibility, social inclusion and reconciliation, as laid out in TogetherBC: British Columbia’s Poverty Reduction Strategy.Delivering on the Poverty Reduction Strategy is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.Quotes:Susan Tatoosh, executive director, Vancouver Aboriginal Friendship Centre Society –“A new partnership between the Vancouver Aboriginal Friendship Centre Society and the Ministry of Social Development and Poverty Reduction has a community integration specialist working in our office once a week and connecting one-on-one with the urban Indigenous people who we support here. Having a CIS team member in the office helps to streamline access to government services for urban Indigenous people who are experiencing poverty and homelessness, and recognizes the importance of VAFCS’s culturally based supports and services.”Adrienne Montani, provincial co-ordinator, First Call: B.C. Child and Youth Advocacy Coalition –“The elimination of the policy requirement that young adults are financially independent for two years before receiving income assistance will help vulnerable young adults get the support they need right away. This is an important change that will better support youth aging out of care, who already experience multiple barriers that prevent them from moving forward into adulthood. It is equally important for other youth who do not have family support during this important time in their transition to adulthood.”Learn More:Read TogetherBC: British Columbia’s Poverty Reduction Strategy: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/about-the-bc-government/poverty-reduction-strategyTo learn more about the July 2019 policy changes, visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2019SDPR0051-001379A backgrounder follows.

Two public information meetings will be held in the Williams Lake area to provide details about wildfire risk reduction projects that will be completed over the next two years in areas where urban development borders on forested areas.The Ministry of Forests, Lands, Natural Resource Operations and Rural Development will direct these risk reduction projects and will host the following information sessions:
Wednesday, Jan. 15, 2020
	7 p.m.
	Williams Lake City Hall
	450 Mart St.
	Williams Lake

Thursday, Jan. 23, 2020
	7 p.m.
	Miocene Community Hall
	3511 Horsefly Rd.
	150 Mile House
At each of these meetings, a presentation from ministry staff will be followed by a question-and-answer session. FireSmart information will be available for residents who wish to reduce wildfire hazards on private property.Planned wildfire risk reduction projects in the Williams Lake area:Preliminary fieldwork for these projects began in fall 2019, and the treatments will continue periodically over the next two years. Areas with steep slopes, fuel hazards or weather patterns that could affect wildfire behaviour have been prioritized, as well as areas close to residences or critical infrastructure.A primary goal of these projects is to reduce the size and intensity of any future wildfires in the Williams Lake area, which will make it easier for firefighters to defend communities. Risk reduction activities may include:
removing hazardous trees and flammable shrubs;
reducing accumulations of woody debris and other fuels on the forest floor;
thinning forested areas; and
pruning low-hanging tree branches to help prevent fire from moving into the upper branches of trees.
About 1,200 hectares of interface land will be treated. Project areas include:
South Lakeside neighbourhood;
Williams Lake River Valley;
Highway 97 South corridor from Broadway Avenue North to the White Road area;
Highway 97 North corridor near the Williams Lake Regional Airport;
Soda Creek Road and MacKenzie Avenue North area;
Fox Mountain, including the Centennial Drive, Eider Drive and Pheasant Drive areas;
west side of Dog Creek Road (south of Gibbon Road) and east side of Dog Creek Road (south of Gun A Noot Trail);
Chimney Valley Road; and
Horsefly Road and Spokin Lake Road junction (Dewar Lake area).
In addition to reducing wildfire risks to communities, these projects will improve the long-term health and resiliency of forests and enhance habitat for mule deer and other wildlife. Other important factors, such as recreational use, riparian areas and cultural values, were considered when planning these projects.Many of the planned activities overlap the priority treatment areas identified in the Williams Lake and Area Community Wildfire Protection Plan, which was developed by multiple agencies, communities and First Nations. Ministry staff will continue to work closely with residents and First Nations as these projects get underway.The planned activities may temporarily limit public access to some trails in areas being treated. The ministry will advise the public of any lengthy closures, should they be required.Learn More: Wildfire risk reduction strategies: http://gov.bc.ca/wildfirepreventionRead about the FireSmart program or download the FireSmart Begins at Home manual: https://firesmartbc.ca/

New investments in the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) for sonography and cardiovascular perfusion programs will mean more graduates and better health care for people in British Columbia.“Students, health-care workers and patients have been calling on government to increase sonography training across the province for years, and we are answering that call with new and expanded programs in Northern B.C., Vancouver Island and now the Lower Mainland,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “We’re investing in BCIT so more students can train for dynamic and rewarding health-care careers and deliver the high-quality care British Columbians rely upon.” Government is investing a total of $2.5 million. Funding of $880,000 will support the expansion of BCIT’s diagnostic medical sonography and cardiovascular perfusion programs.Eight first-year seats were added to the existing 32 sonography seats in September 2019. Another eight first-year seats will be added in 2020 for a total of 48 first-year seats.Capital funding of $1.6 million will allow purchase of the necessary sonography equipment. Beginning in 2020, the cardiovascular perfusion program will expand by three seats – by moving the program intake from seven students every two years to an annual intake of five students.“Our government wants to make sure people have even greater access to health care in B.C. We need even more caring, compassionate and well-trained people to make our health system work – from health sciences professionals to physicians and nurse practitioners,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “Our announcement today will address the need for more health-care workers, which is one of the biggest challenges facing the health system.”In fiscal 2020-21, the Province will provide $640,000 in operating funding toward northern B.C.’s first sonography program at the College of New Caledonia (CNC). In addition, capital funding of $1.5 million has been provided for equipment and renovations at CNC. In October 2019, the Province also announced Vancouver Island’s first Diagnostic Medical Sonography program at Camosun College with one-time funding of $1.4 million.“BCIT was the first post-secondary to offer diagnostic sonography in B.C. and is one of only three institutions in Canada to teach cardiovascular profusion, both of which are critically important specialties in our growing health-care system,” said Kathy Kinloch, president, BCIT. “We are proud of the increasing number of graduates providing quality care to British Columbians, thanks to ongoing support from the provincial government. This funding helps ensure that we continue to provide state-of-the-art equipment and training to more skilled professionals essential to B.C.’s health-care workforce.”As B.C.’s population continues to age, health professionals are in increasingly high demand – the 2018 BC Labour Market Outlook projected 82,100 job openings in the health professions by 2028. Cardiovascular perfusionists and sonographers are two of the top 13 health professions identified as in high demand.Quotes:Janet Routledge, MLA for Burnaby North – “I’m delighted that students in my riding will have increased access to top-quality speciality health training at BCIT so they can train for in-demand jobs that will help build fulfilling and rewarding careers. Supporting students in these specialty positions will help deliver the high-quality health care that British Columbians need and deserve.”Danny Zaporozan, student, diagnostic medical sonography program, BCIT – “As students in the BCIT diagnostic medical sonography program, we not only learn from the best in the industry, we are also learning from instructors who will be our colleagues in the future. Our instructors are sonographers who provide us with hands-on experience for the real world. The training at BCIT is so practical and thorough, it makes me feel fully prepared to make a difference in the health-care world and to be an everyday hero in my job.”Quick Facts:
BCIT was the first public-sector institution in B.C. to offer a diagnostic medical sonography program.
Medical sonographers operate ultrasound equipment to capture images to aid physicians in diagnosis and treatment of medical disorders, and to monitor pregnancies.
Demand for ultrasounds has increased dramatically due to B.C.’s aging population and improvements to the technology and its capabilities. Increasing the number of training seats will help address that need and expand the capacity of health-service providers.
Cardiovascular perfusionists are key members of highly specialized surgical teams. They provide life-saving support to patients undergoing heart and lung surgery by operating complex specialized equipment, such as a cardiopulmonary bypass machine (heart-lung machine), during surgery.

People and families living in Renfrew-Collingwood and surrounding neighbourhoods will soon have access to more quality primary health-care services with the launch of the new RISE Community Health Centre in April 2020.The Province is launching RISE Community Health Centre in collaboration with the Collingwood Neighbourhood House Society to provide comprehensive primary-care services to residents. Community health centres are community governed with services tailored to meet the health needs of the community they serve. The centre will be governed, owned and operated by Collingwood Neighbourhood House.“We’ve listened to people in Renfrew-Collingwood and are using our primary care strategy to build on the good work their community organizations are already doing,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “The RISE Community Health Centre will help connect more people with the health care they need when they need it. This will make a difference for people who have been struggling to access health-care services.”Located at 3425 Crowley Dr., RISE will offer comprehensive primary-care and health-promotion services. This includes attaching people without a primary-care provider to a family doctor or nurse practitioner, providing access to preventative and primary health-care services to patients with complex medical and social needs, mental health and addictions challenges and co-ordination of specialist care.Since November 2019, the health centre has been providing limited primary-care services through a small clinical space at Collingwood Neighbourhood House. It is currently accepting patients by referral from selected organizations and programs. Services at this site will continue when the main location opens, offering services such as chronic disease management, pregnancy, prenatal and postpartum care, mental-health assessment, treatment and support, medication prescription refills and health screenings, assessments and prescriptions.RISE will continue to expand its services and clinical team in the first two years of operation. Over time, patients will also benefit from additional health promotion and disease prevention activities such as a pharmacy dispensary, physiotherapy, nutrition support, counselling and patient education, as well as support to navigate health and social service systems.“RISE Community Health Centre would not be possible without the dedication and tireless efforts of the Collingwood Neighbourhood House Society,” said Dix. “Its passion and support for serving the community has made RISE a reality, and I thank everyone for their continued partnership in this project.” The B.C. government will provide approximately $2.6 million operating budget once the centre reaches full capacity.Quick Facts: 
In April 2020, seven full-time equivalent staff will work at the RISE Community Health Centre’s main location and at Collingwood Neighbourhood House.
The centre expects to have around 12,000 patient visits in the first year of operation.
Community health centres are not-for-profit or co-operative health-care organizations that deliver integrated, people-centred services and programs that reflect the needs of the communities they serve.
There are approximately 100 community health centres that are run by health authorities, and 30 community-governed community health centres in British Columbia.
These centres focus on integrating services and programs in primary care, health promotion, and community well-being, as well as working to address social determinants of health.

Drivers are reminded that a section of the Coquihalla between Hope and Merritt will be closed today from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. to allow for proactive avalanche control.Due to heavy snowfall over the last several weeks, avalanche control via helicopter will be completed from 11 kilometres south of the Great Bear Snowshed to nine kilometres north of the Coquihalla summit. This operation, which is subject to acceptable flying conditions, will remove any weak layers of snow and ice and reduce the overall depth of the snowpack, providing continued safe travel for people using the Coquihalla. The highway will be closed southbound in Merritt and northbound at Hope beginning at 11 a.m., and closed northbound at Portia and southbound at Zopkios beginning at noon. The Coquihalla is expected to reopen by 3 p.m., but changes to the timeline may occur depending on weather.Drivers should alter travel plans as necessary. For the most up-to-date highway travel information, check @DriveBC on Twitter or visit: DriveBC.caDuring avalanche season, people can expect some highway closures, either due to high avalanche hazard conditions or to allow for avalanche control.The ministry’s avalanche program is run by highly trained avalanche professionals who monitor weather and snowpack conditions continuously during the avalanche season. The program manages more than 60 avalanche areas that include almost 1,400 individual avalanche paths around the province.

Alcohol addiction can have devasting impacts on people and families across B.C. No one knows this better than Jennifer.“I’ve lived the devastation that is untreated alcohol addiction,” said Jennifer, whose last name is not being used for privacy reasons. “It tore my family apart.”For years, Jennifer’s now ex-husband struggled with his alcohol use, as have other members of her family.Her ex-husband’s alcohol addiction began several years ago. He would have a few drinks to wind down after a long day at work. But over time, that increased to having several drinks every night.He often lied about his use, replacing empty vodka bottles with water to hide the amount he drank, and Jennifer would find empty liquor bottles hidden around their home. At one point, he totalled his truck. When Jennifer confronted him, he admitted he had a problem and said he would get help – a cycle that continued over and over again – but he never did. Even after speaking to her ex-husband’s doctor, he still did not receive the treatment he needed.As his drinking continued to escalate, so did his behaviour. Her husband became emotionally and verbally abusive, and Jennifer began to fear for her safety and the safety of her children.“I was struggling and dealing with anxiety and was pretty close to having a nervous breakdown because of all the lies, deceit and the denial,” Jennifer said, adding her kids’ relationship with their father suffered as a result. They struggled in school, and were often scared and had nightmares. “I was so concerned, you could see the children breaking down. It was an extremely toxic and volatile environment. It was a matter of mental health and safety.”Jennifer’s husband soon lost his job because of his drinking and became so sick he was eventually hospitalized.After nearly two years of trying to help him overcome his addiction, Jennifer left in June 2018. While she admits she still feels guilty thinking about how she could have left him sooner or how she couldn’t get him the help he needed, she has channelled that energy into something positive.Jennifer is one of many with lived experience who lent their voices to help with the creation of a new made-in-B.C. guideline that physicians and clinicians can use to connect British Columbians who are dealing with high-risk drinking and alcohol-use disorder to services that meet their needs.Contributing to the new guideline, which was developed by the BC Centre on Substance Use, was an experience Jennifer believes has been therapeutic on her own pathway to recovery. The guideline is one she wishes had been around when her ex-husband was in the early stages of his addiction. “I really think that it (the guideline) can offer families an opportunity to get the help that they need before it reaches a devastating point. The earlier the interception, the earlier the chance of recovery,” Jennifer said. “I’m grateful for the opportunity to sit on the board. It has helped me work through things – to grieve and to grow. It’s been a healing process.”The new guideline is a crucial step to help bridge the gap between research and practice. It will be used by physicians and clinicians to manage and treat high-risk drinking and alcohol-use disorder, resulting in more people accessing better, quality care. People, like Jennifer’s ex-husband.Learn More: For more information about the guideline, visit: news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2019MMHA0110-002426

Drivers are advised that a section of the Coquihalla between Hope and Merritt will be closed from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 8, to allow for proactive avalanche control.Due to heavy snowfall over the last several weeks, avalanche control via helicopter is required from 11 kilometres south of the Great Bear Snowshed to nine kilometres north of the Coquihalla summit. This will remove weak layers of snow and ice, and reduce the overall depth of the snowpack, providing continued safe travel for people using the Coquihalla. The highway will be closed southbound in Merritt and northbound at Hope beginning at 11 a.m., and closed northbound at Portia and southbound at Zopkios beginning at noon. The Coquihalla is expected to reopen by 3 p.m., but changes to the timeline may occur, depending on weather.Drivers should change their travel plans as necessary and check DriveBC.ca and @DriveBC on Twitter for the most up-to-date highway travel information.During avalanche season, people can expect some highway closures, either due to high avalanche hazard conditions or to allow for avalanche control.The ministry’s avalanche program is run by highly trained avalanche professionals who monitor weather and snowpack conditions continuously during the avalanche season. The program manages more than 60 avalanche areas that include almost 1,400 individual avalanche paths around the province.

The BC Wildlife Health Program is asking for help assessing the effects of winter ticks on the province’s moose population as part of its annual moose winter tick surveillance program.The program relies on observations from wildlife professionals and the public to monitor the number of moose with hair loss and assess the amount of hair loss on each individual. This information is used to estimate the overall prevalence and distribution of winter ticks.Tick infestations can result in behavioural and physiological changes that may directly affect the survival rates of moose, especially in younger individuals. Winter ticks can contribute to moose population declines, especially when climate change and habitat conditions promote high tick numbers.Winter tick infestations can be observed on moose during January through April. The ticks spend the entire winter on one host. There can be tens of thousands of ticks on one moose.As the female ticks mature, they feed on the blood of the moose in late winter. The irritation causes moose to scratch and groom themselves excessively, resulting in hair loss and less time spent foraging or resting, which can lead to weight loss. The extent of hair loss on a moose can be observed easily from a distance and is a rough indicator of how many ticks are present.Anyone interested in contributing to this surveillance program can fill out a survey online. Alternatively, the electronic survey can be saved and completed on a computer, tablet or mobile device and returned via email to: FLNRMooseTickSurvey@gov.bc.caAn online survey, downloadable survey forms and background information are available on the moose winter tick program website: www.gov.bc.ca/wildlifehealth/mooseticksurveyThe findings of the surveillance program will contribute to the Provincial Moose Research Program, which was initiated in 2013 to investigate factors influencing moose populations in British Columbia.For more information, email: FLNRMooseTickSurvey@gov.bc.caLearn More:Read the latest winter tick study report:

Commercial truck drivers will experience significant time savings on their journeys, thanks to a new streamlined provincial and municipal trip permitting process.The Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, together with several Lower Mainland municipalities and the commercial transport industry, are making Project Cargo Corridor permits available. This streamlines the provincial and municipal trip permitting process for travel to and from Lower Mainland ports and the Alberta border.This is expected to save the trucking industry time and increase confidence for carriers and shippers in order to attract more specialized products through B.C. ports.Project Cargo Corridor permits pre-approve travel for commercial trucks between two major Lower Mainland ports (Fraser Surrey Docks and Lynnterm East Gate) and the Alberta border via Highway 16. The trucks are no longer required to complete the traditional extraordinary-load approval process.It applies to commercial vehicles with the following specifications:
configuration: eight- to 13-axle superloads
gross combined vehicle weight: up to 125,000 kilograms
overall height: up to 4.88 metres
overall width: up to five metres
overall length: up to 50 metres
Other loads of this size require an extraordinary-load approval, which can take up to 12 business days. This is because of the analysis required to ensure the vehicle’s weight and dimensions will not damage infrastructure along the trip route. By having pre-approved vehicle specifications and routing in place, trip approvals on these Project Cargo Corridors can occur within two business days.To make this happen, the ministry has signed information-sharing agreements with municipalities along the corridor, including the District of North Vancouver, the City of Vancouver, the City of Burnaby, the City of Langley, the Township of Langley, the City of Abbotsford and the City of Surrey.The BC Trucking Association and the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority also contributed to the development of Project Cargo Corridor permits. The new permit process will be evaluated throughout the first year of operation, with potential to expand to other highway corridors in the future. Learn More:Project Cargo Corridor: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation/vehicle-safety-enforcement/services/permitting/project-cargo-corridors

A renewed awareness campaign to help keep students safe from sexual violence has launched.Timed to coincide with back-to-class Frost Week 2020 activities, the campaign is aimed at students, both on campus and in the community. As with previous campaigns, social media ads will remind students that sex without consent is rape and that consent must be voluntary – otherwise it is assault.“Our government is responding to a call to action from students to ensure that our campuses are safer for everyone, regardless of gender expression, identity or sexual orientation,” said Melanie Mark, Minister of Advanced Education, Skills and Training. “Any form of sexual violence or misconduct will not be tolerated. Frost Week is a time when students gather to socialize and have fun. It’s a good opportunity for renewed dialogue about what constitutes sexual violence and misconduct, and personal responsibilities and choices.”The provincewide campaign will engage students where they are most likely to see it – on digital platforms including Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram. In June 2019, the Province announced $760,000 to support a number of initiatives, including a plain-language review of policies and processes regarding sexual violence and misconduct to ensure they are clear and easy to understand. The funding is also being used to co-ordinate resources, so that post-secondary institutions can learn from each other, share best practices and access training resources.All 25 of B.C.’s public post-secondary institutions are required to have sexual violence and misconduct policies. The Sexual Violence and Misconduct Policy Act also requires institutions to make their policies publicly available. Provincial regulations require private institutions with student residences to have policies in place.Quick Facts:
The Frost Week 2020 campaign follows the Province’s Frosh Week 2019 Sexual Violence Prevention campaign that launched Aug. 29, 2019, and ran until Oct. 21, 2019.
The fall 2019 campaign included outreach through a student-climate survey to better understand lived experience and evaluate needs on campus going forward.
Student feedback that informed both campaigns was also collected from a forum in June 2019 called Moving Forward Together: Building Capacity to Prevent and Respond to Sexual Violence on Campus.

The 2020 homeowner grant threshold in British Columbia has been set at $1.525 million, maintaining that 92% of homeowners continue to be eligible for the B.C. Home Owner Grant.The threshold is down from $1.65 million in 2019 due to moderating housing prices throughout the province. The threshold has again been set to ensure the same percentage of residential property owners are below the threshold and eligible for the full, basic grant amount. In years prior, rapidly rising housing prices led to an increase in the threshold.The homeowner grant reduces the amount of property tax people pay to a municipality or to the Province for people who live in a rural area.The grant is reduced by $5 for every $1,000 of assessed value above the threshold, meaning eligible homeowners with properties assessed above the threshold receive a partial grant until it is fully phased out. Some low-income owners, such as seniors or people with disabilities, can also apply for a supplement that replaces any grant amount they lose due to the value of their home being over the threshold.The homeowner grant amounts are:
up to $570 for the basic homeowner grant.
up to $770 if the home is located in a northern or rural area. A “northern or rural area” means outside the Metro Vancouver, Fraser Valley and Capital Regional districts.
up to $845 for homeowners who are 65 years or older, or if the homeowner is a person with a disability or lives with a relative who has a disability.
up to $1,045 for homes in northern or rural areas where the homeowner is 65 years or older, or the homeowner is a person with a disability.
The B.C. government reimburses municipalities for the full cost of the grant to ensure local government tax revenues are not affected.Homeowners may also be eligible for property tax deferment if they are 55 years or older or are financially supporting a dependent child.Learn More:To apply for a B.C.

The new year marks the end of Medical Services Plan (MSP) premiums, saving B.C. families up to $1,800 a year and individuals up to $900 a year.While MSP premiums are a thing of the past as of Jan. 1, 2020, here are some important reminders for British Columbians.British Columbians who had been paying their premiums using auto-payments through their credit card or financial institution are reminded to cancel those automated payments.British Columbians must also keep their address up to date, which can be done online at: www.gov.bc.ca/managingyourmspaccountAlthough British Columbians will no longer be invoiced for new premiums starting Jan. 1, 2020, elimination of MSP premiums does not forgive outstanding premiums owed.People may be eligible for relief on premium amounts still owing. For example, retroactive premium assistance could be provided based on net income for a given tax year, family size and disability status. Although British Columbians no longer pay premiums, they must remain enrolled in MSP. The plan will continue to provide eligible B.C. residents with provincially insured health-care benefits.For questions about making a payment or account balances, contact Revenue Services of BC, Monday to Thursday, 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.; Friday, 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.; or Saturday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (Pacific time) at 1 877 405-4909 (toll-free).For questions about retroactive premium assistance, or to update a MSP account, contact Health Insurance BC, Monday to Friday from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (Pacific time) at 1 800 663-7100 (toll-free) or 604 683-7151 (Lower Mainland).Learn More:To learn more about the elimination of MSP premiums in B.C., visit: https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2019PREM0126-002326To learn more and to apply for retroactive premium assistance, visit: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/health-drug-coverage/msp/bc-residents/premiums/retroactive-premium-assistanceA backgrounder follows.

The first anniversary of a $105-million investment over three years in Fair PharmaCare deductibles and co-payments shows that the changes are making a real difference in people’s lives.“In the first three months since government made the changes to Fair PharmaCare, around 88,300 more lower-income families have benefited,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “This means fewer people are having to make the difficult choice when going to the grocery store between either buying food and daily necessities for their family or prescription medicine.”After expanding Fair PharmaCare, the number of families earning up to $30,000 that received paid drug benefits during the first three months of the year increased from 63,600 during January to March 2018, to 151,900 during January to March 2019, an increase of 88,300 families.These changes made to Fair PharmaCare mean that households earning up to $30,000 in net income annually no longer pay deductibles and the provincial government pays 70% of their eligible prescription drug costs right away.Previously, a household earning a net annual income between $15,000 and $30,000 would have to pay between $300 and $600 in deductibles before Fair PharmaCare would start to provide coverage assistance.“This was the first-ever change to Fair PharmaCare deductibles and co-payments since the program was created 16 years ago,” Dix said. “Previously, anyone registered with Fair PharmaCare, even people with the lowest incomes, would have to pay out-of-pocket before receiving 100% coverage. For example, under the previous coverage levels, a family earning $11,250 net a year was required to spend $200 on prescription drug co-payments before PharmaCare would cover the full cost of eligible prescription drugs.”Ministry of Health data show a link between low-income levels, deductibles and decreased drug spending, indicating that families will forgo filling prescriptions due to the cost of deductibles and co-payments. They will opt for other essentials, such as housing and groceries.“A dollar only stretches so far, and no one understands this more than people living on low incomes,” said Gudrun Langolf, president, Council of Seniors Citizens’ Organizations of B.C. “Choosing between food or prescriptions is a reality many seniors faced, and I applaud the B.C. government for taking the long-awaited action to provide relief and make it easier for people to get the prescriptions they need.”The provincial government has also made life more affordable for British Columbians by eliminating Medical Service Plan premiums, saving individuals up to $900 a year and families as much as $1,800 a year.“I have been a pharmacist for more than 12 years and can tell you medication affordability is always among the top concerns that patients have,” Keith Shaw, president, BC Pharmacy Association and pharmacy district manager at Sobeys, which operates Safeway. “I want to thank B.C.’s pharmacists for their important role in ensuring the introduction of Fair PharmaCare was as seamless as possible for our patients. Providing accessible, affordable health care for British Columbians is something that B.C.’s pharmacists are proud to support.”This plan for enhanced coverage for essential medicines for lower-income British Columbians involved collaboration with the BC Green Party caucus, and is a foundational step toward the Confidence and Supply Agreement commitment to address prescription drug costs.Learn More:To learn more and register with Fair PharmaCare, visit: www.gov.bc.ca/fairpharmacareTo learn more about the change, visit:

Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing, has released the following statement regarding BC Assessment’s release of the 2020 property assessments:“As the 2020 property assessments are released, people living in the regions hardest hit by sky-high property-value increases are seeing a moderating trend in housing prices. For the second year in a row, we see only modest changes in the value of both single-family and strata homes in most regions, particularly in the Lower Mainland and on Vancouver Island.“This is a positive sign that our government’s efforts to make housing more affordable for more British Columbians are having a real impact. For too long, the previous government sat back and watched housing prices climb well out of the reach of average people. Younger generations were shut out of the market and many abandoned hope to ever own a home or felt forced to leave the province to start a family.“We are encouraged by signs that property values are continuing to stabilize, giving more certainty for those investing in multi-family buildings, more stability for current homeowners and improved opportunity for those entering the market.“As we move into the next decade, we will continue our work to stabilize the market and support investment in new housing supply, while we ensure that more families and businesses are able to be part of our economic success.”
