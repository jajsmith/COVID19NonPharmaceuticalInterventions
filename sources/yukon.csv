COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, September 30, at 2 p.m., the COVID-19 case count for Yukon is 15. Everyone has recovered. We have tested 3,402 people. COVID-19 Testing Centre From Tuesday, September 22, to Monday, September 28, we tested 157 people at the COVID-19 Testing Centre (CTC) in Whitehorse. The Respiratory Assessment Centre has been renamed the COVID-19 Testing Centre. Hours of operation are 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Sunday.  Referrals are no longer required for a COVID-19 test at the CTC. Road border schedule change for on-site personnel On-site road border personnel are transitioning from the current 24-hours a day schedule to 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the Alaska Highway and Junction 37 borders beginning October 1. Travellers arriving outside of these hours will be required to sign a declaration and submit their self-isolation plan, along with a contact number when they arrive from outside of BC, the NWT or Nunavut. There will be on-site kiosks for completing the self-declaration, which is required by law.  The COVID-19 information station on the Alaska Highway in Whitehorse will also be closing as of 6 p.m. today. These changes reflect reduced road traffic as the winter season approaches. Process for public notifications regarding active cases Once Yukon Communicable Disease Control (YCDC) receives notification of a positive result of COVID-19 they then begin the process of contract tracing. This process involves speaking with the patient, family and close contacts to determine the level of risk of exposure.  Yukon Communicable Disease only contacts people who are identified as contacts. Public notifications are only issued when YCDC is not able to identify everyone who may have come into contact with an infected person. Guidance for Halloween and Thanksgiving The Chief Medical Officer of Health is encouraging Halloween to take place. Children should wear a non-medical mask or face covering, or consider a Halloween themed cloth mask; they should trick or treat in their consistent social bubble; not gather on doorsteps, and use a prop like a broom or a sword to ring doorbells. Those who are distributing candy should use a tool to offer treats, such as tongs or a hockey stick. Only distribute wrapped store bought candy. Please do not leave treats in a communal bucket. More information will be available on Yukon.ca. Singing and music performances We know there's risk associated with these activities and we have tools to manage that risk.  Keep a minimum of two metres between singers and musicians at all times. Face forward while singing or playing instruments (not in a circle or facing each other). Conductors should maintain four metres from the choir or orchestra or wear a face shield and maintain two metres’ distance. Performers should maintain four metres from the audience or be separated by plexiglas or similar barrier. Rehearsals are recommended to be 30 minutes or less. Ensure good ventilation where you are practising, space out in the room you are playing or singing in, open the window, practise outside if you can Regular cleaning of instruments, mouthpieces, music stands, drum sticks and other accessories is essential. Do not share cleaning cloths, instrument brushes or microphones.  Read the singing and music guidelines.   New charges under the Civil Emergency Measures Act Below is a summary of the charges laid on September 29.

Between now and the end of 2020, Yukon coaches who take NCCP multi-sport introduction or development courses online can have their registration fees reimbursed. These courses cover topics related to all sports and include such topics as coaching in secondary schools, designing a basic sport program and making ethical decisions. Coaches can register for these courses through the NCCP. Once they have completed a course, they can submit their receipt to the Sport and Recreation branch for reimbursement.            From a new skater’s first steps onto the ice, to a gymnast safely sticking their first round-off, to a high performance skier standing atop the podium, Yukon coaches play a critical role in the development of our territorial athletes. Coaches help build community, teach confidence and respectful behaviours. Coaches promote fairplay, diversity, inclusion and the value of staying active for life. Our government is pleased to support Yukon coaches to develop their skills so they can keep contributing to our vibrant sporting community.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            This is a terrific initiative to hopefully increase the numbers of coaches and the knowledge base of our coaches in Yukon.  This provides for a greater variety of courses to choose from and the online platform allows for the all the participants to make connections with a number of different coaches from all across Canada in a variety of different sports.

3,2020-09-30,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/new-water-reservoir-faro,Government Website,New water reservoir for Faro ,"           Published 30/09/2020         Construction of a new water reservoir in Faro is now complete. With a capacity of 625 cubic metres, the new reservoir replaces an old reservoir constructed in 1971 that was nearing the end of its useful life. Water storage facilities like reservoirs are essential to keep a town like Faro supplied with clean drinking water. The reservoir buffers community water supply during peak demands, provides redundancy to other reservoirs while they are offline for maintenance, provides additional chlorine contact time for disinfection and provides water for local firefighting purposes. The final project costs are anticipated to be $1.94 million, with the Government of Canada contributing $1.13 million under the Investing Canada Infrastructure Plan, and the Government of Yukon funding the balance. Construction of the new reservoir was publicly tendered and awarded to Wildstone Construction.            The new water reservoir is a key piece of infrastructure that provides Faro residents with clean drinking water as well as resources to fight fires. Our government is proud to be upgrading core municipal infrastructure that supports healthy, thriving communities.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            On behalf of Council, I would like to thank and acknowledge the efforts of our federal and territorial partners for their continuous support as we work to develop our community. I would also like to specifically recognize the hard work of so many within the Department of Community Services, Community Development Branch and the Town of Faro. The water reservoir project is another example of our commitment to working collaboratively and despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, we persevered with relatively minor disruptions to the community. We look forward to strengthening our collaboration as we work to deliver several planned major projects in the near future.      Town of Faro Mayor Leonard Faber             Quick facts       Water reservoirs are storage facilities for a community’s water supply.  Construction of the Faro reservoir began in spring 2020.  The water reservoir is an above-ground, glass-fused to steel tank with insulation and cladding.  It is one of three water reservoirs in Faro and is located behind Faro’s public administration building.

The vision of the Aging in Place Action Plan is to ensure that Yukoners can access the supports needed to live safe, independent, and comfortable lives in their own home or community for as long as possible, regardless of age, income or ability level. In total, it recommends 56 specific actions to help achieve that vision. The action plan was developed based on extensive public engagement in 2018 and 2019 with seniors and Elders, governments, NGOs and community organizations. In total, more than 1,200 Yukoners participated in the engagement. The Aging in Place Action Plan complements Putting People First, the final report of the comprehensive review of Yukon’s health and social services. About a third of the recommendations in Putting People First are relevant to the Aging in Place Action Plan. To help Yukoners live healthy lives, the Government of Yukon has begun the work of implementing the recommendations and actions in the Aging in Place Action Plan and Putting People First, in addition to pursuing the goals and objectives identified in the Housing Action Plan for Yukon and the Safe at Home Plan to end and prevent homelessness.            We all have a role to play in helping Yukoners age in place. This plan provides a framework by which governments, First Nations, NGOs, the private sector, individuals, families and communities can work together to ensure that Yukoners can live full and meaningful lives as they age. Our government is committed to helping Yukon’s aging population live safe, independent, and comfortable lives surrounded by strong and supportive communities.      Minister of Health and Social Services and Minister responsible for the Yukon Housing Corporation Pauline Frost            Quick facts       The action plan outlines four pillars for action: living a full and meaningful life; housing; transportation; and programs, services and infrastructure.  Some of the recommended actions in the plan are already underway or will be actioned immediately. Others are future steps that will require ongoing collaboration and partnership between the Government of Yukon and key community stakeholders.  It’s projected that Yukon’s senior population will more than double in the next 20 years.

5,2020-09-29,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/government-yukon-announces-funding-shingles-vaccine,Government Website,Government of Yukon announces funding for shingles vaccine,"           Published 29/09/2020        To support Yukoners’ long-term wellbeing and quality of life, the Government of Yukon is publicly funding a shingles vaccine for Yukoners between the ages of 65 and 70, the age at which the vaccine is most effective. Shingles is a viral infection that causes a painful rash, caused by the same virus as chickenpox. After someone has had chickenpox, the virus lies inactive in nerve tissue. Years later, the virus may reactivate as shingles. The shingles vaccine, Shingrix, will be publicly funded in Yukon beginning January 1, 2021.              Shingles can be very painful and disproportionately affects older adults. Vaccines are an important preventative tool that can help keep people healthy and reduce the need for primary, acute or urgent care. Funding this effective vaccine will help Yukoners age well and live healthy lives, and will have a positive impact on our territory’s health system.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Quick facts       Funding the shingles vaccine is in line with a recommendation in the Putting People First report, as well as feedback received as part of the Aging in Place public engagement.  There is an increased risk of shingles for older adults. While it is not a life-threatening condition, shingles can be very painful.  Vaccines can help reduce the risk of shingles. Shingrix is a two-dose, non-live vaccine that has been shown to be 90 per cent effective in preventing shingles.  Starting January 1, 2021, the shingles vaccine will be available free of charge at local pharmacies and by appointment at Community Health Centres. It is currently available at your pharmacy, for a fee, with a prescription from your physician.

2,2020-09-28,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/hiring-preference-initiative-starting-october-1,Government Website,Hiring preference initiative starting on October 1,"           Published 28/09/2020         An 18-month hiring preference pilot project for all Government of Yukon competitions will start on October 1. Competitions will continue to be open to all candidates. Hiring preference will be given to qualified candidates who self-identify as Yukon First Nation or Canadian Aboriginal ancestry. The pilot project is an initiative under Breaking Trail Together, a Government of Yukon plan to increase representation of First Nation employees in the public service. The plan was developed in collaboration with Yukon First Nations governments and addresses the Government of Yukon’s legal obligation under the Final Agreements to develop and implement a Representative Public Service Plan. The hiring preference is a two-tiered system. It gives qualified candidates:  first priority if they are of Yukon First Nation ancestry; and second priority if they are of Canadian Aboriginal ancestry.  The hiring preference is applied at the end of the competition. This occurs once all assessments are complete. Regardless of ancestry, successful candidates must posses all essential qualifications, knowledge, skills and suitability required to perform the job.            Our public service should reflect the population that we serve. This ensures the programs and services that we deliver are inclusive and meet the needs of all Yukoners. The preferential hiring pilot project allows us to test this approach to increasing representation of Aboriginal people within the Government of Yukon and advance reconciliation efforts with Yukon First Nations.      Minister of Public Service Commission Richard Mostyn            Ensuring Yukon First Nations are proportionally represented in the public service – Yukon’s largest employer – is an obligation of the Final Agreements. This pilot project supports preferential hiring and the increase of Yukon First Nations in the Yukon government workforce.      Council of Yukon First Nations Grand Chief Peter Johnston            Quick facts       Yukon’s Aboriginal population is 23 per cent based on 2016 federal census data.  Government of Yukon employees who self-identify as Aboriginal is 15 per cent while Aboriginal people of working age, 20 to 64 years old, in Yukon is 22 per cent.  Preference hiring will help the Government of Yukon meet its employment equity objectives as well as Final Agreement obligations.  The goal is to increase the representation of Aboriginal people within the public service across a broad spectrum of occupations and pay levels.  The Government of Yukon remains the single largest employer in Yukon with more than 5,000 employees as of March 31, 2018.

The Government of Yukon’s Land Development Branch managed the initial stages of the project with a custom-built Design Collaboration Agreement with the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations. 	The Champagne and Aishihik First Nations is completing the project through a Transfer Payment Agreement with the Government of Yukon. As well, the CAFN and the Village of Haines Junction have updated the water and sewer agreement to include service for the new lots and lift station in the Marshall Creek subdivision expansion. This will bring the regional system together while the new agreement provides an equal fee structure for equal service between the municipality and CAFN lots.            The Government of Canada will continue working to ensure a safe and sustainable economic recovery, while focusing on the health and well-being of all Yukoners. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, this infrastructure project in Haines Junction and Champagne and Aishihik First Nations is essential. It not only helps to ensure the speedy recovery of our economy and provide needed jobs, it also helps to protect the well-being of our communities, and our environment, now and into the future.      Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell on behalf of Minister of Infrastructure and Communities Catherine McKenna            We are very pleased to partner with the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations on the expansion of municipal services to the Marshall Creek subdivision.

This area is important to Carcross/Tagish First Nation people, local residents, recreational users and visitors of the Tagish River. This draft recommended management plan aims to protect the Tagish River for future generations and to provide a path forward for sustainable use of this culturally and ecologically important area. Finalizing the Tagish River Habitat Protection Area recommended management plan will meet an important milestone in implementation of the Carcross/Tagish First Nation Final Agreement, and balance important ecological conservation, valued recreational use, and protection of cultural vales.  Public meetings will be held in October 2020.            It is exciting to see this management plan moving towards completion. I encourage all users of the Tagish River area to come to the public meetings to learn about the recommended management plan and provide feedback on how to protect this culturally and ecologically significant area.      Minister of Environment Pauline Frost            Carcross/Tagish First Nation is encouraged that through this recommended management plan people will be able to re-establish their relationship and connection to the land and water that makes up the Tagish River Habitat Protection Area.

20,2020-09-17,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/expanded-rebates-renewable-home-heating-now-available,Government Website,Expanded rebates for renewable home heating now available,"           Published 17/09/2020        Good Energy rebates for heat pumps, an efficient renewable heating system for homes, are now available. Heat pumps extract heat from the outside air or ground and push it into a building. This process allows a heat pump to significantly reduce energy use for heating. Cold climate heat pumps are able to extract heat from even very cold air and are proven to be more efficient than traditional heating systems down to -25°C. Homeowners can receive rebates covering 40 per cent of project costs, up to a maximum of $8,000 for a new air or ground source heat pump. In addition to the expanded rebate, the Government of Yukon is seeking participants for a heat pump pilot project. In partnership with Yukon’s electrical utilities, the project will support the installation of 25 heat pumps for both commercial and residential buildings that already have certain heating systems installed. The pilot project seeks to understand how this technology and existing heating systems interact to optimize performance for homes and electrical grid. The Government of Yukon will cover installation costs of up to 40 per cent up to a maximum of $10,000. The expanded rebate program and new pilot project are commitments under Our Clean Future: A Yukon strategy for climate change, energy and a green economy.            Heating is the second largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Yukon. As part of our government’s actions to address climate change, guided by the Our Clean Future strategy, we are excited to provide additional incentives to encourage Yukoners to adopt a highly efficient and cost effective heating technology. Heat pump technology will not only reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, but also save homeowners and businesses money.      Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources Ranj Pillai            Quick facts       Heat pumps are powered by electricity and use significantly less energy to heat the same space as electric baseboard heaters.  Heat pumps are a proven technology that work in Yukon’s cold climate.  Heat pumps are often paired with electric or conventional back-up heating systems that provide supplemental heating on the coldest days.  Home or business owners who wish to participate in the pilot project can contact the Energy Branch to find out if their home or business is the right fit for the project.  Monitoring from the pilot project will provide additional information and options for the electrical utilities to more efficiently manage peak demand and help address the growing demand and impacts from electric heating in homes.

The extension will provide more time and opportunities to safely connect and gather perspectives on these programs and services. Engagement opportunities with families, educators, school communities, partners and Yukon First Nations originally planned for April and May 2020 are being rescheduled for this fall. The extended engagement opportunities include: An online tool to gather perspectives and experiences from students, families, partners, school communities, staff and the public. Focus groups led by the review consultant with: 		Educators, including Learning Assistance Teachers, School Counsellors, Educational Assistants, etc.; Yukon First Nations; School Councils; and The Advisory Committee for Yukon Education and other professionals who work with children and youth with diverse needs.  An interim update on the review is now available, with the information gathered to date by the consultant about Yukon’s current service model for these programs, along with questions and resources to consider as the review moves forward. The consultant’s final report for this review and a summary of what was heard through the engagement activities will be shared by the end of March 2021. Along with the recommendations from the 2019 audit report, this report will be used to frame collaboration with Yukon First Nations and education partners to respond to the feedback and findings from this review and together develop next steps and actions to improve and modernize these programs to more effectively support student learning needs and outcomes.            The Government of Yukon remains committed to working with families and communities to ensure all students have the learning supports they need. We look forward to hearing the perspectives and experiences of students, families, partners, school communities, Yukon First Nations and staff so that we can improve inclusive and special education in our territory.      Minister of Education, Tracy-Anne McPhee             I appreciate how open people have been in sharing their thoughts about inclusive and special education. Even at these early stages, I can see that there are some incredible strengths here in the Yukon that can serve as a springboard to address the challenges that have been identified. It’s unfortunate the work had to be put on hold due to the pandemic, but it has provided a good opportunity to reflect on the process and on the discussions that have happened so far. I hope this interim update can inspire people to start thinking about their own stories with inclusive and special education, and the kinds of changes they’d like to see. I look forward to connecting with people to hear those stories and ideas once the review starts back up again.      Nikki Yee, independent review consultant             Quick facts       This review responds to Recommendation 70 in the Auditor General of Canada’s 2019 report, Kindergarten Through Grade 12 Education in Yukon.   The purpose of this review is to identify barriers and opportunities in the current service model and questions and resources to consider, by hearing from families, educators, and communities about their experiences with current programming and by learning about what other jurisdictions are doing.  The review began in February 2020, starting with the Department of Education’s current practices, procedures and legislated responsibilities, and initial meetings with central staff and school administrators.  The interim update from the consultant includes information and research gathered so far. This update will be referenced in the online tool and focus groups sessions that are being rescheduled.            Contact   Janine Workman 	Cabinet Communications 	867-332-0480janine.workman@gov.yk.ca Kyle Nightingale 	Communications, Education 	867-336-0653kyle.nightingale@gov.yk.ca   Nikki Yee 	Independent review consultant  	778-846-5049     News release #:   20-259    Related information:   Review of Inclusive and Special Education Interim Update Auditor General of Canada report  Learn about the Advisory Committee for Yukon Education        "

COVID-19 cases and recoveries 	As of today, September 16, at 2 p.m., the COVID-19 case count for Yukon is 15. Everyone has recovered. We have tested 3,020 people. Respiratory Assessment Centre 	From Wednesday, September 9, to Tuesday, September 16, we tested 129 people at the Respiratory Assessment Centre in Whitehorse. Symptom criteria for staying home from schools and daycares  	We have developed guidance based on three colour zones to help parents and guardians know when to keep children home from school or daycare. “Green” means the child is well, has no symptoms and can attend school. This green zone includes situations where they have symptoms consistent with a previously diagnosed health condition and which are not unusual for that child. “Yellow” means the child has symptoms such as a runny nose, a headache or fatigue. The yellow zone means the child should stay at home for 24 hours and see whether the symptoms progress or resolve.   If a child has a runny nose or nasal congestion that persists beyond 24 hours but it’s mild and doesn’t progress and the child is otherwise well, then the child may go back to school or daycare. Yellow symptoms are: Headache Runny nose or congestion Sore throat Fatigue or just unwell, or unable to participate in usual activities Major or intense fatigue Generalized muscle pain (not related to physical exertion) Significant loss of appetite Vomiting or diarrhea If a child only has vomiting or diarrhea, they can return to school when they have no further symptoms for at least 24 hours. “Red” means the child has a new cough, fever or difficulty breathing. In these situations, we recommend that they’re tested for COVID-19 and are assessed by a health care provider as needed. We especially recommend testing if a child has more than one of the following “red” symptoms: Cough Fever Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing Loss of taste or smell If a child isn’t tested, they must remain in self-isolation until their symptoms resolve and for at least 10 days from when they started having symptoms. Six new charges under the Civil Emergency Measures Act 	Six new charges were laid under the Civil Emergency Measures Act on September 11 and September 15. Two charges were laid on September 11: failure to self-isolate; and failure to transit through Yukon. Four charges were laid on Sept 15: two failures to self-isolate; and two failures to behave in a manner consistent with the declaration. We will not provide information that may identify anyone, such as their name or where they received the charge. Reminder about isolation requirements 	Travellers who are required to self-isolate must complete their entire 14-day isolation when they arrive back in Yukon. This includes people who spent time in BC, the NWT or Nunavut after they travelled from other regions of Canada or internationally. The entire 14-day isolation must happen after people arrive in Yukon. People must also be reachable at the phone number and address they’ve provided on their declaration form throughout their period of self-isolation. They may receive a spot check call from the Government of Yukon. These spot check calls are separate from the Public Health Agency of Canada checks that are for people who have been outside the country. Enforcement statistics 	The Government of Yukon has received 795 complaints: Failure to self-isolate: 441 Social gatherings over 10 inside or 50 outside: 23 Failure to transit through Yukon in 24 hours or stay on the designated route: 308 Businesses failing to comply with Orders: 8 Failure to abide by a declaration form or not permitted entry into Yukon: 13 Other: 2 There have been 12 charges in total laid under the Civil Emergency Measures Act (CEMA).

Glucose monitors can help individuals living with type 1 diabetes to better monitor their glucose levels. Yukon is the first jurisdiction in Canada to provide coverage for continuous glucose monitors to individuals 18 years of age and younger, and joins Ontario and Quebec in providing coverage for flash glucose monitors. If adults prefer to use a continuous glucose monitor, they can apply their flash glucose monitor coverage to the cost of a continuous glucose monitor. Adults with additional medical needs, for example dementia, can apply for full coverage of a continuous glucose monitor device. Adult Yukoners are encouraged to work with their health care professional to determine the most appropriate support to manage their diabetes.            We recognize the challenges Yukoners and families who live with type 1 diabetes face on a daily basis and we are committed to supporting them to live happy, healthy lives. This coverage will help adults living with type 1 diabetes in Yukon manage their condition and improve their quality of life.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Diabetes Canada commends the Yukon government for adding coverage of flash glucose monitoring for adults with type 1 diabetes to its existing coverage of continuous glucose monitors for children with type 1. These devices are health-protecting and potentially life-saving for many people with diabetes. It is critically important that people with diabetes, in consultation with their health care providers, be able to access the glucose monitoring system that best meets their needs. Diabetes Canada acknowledges the dedication of community volunteers who have been advocating for this important policy and encourages other provinces and territories to follow suit and cover these life-changing devices.      President and CEO of Diabetes Canada Laura Syron            Quick facts       Physicians will apply for coverage on behalf of their patients.  It is estimated that up to approximately 250 people in Yukon have type 1 diabetes.  To be eligible for the benefit, Yukoners with type 1 diabetes who meet the benefit criteria must register with the Chronic Disease and Disability Benefit program at 867-667-5092. People aged 65 or older can contact the Pharmacare program at 867-667-5403.  A flash glucose monitors does not require a finger prick to monitor glucose levels, rather, a small sensor is inserted just under the skin of the upper arm, and when scanned every eight hours, it provides a current glucose reading and a continuous trend graph to a reader’s device.

Premier Sandy Silver            Our Clean Future is an ambitious, Yukon-wide strategy to address our changing climate in a sustainable way. The strategy outlines tangible actions we will take to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impacts over the next decade. All Yukoners have a stake in this strategy and together we can ensure our territory takes action to preserve our environment for future generations.      Minister of Environment Pauline Frost            While addressing climate change is challenging, it also presents new opportunities for innovation and economic growth. Investing in building retrofits, encouraging Yukoners to purchase clean technologies like zero emission vehicles and supporting the renewable energy projects needed to power our future will support meaningful jobs in a forward-looking, green economy. Our Clean Future lays out how we can be part of the solution when it comes to climate change while building a bright future for Yukoners.      Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources and Economic Development Ranj Pillai            Quick facts       The Government of Yukon collaborated with Yukon First Nations, transboundary Indigenous groups and Yukon municipalities to establish Our Clean Future’s priorities. The final strategy reflects input from Yukoners, non-governmental and community organizations, industry and private businesses, First Nations and municipal governments gathered during two rounds of public engagement in 2018 and 2019.  Actions from eight Indigenous and municipal partners are showcased in Our Clean Future, highlighting continued community leadership on climate change.

26,2020-09-10,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/coming-together-caribou,Government Website,Coming together for caribou,"           Published 10/09/2020        Partners to the Canadian Porcupine Caribou Management Agreement gathered on September 3, 2020, to respond to the Record of Decision on oil and gas leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and reaffirm our commitment to conserving the Porcupine caribou herd and its habitat. Together, the parties released this statement: “We do not believe the selected alternative in the Record of Decision is sustainable for Porcupine caribou. We remain committed to co-operatively managing the herd and its habitat within Canada to ensure the conservation of the herd, in particular for providing for ongoing cultural and subsistence needs.”            The Government of Yukon and our partners have consistently identified and demonstrated that development in the refuge has high risks of significant negative impacts to wildlife populations, particularly the Porcupine caribou herd. The Government of Yukon will continue to stand in solidarity with the Gwich’in People, advocating for the protection of the Porcupine caribou herd’s sacred and sensitive calving grounds on the Alaskan coastal plain.      Government of Yukon Minister of Environment Pauline Frost            The Gwich’in have lived in balance with the Porcupine Caribou herd since before any mark of modern history and, as expected, officials in the U.S. administration tasked with advancing destruction of the herd’s nursery recognized that it was in their best interest to discard that. The Record of Decision validates our experience of the erosion of integrity in assessments, process and respect: our Traditional Knowledge disrespected, our requests for consultation ignored, and our concerns disregarded. In finalizing the Oil and Gas leasing alternative, the U.S. administration violated our inherent and human rights, and the rights of all of the Indigenous users of the herd in Canada. But our rights cannot be discarded nor our voices silenced.      Chief Dana Tizya-Tramm​, Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation            Porcupine Caribou are invaluable to the culture and subsistence of Indigenous Peoples and northerners. Maintaining the long-term success of the herd is critical to maintaining Indigenous people’s culture and right to traditional harvest. Our partnership approach to conserving Porcupine Caribou is our key strength for addressing our shared concerns with proposed development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I will continue to support our partners in their efforts while working with my cabinet colleagues on this important issue.      Minister of Environment and Climate Change Canada Jonathan Wilkinson            The Porcupine caribou herd has sustained Gwich'in and Inuvialuit people for thousands of years. While many other communities in the Northwest Territories suffer the hardships of declining caribou, the Porcupine remains one of the last great healthy migratory herds in the world. While the Government of the Northwest Territories supports a balanced approach to caribou conservation and economic development, our government is deeply concerned about the recent decision of the U.S. administration to open up all Porcupine caribou calving and post-calving lands to oil and gas development. The GNWT remains committed to working with our co-management partners to support the wise management of the Porcupine herd.      Government of the Northwest Territories Minister of Environment and Natural Resources Shane Thompson            The Gwich’in Tribal Council remains committed to protecting the sacred grounds of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska. We stand united with our allies against the irresponsible Record of Decision issued by the Trump Administration. The Porcupine Caribou are essential to the survival of both our people and our culture. We will not rest until the calving grounds of the Porcupine Caribou on the sacred Coastal Plain is permanently protected for future generations.      Gwich’in Tribal Council Grand Chief Ken Smith            The Inuvialuit have depended on the Porcupine Caribou for hundreds of years for food, cultural and social well-being. The important role of this caribou herd is reflected in the protections and conservation measures provided under the Inuvialuit Final Agreement. These include provisions for the implementation of the Porcupine Caribou Management Agreement (PCMA), the establishment of Ivvavik National Park and the conservation measures for the Yukon North Slope as means to cooperatively manage the herd and protect the Porcupine Caribou calving grounds and habitat that lay within the Inuvialuit Settlement Region.  The Inuvialuit Game Council is not against development but feels there needs to be a balance struck between economic gain and indigenous cultural and social well-being. The Council is troubled by regulatory decisions that do not take into account the potentially negative impacts that opening ANWR to oil and gas development may have on this herd, the habitat it relies on and the many indigenous groups that depend on it for their traditional practices. The Inuvialuit Game Council continues to work with the other Parties to ensure the persistence of this herd for future generations.      A/Chair for the Inuvialuit Game Council Jim Elias            The Porcupine caribou herd is an important part of the northern way of life and a valuable traditional food source for so many. It is through the respectful harvest of this herd that we express our First Nations culture and our subsistence rights. We stand with our partners in protecting ANWR against any activity that erodes the viability of the Porcupine caribou herd. Protecting ANWR, protecting the herd, and protecting our culture are one in the same.       ​Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in Chief Roberta Joseph           Contact   Government of Yukon Janine Workman 	Cabinet Communications 	867-332-0480Janine.workman@gov.yk.ca Vuntut Gwitchin Government Elizabeth Staples 	Caribou Coordinator 	778-668-0811estaples@vgfn.net Government of Canada Moira Kelly 	Press Secretary 	Office of the Minister of Environment and Climate Change 	819-271-6218moira.kelly@canada.ca Media Relations 	Environment and Climate Change Canada 	819-938-3338 or 1-844-836-7799 (toll-free)ec.media.ec@canada.ca Government of the Northwest Territories  Joslyn Oosenbrug 	Public Affairs and Communications 	Department of Environment and Natural ResourcesENR_Communications@gov.nt.ca Gwich’in Tribal Council  Amber Keegan 	Policy, Negotiations, and Communications Specialist 	867-777-7923Amber.Keegan@gwichintribal.ca Joint Secretariat on behalf of the Inuvialuit Game Council  Jennifer Lam 	Committee Program Managercpmanager@jointsec.nt.ca Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in Government Elaine Corden 	Communications Coordinator 	(867) 993-7100 ext. 136elaine.corden@trondek.ca     News release #:   20-254    Related information:   Porcupine Caribou Management Board        "

The Government of Yukon is extending the state of emergency under the Civil Emergency Measures Act (CEMA). The extension will allow the Ministerial Orders issued under CEMA to remain in place to continue to support and protect Yukoners, including the Health Protection Order. Ministerial Orders issued under CEMA include a range of measures, such as health protections setting requirements for entry to Yukon, and mandatory self-isolation when applicable, along with other orders that extend benefits and protections related to economic impacts, such as landlord and tenant protections. The state of emergency and accompanying orders enable the government to adapt and respond rapidly to the pandemic and to keep pace with developments across Canada, with the aim to minimize risk and help Yukoners to manage through uncertainty. The Government of Yukon regularly evaluates the need for the state of emergency and Ministerial Orders issued under CEMA and may repeal any that are no longer necessary to the current pandemic situation. As of September 9, the following Ministerial Orders have been repealed: Self-Isolation Exception for Traditional Activities; Property Tax Relief; Remote Cannabis Sales; Virtual Commissioning, Signing and Witnessing; and the Amendment of Government Contract Provisions. The Driver Medical Order, which temporarily exempted drivers who are 70 years of age or from having to submit a medical examination certificate, if required, will expire in 90 days. All Yukoners can continue do their part in ensuring the health and safety of their family members, neighbours and communities by practising the Safe 6.            We know that Yukoners are concerned about the continued possibility of importing COVID-19 to the territory. As a territory we have done well because we have worked together to protect the Yukon and guard against this pandemic. Nothing is more important than protecting the health and wellbeing of all Yukoners. Extending the state of emergency does not mean there is an increased risk to Yukoners at this time. The purpose of the extension is to ensure our government can continue to react quickly and to respond to the needs of Yukoners during COVID-19.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            Quick facts       A full list of the orders and legislative changes made under the Civil Emergency Measures Act can be found on Yukon.ca/changes-legislation-covid-19.  Violations of the orders under the Civil Emergency Measures Act are an offence and are punishable by a fine or imprisonment.  While we wait for an effective treatment or vaccine, public health measures will remain in place to limit the risk of infection in Yukon.  The six steps to staying safe are: physical distancing; regular hand washing; staying home when sick; not gathering in groups of more than 10 people indoors, or 50 outdoors, and keeping two metres apart; limiting travel to communities and self-isolating when required.  From Wednesday, September 2, to Tuesday, September 8, 163 people were tested for COVID-19 at the Respiratory Assessment Centre in Whitehorse.

Born in Old Crow and raised mostly in the Bluefish River area, Mr. Frost lived a full and meaningful life. His strong beliefs that the land and animals must be protected for future generations will have a profound and long lasting impact in the community and across the north. His outgoing nature and love for storytelling will be missed deeply.  Mr. Frost’s dedication to his work at the community health centre, maintaining the local airstrip and his passion in the fight against climate change, are only some examples of his endless commitment to ensuring the health and safety of the Gwitchin people, land and wildlife. He generously shared his knowledge with so many. His contributions to his family, community this territory and the Gwitchin people will continue to be felt for many generations. We have lost a legend and our thoughts are with Elder Frost’s family and his entire community.

The regulation will help to foster a positive culture in the workplace as well as physical and psychological safety for Yukon workers. The Violence and Harassment Prevention Regulation will come into effect on September 4, 2021, giving employers a full year for implementation. During that time the Yukon Workers’ Compensation Health and Safety Board will be offering support, particularly to employers with small businesses, with a how-to guide, ready-to-use tools and training resources. In addition to the introduction of the new regulation, the Government of Yukon has made enhancements to the existing regulations about hazard assessment to make them clearer and easier to understand.            Everyone benefits in workplaces where the culture is positive and collaborative, and where there is trust, respect, teamwork and openness. Violence and harassment are not acceptable in any workplace. By focusing on their prevention, these regulations will make a significant contribution to creating the positive and healthy workplaces we all deserve.      Minister responsible for the Yukon Workers’ Compensation Health and Safety Board Jeanie Dendys            Every workplace has hazards. Identifying them and managing the risks they pose is the foundation of workplace health and safety. The Violence and Harassment Prevention Regulation highlights these two hazards and identifies actions that will help to control and mitigate their occurrence.      President and CEO, Yukon Workers’ Compensation Health and Safety Board, Kurt Dieckmann            Quick facts       In a public engagement in 2017, almost 70 per cent of survey respondents said they support amendments to the Occupational Health and Safety Act to allow for the development of regulations aimed at preventing mental injuries at work.  In 2019, the Yukon Workers’ Compensation Health and Safety Board hosted a public engagement to ask Yukon employers, workers and stakeholders for their input. It included stakeholder and public meetings, an online survey and written submissions.  The public engagement was summarized in a What We Heard report. It noted that Yukon employers, workers and stakeholders support regulation as a way to help prevent workplace violence and harassment and for clarification about the requirements for workplace hazard assessments.

This change, effective immediately, will support quality and efficient care by aligning what Yukon optometrists practice with the training Canadian optometrists currently receive in glaucoma management. Under the change, optometrists must still refer glaucoma patients to ophthalmologists when necessary, for example, in the care of complex cases or if a case is worsening. Expanding the scope of practice of optometrists means that Yukoners now have streamlined access to the care they need, an important step towards reducing red tape for Yukoners. This is yet another example of how modernizing and updating legislation and regulations can enhance the service Yukoners receive.            Our government is committed to improving the healthcare Yukoners can receive in the territory.

Updated bus routes will be posted on Yukon.ca by the end of the workday on Friday, September 4. Updated bus routes will take effect on Tuesday, September 8. Parents or guardians who have a child assigned to a school bus are advised to check the school bus routes over the long weekend to make sure they are up-to-date on the time of pick-up for their child for Tuesday morning. Families can check the updated routes at yukon.ca/en/school-bus-schedules. Bus routes need to be updated to accommodate a high volume of eligible students who were registered for the bus closer to the start of the school year. These registrations have now been processed and eligible students are being assigned a seat on the school bus, which is impacting existing bus routes. Changes to bus routes beyond pick-up times are not anticipated. Parents or guardians will be contacted directly if there are any changes beyond the pick-up time for their child.  Notification of assigned seat  Parents or guardians of eligible students who have now been assigned a seat on the school bus will be notified directly by e-mail of the student’s bus number. Students are only assigned a seat if their parents or guardians receive a direct notification. School bus passes  For the week of September 8, new students to the bus do not need their school bus pass to ride the bus. The school bus driver will have updated lists of students who have been assigned to their school bus. School bus passes will be provided to new students the following week by the student’s school. Students should use the bus stop closest to their home as shown in the updated school bus routes. Accommodating students beyond eligibility  Following this update, school buses are operating near capacity while following the health and safety guidelines and accommodating eligible students who have registered. Eligibility to ride the school bus is outlined in the Education Act and Student Transportation Regulations. Students are eligible to ride the school bus to their school and back home if: they live more than 3.2 kilometres from their school; and they are attending their attendance area school. As the school year continues, seats that become available to students beyond the eligibility requirements will be assigned based on the order of priority: Kindergarten to Grade 3 students; Grade 4 to 7 students who live within 3.2 kilometers of their attendance area school; students who attend school outside of their attendance area; and special requests, including busing to stops other than from home to school and back, such as daycare centres. Additional buses The Government of Yukon has requested an additional three school buses through its school bus provider. The Government of Yukon continues to work with the school bus provider on timing for adding these additional buses to the existing fleet and will provide updates when available.

But the COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than residents’ personal health, it is also having a profound impact on the economy. That is why governments have been taking decisive action to support families, businesses and communities, and continue to look ahead to see what more can be done. Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell, on behalf of Minister of Infrastructure and Communities Catherine McKenna, Minister of Community Services for the Government of Yukon John Streicker and Mayor of the City of Whitehorse Dan Curtis announced funding for a project that will help protect the city from the threat of wildfires. The Whitehorse South West Fire Risk Reduction project will create a six-kilometre fireguard along the southwest corner of the City of Whitehorse. All conifer plants will be removed within the identified 150-hectare area and support the Whitehorse West Landscape-level Fuel Management Plan. The removal of conifer plants also follows the standards for the reduction of fire hazards on Crown lands. The creation of a fireguard in this area is critical to protecting the City of Whitehorse and residential dwellings surrounding the city. This project will improve the safety for residents and create jobs. The Government of Canada is investing over $1.1 million in this project through the Investing in Canada plan through the Green Infrastructure Stream (GIS). The Government of Yukon is providing $487,500.            In Yukon, wildfires are a constant threat to communities and climate change may increase the potential for forest fires in the future. This important project will ensure that Whitehorse and surrounding residential areas are protected. This investment is helping to protect the health and safety of Yukoners.      Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell, on behalf of Minister of Infrastructure and Communities Catherine McKenna            A bold strategy for wildfire-resilient communities calls for visionary projects. I am excited to join my partners from the Government of Canada and the City of Whitehorse in announcing the start of this significant milestone. The forest fuels that are being removed during this project will offer a major opportunity to support Yukon’s emerging biomass sector, and the resulting fuel break will be an important natural capital asset that will reduce the risk of fire to the City of Whitehorse. Thanks to this and other pieces of our government’s new strategic vision for reducing wildfire hazards, we are making huge progress towards more wildfire resilient communities.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            The City of Whitehorse is committed to protecting its residents from the threat of wildfire. As part of this commitment, we performed extensive fuel abatement work along the Copper Haul Road this past winter. Fuel abatement is a key capital project for us and public safety is one of City Council’s Strategic Priorities. I would like to thank our partners for their continued support in keeping Whitehorse residents safe.      Mayor of the City of Whitehorse Dan Curtis            Quick facts       Through the Investing in Canada plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes, and Canada’s rural and northern communities.

International border reminder This section has been updated to clarify when Yukoners are required to self-solate.. Yukoners are reminded that if you choose to go past the Canadian border station at Fraser or Beaver Creek, you must be aware of the federal rules for re-entering Canada at the time of your departure. If you cross into Alaska, you will be subject to these federal rules, which include a mandatory 14-day quarantine. These rules are applied equally at all official border crossings (and points of international arrivals) across Canada, and you must follow the directions given to you by the CBSA and the Public Health Agency of Canada. The federal requirements are separate from our own territorial border measures. For example, as a Yukoner, you are required to self-isolate if you've travelled outside of Yukon, British Columbia, Northwest Territories or Nunavut. For more information: www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/services/covid/canadians-canadiens-eng.html yukon.ca/information-self-isolation Yukoners encouraged to remain vigilant  Although there are no confirmed active cases in the territory, Yukoners are encouraged to remain vigilant and continue following the Safe Six: Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or use hand sanitizer with at least 60 per cent alcohol.

Community Wellbeing Survey The territory-wide Community Wellbeing Survey is closing on September 6. The results of the survey will provide a territory-wide snapshot of Yukoners’ wellbeing and generate needed data to support informed decision making. The COVID-specific questions at the start of the survey will be used to inform next steps in the pandemic response. Visit yukon.ca for more information. International border reminder Yukoners are reminded that if you choose to go past the Canadian border station at Fraser or Beaver Creek, you must be aware of the federal rules for re-entering Canada at the time of your departure. If you cross into Alaska, you will be subject to these federal rules, which include a mandatory 14-day quarantine. These rules are applied equally at all official border crossings (and points of international arrivals) across Canada, and you must follow the directions given to you by the CBSA and the Public Health Agency of Canada. The federal requirements are separate from our own territorial border measures. For example, as a Yukoner, you are required to self-isolate if you've travelled outside of Yukon, British Columbia, NWT, or Nunavut in the 14 days before you re-enter the territory. For more information: www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/services/covid/canadians-canadiens-eng.html yukon.ca/information-self-isolation Yukoners encouraged to remain vigilant  Although there are no confirmed active cases in the territory, Yukoners are encouraged to remain vigilant and continue following the Safe Six: Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or use hand sanitizer with at least 60 per cent alcohol. Stay home if you're feeling sick. Remember to keep two metres (six feet) between yourself and people who are not in your social bubble.

Collins track and field complex is now complete,"           Published 01/09/2020        The new track and field complex at F.H. Collins Secondary School is now complete and opened to the public today. Minister of Community Services John Streicker, Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee, Member of Parliament Larry Bagnell, Whitehorse Mayor Dan Curtis and MLA Nils Clarke joined representatives from Athletics Yukon, the Yukon Soccer Association and F.H. Collins School to celebrate the opening of the facility.   The track and field complex is a public asset that offers a world-class recreation facility to schools and the broader athletic community and will create opportunities for residents, visitors and athletes for years to come. It provides recreation opportunities for all ages and groups, including seniors, children, and people with disabilities. Like all other school fields, the public can access the facility when it is not in use, or can make sport-specific bookings during the operational season by calling the Whitehorse Parks and Recreation Department at 867-633-8518. In order to keep the compound open and accessible to all, we are asking all users to take care of the track and artificial turf field by taking the following measures: Wear clean footwear without metal or screw-in cleats on the track and artificial turf field. Keep dogs and other animals off the facility, except service animals. Do not bring any food or beverages other than water into the facility. Non-motorized wheelchairs and strollers permitted only.            Our government is so proud to support this great new facility! I am incredibly honored to be here for the grand opening and welcome the community. Whether it’s Under 6 soccer, hosting meets, extending our seasons or training for games, this new track and field will serve Yukoners for years to come.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            I’m very pleased to see the new track and field complex open. This new facility enhances F.H. Collins Secondary school, and will expand and enhance sport opportunities for school and athletic communities across Whitehorse and Yukon, while supporting the health and wellness of Yukoners.      Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee            Strategic investments in recreational infrastructure play a key role in making sure communities stay active and healthy. Not only do these facilities benefit the students and athletes of Whitehorse, but the completion of this track and this field come at a very welcome time, during COVID isolation, and will go a great distance in contributing to our community’s overall physical and mental health.      Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell            This new track and field complex is a much welcomed addition to our community and to F.H. Collins, which happens to be the school I graduated from many years ago. I am excited for this facility to be around for many generations to come and I commend the Government of Canada, as well as the Government of Yukon for making this happen.      Mayor of Whitehorse Dan Curtis            Yukon Soccer appreciates the community effort put forth to complete the track and turf at F.H. Collins Secondary School. We are honored to have access to the facility for soccer games. Let’s all do our part to help each other follow the rules and keep the track and turf clean. Thanks.      Yukon Soccer Association president Fabien Glyka            Athletics Yukon is thrilled to be a part of the first rubberized Track and Field facility North of 60, in Canada!      Athletics Yukon president Kristen Johnston            Quick facts       The budget for this project is $8.2 million. The Government of Canada contributed over $6 million through the Small Communities Fund from its Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Yukon has contributed $2 million.  Rubberizing the surface of the track provides a more comfortable surface and can enhance athletic performance. A rubberized track is less likely to generate stress fractures amongst athletes than concrete or asphalt pavement, and can also enhance speed. However, rubberized surfaces also require specific care and maintenance in order to last.  The facility has lights for night use, which will extend the track and field season in Yukon.  The track took two summers to build due to the weather conditions required to rubberize the surface. The rubberizing of the track was completed in August 2020.  Sporting activities on the new facility during COVID-19 should follow the sport and recreation guidelines.

To mark the release of the article, the Yukon Beringia Interpretive Centre along with the American Museum of Natural History will be hosting an online panel discussion with lead scientist and author Dr. Emil Karpinski, Yukon palaeontologist Dr. Grant Zazula and other collaborators. Entitled Mysteries of the Mastodon, the discussion will highlight Yukon’s role as a key site for the study of responses and adaptations to climate in prehistoric animal populations. Recognizable for their tusks and muscular trunks, the mastodon was one of the largest mammals on earth during the ice age. Roaming from present-day Yukon and Alaska to as far south as Mexico, the species went extinct approximately 11,000 years ago. By examining DNA preserved in fossilized teeth, tusks and bones from these ancient creatures, including specimens from the Old Crow and Dawson City areas, the international team of scientists found that ice age American mastodons migrated northward to the Arctic multiple times in the past in response to dramatic global warming events of the ice age. For more information and to participate in the event, visit the Yukon Beringia Interpretive Centre’s Facebook page.            This study is another great example of the significance of the Yukon Palaeontology Program’s research. With our outstanding fossil records and knowledgeable and dedicated team, Yukon continues to be a leader in Beringia and ice age research.      Minister of Tourism and Culture Jeanie Dendys            The pattern of ice age animals moving northward when climates warmed up is very similar to what we are observing with present-day wildlife. Yukon’s fossil record of American mastodons provides valuable perspective to climatically-driven movements of animals into the North.      Yukon palaeotonolgist Dr. Grant Zazula            Quick facts       This paper was a collaboration between scientists across Canada, Mexico, Australia, and the United States.  Previous research from Yukon's palaeontology program developed the original idea for this genetic study and provided several fossils of mastodons that are part of the Government of Yukon fossil collections.  This is the first large-scale genetic study of American mastodons, understanding the migration paths of mastodons and their response to climate change.  Today at 10 a.m., the Yukon Beringia Interpretive Centre (YBIC) will be hosting online a panel discussion with the contributing authors live on the YBIC Facebook page.

This funding is part of the $500 million in COVID-19 relief funding that the Government of Canada announced in May 2020 for cultural, heritage and sport organizations across the country. The Government of Yukon’s Sport and Recreation branch is administering the funds directly to eligible not-for-profit sport and recreation organizations. These Yukon organizations can use the funds to cover COVID-19 related expenses they may have previously incurred because of closures or may experience in the future, as they adapt and operate under new guidelines.            Our recreation and sport organizations play such a vital role in our lives as Yukoners. They help keep us physically active and mentally healthy. They provide training and skill development. They give us opportunities to connect with each other. Sport & recreation groups, like many other organizations in our territory, have been affected by COVID-19. Thanks to the federal government, we’re hopeful these relief funds will support sport organizations as we all adapt to the ongoing impacts of the pandemic.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            Recreation is important, as it helps build inclusive communities, where families and friends can have fun and spend time together. In times like these where isolation is part of our day-to-day lives, it is especially important that we stay active and healthy for our overall physical and mental health. These funds will help keep us connected, as we navigate our ‘new normal’.      Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell              Quick facts       To ensure eligible organizations receive this funding as soon as possible, the Sport and Recreation branch is first distributing $1,259,660, or roughly 75 per cent of the funds allocated to Yukon, to its existing clients, using a standard formula.  Sport and recreation organizations that are not clients of the branch and have sport or active recreation as a primary mandate can contact Sport Yukon on how to potentially access funding.    In the fall, after feedback and evaluation, the Government of Yukon will distribute the remaining $427, 331.  Examples of eligible expenses include costs typically covered by other revenues lost due to COVID-19 restrictions, hiring extra staff, materials or equipment required to mitigate impacts of COVID-19 or funding strategic planning in anticipation of future COVID-19 impacts.

COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, August 26, at 3 p.m., the COVID-19 case count for Yukon is 15. Everyone has recovered. We have tested 2,459 people. Respiratory Assessment Centre From Wednesday, August 19, to Tuesday, August 25, we tested 116 people at the Respiratory Assessment Centre in Whitehorse. Contact sports guidelines Guidelines for contact sports are now on Yukon.ca. By adapting the way we play contact sports to reduce the risk of COVID-19 we can get back on the ice, field and court. The new guidelines apply to children and adult leagues and supplement the Government of Yukon’s existing sport and recreation guidelines. Holding a gathering guidelines Guidelines for holding organized gatherings as well as social gatherings are now online. Organized gatherings are seated events in a rented venue, such as weddings, celebrations of life and cultural events. You can have up to 50 people at an organized event indoors and up to 100 people outdoors. All rental venues need to have an operational plan and guests and organizers need to follow the plan. Social gatherings are events in private homes or public spaces, such as birthday celebrations, retirement parties and backyard barbecues. You can have up to 10 people indoors or 50 people outdoors for these sorts of gatherings. When to stay home Yukoners are reminded not to go to work or school if they’re feeling sick. They should check the Iist of COVID-19 symptoms on Yukon.ca, complete the online assessment tool and get tested if that’s recommended. If someone in a family or household is unwell, the people they live with may go to work or school unless a health care provider has told them to stay home. This advice is the same if the person who’s unwell has been tested for COVID-19.  Testing and self-isolation Anyone who does not feel well should check the COVID-19 list of symptoms on Yukon.ca, complete the online assessment tool and get tested if it’s recommended. Anyone who has symptoms of COVID-19 should self-isolate and use the online self-assessment tool at Yukon.ca, call 811 or contact their health care provider. They’ll receive guidance from a health care provider according to their individual circumstances. There are many unique situations that require guidance from public health officials. People who are tested for COVID-19 should continue to self-isolate until they receive their test result or until a health care provider advises them they no longer need to. People returning to or travelling into Yukon from anywhere except British Columbia, the Northwest Territories or Nunavut must self-isolate for a full 14 days, regardless of testing. We’re grateful to everyone who takes getting tested and self-isolation seriously and helps to reduce the risk of infection in their community.

The federal government will provide the funding in two phases: 50 per cent now and 50 per cent in early 2021. The Government of Yukon will have the flexibility to spend the funding according to its educational needs and could use it in a range of ways to protect students and staff during the pandemic, including adapting learning spaces, providing more custodial staff, supplying additional buses and providing mental health supports, health and safety training and more support for students and school communities.            This funding is very much appreciated. In my conversations with the Prime Minister and our federal colleagues, they continue to be very responsive to the needs of this territory as we manage the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic. This support will offset the costs incurred as we make sure schools are safe and adaptable to the needs of Yukon students.      Premier Sandy Silver            Yukon school communities have gone to great lengths to safely reopen schools and we are very proud of all of the work that has been done. There are costs to the adaptations that schools have made and this support will help offset these costs. We appreciate support from our federal government and look forward using these funds to the benefit of Yukon students and schools.      Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee            Quick facts       The federal government has committed to provide provinces and territories with $2 billion in new federal funding to support the adaptation of the education sector to ensure a safe return to class in the fall.  Funding will be allocated on an equal per capita basis across the country to support students ages four to 18, with a $2 million base amount provided to each jurisdiction.

The safety and well-being of Northerners are top priorities of the governments of Canada and Yukon. But the COVID-19 pandemic has affected more than residents’ personal health, it is also having a profound impact on the economy. That is why governments have been taking decisive action to support families, businesses and communities, and continue to look ahead to see what more can be done. Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell, on behalf of Minister of Infrastructure and Communities Catherine McKenna; and Minister of Community Services for the Government of Yukon John Streicker announced funding for three projects that will build or improve infrastructure in three communities across Yukon. One project is the construction of the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in Youth Centre in Dawson to enable youth to pursue traditional hobbies and activities such as music and fine arts. In Carcross, residents will benefit from clean water with upgrades and expansion to the sewage lagoon and the construction of a new lift station. In Watson Lake, retrofit upgrades to the administrative building will improve energy efficiency, lowering costs and improving comfort for employees and visitors. These projects will improve the quality of life of Yukon residents, and create immediate and long-term jobs. The Government of Canada is investing over $6.5 million in these projects through the Investing in Canada plan, including the Green Infrastructure Stream (GIS), Community Culture and Recreation Infrastructure Stream (CCRIS), Rural and Northern Communities Infrastructure Stream (RNIS), and the New Building Canada Fund – Provincial-Territorial Infrastructure Component – Small Communities Fund (SCF). The Government of Yukon is providing over $2.4 million, while the Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in First Nation is contributing $50,000.            Protecting the health and safety of Canadians is our first priority. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, investing in infrastructure in Yukon is essential to ensure the speedy recovery of our economy, provide needed jobs, and protect the well-being of our communities. This is a great example of how we are working with our partners to build stronger, more resilient infrastructure that will serve Yukoners now and in the future.      Member of Parliament for Yukon Larry Bagnell, on behalf of Minister of Infrastructure and Communities Catherine McKenna            Community infrastructure is so important and these much-needed projects all help to improve the lives of Yukoners in different ways. A new youth centre for Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in youth will provide a valuable cultural space for young people in Dawson, while Carcross is getting much-needed upgrades to its sewage system. I am also pleased to see green energy retrofits to the public administration building in Watson Lake, which is another step to building resilience to climate change in our communities.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            Tr'ondëk Hwëch’in is very pleased to be moving ahead with construction of a new Youth Centre. After several years of housing this vital program in temporary facilities that lack the space to offer adequate programming, we are looking forward to completion of a first-class centre designed specifically for our youth. We could not be more proud of the TH youth who worked to make their dream of a new Youth Centre a reality, raising funds, lobbying government leaders, and playing an active role in the design of the new facility. The Youth Centre has long played an important role in keeping our young people healthy and engaged, and we are excited for a facility that finally reflects its central role in the life of our community.      Chief of Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in First Nation Roberta Joseph            The Town of Watson Lake is grateful for the funding which is allowing us to upgrade our public administration building. These energy retrofits will make our building more comfortable for staff and for the public. It will help the town save money and reduce greenhouse gasses. The solar power is a welcome addition to the building in showing some support for green energy. The new exterior finishes are a nice contrast to the beautiful scenery in the downtown. On behalf of the Town of Watson Lake, I would like to thank all parties for the funding and the work accomplished to the retrofit of our town administrative building.      Deputy Mayor of Watson Lake Chris Irvin            Quick facts       Through the Investing in Canada plan, the Government of Canada is investing more than $180 billion over 12 years in public transit projects, green infrastructure, social infrastructure, trade and transportation routes and Canada’s rural and northern communities.  To support Canadians and communities during the COVID-19 pandemic, a new stream has been added to the over $33-billion Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program to help fund pandemic-resilient infrastructure. Existing program streams have also been adapted to include more eligible project categories.

The Government of Yukon has replaced the current Tender Management System (TMS) with a new, more efficient platform called bids&tenders. The online system has features that will streamline procurement, including: electronic bidding that includes supplier registration, tender notifications and electronic submissions for suppliers; contract management that meets the standards of our financial systems; spend analytics for reporting and planning, leading to more strategic procurement and greater transparency; and vendor performance review program management that includes evaluation and tracking of contract performance. An online submission system will reduce the need for paper bids, flag compliance errors for bidders and improve spending analysis across government. Businesses interested in bidding on contracts with the Government of Yukon are encouraged to sign up for an account on bids&tenders. Online training is available to assist with creating an account or submitting a bid in the new system.            We are excited to launch this new eProcurement system to provide a faster and more accessible, reliable and transparent tendering system for businesses. Moving to online bids will save businesses time and money while maximizing the economic benefit for Yukoners. This is part of our enduring commitment to support the economy and drive competition and innovation in the Yukon.      Minister of Highway and Public Works Richard Mostyn            Quick facts       Businesses can learn how to use the new system through online training sessions found here.  To bid on upcoming contracts, individuals and businesses will be required to create an account on bids&tenders even if they send in a paper based submission.  As the new eProcurement system is phased in, paper-based procurement will be phased out. After January 1, 2021, paper based submissions will no longer be accepted and hard copies of tender documents will no longer be distributed for tenders posted.

Ice-rich permafrost under this section of the Hamilton Boulevard extension has been monitored for a number of years. Repairs can be made now that the permafrost has thawed.   Cobalt Construction Inc. of Whitehorse was awarded the contract for the work, which includes reconstruction of the subsurface and surface of the road, as well as installation of new guardrails and replacement of light standards. During that time, drivers can expect detours, traffic control and possible delays while the work is done.            We are pleased that we can now make repairs to this section of Hamilton Boulevard to provide a safer and smoother ride for road users. We thank residents for their patience over the past few years. This is one of several projects underway in Whitehorse and throughout the territory to improve road safety. As this work proceeds, travellers are reminded to drive carefully, pay attention to signs and flagging crews, slow down around construction zones, and give heavy duty equipment adequate space.      Minister of Highways and Public Works Richard Mostyn            For a number of years, this high-traffic area has been an issue for motorists. I would like to acknowledge the efforts made by Minister Richard Mostyn for these much-needed improvements over the years. We are thankful for these repairs and for the Government of Yukon’s respectful engagement during this lengthy process. Thank you for your patience while the contractor undertakes this work.      Mayor of City of Whitehorse Dan Curtis            Quick facts       South Hamilton Boulevard in Whitehorse is the alternate connector road that connects Copper Ridge, Ingram and Lobird Trailer Park to the south Alaska Highway.  The condition of permafrost along the Hamilton Boulevard stretch has been monitored since 2013. A geotechnical study of the road recommended that the affected area be surfaced with gravel only to allow the ice to melt completely. An assessment of annual surveys of road elevations showed that in 2019, the settlement of the road had slowed considerably. It indicated that permafrost had thawed from beneath the road embankment to the point where reconstruction is now possible.            Contact   Matthew Cameron 	Cabinet Communications 	867-393-7136matthew.cameron@gov.yk.ca Bonnie Venton Ross 	Communications, Community Services 	867-332-5513bonnie.ventonross@gov.yk.ca Myles Dolphin 	Manager, Strategic Communications 	City of Whitehorse 	867-689-0515myles.dolphin@whitehorse.ca     News release #:   20-230    Related information:   City of Whitehorse construction notice         "

School operational plans Each school in Yukon is required to have an operational plan that outlines how the school will meet the health and safety guidelines for Kindergarten to Grade 12 school settings set by Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. Central administration staff and school principals have been working with public health officials, school councils and Yukon First Nations in each school community to finalize operational plans and adapt school routines for the 2020–21 school year so that students and staff can safely return to classes.   School operational plans are being reviewed, finalized and distributed through each school as they come in to keep students, parents and school staff updated on specific measures in place at their school. School operational plans are being shared on school websites. School busing To meet the health and safety guidelines for school bus operations set by Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, school bus services are being adapted for 2020–21, including fewer students on each school bus. Students are being prioritized for the school bus this year based on their eligibility as outlined in the Education Act and Student Transportation Regulations. Students are eligible for the school bus if they live more than 3.2 kilometres from their school and are attending the school in their attendance area. School bus routes for elementary students in Whitehorse are now available on Yukon.ca. The bus routes for high school students are still being finalized, including for students in Grades 10 to 12 rotating between classes in school and learning away from school. Routes will be posted and updated by the end of the week and as they become available.    All students who are eligible to ride the school bus will be able to do so. The Government of Yukon is working with its bus service provider to add additional school buses for the 2020–21 school year to accommodate as many students as safely possible. The Government of Yukon will also consider requests from students beyond the usual eligibility requirements for bus travel, based on available space on buses in the following order of priority: Kindergarten to Grade 3 students; Grade 4 to 7 students who live within 3.2 kilometres of their attendance area school; students who attend school outside of their attendance area; and special requests, including busing to stops other than from home to school and back. Families are being directly notified if they can be accommodated on the school bus at the start of the school year. As the school year starts, we will be monitoring our bus services and identifying where we can make adjustments to ensure we continue to accommodate as many students as possible and families will be updated as spacing becomes available. The Chief Medical Officer of Health and the Department of Education continue to encourage families to transport students between home and school this year if possible by arranging for students to walk, cycle, drive or carpool. This will allow more space on the bus for students who do not have another way of getting to school. High school students are encouraged to register for a City of Whitehorse transit pass and ride City transit instead of the school bus if possible, to help accommodate students who cannot take city transit on the school bus. City transit passes also provide flexibility for students who will have different schedules than normal this school year. The Department of Education will continue to provide city bus passes to students who request them. Families that have alternative transportation to school are asked to de-register for the school bus by contacting the Student Transportation Officer at student.transportation@gov.yk.ca.             We are excited to welcome students and staff safely back into the classroom, where students are face-to-face with their teachers and learning alongside their friends. Everyone will have new health and safety routines to learn in the first few weeks and we will continue to adapt to meet the needs of students over the course of the school year. Thank you to principals, educators, staff, public health officers, school councils, Yukon First Nations and our education partners for all their efforts and work over the summer to bring students safely back to school.      Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee            In COVID times more than ever, it takes a community to raise and to educate a child. My thanks go to all who have devoted hundreds of hours into the researching and writing of health and safety guidelines, the busing plans and the operational plans to enable kids to be back into schools. We all know how important for our children return to school, and for teachers and staff to feel informed, safe and supported. That would not be possible without the people behind the scenes.      Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Brendan Hanley             Quick facts       August 20 is the first day of school for Whitehorse students. Rural schools start on different dates between August 19 and September 1.  Rural school students in Kindergarten to Grade 12 and Whitehorse students in Kindergarten to Grade 9 will return to full time face-to-face classes five days a week. Whitehorse students in Grades 10 to 12 will attend face-to-face classes for half the school day five days a week and learn away from school for the other half of the school day.  School operations over the course of the pandemic are guided by the health and safety guidelines for Kindergarten to Grade 12 school settings. Student learning over the course of the pandemic is being guided by the Yukon Learning Continuity Requirements, including building skills through blended learning.  The COVID-19 student learning survey results were published on August 7 and are guiding staff as they continue to plan and adapt learning and ongoing instruction for students into the 2020–21 school year.  To support assigned seating, students will be provided a school bus pass on the first day of school that will include their school bus number. Students will be required to show their school bus pass when they get on the school bus.  Requests to ride the school bus to a location other than home or school are considered based on the Student Transportation Ridership Guidelines, including if there is enough space on the school bus and if there are available bus routes. These requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis. The priority for busing is students travelling between home and school.

The Government of Yukon is working with the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority to install a new system that will make it safer and faster to manage and screen baggage. Construction on the new system will begin this week and a temporary baggage screening system will be in place by September. The temporary system will require passengers to carry their baggage through the terminal a short distance to a separate baggage drop after check-in. Additional support will be available for any individuals requiring assistance. While the new system is being installed, passengers are advised to arrive at the airport earlier than normal before a flight to accommodate for changes in baggage screening processes. The new baggage handling system and associated equipment is expected to be installed by March 2021.            Our government continues to invest in modernizing Yukon’s aviation infrastructure. These upgrades to the Erik Nielsen Whitehorse International Airport will improve experiences for visitors and travellers.

Addditional measures introduced to support Yukon licencees during the pandemic include a 50 per cent refund of this year’s licence fee and the deferral of updates to the wholesale price list until October 1, 2020. The Yukon Liquor Corporation has also worked with the Liquor Board to support off-premise licensees, and extend hours and provide additional flexibility in the space and footprint requirements of restaurants.            Yukon restaurants and other food establishments have had to make swift adjustments to accommodate customer safety and to adapt to the disrupted tourist season.

64,2020-08-05,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/territory-wide-community-wellbeing-survey-launched-week,Government Website,Territory-wide Community Wellbeing Survey launched this week,"           Published 05/08/2020        The Government of Yukon has partnered with the Canadian Index of Wellbeing and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health to undertake a comprehensive study of wellbeing in Yukon. As Yukon begins transitioning into Phase 3 of the pandemic response, all Yukoners are being called on to complete the Yukon Community Wellbeing survey to measure territorial wellbeing and better understand the local impacts of COVID-19. The survey opened on Monday and responses will be collected throughout the next four weeks, closing in early September. The results of the Community Wellbeing Survey will provide a territory-wide snapshot of Yukoners’ wellbeing. The survey will generate the needed data to support informed decision making to best meet the unique and changing needs of Yukoners with programs, services and supports tailored to the local context. The COVID-specific questions at the start of the survey will be used to inform next steps in the pandemic response. Ensuring the voices of all Yukoners are reflected through this survey is essential. As a thank you for completing the survey, all respondents will be entered into a draw to receive one of three $500 prepaid Visa gift cards.            While Yukon communities are incredibly resilient, we know that responding to the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on our overall wellbeing. This survey will help us identify some of the unintended consequences of the pandemic and the overall health response so far. This is a chance to hear directly from Yukoners about how things are going during these challenging times, and what we as government can do to improve wellbeing across the territory. I encourage all Yukoners to take the time to complete this important survey, as it will inform how we continue to manage the pandemic in a way that minimizes the impacts on individuals and communities.      Premier Sandy Silver             Through our collective efforts, we have effectively contained the spread of COVID-19 in Yukon, but we know that our success has come with many unintended consequences to our wellbeing, both negative and in some instances positive. This survey and your participation in it is incredibly important. It represents one part of the approach we are taking to monitor the short and long terms impacts of the public health response and the many COVID closures that have been imposed since March. Your voice and your perceptions matter, so please take the time to complete this survey. The feedback we get will be used to inform our next steps in the pandemic response as we continue to keep COVID-19 contained with a minimum of harms to our social and economic wellbeing.      Dr. Brendan Hanley, Chief Medical Officer of Health             We are extremely excited about our partnership with the Government of Yukon as we explore the wellbeing of the residents of Yukon, especially during this challenging time. We know from our work across the country that Canadians place quality of life at the top of their list of priorities for themselves, their families, and their communities. Beyond the economy, Canadians’ wellbeing is a function of many aspects of their lives, such as their connections with others, their sense of belonging, the benefits they derive from their leisure, and the quality of their environment. The results of the survey will provide insights into where inequities of wellbeing exist in the lives of Yukoners so that steps can be taken to ensure that everyone can thrive.       Canadian Index of Wellbeing, University of Waterloo, Director Dr. Bryan Smale             Quick facts       The Canadian Index of Wellbeing model and the Community Wellbeing Survey helps Canadians plan for a better and more sustainable future by offering a rigorous and academically-grounded framework that measures social progress and wellbeing using a collection of indicators that are tracked across the country.  Results of the survey will be shared later this fall and a final Profile of Wellbeing in Yukon report will released in early 2021.  The data from the Community Wellbeing Survey can be used by many different organizations for a variety of purposes, including evidence-informed planning, with the ultimate goal of improving the quality of life for residents, in measurable terms.

65,2020-08-05,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/august-5-2020-covid-19-update,Government Website,"August 5, 2020: COVID-19 update","           Published 05/08/2020        The Government of Yukon has the following updates on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 case count As of today, August 5, at 2 p.m. the COVID-19 case count is 14. All of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered. There are no active cases in the territory and 1,769 people have been tested. We have had no new cases since April 20. Additional information stations set up in Beaver Creek and Watson Lake To support the government’s COVID-19 response, the visitor information centre in Watson Lake and the Yukon Beringia Interpretive Centre will be closing on August 6. The visitor information centre in Beaver Creek will be closing on August 9. Staff from these three facilities have been reassigned to work out of information stations at Yukon’s land and air borders where they will provide visitors with COVID-19 resources and information about how and where to travel safely, respectfully and responsibly in and through Yukon. Information stations are located at the Civil Emergency Measures Act (CEMA) border station outside of Watson Lake, the Canada Border Services Agency station in Beaver Creek, the top of Robert Service Way and at the airport in Whitehorse. The Yukon Beringia Interpretive Centre will be continuing online programming throughout the summer and fall. Details and information are available on Facebook and at Beringia.com. Changes to guidelines for bars, pubs and lounges Updated guidelines for bars, pubs, lounges and nightclubs mean that music, including singing and wind instruments, is now permitted if requirements are met. These include a physical distance between musicians and patrons. Karaoke is also permitted for solo performers and musicians and performers must be screened for illness prior to performing. Dancing is still not permitted. Other changes include no self-serve bar service to people. Food and drinks must be delivered to the patron’s designated table. See bars, pubs, lounges and nightclubs reopening guidelines on Yukon.ca. Child care guidelines updated Guidelines for child care services have been provided to all child care and day home operators in Yukon. Parents are no longer required to fill in an assessment tool daily but are reminded to assess their child before delivering them to daycare. See child care centres and family day homes on Yukon.ca. Public notifications Yukon Communicable Disease Control (YCDC) is very experienced in contact tracing and determining the need for public notification. When YCDC can identify people who have been exposed, they will contact them directly. This preferred approach protects an individual’s confidentiality while obtaining the needed information. If this is not possible then there are three other approaches. When they have clear detail on locations and time, but not exact information on who may have been present and whether there may have been public mixing, a public notification will be issued. With reliable information that spacing and sanitation protocols are being followed (e.g., at hotels, restaurants or campgrounds) so there is no opportunity for public exposure, these places are not identified as contact locations. With little detail on when and where someone was, but a location, a broader notification is required, which is the least preferred option and only done as a last resort. Visitor decals now available in nine communities People in Yukon with out-of-territory plates can pick up a set of visitor decals at designated pickup points in Whitehorse and nine communities. They must first have completed their 14-day self-isolation period, if it was required. Eligibility requirements are listed on Yukon.ca. In Carmacks, Dawson, Faro, Haines Junction, Mayo, Old Crow, Ross River, Teslin and Watson Lake, decals can be picked up during business hours from the Department of Environment or Compliance Monitoring and Inspections offices. In Whitehorse, decals can be picked up at the Emergency Measures Office, Monday to Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. A visitor decal indicates that the occupants are not required to self-isolate and the vehicle is authorized to travel in and around Yukon. One decal will be placed on the driver’s side of the windshield and the other will be displayed at the back of the vehicle. Enforcement statistics Since April 29, 32,104 travellers have entered or passed through Yukon. Of those, 6,067 were Yukoners, 4,115 were from BC and 14,100 were non-residents transiting through the territory. So far, Yukon has issued 123 visitor decals for non-residents. The Government of Yukon Emergency Coordination Centre received 526 complaints since April 29. So far, six people have been fined for violating the Civil Emergency Measures Act.

69,2020-07-31,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/opioid-death-toll-rises,Government Website,Opioid death toll rises,"           Published 31/07/2020        Concern continues to rise around the number of opioid related deaths in Yukon. Since January 2020, 13 individuals have died as a result of drug overdoses, 11 of which can be directly linked to opioids. The numbers were jointly released today by Yukon’s Chief Coroner Heather Jones, Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley and Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost. The announcement comes with a caution to all drug users to be extremely cautious in what they are using and who they are buying from. In May this year, the coroner and Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health issued a first warning, advising individuals not to use alone and to ensure they have a naloxone kit readily available.   There are currently plans under way to expand drug testing and explore the possibility of a supervised consumption site in Yukon.            These deaths are heartbreaking. With each death, our community loses a son or a daughter, a neighbour or a colleague. People need to be aware about the dangers of illicit drug use and know that opioid use does not discriminate. This is a complex problem that we need to address as a community. This includes working to reduce the stigma around people who use drugs, which remains a significant barrier that prevents individuals, families and communities from getting help.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Given the number of deaths in only seven months and the continued efforts we have undertaken to caution people, we have reached another level of crisis. We have to think differently about how we meet the needs of this segment of our population to keep them safe and to keep those at risk alive.      Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley            This recent spike in opioid related deaths is seen as a tragedy by Yukon Coroner’s Service. Each death represents deeply rooted networks within our communities and the impact has been massive. We must move forward with renewed compassion and face this as the crisis it has become.      Yukon Chief Coroner Heather Jones            The foremost objective of Yukon RCMP is to keep Yukoners safe, particularly our most vulnerable population. While enforcement is a key component in keeping our community safe from drug traffickers, it can only go so far. This is a bigger issue beyond simple law enforcement that requires a community approach that also includes prevention, education and harm reduction.      Yukon RCMP Commanding Officer, Chief Superintendent Scott Sheppard             Quick facts       Opioid Treatment Services at the Referred Care Clinic located on 210 Elliot Street, does not require a referral; anyone can access these services, which include strong social supports.

Permit Hunt Authorization (PHA) lottery The final list of permit holders is now available online. Forty-four permits were returned. The Government of Yukon completed five rounds of the reissuance process and is pleased to have issued all permits. In total, there were 6,079 applications for 270 PHA permits covering six species. Statistics for the 2020 PHA lottery are now online showing the distribution of years applied and the number of applications for each hunt code, for each species. Hunting during COVID-19 All hunters must follow the latest orders and recommendations from the Chief Medical Officer of Health when planning their hunt, including the guidelines on travel to Yukon communities. The most up-to-date information is available online at Yukon.ca/covid-19. Hunters are also encouraged to follow the travel advisories from First Nations governments and communities on the Council of Yukon First Nations website. Harvest reports and mandatory submissions For most species, hunters report their harvest no later than 15 days after the end of the month in which the animal was taken. Hunters are encouraged to report their harvest by calling Client Services at 867-667-5652 or toll free in Yukon 1-800-661-0408, ext. 5652 during regular business hours. When calling, hunters will receive further guidance on how to submit any mandatory biological submissions. Online (Turn and Polluters) TIPP reporting The new-and-improved web reporting service for Turn in Poach and Polluters (TIPP) is now available. This service was created to report witnessed violations of fishing, hunting, trapping or environmental laws, or injured or dead wildlife. This online service is not monitored evenings, weekends or on statutory holidays. For dangerous wildlife encounters and other situations that need immediate assistance, call the TIPP line at 1-800-661-0525. Hunt respectfully We remind all hunters that conservation and cooperation should be a priority when out on the land. No matter where you hunt in Yukon, you are on a First Nation’s or Inuvialuit traditional territory. Respect the land, other hunters and the wildlife that is being harvested. Keep a clean camp, pack out what is brought into the backcountry, stay on established trails and don’t use cabins without permission. Get the new hunt wisely guide Hunters are encourages to get a copy of the Yukon hunting regulations summary booklet. New this year is the hunt wisely guidebook, which includes hunter ethics, essential gear, firearm safety, field dressing methods and more. Copies of both booklets are available online or at any Department of Environment office.            Hunting is different during COVID-19. Hunters need to take additional precautions to be sure they are travelling safely through Yukon communities and to follow the Safe 6. We recognize that being outdoors and connecting with the land is important for our mental and physical health, particularly during this pandemic. I wish all hunters a safe and successful hunting season.

Family violence, substance use and child maltreatment may have increased within families due to an array of factors such as the reduction in child care, social isolation and general anxiety due to the pandemic. To support families who may feel overwhelmed by the new demands, CYFN and the Government of Yukon are promoting their services in a joint advertising and social marketing campaign. One ad depicts members of a six-person household who are doing their best to cope while staying at home. It invites families to call CYFN’s Family Preservation Services or the Government of Yukon’s Family and Children’s Services to find out what supports are available. A second advertisement depicts two children huddled outside in the dark, while their parents can be seen consuming alcohol and arguing inside. In this case, the ad invites community members to call Yukon Family and Children’s Services if they are concerned for the safety or well-being of a child or youth. The ads are a result of ongoing collaboration between CYFN and the Government of Yukon’s Family and Children’s Services on child-welfare reform in Yukon.            The COVID-19 pandemic has created a number of new challenges for Yukon First Nations families and communities. The Council of Yukon First Nations recognizes these challenges and we want to ensure our most vulnerable people are supported.      Council of Yukon First Nations Grand Chief Peter Johnston            These are difficult times for many Yukon families, but please remember that you are not alone and that supports are available to help you cope. And we also want to remind Yukoners that caring for children and youth is a collective responsibility, if you have concerns about a child in your community, please share them with us.

This will be the longest of the stages, lasting until a vaccine is developed, and will involve a gradual easing of restrictions for Yukoners. Starting on August 1, Yukoners can increase their household bubble from one additional family by adding three to five families depending on family size. The maximum number of individuals in a bubble should be 15 people. Members of this bubble can interact without having to physically distance.   Indoor social gatherings remain limited to 10 with social distancing, unless it is with people that are part of your social bubble. Outdoor gatherings remain at 50. However, Phase 3 allows for planned, seated events in rented spaces with a maximum of 50 people as long the rules of the rental venue are followed. Seated outdoor events with 100 people, such as weddings, will also be allowed. Yukon athletes will be able to return to play as part of Phase 3. Officials with the Chief Medical Officer of Health’s office will meet with sports organizations and officials to plan a safe return to sports activities this fall. More details will be shared as they become available. The transition to Phase 3 is enabled through meeting the indicators outlined in A Path Forward: Yukon’s plan for safely lifting COVID-19 restrictions. The Government of Yukon, based on the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health, will continue to evaluate the overall risk to Yukoners when determining when to further ease restrictions throughout Phase 3, including travel restrictions.            We are on track to enter Phase 3 of our Path Forward plan on August 1. This would not have been possible without the incredible effort from Yukoners who are doing their part to take precautions to protect themselves and their friends, families and neighbours. I strongly urge all Yukoners to continue to practice the six steps to staying safe. Our government will continue to take a measured approach to lifting restrictions in Yukon, based on advice from Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health.      Premier Sandy Silver            Our community actions have helped us get to where we are able to enter Phase 3 on August 1. This will be a long phase and we will continue to move slowly. With continued support from citizens and continued adherence to the Safe Six, we will be able to keep moving forward towards our new normal. As we open up and gather more, adhering to the Safe Six is more important than ever.      Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley            Quick facts       On August 1, Yukoners can increase their household bubble from one additional family by three to five additional families, depending on family size.

On August 1, seated outdoor events with a maximum of 100 people are allowed.  Social gatherings with members outside of your household bubble are still restricted to 10 people indoors and 50 people outdoors and only if social distancing precautions are taken.  Meetings with major sports organizations in the territory will occur to plan for a safe return to sports activities in early fall.  There have been no new cases of COVID-19 in Yukon since April 20, 2020. In total, Yukon’s case count is at 14, which include Yukoners who contracted the virus outside of the territory. All 11 cases of COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered.  Until there is a vaccine or effective and accessible treatments are identified, measures will need to remain in place to limit the risk of infection in Yukon.  The Safe Six are: physical distancing; regular hand washing; staying home when sick; not gathering in groups of more than 10 indoors and 50 outdoors; limiting travel to rural communities and being respectful when you’re there; and self-isolating if you’ve just returned to Yukon from anywhere other than BC, Nunavut and NWT.

Banking services are essential to community residents, First Nation and municipal governments, local businesses and tourists. Having reliable and convenient access to banking services ensures Yukoners in communities can take care of personal financial matters and be part of the economic growth of the territory.      Minister of Finance Sandy Silver            CIBC is pleased to be appointed to serve these Yukon communities.

Minimizing disruption to communities and individuals is one of the main focal points for this transition. The look and feel of the services may be different, but the same services, location, days and hours open will remain the same.

77,2020-07-27,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/fortymile-caribou-herd-summer-hunting-opportunity-opened,Government Website,Fortymile caribou herd summer hunting opportunity opened,"           Published 27/07/2020        The Government of Yukon is opening a limited licensed harvest on the Fortymile caribou herd from August 1 to September 9, 2020 for Yukon resident hunters. This is the second hunting opportunity for licensed Yukon resident hunters after 25 years of Fortymile caribou herd recovery efforts between the Government of Yukon, Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in, Yukon Fish and Wildlife Management Board, Dawson Renewable Resources Council and Alaska. The herd has now recovered to a population that allows for a sustainable, managed harvest that is in line with long-term conservation efforts. Opening harvesting opportunities now, when the population is numerous, is vital for maintaining the herd’s health as well as the ecological health of the range it lives on. To be eligible for one of 160 permits, hunters must have a valid Yukon big game hunting licence and a caribou seal. Hunters who have already reached the bag limit of one caribou for woodland caribou this hunting season from April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021 are not eligible to obtain this permit. Permits will be available from Department of Environment offices starting on July 30. Additional rules and requirements for the hunt are available online.            Recovering the Fortymile caribou herd has been a long journey, with many ""firsts"" to celebrate along the way. We extend our best wishes to those Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in citizens and families participating in the first Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in community hunt. We are also pleased to be able to offer harvest opportunities for licensed hunters this summer. During COVID-19, hunters must take extra precautions and follow the latest public health recommendations to ensure a safe and responsible hunting season.      Minister of Environment Pauline Frost            Quick facts       During the 2020 winter hunt of Fortymile caribou, 66 permits were issued to licensed Yukon hunters and resulted in a harvest of 14 caribou.  Similar to the winter hunt, permits will be valid for five days and will be issued at intervals. For example, August 1 to 5, August 6 to 10 and so on. Twenty permits will be available for each interval.  Hunters must report the results of their hunt whether or not they are successful. If successful, they must also submit the caribou’s incisor bar within 72 hours of the permit end date.

The guidelines will help schools plan for the return of students to classes for the 2020–21 school year. Department of Education central administration staff are working with school principals and school staff to finalize school operational plans and adapt their school routines based on these health and safety guidelines. School principals will share finalized school operational plans with school communities by August 12 before the start of the 2020–21 school year. Health and safety guidelines for Kindergarten to Grade 12 school settings  School operations are being adapted based on the health and safety guidelines for Kindergarten to Grade 12 school settings, including ensuring:  safe spacing in classrooms and common areas; proper cleaning and disinfecting of the school and high-touch areas and equipment; students and staff know when and how they should clean or sanitize their hands; safe handling of food and use of water fountains; processes are in place if a students or staff gets sick or show symptoms; and students and staff know to stay home if they are sick or show symptoms. Health and safety guidelines for school bus operations School bus services are being adapted based on the health and safety guidelines for school bus operations, including: maintaining physical distance of two metres when waiting for the bus; loading students on the bus from back to front, and offloading students from front to back to support physical distancing; seating students at a two-metre distance from school bus drivers; limiting students to two per seat, unless they are from the same household and using assigned seats; ensuring students and bus drivers are washing or sanitizing their hands before and after boarding the school bus; and cleaning and disinfecting buses, including high-touch areas after each trip. The Chief Medical Officer of Health and the Department of Education encourage families to arrange for students to walk, cycle, drive or carpool to transport students to and from school this year, if possible to allow for more room on buses for students without other means of transport.            Our schools and department are working tirelessly to have students return to school. These guidelines will inform ongoing planning to ensure face-to-face learning opportunities to protect the health and safety of students and staff. I want to thank all our education partners who have worked hard to adapt plans to make sure our students are safe and supported.      Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee             Careful thought and planning have gone into these health and safety guidelines to enable students to return to in-classroom learning. It is critical that we support our kids’ ability to learn and thrive in a face to face educational environment. The work we have undertaken with Education allows this to happen in the safest manner possible for students and their teachers.      Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley            Quick facts       On July 9, 2020, the Government of Yukon announced preliminary operational and learning planning for Yukon schools for the 2020–21 school year based on the initial health and safety guidance for Kindergarten to Grade 12 school settings and efforts to support safe spacing in schools:  Rural schools have the flexibility to safely return all Kindergarten to Grade 12 students for full-day, in-class instruction five days per week. Whitehorse schools can safely return all Kindergarten to Grade 9 students for full-day, in-class instruction five days per week. Whitehorse Grade 10 to 12 students will return to half-day in-class instruction and half-day learning away from school five days per week using blended learning with additional support through virtual or in-person study halls with teachers. The Grade 8 students from F.H. Collins Secondary School will move to the Wood Street Centre for the 2020–21 school year and experiential programs will be moved to F.H. Collins and Porter Creek Secondary School.  School preliminary plans have been shared with Yukon First Nations governments and school councils. Yukon First Nations, school councils and education partners will continue to be engaged and their feedback incorporated as planning continues for the 2020–21 school year.  Students will be prioritized for busing in the 2020–21 school year if they are eligible for school busing as described in the Education Act and Student Transportation Regulations and are residing outside of a 3.2 kilometer radius of their school and are enrolled in their attendance area school.

COVID-19 case count As of today, July 22, at 2 p.m. the COVID-19 case count is 13. All of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered. There are no active cases in the territory and 1,450 people have been tested. Update on the start of Phase 3 Phase 3 is expected to begin on August 1, 2020. The public is reminded that Phase 3 will be a long one, anticipated to take Yukon through until a COVID-19 vaccine is available.  	Initially, changes under Phase 3 will be internal to the territory only. Changes being considered are expansion of family bubbles, gatherings and a return to sport play. Additional changes and relaxation of other restrictions will be considered as appropriate, based on public health principles and level of risk. Expanded testing statistics Testing criteria was expanded on July 15 to include a broader range of symptoms for individuals who have not travelled. This was done in response to and in anticipation of the opening of the border with British Columbia, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, and flu season. Since July 15, 75 tests have been conducted. Testing is happening at Yukon Communicable Disease Control (YCDC), the respiratory assessment centre (RAC) and, in some cases, Whitehorse General Hospital. There have been 170 tests conducted since July 1. Contact tracing emails If someone is named as a contact of a person who has COVID 19, they will be contacted by Yukon Communicable Disease Control (YCDC). Yukoners are encouraged to be on alert for scams related to contact tracing. Any other contact tracing outreach being conducted by anyone aside from YCDC is not valid. Stories are circulating about emails being sent to individuals identifying them as having been somewhere where someone has been diagnosed as positive. The email encourages the recipient to open a document for instructions, which they should not do as these emails are fraudulent. All contact tracing is done directly by YCDC. Visitor decals available for eligible vehicles with out-of-territory licence plates As of July 20, 2020, some vehicles with out-of-territory licence plates will be provided with a visitor decal when they enter Yukon at a border check station staffed by Government of Yukon enforcement officers. Visitor decals will be provided to critical service providers and travellers who have completed their 14-day self-isolation as required, including: Canadians with plates from jurisdictions outside of British Columbia, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut; Americans providing essential services in Yukon; and foreign residents who have been permitted entry to Canada by the Canadian Border Services Agency. The green visitor decal placed on the driver’s side of the windshield indicates that the occupants are not required to self-isolate and the vehicle is authorized to travel in and around Yukon. People in Yukon with out-of-territory plates can pick up a visitor decal at the Emergency Measures Office located at 60 Norseman Road in Whitehorse. People living in Yukon communities can contact covid19enforcement@gov.yk.ca to request a visitor decal. Eligible visitors must first have completed their 14-day self-isolation period, if it was required. Visitors as well as residents are reminded to be kind, respectful and be safe.

This continues our public commitment to support the organization and assist in creating low-income housing options for Yukoners. The hard work of Habitat for Humanity’s volunteer members is much appreciated in the ongoing effort to meet the need for quality affordable housing in Yukon.      Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources Ranj Pillai            The transfer of these two duplex sites in Whistle Bend by the Government of Yukon helps Habitat for Humanity Yukon continue its important work in removing barriers to affordable home ownership in Yukon.      Habitat for Humanity Yukon Executive Director Marney Paradis            Quick facts       Habitat for Humanity Yukon is a not-for-profit organization that was officially established in September 2004 to provide affordable housing through home ownership. Since that time, Habitat has constructed 22 new homes for low-income families. Much of Habitat’s success has been through the efforts of its volunteer base, some of whom dedicate many weeks each year on building sites.  Since 2005, Habitat for Humanity Yukon and the Government of Yukon have worked in partnership to make home ownership possible for low-income Yukon families who would not qualify for a regular mortgage and for whom home ownership would otherwise be difficult or impossible.

The opening of The Farm Gate, a licensed and inspected poultry operation owned by Cain and Michelle Vangel, marks the first opportunity for Yukon retailers to offer Yukon-raised poultry products in store. The new licensed, privately-owned white meat abattoir facility means producers now have a place where their birds can be processed, retailers now have the ability to purchase inspected poultry to add to their shelves in their store or on their menu and Yukoners can now access Yukon raised poultry products through many different sale points. The first inspected, locally-raised chickens went into the freezers at Bigway Foods in Whitehorse in late June.            The availability of locally-raised and inspected poultry is an important step in developing the capacity of Yukon’s agriculture industry and will increase food security for Yukoners. Congratulations to the Vangel family and The Farm Gate and thanks to Sam Jurovich of Bigway Foods, the Agriculture Branch, and the Animal Health Unit for working hard to bring this to fruition.      Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources Ranj Pillai            I am happy to be able to provide locally-raised poultry to Yukoners and I‘d like to thank Sam, Nathan and Ash at Bigway Foods for stepping up to carry more locally-raised products in their grocery store. I anticipate this is just the first step in an expansion of choice of locally-raised inspected poultry that will be available to Yukoners in the near future.      The Farm Gate owner Cain Vangel            Our customers enjoy the ability to buy locally grown and raised foods and we are happy to support Yukon farms and processing facilities to deliver the goods that customers are requesting.      Copper Ridge Bigway Foods owner Sam Jurovich            Quick facts       Yukon has a growing red and white meat industry. Since 2016 there has been a 200 per cent increase in the number of inspected animals reaching the retail market. During the challenging times presented by COVID-19, Yukoners have shown their desire to buy local and meat inspection in 2020 is projected to double last year’s numbers.   Both red and white meat inspection requires an inspector to view the live animals, ensuring their pre-slaughter health, and to visually inspect each animal during and after processing. Inspections of abattoir facilities are carried out by qualified Government of Yukon meat inspectors.

This agreement sets out shared objectives and commits $19 billion in federal resources in areas that are critical to safely resuming economic activity across the country and reducing the impact of a potential “second wave” of COVID-19. I am pleased to say that throughout this process, the federal and provincial leaders have recognized the unique circumstances of the territories. I am particularly pleased that this agreement includes a commitment from the Government of Canada to provide additional support specifically for the territories through a separate agreement. I greatly appreciate the support from other Premiers to advance considerations specific to the North through these negotiations. Additional resources will ensure that federal support is tailored to the distinct needs of the territories. We will provide more details when that agreement is finalized. I am proud of our success working together to develop an agreement that serves the interests of 13 provinces and territories, and Canada as a whole.

Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley, working with Yukon Communicable Disease Control (YCDC), has released expanded testing criteria. With the reopening of the territory to other provinces and territory, interactions with those from outside Yukon will increase. The expansion of the symptoms list will allow for increased testing which in turn will assist with early detection and contact tracing of COVID-19. The expanded list of symptoms includes fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, runny nose, sore throat, loss of sense of taste or smell, headache, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea and muscle aches.            Increased testing will allow early detection and contact tracing which is a critical part of the public health strategy that will help us maintain our goal of case detection and containment.  We now face the challenge of living and managing COVID while recognizing the need to address health and public health in a more holistic way. We will strive to identify cases early by testing the right people in a timely manner and when cases are identified, YCDC and my office will work to manage those persons and their contacts.      Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Brendan Hanley            Quick facts       Testing of asymptomatic persons is not recommended at this time.

Cultivating Our Future: 2020 Yukon Agriculture Policy is the result of three years of work with Yukon’s agricultural producers, public and First Nations. The vision for the 2020 Yukon Agriculture Policy is to create the right conditions to increase Yukon’s self-sufficiency in food production, produce high-quality products that feed Yukon’s vibrant communities, contribute to the local economy and to leave positive cultural and environmental legacies for future generations. The policy supports the ongoing development of Yukon’s agriculture industry in areas including: accessing arable land for farming; encouraging best management practices on farms; improving land use for agricultural purposes; prioritizing agriculture-related infrastructure development; reducing operating costs and offering agriculture extension services to support farmers and communities; and increasing farm opportunities, including agriculture business development and marketing.            The updated agriculture policy will work hand-in-hand with Yukon’s Local Food Strategy to encourage self-sufficiency in food production, promote the availability of local food to all Yukoners and consider First Nations priorities for land use and developing local food production capacity. The updated policy supports all communities and aspects of the agriculture and local food sectors, including food for people, feed for livestock and food distribution and environmental impacts.      Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources Ranj Pillai            Yukon’s agriculture industry representatives have been working closely with the Government of Yukon for over two years to update and refine a new agriculture policy for Yukon. We are excited about the future of local food production in Yukon and Cultivating our Future: 2020 Yukon Agriculture Policy will be a guiding document in the development of Yukon’s agriculture industry in to the next decade.      President of Yukon Agricultural Association Sonny Gray            Quick facts       Cultivating Our Future: 2020 Yukon Agriculture Policy is Yukon’s fourth formal agriculture policy. The first policy was adopted in 1982 and updates were made in 1991 and 2006. The 2006 Yukon Agriculture Policy was adopted to encourage an agriculture industry that is economically viable, environmentally sustainable and produces high quality and safe food.  There are 142 farms reported in Yukon. Hay production has been the largest portion of Yukon’s agriculture industry in terms of the number of farms, acreage and revenue. Yukon farms also produce vegetables, field crops, berries, meats and a variety of value-added products including preserves and cheese.

The agreement signed between Yukon Energy and Solvest Inc. commits the utility to purchase the renewable electricity generated by the company’s proposed solar project on the North Klondike Highway for the next 25 years. Solvest’s 1 megawatt project is the first large-scale solar project in the Whitehorse area and the second independent power producer to sign an electricity purchase agreement in Yukon. Once constructed, Solvest’s solar array will be the largest solar array operating in the territory. It will generate approximately 1.84 gigawatt hours of renewable electricity each year, about the same amount of electricity used by 153 Yukon homes in a year. Construction is slated to begin in August and completed in November 2020.            As demand for electricity grows, it is important that we increase the amount generated from renewable sources. This local renewable energy project creates jobs and opportunities for Yukon businesses, supports energy self-sufficiency, makes us less vulnerable to changing fuel prices and helps us transition to a clean energy economy. Signing this agreement brings certainty to Solvest as a green economy investor and to Yukon Energy and its customers on the price paid for power over the next 25 years.      Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources Ranj Pillai            Yukon Energy is committed to renewables. By 2030, our goal is to have more than 97 per cent of the electricity generated on the Yukon grid, on average, to come from renewable sources. In addition to the renewable projects we are building on our own, entering into these types of agreements with Independent Power Producers and purchasing locally-owned and generated renewable electricity helps us reach our renewable electricity target and build a sustainable energy future in Yukon.      Yukon Energy Corporation President and CEO Andrew Hall            Solvest is pleased to take a leading role in renewable energy development in Yukon. This project will provide an economically viable example of solar in the North and help encourage further development of renewable energy here and across northern Canada. As a local company, we look forward to working with Yukon government, Yukon Energy and ATCO Electric Yukon to bring this project online and begin supplying Yukoners with renewable energy for decades to come.      Solvest Vice-President Ben Power            Quick facts       There are three approaches to developing an Independent Power Production project: the Standing Offer Program for smaller projects that go through an application process, the Call for Power where utilities seek out larger projects and Unsolicited Proposals where projects are submitted to utilities. This is the first Electricity Purchase Agreement signed under the Standing Offer Program.  Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation owns the 480 kilowatt solar array installed in Old Crow. The renewable energy system will displace the use of diesel to generate electricity in the off-grid community. Once the system is operational, ATCO Electric Yukon will purchase the electricity for the next 25 years.

Tenants living in private non-subsidized market rental housing in Yukon who have lost 30 per cent or more of their income due to COVID-19 are eligible for a grant to help cover rent in July, August and September 2020. Eligible households can receive 50 per cent of median market rent based on unit size: $415 per month for a bachelor, or room in a house; $500 per month for a 1 bedroom; $600 per month for a 2 bedroom; and $800 per month for a 3 bedroom or larger. The grant will be paid directly to landlords on behalf of tenants. This will ensure that landlords, who may also be experiencing lower income as a result of the pandemic, continue receiving partial income from their rental properties and tenants who have had to defer paying rent will have less owing. In June, the Government of Yukon passed a ministerial order that protects tenants from eviction for non-payment of rent if they are under a health protection measure and allowed tenants who deferred rent payments due to income lost due to COVID-19 will have until December 31, 2020 to repay the outstanding amount to their landlord. For new clients who are interested in the program, the COVID-19 Rent Assist program applications for July to September will be available in late July at https://service.yukon.ca/forms/en/rent-assistance-covid19. Existing clients of the COVID-19 Rent Assist program for April, May or June should contact the Yukon Housing Corporation at rentassist@gov.yk.ca or by phone at 867-667-5759 or toll-free at 1-800-661-0408 extension 5759 to find out how to renew their application.            It is important that we continue to support Yukoners who are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This will help tenants who have experienced a loss of income due to the COVID-19 situation and landlords who may not be receiving their rental income. The Government of Yukon will continue to support Yukoners during these uncertain times as we work to keep our territory safe and healthy.      Minister Responsible for the Yukon Housing Corporation Pauline Frost            Quick facts       The COVID-19 Rent Assist program was originally announced in May 2020 to help landlords and tenants who had lost income due to the COVID-19 situation pay rent during April, May and June. Yukoners can apply for support for these three months until July 15, 2020.  During these three months, the Yukon Housing Corporation approved 140 Yukon households for support.  This program has a budget of $1.29 million to help Yukoners afford rent after they have lost income due to COVID-19.

96,2020-07-02,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/tower-bay-dezadeash-lake-closed-all-fishing,Government Website,Tower Bay on Dezadeash Lake closed to all fishing ,"           Published 02/07/2020        Joint release with Champagne and Aishihik First Nations. The Government of Yukon and Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (CAFN) have put regulations in place to close Tower Bay (Gokhtaheen), located on Dezadeash Lake, to angling and subsistence fishing each year from July 1 to August 15. The regulation is the first of its kind in Yukon. It aligns a subsistence regulation under CAFN’s fish and wildlife legislation with the territory’s fishery regulations. The regulation will apply to licensed anglers, CAFN Citizens and Yukon First Nations with consent from CAFN to fish for subsistence on Dezadeash Lake. The closure will protect lake trout that gather in Tower Bay to seek refuge from warm lake temperatures.            The Government of Yukon is proud to work in partnership with Champagne and Aishihik First Nations to put this important regulation in place. Closing Tower Bay for fishing for a period each year will protect lake trout, ensuring the population remains sustainable now and for future generations.      Minister of Environment Pauline Frost            It is dän k’e – our way – to look after the fish and the lake. We are glad to partner with the Government of Yukon on these regulations.  It is worth sacrificing our subsistence fishing rights at Gokhtaheen today in order to look after the fish for generations to come.       Champagne and Aishihik First Nations Kaaxnox, Dän nätthe äda (Chief Steve Smith)            Quick facts       The Government of Yukon and Champagne and Aishihik First Nations will review this measure in five years to evaluate effectiveness and compliance.  This regulation change was proposed by Champagne and Aishihik First Nations in 2015 during the Yukon Fish and Wildlife Management Board’s regulation change process. It went through public review in fall 2015 and was recommended to the Minister by the Board in spring 2016.  Champagne and Aishihik First Nations passed its regulation closing the bay in June 2020 based on Citizens’ input through the General Assembly.  Lake trout are a cold water species who thrive in water temperatures between 8°C and 12°C.  Dezadeash Lake is shallow and experiences a high temperature increase in the summer. Due to this, lake trout congregate at Tower Bay because it has cool water inflow. This makes them vulnerable to over-fishing and can push them into warmer waters, which limits their ability to regulate their temperature.

97,2020-06-30,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/community-safety-plan-developed-whitehorse-emergency-shelter,Government Website,Community safety plan developed for Whitehorse Emergency Shelter,"           Published 30/06/2020        A new Community Safety Plan for the Whitehorse Emergency Shelter and surrounding community has been developed with help from Public Safety Canada. In partnership with key local stakeholders, the Government of Yukon worked with Public Safety Canada and its community safety planning process to develop the plan in the context of the shelter. This process advocates a community-based approach to identify ways to address safety concerns, while remaining focused on serving Yukon’s vulnerable community members. The Community Safety Plan identifies four key priorities that will enhance the shelter’s commitment to providing a safe place for those experiencing homelessness, while also being responsive to the concerns of local residents and businesses. These priorities are: Ensuring the safety of shelter clients, drop-in guests and staff; Enhancing the shelter's strategic and operational governance; Creating a safe and harmonious neighbourhood for shelter clients, and neighbouring residents and businesses; and Ensuring that clients can access culturally-based programs, services and other supports that identify and remove barriers to wellness, healing, education, employability, self-sufficiency, and cultural and community inclusion. The safety plan includes 14 high-level goals and 26 specific actions that are meant to achieve the goal of an emergency shelter that is safe, responsive to the needs of vulnerable citizens, and respectful of those who reside or work in the immediate vicinity. The Government of Yukon is currently reviewing the safety plan and its recommendations. Some of these actions have already been implemented and several more are in development. A committee will be established to oversee the ongoing implementation of the plan, which will continue to apply harm reduction principles and practices to the delivery of services at the shelter.            Our government looks forward to working with all of our valued community stakeholders, local businesses and neighbours in using the Community Safety Plan as guide to help us address collective neighbourhood concerns. We are committed to working with our partners to create a community that helps all members thrive. The actions in this plan will help us provide the best supports possible to clients while addressing concerns of the downtown Whitehorse community. Working together, with open minds and a spirit of partnership that focuses on how best to support those most in need, we believe that we can better address the complex health and social needs in our community.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost           Backgrounder   Addressing safety concerns Exterior renovations to the shelter are underway that will help to immediately address some of the ongoing safety concerns. A six-foot fence has recently been installed along the west side of the shelter, which will deter guests from accessing the back of the facility. Seven specially designed benches and planter boxes are being installed along the Alexander Street side of the shelter. These benches will provide more useable space for shelter guests and a safer place to congregate. The benches are movable, so they can be removed if necessary. Enhanced and integrated health services The Department of Community Services has stationed an EMS Paramedic at the facility, 10 hours a day seven days a week. Since January 2020 more than 1200 interactions with shelter clients have been attended to by these paramedics. The Whitehorse Emergency Shelter has partnered with Mental Wellness and Substance Services to provide psychiatric nursing and mental wellness counselling and social supports to guests, as well as enhanced integration with the Referred Care Clinic (RCC) through a shared outreach nurse to ensure access to a suite of integrated supports and improved access to primary care. Increased programming and support services In 2019 Health and Social Services added two new positions: a social worker and an outreach worker, to support facility guests and connect them to available resources. On-the-land and recreational programming with a First Nations focus has been offered since 2019. A major emphasis has been on guest-led programming and activities. The department of Health and Social Services will continue to work with its government and NGO stakeholders to look at developing further programs and activities. Increased client involvement A Guest Advisory Committee was created in summer 2019 to provide Health and Social Services with advice and recommendations about programming and services. This work is currently being reinvigorated, with a focus on developing peer-based employment opportunities, along with establishing the overall framework for how best to engage guests and peers. Information sharing The shelter has launched a newsletter that highlights activities and programming happening at the facility, and provides some general information to the community on operations. COVID-19 response Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic staff at the Whitehorse Emergency Shelter have been working diligently on measures designed to prevent the potential spread of the virus within the facility and among its guests. This time last year, there were an average of 55 to 65 overnight guests per day. The overnight shelter numbers for May 2020 ran from 18 to 39 guests per day. Key measures include: Screening overnight shelter guests for COVID-19 symptoms at intake. A detailed set of operational guidelines for this screening process has been developed. Ten housing units on the facility’s third floor are being held as future isolation units for guests or shelter users diagnosed with COVID-19. Since late March, guests who require minimal supports have been moved into temporary off-site accommodation, to reduce the number of people staying overnight. On-site dining for dinner has been restricted to overnight shelter guests only. A to-go meal option is being provided to all shelter guests at the Whitehorse Food Bank. We have taken measures to reduce the number of people in the shelter at one time, while ensuring that vulnerable people have a place of respite and a place to connect to health and social supports, if needed. Increased on-site cleaning staff are providing 16 hours a day of continuous cleaning services, which meets or exceeds Canadian disinfection guidelines. Shelter beds and mattresses are disinfected daily.

Individuals entering the building or the airport terminal will be required to wear a non-medical mask or face covering. This is in addition to the measures announced by Transport Canada on April 20, 2020. As travel restrictions begin to lift, an increase in airport traffic is anticipated throughout the summer months. These additional protective measures will help slow the spread of COVID-19 and ensure passengers and airport staff are able to maintain the same level of safety obtained from physical distancing, particularly at crowded sections such as security checkpoints and check-in lines. It is advised that people only enter the airport if it is absolutely essential. Yukoners are encouraged to use the free parking or the cell-phone waiting lot when picking passengers up.      Quick facts       Wearing a mask alone will not prevent the spread of COVID-19. All Yukoners must strictly adhere to good hygiene and public health measures such as frequent hand washing and physical distancing.    Non-medical face masks or face coverings should: allow for easy breathing; fit securely to the head with ties or ear loops; maintain their shape after washing and drying; be changed as soon as possible if damp or dirty; be comfortable and not require frequent adjustment; be made of at least two layers of tightly woven material fabric (such as cotton or linen; and be large enough to completely and comfortably cover the nose and mouth without gaping.

Phase 2 will begin July 1 and includes significant changes to border control measures. Beginning tomorrow, residents of Yukon, British Columbia, Northwest Territories and Nunavut can enter Yukon without having to self-isolate. To do so, they must provide valid identification proving they are a resident of one of those four jurisdictions and declare they have not travelled outside of those locations in the previous 14 days. Yukon’s borders will also open to the rest of Canada starting tomorrow, but with strict public health measures in place, including the need to self-isolate for 14-days. Some Canadian residents may be exempt from the self-isolation requirement, such as critical workers and individuals transiting through Yukon. Enforcement officers will continue to be stationed at Yukon border checkpoints to advise travellers of their obligation to self-isolate, and provide information on how to safely transit through Yukon. The transition to Phase 2 is made possible by the continued downward trend in COVID-19 cases nationally and enhanced health care capacity locally. The start of Phase 2 is also supported by new and revised sector-specific guidelines for businesses and restaurants, vulnerable populations and many more. A complete listing of all published guidelines and recommendations related to staying safe or operating a business in the territory during COVID-19 can be found by visiting Yukon.ca.            Thanks to the precautions taken by Yukoners over the course of the pandemic so far, we are in a position to enter Phase II of our Path Forward plan and continue to lift restrictions. Our goal as a government remains to contain the spread of COVID-19 in Yukon and to protect the health and safety of Yukoners. We have published dozens of guidelines and recommendations so businesses, organizations, and all Yukoners know how to operate safely during the pandemic. We are confident in the measures we have in place to protect our most vulnerable citizens and also know Yukoners will continue to do their part by practising the Safe Six.      Premier Sandy Silver            Tomorrow brings a new challenge for all of us; to adapt to a world where, COVID-19 is a fact of daily life. Since the gates shut in March we have been able to fend off outbreaks and kept the numbers of cases to a minimum. We have kept our seniors and our vulnerable populations safe. We were able to take the time to learn about COVID-19, learn from others and prepare our defences. I am confident we are prepared to meet this new challenge of living with COVID-19 while progressively restoring our overall health.      Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley            Quick facts       As of July 1, residents of Yukon, British Columbia, Northwest Territories and Nunavut can enter Yukon without having to self-isolate if they can provide ID proving their residency, and confirm they have not been outside those four jurisdictions in the past 14 days.  These jurisdictions have implemented public health measures that have shown good results in stemming the spread of COVID-19. The self-isolation exemption list can change based on COVID-19 case counts, outbreaks, and risk mitigation measures.  As of July 1, all remaining residents of Canada may enter Yukon as long as they self-isolate for 14 days upon entry. Some may be exempt from the self-isolation requirement, such as critical workers and individuals transiting through Yukon.  There have been no new cases of COVID-19 in Yukon since April 20, 2020. In total, Yukon has seen 11 cases of COVID-19, all of which have recovered.  Until there is a vaccine or effective and accessible treatments are identified, measures will need to remain in place to limit the risk of infection in Yukon.  The Safe Six are: physical distancing; regular hand washing; staying home when sick; not gathering in groups of more than 10 indoors and 50 outdoors; limiting travel to rural communities and being respectful when you’re there; and self-isolating if you’ve just returned to Yukon from anywhere other than British Columbia, Northwest Territories and Nunavut.

COVID-19 case count As of today, June 24, at 2 p.m. the COVID-19 case count remains at 11 in the territory. All of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered. There are no active cases in the territory and 1,265 people have been tested. We have had no new cases since April 20. Border controls to be eased Starting July 1, residents of British Columbia and Yukon will be allowed to travel back and forth without the need to self-isolate for 14 days. BC residents entering Yukon will need to provide documentation proving their BC residence at the border or airport, such as a driver’s licence. Also from July 1, residents of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut will be allowed to enter Yukon without needing to self-isolate for 14 days, as long as they travel directly to Yukon from one of the territories or through BC. The decision to ease border restrictions was made based on careful risk assessments and confidence in the territory’s health care capacity and ability to contact trace if new cases arrive in Yukon. Resources for vulnerable populations To help Yukoners at risk during this pandemic, vulnerable populations can now access mental health and social supports online. This includes homeless people, those experiencing or at risk of gender-based violence, people with disabilities, seniors and those with underlying medical conditions. Pools to reopen Effective July 1, public pools will be able to operate with an approved operational plan. Swimming and other water-related activities are excellent ways to get the physical activity needed for a healthy life. The use of public pools is considered a low-risk activity as long as pools are operated safely and are properly maintained. All requirements in the Public Pool Regulations, under the Public Health and Safety Act, must be adhered to. An operational plan must be submitted to COVID19info@gov.yk.ca and there must be a pre-opening public pool inspection. Pool operators throughout the territory have been advised of this information. Farmers market  Beginning July 1, Yukon farmers' markets can welcome non-food vendors (such as artisans and soap and flower sellers). Information booths will continue to be excluded.

106,2020-06-19,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/statement-government-yukon-national-indigenous-peoples-day,Government Website,A statement from the Government of Yukon on National Indigenous Peoples Day,"           Published 19/06/2020        Premier Sandy Silver issued the following statement for National Indigenous Peoples Day: June 21 is National Indigenous Peoples Day, an important opportunity to celebrate the rich histories, cultures and traditional knowledge of Yukon First Nations and Indigenous groups across Canada. First Nations truly are the heart and soul of many Yukon communities. This day gives us the chance to recognize their diversity of achievements and ongoing contributions to the vibrant cultural fabric of our territory. In Yukon, each First Nation plays a crucial role in strengthening our systems of governance, economy, culture and education. In 1973, as part of Together Today for our Children Tomorrow, Yukon First Nation leaders called for a university in Yukon. In 2020, the launch of Yukon University, Canada’s first university north of 60, honours that call and breathes life into that vision. Yukon First Nations continue to map the way forward for our territory in a way that benefits all Yukoners. Our government is proud to celebrate Yukon First Nations and Indigenous groups from coast to coast to coast. I encourage all Yukoners to learn more about Indigenous culture, arts, and achievements, and to celebrate this important day with friends and family.

107,2020-06-19,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/final-phase-fh-collins-track-and-field-underway,Government Website,Final phase of the F.H. Collins track and field underway,"           Published 19/06/2020        The new running track at F.H. Collins will be closed starting June 23, 2020 while the surface is rubberized. This is the final phase of the F.H. Collins track and field project. Work is expected to be complete so that the track is ready for the 2020–21 school year. Closing the track at this time of year will result in the shortest possible closure. The rubber requires that overnight temperatures stay above 10 degrees Celsius in order for the track to set. The public is asked to stay away from the track during this time to allow for proper installation. Athletics Yukon plans to register the new track to World Athletics standards so that the track may be used for national track and field meets in the future. The facility will be used to host the Yukon elementary and high school track and field championships. In addition to the regulation running track, the new track and field complex will also have steeple chase, long jump, high jump and shotput facilities. The budget for this project is $8.2 million. The Government of Canada contributed over $6 million through the Small Communities Fund from its Investing in Canada infrastructure plan. The Government of Yukon has contributed $2 million.            Physical activity is key to a healthy, active lifestyle. We’re so excited to see the final phase of the F.H. Collins track underway. This will bring world-class running facilities to our community for the first time and I look forward to athletes of all ages and abilities using it.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            This modernized facility will expand physical education and sport opportunities and enhance the Riverdale Educational Reserve. It will also provide a great venue for community recreation that supports the health and wellness of students, families and all Yukoners.      Minister of Education Tracy-Anne Macphee            The athletics facility, with its new rubberized track, is unique in Whitehorse and in Yukon. I am proud to know that our athletes and residents can train and keep fit and healthy at this excellent facility. The Government of Canada recognizes that strategic investments in public infrastructure, including sports and recreation projects such as this, will ensure that our communities remain among the best places to live, work, and raise a family.

The amendments provide a clearer and more comprehensive framework to govern the use of segregation and restrictive confinement. They also establish new independent external oversight and accountability measures for the use of segregation in Yukon’s corrections system. A review adjudicator will be appointed to review segregation placements prior to an inmate being held in non-disciplinary segregation for five consecutive days. Additionally, a review panel will be established to provide oversight in circumstances where an individual has been held in segregation for more than 40 aggregate days. These external review processes are designed to provide independence and ensure that placements are only done in accordance with the circumstances contained in the amended legislation.            These progressive amendments follow the United Nation’s Mandela Rules and align corrections in the Yukon with international best-practices for those in custody. Corrections reform and the safe, fair and compassionate treatment of inmates is our government’s priority.

COVID-19 case count As of today, June 17, at 2 p.m. the COVID-19 case count remains at 11 in the territory. All of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered. There are no active cases in the territory and 1,245 people have been tested. We have had no new cases since April 20. Full dental services to resume in Yukon Dental professionals may again offer full dental services in the territory beginning on July 1. All dental care except emergency and urgent procedures had previously been suspended due to the pandemic on March 27. The Chief Medical Officer of Health has recommended the resumption of full dental services as part of the territory’s COVID-19 reopening plan, which enters Phase 2 on July 1. Dental professionals will be able to offer non-urgent services, including but not limited to: initial or periodic oral examinations or recall visits; routine dental cleaning and preventative therapies; routine radiographs; extraction of asymptomatic teeth; aesthetic dental procedures; dental implants; restorative dentistry; and non-painful chronic periapical lesions. At this time, dental professionals must continue to follow the Chief Medical Officer of Health’s Recommended practices and personal protective equipment. Guidelines issued Guidelines have now been created and posted for the operation of fitness centres and gyms. This guidance does not apply to recreation centres with pools, arenas, sports fields or large indoor spaces for gatherings. It is designed for public indoor spaces designed for shared fitness purposes. An operational plan must be submitted if the operation employs staff and the safe six must be applied. Guidelines for the operation of public recreation centres have also been released. These guidelines address facilities with large indoor spaces, pools, running tracks, curling and ice rinks, etc. Again, operational plans must be submitted and the safe six adhered to.  Restaurants at full capacity Beginning July 1, Yukon restaurants can increase their operating capacity from 50 per cent to 100 per cent. Restaurants were closed to all but take out services on March 22 and reopened at 50 per cent on May 29. Restaurants will still be required to follow the reopening food premises guidelines. Gatherings  As of July 1, outdoor gatherings in Yukon may have up to 50 people in attendance. These should still respect physical distancing guidelines and may not serve shared food. No buffets or pot lucks are permitted at this time. The limit for indoor gatherings remains at 10 or fewer.

As of July 1, all tenants must pay their rent in full as set in their tenancy agreements, unless they are prevented from doing so because they are subject to a health protection measure. Tenants who owe unpaid rent from March 26 to July 1 because of COVID-19 loss of income or after 	June 25, because they were under a health protection measure, have until December 31 to repay the outstanding amount. For people who are subject to a health protection measure such as self-isolation in accordance with the Chief Medical Officer of Health’s instructions, rental protection measures put in place on March 26, 2020 continue. The order also prevents landlords from entering the rental unit of a tenant subject to a health protection measure unless it is an emergency. Additionally, tenants who are not able to pay their rent because of COVID-19 loss of income will still be able to end their tenancy with 30 days’ notice to their landlord. This frees up the rental unit to tenants who are able to cover rent. Tenants and landlords are encouraged to contact the Residential Tenancies Offices for more information by phone at 867-667-5944 or toll-free in Yukon at 1-800-661-0408 extension 5944, or by email at rto@gov.yk.ca A variety of territorial and federal programs are currently in place to support individuals who are experiencing financial impacts as a result of COVID-19. Information about available supports can be found at Yukon.ca/covid-19.            We continue to provide safeguards for tenants who may have to self-isolate and follow health protection orders while the emergency order is in effect. As restrictions lift, we know that it will take time for some businesses to reopen and rehire staff. We hope that with this deadline, affected tenants will have enough time to earn the income to pay any overdue rent.         Minister of Community Services John Streicker            Quick facts       A health protection measure means any of the following as it relates to a tenant or a member of the tenant’s household and COVID-19: 	  A quarantine of the individual; A restriction on the movement of the person or class of people, to and from the rental unit. A health officer imposes it under the Public Health and Safety Act; A restriction of an individual's movement if it is recommended by or is under the authority of the Chief Medical Officer of Health or the Chief Public Health Officer. It does not include physical distancing; and Hospitalization of the individual.  An Order in Council passed on March 26 prevented landlords from serving their tenants with a notice to end tenancy for unpaid or late rent until the OIC is repealed on June 25.  A tenant who could not pay their rent on time before June 25 because of COVID-19 related job loss or reduced income will have until December 31 to pay the overdue amount.  If a tenant is under a health protection measure after June 25 that prevents them from leaving their home or hospital, they may accumulate additional rent arrears while subject to a health protection measure but must repay it by December 31.   A tenant who has lost their job or had their income reduced because of COVID-19 will be able to end the tenancy with 30 days’ notice.  A landlord will not be able to enter a rental unit if the residents are under a health protection measure, except for reasons of safety.  The Residential Tenancies Office encourages landlords and tenants to agree on how to repay owed rent. If this is not possible, the parties may work with the Residential Tenancies Office to mediate a repayment plan.   Landlords may apply to the COVID-19 Rent Assist program, which offers a grant of up to 50 per cent of the median rent for an equivalently sized rental unit. The program is in place from April to June 2020. A federal program is also available to help landlords pay their mortgages.           Contact   Matthew Cameron 	Cabinet Communications 	867-393-7136matthew.cameron@gov.yk.ca Bonnie Venton Ross 	Communications, Community Services 	867-332-5513bonnie.ventonross@gov.yk.ca     News release #:   20-171    Related information:   Paying rent, loans or mortgage during COVID-19 COVID-19 information        "

A full list of the orders and legislative changes made under the Civil Emergency Measures Act can be found at yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/covid-19/legislation-changes-covid-19. Guidelines released for visitors at long-term care facilities Outdoor visits for long-term care residents are now permitted with the release of a staged plan for the reopening of long-term care facilities in Yukon to visitors. Currently residents can identify one visitor with whom they can visit in a pre-set outdoor location. The reintroduction of visitors is staged over four phases, similar to the Yukon government’s Path Forward plan. Phase 2 will permit two outdoor visitors at the same time. The territory’s five long-term care homes were closed to all visitors and volunteers on March 16 to avoid introduction of COVID-19 into long-term care homes. In Canada the highest number of deaths is attributed to COVID-19 in nursing and long-term care homes. Bars able to reopen shortly Guidelines for the reopening of bars within the territory have been shared with all proprietors, with the intent of giving them time to prepare for reopening on Friday, June 19. Bars may only open at 50 per cent capacity, the same as restaurants. This is intended to promote physical distancing and limit the size of groups. Groups planning to gather at a bar can be no larger than 10 sitting together. All bars must submit an operational plan to the Health Emergency Operations Centre for approval. Live music will not be permitted at this time and recreation areas such as dart boards, pool tables, dance floors and gaming (such as pinball and video games) are not permitted to open at this time. COVID-19 update As plans for reopening move forward and there is no presence of COVID-19 in Yukon, we are reducing the number of updates. The regular COVID-19 updates will move to once a week beginning Wednesday, June 17, at 2 p.m.      Contact   Aisha Montgomery 	Communications, Community Services 	867-456-6580 Aisha.montgomery@gov.yk.ca Pat Living 	Communications, Health and Social Services 	867-335-1531patricia.living@gov.yk.ca     News release #:   20-170        "

The Yukon Mineral Exploration Program is a funding program designed to support individuals and companies exploring for hard-rock and placer occurrences by shouldering a portion of the risk capital required to explore. The exploration projects funded by the Yukon Mineral Exploration Program are a fundamental step in the early-stage discovery of mineral deposits that can lead to advanced exploration projects and mine development. With this $2.5 million investment by the Government of Yukon the grant recipients will be able to invest more than $8 million in Yukon this season, which will support the economies of Yukon communities.            The Yukon Mineral Exploration Program is key to helping proponents leverage private investment in early stage exploration projects. Our increased investment marks the most funding that has ever been made available through this program in a year when we’ve seen a record number of applicants.  Our government is proud to support local businesses and create jobs for Yukoners at a time when the economy has been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.      Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources Ranj Pillai            Quick facts       It is the responsibility of applicants to ensure that required permitting is in place and work programs comply with the laws of general application, particularly those related to mining, water, notification, land use and environmental regulations.  All companies and individuals exploring in Yukon are also required to comply with COVID-19 related orders that are in place and to follow guidelines that have been established, including the guidelines for travel within Yukon.

117,2020-06-11,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/recycling-services-resume-across-yukon,Government Website,Recycling services resume across Yukon,"           Published 11/06/2020        Joint news release with Raven Recycling Most recycling services across the territory have now resumed after being suspended since March 30. Raven Recycling and many rural recycling and bottle depots are now open during their regular hours. People are encouraged to contact their local depot to confirm, as some rural depots are still working to reopen as quickly as possible. Free stores remain closed until further notice but textile recycling is available at all depots. Neither Raven Recycling nor any of the rural depots will accept Styrofoam, as there is no viable market for that product. Both Raven Recycling and the Government of Yukon are asking people to practise physical distancing at recycling depots and wash their hands before and after their visit to help ensure the depots stay safe. People with large loads of recycling are encouraged to call their local depot before dropping it off. At Raven, people with large loads or people wanting to donate their refundables to a non-profit of their choice should label their bags with their name, contact information and preferred non-profit for donation, if desired. Raven will call them to let them know when their refund is ready. All refundables left at the donation bin at Raven will be shared with Humane Society Yukon. Raven Recycling conducted a survey of 1,300 Whitehorse residents between April 24 and May 4 and found that 90 per cent of people have been storing their refundables, and 68 per cent of people have been storing their non-refundables. Approximately 30 per cent of respondents said they had thrown recycling in the garbage and two per cent said they had burned it. People who could not store all of their recyclables said they chose which materials to keep and which to throw in the garbage, found ways to reuse things like glass or cartons and tried to reduce.            Thank you to everyone who stored their recycling over the past two months in an effort to keep these materials out of the landfill and thank you to those who will start recycling again now that services are open. We encourage everyone to practise physical distancing and hand washing at the depots so we can keep them safe and open for everyone.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            Our temporary closure highlighted the sheer volume of single-use packaging material consumers are forced to deal with. Please voice your support for improvements to how we manage materials, such as tipping fees and producer responsibility programs. Where you can, make the effort to avoid purchasing single-use items, reducing and reusing before you recycle. The satisfaction of reducing your waste is well worth the effort.      Executive Director of Raven Recycling Joy Snyder            Our municipalities appreciate everyone’s patience and cooperation over the past two months. The closure highlighted the value of this service, and our membership is glad to be back offering it to our communities. Please respect the safety of our public works staff and the public by practising social distancing and hand-washing when visiting our recycling centres.      President of the Association of Yukon Communities Gord Curran            Quick facts       All rural depots are open or are working to reopen as soon as possible. Contact your local depot to confirm that services are open before you plan your visit.  Through the month of May, Raven Recycling began re-opening their public drop-off and opened their bottle depot for refunds on May 19. Since June 1, when scrap metal sales opened, all services have resumed.  Tipping fees at Marsh Lake, Mount Lorne, Carcross, Tagish, and Deep Creek will be introduced on August 1, 2020. Find out about tipping fees in rural communities  If you have a large load to drop off, contact Raven Recycling ahead of time at 867-667-7269 or contact your local depot.  To practise physical distancing at Raven Recycling, you can avoid entering the bottle depot by donating your refundables. Leave them outside by the front door and proceeds will be shared with Humane Society Yukon.

As part of A Path Forward: Yukon’s plan for lifting COVID-19 restrictions, initial health and safety guidance for Kindergarten to Grade 12 schools has been developed with Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health to start planning for changes to the operations of Yukon schools for the 2020–21 school year. Health and safety guidelines will be developed before the start of the 2020–21 school year. Each school will determine how it will adjust its operations to meet Yukon’s health and safety guidelines for Kindergarten to Grade 12 schools while meeting the unique needs and context of school communities. School principals and staff will share this information before the start of the 2020–21 school year.            This has been a challenging time for students and families. We know that the longer we are out of regular routines the more mental health and wellness are affected. Planning is well underway to return our students to school in the fall, knowing that schools will be following new guidelines to protect the health and safety of students, school staff and communities.      Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee            Returning students to classes in school is an important part of our return to Yukon’s new normal. Children need to see their teachers and to be with each other in a healthy learning environment. If carefully planned, schools can be safe places to learn even in the presence of COVID.      Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley            Quick facts       Planning for the 2020–21 school year includes flexibility to reduce the number of students in schools if there is an increased risk of transmission or a second wave of the COVID-19 virus; and to supplement in-person classes with other learning opportunities if needed.  Detailed health and safety guidelines for schools will include requirements for hand washing and personal hygiene practices, cleaning and disinfecting, safe spacing through physical distancing and minimizing physical contact, riding the school bus, managing illness and absences and after school and community use.  Other jurisdictions where students have returned to classes in their schools will also be monitored to learn from and adapt to best practices.  Students will be able to ride the school bus to school with new health and safety guidelines that will be developed. Whitehorse parents/guardians should register their child by visiting yukon.ca/en/bus by June 19. Rural parents and guardians should contact their school directly to ask about busing.  The Government of Yukon released A Path Forward: Yukon’s plan for lifting COVID-19 restrictions on May 15, 2020 and is on track to enter Phase 2 of the plan on July 1.  On April 7, 2020, the Government of Yukon announced the suspension of face-to face classes in Yukon schools for the remainder of the 2019–20 school year.

121,2020-06-05,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/june-5-2020-covid-19-update,Government Website,"June 5, 2020: COVID-19 update","           Published 05/06/2020        The Government of Yukon has the following updates on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 case count As of today, June 5, at 2 p.m. the COVID-19 case count remains at 11 in the territory. All of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered. There are no active cases in the territory and 1,201 people have been tested. We have had no new cases since April 20. Updated guidance for critical and essential service workers released The Government of Yukon’s guidance for critical and essential workers has been updated this week to provide greater clarity to workers delivering critical and essential services in the territory between now and July 1, 2020. After July 1, 2020, restrictions will be eased for critical and essential workers entering Yukon from BC. The updated guidance document clarifies that the restrictions of gatherings to 10 people does not apply to workplaces, that people who need to do urgent repairs or maintenance on infrastructure are considered critical workers, as are judges, witnesses and other individuals necessary to carry out the rule of law. The updated document also clarifies that all of Yukon’s communities – whether Whitehorse or rural – should be treated similarly by people who need to come to Yukon to work from outside the territory. The guidance document is in effect immediately and only applies to the current phase of our approach to the pandemic. Further changes to this document may arise once we enter Phase II of our plan to lift COVID-19 restrictions. Updates to A Path Forward: Yukon’s plan for lifting COVID-19 restrictions Following the announcement about the anticipated start of Phase II on July 1, Yukon’s plan for lifting COVID-19 restrictions has been updated to include specific dates and new timelines. The latest version of the plan can be found online at https://yukon.ca/covid-19 and will be updated periodically as we progress through the phases of the plan. Faith-based services Beginning this Sunday, June 7, places of worship will be permitted to open. Service organizers and attendees are required to adopt steps to ensure physical distancing, even adapting the nature of their services where necessary. This means, for example, that the seating capacity of indoor venues will be limited to one third of the building capacity up to a maximum of 50 people including service leaders and organizers. Leaders and organizers must also increase the frequency of cleaning and disinfecting common, high-touch areas such as seating, railings, switched and ceremonial objects. Organizers are required to complete an operational plan that must be produced if requested. It does not need to be approved in advance. The guidance for faith-based services and activities is now online at Yukon.ca. Mental health resources Yukon has a wide range of mental health support. list of the resources is available on the Yukon.ca website at: https://yukon.ca/en/health-and-wellness/mental-wellness-support-during-covid-19 These resources are provided by the Yukon government, First Nations governments, the federal government and the non-governmental organization (NGO) community. The majority of these supports remain available during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some services have been altered to comply with the orders and recommendations of the Chief Medical Officer of Health. This list is not comprehensive and the provision of services will change depending on which phase Yukon is at based on the plan for management of the COVID-19 pandemic level in Yukon, including plans to lift restrictions. These resources have been collected and organized by population to make it easier for health care providers, NGOs and anyone supporting the health and wellness of Yukoners, so identify the appropriate resources. Accessing Opioid Treatment Services during COVID-19 Opioid Treatment Services and support are available to anyone who feels a need to discuss or address their opioid use, especially considering the increased stressors many are under due to COVID-19. The medical community is expressing concerns over the lack of safe supply. This may encourage people to seek treatment over fears that the drugs they normally use may not be available or are unsafe to use and that some individuals may be using more at this time as a coping mechanism.  Opioid treatment includes access to prescription medications such as suboxone and methadone used to treat opioid use disorder. If people are unsure if treatment is right for them, they are encouraged to come in and have a conversation with a clinician about what options are available and what treatment might look like. Opioid Treatment Services operate out of the Referred Care Clinic at 210 Elliott Street in Whitehorse. Normally these are drop-in services but because of COVID-19, the public is being asked to call first and make an appointment.

123,2020-06-05,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/applications-special-guide-licence-lottery-open-june-5,Government Website,Applications for Special Guide Licence lottery to open June 5,"           Published 05/06/2020        Yukon resident hunters can apply for a Special Guide Licence (SGL) from June 5 to 18, 2020. A Yukon resident with a valid big game hunting licence who obtains an SGL may guide a non-resident Canadian hunter for moose, caribou or bison. They may also apply for weighting only, which will improve their chances in future SGL lotteries.  All hunters must follow the latest orders and recommendations from the Chief Medical Officer of Health when planning their hunt, including the Travel within Yukon guidelines. Non-residents who are not already in the territory are advised they will need to comply with border restrictions and self-isolation requirements. This year, successful applicants can decline having a licence issued if the non-resident is unable to enter Yukon due to travel restrictions. Successful applicants will be notified by email and must then request their SGL licence to be issued by contacting the Department of Environment. Once a licence is issued, it cannot be returned. Successful applicants should confirm that the non-resident hunter is eligible to enter Yukon in advance of requesting the issuance of licences. If the successful applicants do not request and obtain their licences, both applicants will be eligible to apply for the lottery next year and appropriate weighting will be applied to the resident’s licencing history. There are 125 special guide licences available and hunters can apply online.            Outdoor recreation is important for Yukoners’ mental and physical health and wellness at all times, including during this pandemic. This year’s Special Guide Licence lottery will provide non-residents who are staying with family in Yukon an opportunity to hunt and potentially provide high-quality food for their family. As always, hunters should take only what they need, be respectful of the land and other hunters, and use all that they take, but they should also take extra precautions and follow the latest public health recommendations to ensure a safe and responsible hunting season.      Minister of Environment Pauline Frost            Quick facts       Non-residents who are not already in Yukon need to carefully consider border restrictions. Entry to Yukon is currently only permitted for residents, family members of residents, people delivering critical or essential services, travelers transiting through Yukon to a neighbouring jurisdiction, and people exercising an Aboriginal or treaty right. Non-residents may be denied entry to Yukon.  The SGL lottery application deadline is June 18 at 4 p.m.  Hunting season for moose and caribou opens August 1, 2020. Bison can be hunted in different areas at two times during the fall and winter: September 1 to October 31, 2020, and November 1 to March 31, 2021.

124,2020-06-04,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/support-restaurants-announced,Government Website,Support for restaurants announced,"           Published 04/06/2020        Restaurants and other businesses with a liquor licence are receiving support from the Government of Yukon. Liquor licensees will now receive a discount of 25 per cent off the retail price for liquor. This discount will be applied for the duration of restrictions requiring restaurants to open at half their usual capacity, which began on May 29. Licensees will also receive a 50 per cent refund of this year’s licence fee because of the closure requirements for restaurants and bars. These measures to support Yukon licencees are based on recommendations from the Business Advisory Council. Additional measures to support Yukon licencees include deferring updates to the wholesale price list until October 1, 2020 and temporarily waiving the re-stocking fee for all liquor licensees when returning unsold liquor to the Corporation. The Yukon Liquor Corporation has also worked with the Liquor Board to support off-premise licensees, and extend hours and provide additional flexibility in the space and footprint requirements of restaurants.            Yukon’s restaurants are facing multiple challenges in reopening their businesses. Most have suffered from significant loss of revenue during the last two months. These new measures will help reduce the costs of reopening and support the local economy in these difficult times. I would like to thank the Business Advisory Council for providing constructive suggestions to support Yukon restaurants and their dedicated staff.

This summer, a signalized intersection will be built at the Hillcrest intersection to improve safety for pedestrians and cyclists. The contract also includes a new paved multi-use trail along the highway which will connect to the City of Whitehorse’s growing trail network. Additional through lanes and dedicated turn lanes will also be added to improve the flow of traffic and reduce the likelihood of collisions. The Government of Yukon will continue to monitor how these upgrades enhance safety for all road users. Construction is expected to begin in June.            The Alaska Highway is a critical for all of Yukon’s road users and these improvements will substantially improve safety. This contract also provides another example of a local company playing a role in keeping Yukon’s economy on track while improving the lives of Yukoners.      Minister of Highways and Public Works Richard Mostyn            Quick facts       The Yukon Environmental and Socio-economic Assessment Board has recommended that the Alaska Highway Safety Improvement project be allowed to proceed as proposed.  The project will be completed in three phases. This contract is broken down into two phases.  Phase 1 between Lodestar Lane and Hillcrest Drive will start this June and end in fall 2020. Phase 2 is from Hillcrest Drive to Burns Road and will start in summer 2021 and end in fall 2021.  Phase 3 will take place the following summer as a new tender/contract. The full project (three phases) will be completed in fall 2022.   Uncontrolled road accesses along the highway will also be closed in an effort to improve safety and reduce motor vehicle collisions.

The new acquisitions are the work of Yukon artists Justin Apperley, Audrey and Karrie Brown, Kimberly Edgar, Vashti Etzel, Violet Gatensby, Hannah Jickling and Valerie Salez, Daphne Mennell, Roland Peters, Monika Käte Steputh and Eugene Alfred. The selected works showcase an array of stylistic approaches and themes and represent a wide range of media including carving, photography, painting, beadwork, knife making and even snow shovelling. The pieces were selected through the annual call for submissions process held by the Yukon government and the Friends of Yukon Permanent Art Collection (FOYPAC). Selections were made from 129 submissions by 58 artists. A public exhibition to officially unveil the new artwork will be held this fall.            Each of these 11 new additions to the Yukon Permanent Art Collection represents an important verse in the rich story of visual art in our territory. We are thankful for the gifts of hope and beauty these works bring us in our challenging new reality. Congratulations to the artists on this achievement, and our thanks for adding their voice and considerable talents to this invaluable collection.      Minister of Tourism and Culture Jeanie Dendys            The annual call for submissions is always an exciting process. The response this year was impressive, and the selected works reflect the diverse skills and unique vision of both emerging and established Yukon artists. This year’s acquisitions are also notable because for the first time since we began the annual call for submissions in 2008, all of the selected artists are from communities outside of Whitehorse. We're excited to welcome these exceptional pieces from throughout our territory into the collection.          Friends of Yukon Permanent Art Collection President Katie Newman            I am thankful that my grandma took the time to pass down her beading skills so that I could create what is now considered an art piece, and am honoured to join both her and my father in Yukon's permanent collection.      Artist Karrie Brown            Quick facts       The new acquisitions were selected by the Friends of Yukon Permanent Art Collection (FOYPAC) through an arms-length adjudication process. FOYPAC is a non-profit society made up of artists, art professionals and community members dedicated to the continued growth of the collection.  Works from the collection are displayed in public areas of government buildings in Whitehorse, Dawson, Faro, Haines Junction and Mayo. They are also periodically displayed in special curated exhibitions produced by Tourism and Culture’s Arts Section or through loans to other institutions.  There are currently more than 450 art works by more than 240 artists in the collection.  The deadline and parameters for the 2021 call for submissions will be announced later this year.

127,2020-06-03,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/yukon-recognizes-one-year-anniversary-release-national-inquirys-final-report,Government Website,Yukon recognizes the one-year anniversary of release of National Inquiry’s Final Report,"           Published 03/06/2020        Today, June 3, marks the one-year anniversary of the formal release of the final report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two Spirited individuals (MMIWG2S+): “Reclaiming Power and Place”. The Final Report comprises the truths of more than 2,380 family members, survivors of violence, experts and Knowledge Keepers gathered from two years of public hearings and evidence gathering. It delivers 231 individual Calls for Justice directed at governments, institutions, social service providers, industries and all Canadians. Last year, the Yukon Advisory Committee (YAC) on MMIWG developed a first draft of the Yukon Strategy on MMIWG2S+ based on the National Inquiry’s Calls for Justice, a review of other national and territorial reports, and recommendations from past gatherings of MMIWG2S+ family members. This long-term strategy will represent a whole of Yukon approach, outlining specific action plans and roles for all stakeholders and all Yukoners to play. Minister Jeanie Dendys, as a co-chair of the committee, has engaged with 12 First Nations and five municipal governments to discuss their feedback and participation in the strategy. Unfortunately, the realities of COVID-19 delayed meeting with the remaining First Nations and municipal governments in person, so those meetings will take place virtually. In recognition of the valuable expertise and experience of family members of MMIWG2S+, the strategy will keep the voices of families at the centre. Although a large gathering of family members scheduled for March 21 to 22 had to be cancelled, input into the strategy will still be coordinated through small and virtual gatherings in the coming months.  The final document will then be shared with all stakeholders for signing. The Yukon Advisory Committee had hoped to have finalized Yukon’s MMIWG2S+ Strategy before reaching the milestone of the first anniversary of the release of the National Inquiry’s final report. COVID-19 delayed progress in meeting that goal, but Yukoners should rest assured that the committee is still moving forward with this important work and will create a whole of Yukon strategy that will change the story for Indigenous women, girls and LGBTQ2S+ Yukoners.            It has been an honour to co-chair the Yukon Advisory Committee on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women, Girls and Two Spirited individuals, to lead this work and be in a position of leadership in the last few years. I look forward to working with all stakeholders to finalize this strategy and begin the work ahead to create an inclusive and safe community for all Yukoners.      Minister responsible for the Women’s Directorate, Jeanie Dendys            I am excited to be working in partnership with all Yukoners to take a decolonized approach to addressing MMIWG2S+ that puts their families and survivors at the forefront, and highlights the Yukon's greatest strength: working together.        Ann Maje Raider, Liard Aboriginal Women’s Society            There is a need for collaboration in this work. The Yukon Strategy on MMIWG2S+ must be based in our relationships, and strengthened by our ability to rely on each other to identify the problems and solutions together.      Chief Doris Bill, Kwanlin Dun First Nation            Quick facts       The Yukon Advisory Committee originally came together four years ago to support the National Inquiry and the families’ participation, promote information sharing, and plan collaborative action.  This group includes representatives of Indigenous women’s organizations and families of MMIWG. There are three co-chairs: Minister Jeanie Dendys, Chief Doris Bill and Ann Maje Raider.

Graduation is such an important milestone for every student, their families and their school communities. It is a time to celebrate dedication and achievement in learning. It marks the transition into next the stage of life, continuing to the next level at school, starting postsecondary studies or embarking on a career. As you all know, formal graduation ceremonies have been postponed and Yukon schools are determining when they can safely hold formal cap and gown celebrations. Until then, students, parents, families, principals, teachers, graduation committees, Yukon First Nations and Yukon University have found alternative ways to honour and celebrate the accomplishments of all Yukon graduating students. Thank you all for the community spirit you have shown. Your creativity, ability to adapt and imaginations are a positive example and let our graduates know how much you care.    Yukon Graduate Day is an opportunity for Yukoners to celebrate the accomplishments and success of Yukon graduating students. It allows us to come together to celebrate, support and recognize the incredible resiliency, perseverance and optimism that Yukon students and graduates have shown during their learning journeys. The Government of Yukon is pleased to recognize the many accomplishments of this year’s graduates on Yukon Graduate Day.

Eligible families will receive an additional $250 to $400 per month to help pay for supports, as there has been a significant reduction of services available in the community due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Community supports and services that are typically available include schools, day programs and recreation facilities. These facilities are currently unavailable or more difficult to access. Funding can help pay for services such as respite care, child care or housekeeping, or for specialized equipment or supplies. This additional funding will be provided from June to August 2020.            This funding will reduce stress and financial burdens for families supporting children, youth or an adult with a disability who are being disproportionally impacted by the reduction of community support during the COVID-19 crisis. Many of the typical supports families rely on have not been available. This temporary funding will help them through this challenging time.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Quick facts       Disability Services provides supports to people with disabilities and their families or caregivers.

Premier Silver and Dr. Hanley confirmed that if conditions continue trending positively Yukon is on track to begin Phase II on July 1. Since the transition to Phase I of A Path Forward: Yukon’s plan for lifting COVID-19 restrictions on May 15, Yukoners have seen a gradual shift in COVID-19 related restrictions. This includes the reopening of personal services, dine-in restaurants opening at 50 per cent capacity and day cares, day camps and recreational centres approved to operate. New guidelines are in place effective today that describe how to travel responsibly within Yukon and respect the wishes of communities and First Nations. Next week, territorial parks and campgrounds will open for the summer. Once the transition to Phase II begins, additional restrictions will be lifted throughout July. This includes lifting travel restrictions between Yukon and British Columbia, which will allow for the free movement of Yukon and BC residents back and forth, with no requirement for 14-day self-isolation. Decisions about how and when to move forwards or backwards through each phase of the plan continue to be guided by careful risk assessments and the six “criteria for transitioning between phases” including community engagement and public health capacity such as the capacity to contact trace and maintain fast testing turn around time. Monitoring the status of the virus in neighbouring jurisdictions will continue to determine if it is safe to further lift restrictions. British Columbia has seen a significant decrease in cases of COVID-19 and continued progress containing the virus and flattening the curve, paving the way for the gradual lifting of some border restrictions. Visit Yukon.ca for regular updates. If you have additional questions, you can email covid19info@gov.yk.ca or call the COVID-19 information line at 877-374-0425 between 7:30 a.m. and 8 p.m. seven days a week.            We recognize the impact that COVID-19 restrictions are having on our physical, emotional and economic wellbeing and are striving to reach the proper balance between public safety and Yukoners’ desire to resume their lives. We are confident in our health care capacity, our ability to test and our ability to track and contain this virus. It is that confidence, and all the skills we have gained in the past two months, that allow us to begin moving into Phase II of this plan.      Premier Sandy Silver             British Columbia has shown great success in managing COVID-19 within the province and based on their epidemiology, and ours, I am confident that this is a safe way for us to progress as we transition out of our cocoon. Looking at our overall health, I believe this is the right choice for the territory.      Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley            Quick facts       All employers are now required to complete a COVID-19 Operational Plan to identify hazards and mitigate risks for staff and the public.  Any organization wishing to have the plans of their event or activity reviewed by public health professionals can submit the details using an online form.  Restaurants can now offer dine-in services with an approved COVID-19 Operational Plan.  Territorial campgrounds will open on June 4.  Yukoners may responsibly travel within Yukon communities as long as they take precautions and respect the wishes of municipal and First Nations governments. You may shop in local stores and buy food in restaurants if they are open for your business.  There have been no new cases of COVID-19 in Yukon since April 20, 2020. In total, Yukon has seen 11 cases of COVID-19, all of which have recovered.  If restrictions had not been put in place, Yukon could have experienced upwards of 2,500 cases of COVID-19 according to modelling developed by the Health Emergency Operations Centre.  Until there is a vaccine or effective and accessible treatments identified, measures will need to remain in place to limit the risk of infection in Yukon.  The six steps to staying safe are: physical distancing; regular hand washing; staying home when sick; not gathering in groups of more than 10; limiting travel to communities and self-isolating when required.  With no new cases since April 20, Yukon remains one of the least restricted parts of the country. A Path Forward is a gradual and phased approach to easing current restrictions in the territory.

The RAC was established to respond to the need for respiratory illness assessment, high rates of influenza and COVID-19 testing outside of the acute care system and at Yukon Communicable Disease. The centre was open to individuals who had travelled and were experiencing symptoms, and also to members of the general public who were experiencing symptoms of respiratory illness. With physicians’ offices closed to most in-person visits, the RAC was designated as the location for testing.            The RAC currently sees an average of five patients daily, influenza season has peaked and the COVID-19 risk in Yukon is currently low. Therefore, these small volumes of patients can be easily absorbed by the emergency department, with persons with a travel history or contacts still being screened at Yukon Communicable Disease Control. The RAC has effectively supported Yukon’s efforts to assess and test for COVID-19 and limit the spread of infection in the territory.      Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Brendan Hanley            Thank you to everyone who worked together to get the Respiratory Assessment Centre up and running so quickly and a big thank you to the front line workers who screened and tested the hundreds of Yukoners who used the RAC. We are lucky in the territory that our public health measures are working. If the RAC is needed again, we are poised to have it set up within one day.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost             Quick facts       The Respiratory Assessment Centre operated out of the Yukon Convention Centre on Fourth Avenue in Whitehorse.  During the 70 days of operation, it assessed more than 400 individuals; more than 225 of those were tested for COVID-19.  Currently we have a total 13 staff, two nurse practitioners and 13 physicians on contract working at the RAC. Daily we have between five to six staff, one nurse practitioner and one physician working.  Individuals who are returning from travel outside Yukon and experience symptoms should contact 811.

All orders and recommendations issued by Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health apply in territorial parks and campgrounds. Non-residents who are required by law to travel through Yukon within 24 hours cannot stay or stop in government-run campgrounds. Those required to self-isolate may not do so in territorial parks or campgrounds. Existing rules for campground reservations remain in place. Camping permits for Yukon residents are now available online or from vendors.

COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, May 26, at 2 p.m. the case count remains at 11 cases of COVID-19 in the territory. All of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered. There are no active cases in the territory and 1,159 people have been tested. We have had no new cases since April 20. We have traced each case in Yukon so far to its origin which means there continues to be no known community spread in the territory. We assume community spread has occurred when we can no longer trace how somebody became infected. Weekday updates We update information about COVID-19 cases and tests every weekday on Yukon.ca, except public holidays. The information we publish includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered. Today’s update focusses on the modelling work being done within the CMOH office. Copies of this technical briefing presentation are available here. Single site survey  To address the potential risk of COVID-19 transmission from the movement of staff, volunteers and contractors between certain facilities, such as long term care facilities, and other volunteer and employment settings, the Chief Medical Officer of Health will collect information to identify where there is cross over. As Yukon prepares to shift into a new phase of the pandemic response it, may be necessary to restrict movement of certain employees between facilities and other employment types in order to lessen the risk of COVID-19 transmission in these facilities. The goal of this project is to ensure the continuity of services and to protect the health of residents and employees in facilities, while mitigating impacts on operations and on affected staff. All information is being collected through a secure on-line portal and in accordance with applicable Yukon privacy legislation. Day camps/Canada Games Centre Since the publication of the guidelines for summer day camps, City of Whitehorse camps and Polarettes have had their plans okayed. Additional plans are being reviewed this week. . The phased in reopening of the Canada Games Centres has also been approved.

These volunteer paramedics go above and beyond the call of duty, even responding to serious incidents outside of their scheduled hours. We thank them for their dedication, hard work, and giving their time to support their communities.

135,2020-05-25,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/statement-minister-tourism-and-culture-jeanie-dendys-national-tourism-week,Government Website,Statement from Minister of Tourism and Culture Jeanie Dendys on National Tourism Week,"           Published 25/05/2020        Minister of Tourism and Culture Jeanie Dendys has issued the following statement to mark the kick-off of the 2020 National Tourism Week. As we mark this year’s National Tourism Week, the tourism industry finds itself facing a new and very challenging global landscape. The past several years of banner growth and development, ground-breaking partnerships and the focused vision of the Yukon Tourism Development Strategy have been an exciting and optimistic time. This has all been interrupted by the global pandemic, but I am so impressed with how the tourism sector has responded to lend a hand. Airlines have safely transported family members home to care for loved ones. Our hotels have housed those who needed a safe place to self-isolate. Restaurants have adapted delivery and pickup services to provide quality meals within the new social distancing policies. This spirit of ingenuity and hospitality is as much a part of what draws visitors from across the world as our incredible wilderness, vibrant culture and fascinating history. This Tourism Week, I ask Yukoners to reflect on the fact that Tourism is Community. Tourism has reliably been Yukon’s largest private sector employer and second-largest economic driver. It fosters cultural appreciation, supports diversity and contributes to rural economic sustainability. It is powered by Yukoners proud of their home and the stories and experiences that live here. However, there is no way around it: for the time being, Yukon is not receiving visitors. We are instead telling travellers both here in the Yukon and from outside the territory to Wait for Someday, and to Explore Yukon Later. But welcoming visitors is intrinsic to who we are as a people. Yukoners always roll out the welcome mat. As our government gradually eases health and travel restrictions and as the tourism sector plans for its recovery, this work will be done in the same spirit of collaboration and engagement that led us to the Yukon Tourism Development Strategy. This values-based plan was built with the following at its core:  Love our Yukon → Encourage a thriving tourism sector → Preserve and enjoy our natural environment → Honour our heritage → Celebrate our cultures → Build healthy communities → Develop partnerships → Foster innovation   As we chart our path forward and navigate the new normal, please join me in celebrating our community and the tourism sector’s significant contribution to our lives here in the Yukon. These are difficult times for tourism, no question, but I know we will rebound stronger than ever, thanks to the talents, skills and pride of our community partners in Yukon’s tourism sector.

Civil Emergency Measures Act new Order A new health order was issued today under the Civil Emergency Measures Act. This Order allows the Minister of Community Services in consultation with the Chief Medical Officer of Health to review and approve variations to the requirements and restrictions in the existing orders. This will provide more flexibility as we move forward with the reopening plan so that services such as hair salons and dine-in restaurants can resume. It also allows the Government of Yukon to respond quickly and close services if we see a spike in COVID-19 cases or community spread of the virus in the territory. Child care services Licensed child care operators can now provide child care for the children of all Yukon families, rather than only for vulnerable families and the families of critical and essential workers. Child care operators can also return to their pre-COVID-19 enrolment numbers and are now following the new guidelines for operating child care centres during COVID-19. Inspectors are working with child care operators to determine when they can return to their normal licensing capacity. Restaurants From May 29, restaurants can again provide dine-in services, as long as they have developed a COVID-19 operational plan to keep staff and customers safe and the government has approved the plan. Restaurants have been able to continue providing take-out services throughout the pandemic. Personal services Personal services businesses can reopen on May 27 as long as they have developed a COVID-19 operational plan and it has been approved by the government. Personal services businesses include hair salons, barber shops, tattoo parlours, nail salons and non-registered massage therapists. We ask Yukoners to be patient and give businesses the time they need to get ready to provide services again after their complete closure. COVID-19 operational plan template All businesses, service providers and employers need to have a COVID-19 operational plan in place even if they were not mandated to close under the Civil Emergency Measures Act. They don’t need to have the plan approved in order to operate but need to have it available for inspection by the government. The template for COVID-19 operational plans is on Yukon.ca. As and when the government lifts restrictions on types of businesses currently mandated to close under the Civil Emergency Measures Act those businesses must complete a COVID-19 operational plan and have it approved by the government before they can reopen. Recreational programming COVID-19 review form Event planners and recreational programmers should develop a COVID-19 plan and get it approved by public health officials. The online form is on the “Request a review of business, service or event operations during COVID-19 page” of Yukon.ca.

143,2020-05-19,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/may-19-2020-covid-19-update,Government Website,"May 19, 2020: COVID-19 update","           Published 19/05/2020        Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley has the following updates for the Yukon public on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, May 19, at 2 p.m. the case count remains at 11 cases of COVID-19 in the territory. All of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered. There are no active cases in the territory and 1,134 people have been tested. We have had no new cases since April 20. We have traced each case in Yukon so far to its origin which means there continues to be no known community spread in the territory. We assume community spread has occurred when we can no longer trace how somebody became infected. Weekday updates We update information about COVID-19 cases and tests every weekday on Yukon.ca, except public holidays. The information we publish includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered. Combined households As from May 15, 2020, the territory is now in Phase 1 of the Government of Yukon’s reopening plan, A Path Forward. This means we can all now choose one other household to join up with and not have to practise physical distancing with people in that household. Once we’ve chosen a household to pair with we cannot change to another pairing. It's acceptable if the number of people in the two households is more than 10 but we must continue to avoid gathering in social groups of more than 10 other than that. We must also continue to keep a physical distance of two metres (six feet) from anyone not in our two households. There’s more information in the combined household guidelines on Yukon.ca. Reopening businesses and services Being in Phase 1 of the reopening plan means that businesses and service providers that weren’t ordered to close may operate as long as they have a COVID-19 operational plan and have put safety precautions in place. Recreational programming such as sporting events and day camps are possible but organizers need to have an approved plan in place. Businesses such as personal services and restaurants that were ordered to close will be able to open up again once they’ve prepared operational plans based on the guidelines we’re developing and had them approved. Restaurants can meanwhile continue to provide take-out and delivery services but must submit an operational plan to the government by May 29. Guidelines for those restaurants planning to restore table service will be available in coming days. All  other employers are also required to complete COVID-19 operational plans and have them available for inspection but these don’t need to be submitted for approval. Businesses, employers and event organizers can find more information about the steps they need to take and where to send their plans for review or approval on the “Operating businesses, services and events safely during COVID-19” page of Yukon.ca. As soon as we complete guidelines we publish them on the “Guidelines and recommendations” page of Yukon.ca. A change to the six steps to staying safe   Now that we’re in Phase 1, we’ve changed our guidance that said avoid travel to communities to instead asking people to limit travel to communities. Communities are particularly vulnerable during the pandemic and we ask Yukoners to travel within the territory as respectfully and safely as possible.  The updated six steps to staying safe and stopping the spread of COVID-19 are: physical distancing; regular hand washing; staying home when sick; not gathering in groups of more than 10; limiting travel to communities and self-isolating when required. Moving through reopening phases We’ll make decisions about moving to the next phase of the reopening plan in a gradual, cautious and objective way with at least two to four weeks between each phase. This means we’ll have time to detect changes in the pandemic situation and evaluate the risks of the steps we’ve taken so far and how safe it is to move to the next stage. This is why we’re not committing to fixed dates. We’ll keep Yukoners informed at every step of the way. The six criteria we’re basing our decisions on are: community engagement, preventative measures, public health capacity, importation risk, health system capacity, and virus spread and containment. The Government of Yukon will make decisions in consultation with Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health. The phases of the plan are: Phase 1 – restart; Phase 2 – recover; and Phase 3 – new normal. We also have Phase 0: response, which is the phase we were in until May 15 and, to be prepared in case the situation in Yukon backtracks and we need to impose restrictions again, we also have a Phase minus 1 – worsened state. The full plan is published on Yukon.ca. Victim Services We recognize that staying home during the pandemic is not safe for everyone. Support is available for anyone who’s not safe at home because of partner violence, family violence or sexualized violence. Victim Services can work with people to explore options based on their circumstances, help them make a safety plan and access safe shelter if they need it. To contact Victim Services, call toll free 1-800-661-0408, extension 8500. Staff at the Women’s Transition home in Whitehorse, the Dawson Women’s Shelter or Help and Hope for families in Watson Lake can also help. If anyone needs immediate help they should call 9-1-1.

145,2020-05-15,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/plan-ease-covid-19-restrictions-released-start-phase-i,Government Website,Plan to ease COVID-19 restrictions released with start of Phase I,"           Published 15/05/2020        The Government of Yukon and the Chief Medical Officer of Health have released A Path Forward: Yukon’s plan for lifting COVID-19 restrictions. A Path Forward presents a gradual and phased approach to lifting COVID-19 restrictions, with a focus on protecting communities and vulnerable residents, and on preventing the re-introduction and spread of COVID-19 in Yukon. The plan lays out the principles that will guide decisions on easing restrictions. They are based on public health advice and best practices across Canada adapted to fit Yukon’s local context. Phase I: Restart of A Path Forward begins today, following the easing of certain restrictions already announced during the previous “response phase” of the plan. The easing of restrictions is spread out over a number of phases. Moving to subsequent phases depends on meeting a set of clear criteria and conditions, including community engagement; keeping the ”6 steps to staying safe” preventative measures in place; controlling importation risk through border restrictions; maintaining health system and public health capacity; and continuing close monitoring of the current spread of the virus in and outside Yukon. Decisions around the timing for moving between phases in the plan will depend on risk assessment and the ongoing evaluation of success in maintaining stability and security at each phase. Continued border controls are a key part of the plan. With no active cases in the territory, importation of COVID-19 remains Yukon’s greatest risk. By mitigating that risk and helping to ensure that COVID-19 does not enter the territory, it will be easier to relax restrictions for residents inside the territory. The Government of Yukon will continue to meet with First Nations governments and municipal governments to discuss the public health details and collaborate on the other aspects of the plan and ongoing response to COVID-19. Regular updates will continue to be posted on Yukon.ca. Information is also available by calling the COVID-19 InfoLine at 877-374-0425 (7:30 a.m. to 8 p.m, seven days a week) or emailing covid19info@gov.yk.ca.            As we look to ease restrictions in Yukon, it is paramount that we do so in a way that keeps our communities safe and healthy. A Path Forward outlines our plan to get Yukoners moving again as quickly and safely as possible while protecting our communities and our most vulnerable residents. We will continue to support Yukon families and businesses through each phase of this plan as we work towards revitalizing our territory.      Premier Sandy Silver             We are in a much better place than so many of our fellow Canadians and the fact that we are able to move towards reopening is because of our successes. We were able to close our borders, self-isolate returning Yukoners and our citizens have embraced the safe six. We need to continue to do this so we can stay safe from the pandemic.      Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley            Quick facts       With no new cases since April 20, Yukon remains one of the least restricted parts of the country. A Path Forward is a gradual and phased approach to easing current restrictions in the territory.  All employers are now required to complete a COVID-19 Operational Plan to identify hazards and mitigate risks for staff and the public.  Any organization wishing to have the plans of their event or activity reviewed by public health professionals can submit the details using an online form.  Restaurants will continue to be restricted to take-out only pending additional public health assessment and the development of an approved COVID-19 Operational Plan by restaurant operators.  Territorial campgrounds are on track to open on June 4 but remain closed at this time.  There have been no new cases of COVID-19 in Yukon since April 20, 2020. In total, Yukon has seen 11 cases of COVID-19, all of which have recovered.  If restrictions had not been put in place, Yukon could have experienced upwards of 2,500 cases of COVID-19 according to modelling developed by the Health Emergency Operations Centre.  Until there is a vaccine or effective and accessible treatments identified, measures will need to remain in place to limit the risk of infection in Yukon.  The ”6 steps to staying safe” are: physical distancing; regular hand washing; staying home when sick; not gathering in groups of more than 10; limiting travel to communities and self-isolating when required.

The full name of the school and community centre will be Le Centre scolaire secondaire communautaire Paul-Émile Mercier in French or The Paul-Émile Mercier Secondary School Community Centre in English; CSSC Mercier for short. The name was proposed by Vincent Bélanger as part of a competition launched by the Commission scolaire francophone du Yukon (CSFY) with the Yukon Francophone community and students from École Émilie-Tremblay and Académie Parhélie. The name was selected as part of the competition and Vincent will receive an award of $100.00 for submitting the name Paul-Émile Mercier.             I am honoured to join the Commission scolaire francophone du Yukon in announcing the name for the new French First Language Secondary School. Paul-Émile Mercier’s legacy as an engineer and professor will inspire generations of Yukon students on their learning journey. Congratulations to Vincent Bélanger for making a great suggestion.      Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee            The CSFY and the Yukon francophone community are proud to be able to associate the name of Paul-Émile Mercier with the new secondary school community centre. This is a wonderful way to pay tribute to this Francophone who left his mark on the Yukon and who contributed to the creation of our cultural heritage. Through his contribution to the economic and social vitality of the territory, Paul-Émile Mercier is a model of involvement for our community. In addition, his career as a university professor reflects his interest in sharing knowledge, which makes him an inspiring choice for a school and for the education of our students.      President of the Commission scolaire francophone du Yukon Jean-Sébastien Blais            Our family is sincerely honoured that the new secondary school community centre in Whitehorse is named after our ancestor Paul-Émile Mercier. Marie-Louise Taché and Paul-Émile Mercier were married in Yukon and we are extremely proud of these roots.

Backgrounder   About Paul-Émile Mercier Paul-Émile Mercier was born in 1877. Son of Virginie Saint-Denis and Honoré Mercier, former Premier of Quebec, Paul-Émile left his mark in Yukon as an engineer. He helped develop Yukon's transportation system in the early 20th century.  In 1901, he married Marie-Louise Taché in Whitehorse. In 1903, Mercier became director of the Department of Public Works in Whitehorse. His work led him to move around the territory. Among other things, he directed work at the Five Finger Rapids to make them less dangerous for navigators.  Returning east with his wife, he held a position as chief engineer for the city of Montréal from 1914 to 1919. Mercier's name is associated with several important functions: major in the army, land surveyor, professor at the École Polytechnique de Montréal, not to mention his participation as a member of numerous societies and associations. Paul-Émile Mercier died on August 24, 1926, at the age of 49. Paul-Émile Mercier is the great-grandfather of the Honourable Thomas Mulcair, who served as the leader of the New Democratic Party in Canada from 2012 to 2017. Construction project of the CSSC Mercier In April 2019, Ketza Construction began construction on the Riverdale Education Reserve. The new school, which will accommodate up to 150 students, will offer programming for French First Language students in Grades 7 to 12. It will provide a rich and stimulating environment that will inspire students to develop their full potential for years to come.  The initial deadline for completion was summer 2020, followed by a final phase to fit-up and commission the building. Due to COVID-19, the date of entry of students is still to be determined and will be shared once available. Funding for the project includes $7.5 million from the Government of Canada and its Official Languages Support Program. These funds finance community spaces, which will be shared with the community and other students on the campus. It includes spaces for a multi-purpose room, a community radio station, a community kitchen and an atrium to host a variety of activities and events. The CSFY provides monthly updates on the progress of construction on its website and on social networks. The Government of Yukon also updates an online page to keep the community informed.

We know that Yukoners are concerned about the possibility of importing COVID-19 to the territory. Strong measures at our borders reduce the risk within the Yukon.  Our efforts to provide information and education about the CEMA Orders have been very successful in achieving compliance and understanding, ensuring that both Yukoners and people entering the territory follow the guidance that COVID-19 has made necessary. We will continue to work with our community partners to keep our territory safe and healthy.       Minister of Community Services John Streicker            Quick facts       A new information station will be set up at the Alaska Highway junction with Robert Service Way south of Whitehorse.

The meeting focused on how the governments can work together to respond to and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Leaders discussed health and social supports, the economy, education, treaty rights, and Yukon’s comprehensive reopening strategy, which will be unveiled tomorrow.            Close communication between governments is absolutely critical as we navigate Yukon through this pandemic. The respectful relationships we have built with our First Nations partners through the Yukon Forum have put us in a very strong position to respond collaboratively to keep Yukoners safe. This was a timely meeting to discuss how we will work together to prevent the spread of this virus, support citizens and plan for economic recovery.      Premier Sandy Silver            Keeping our communities and citizens safe is the top concern among Yukon First Nations leaders. Today, we found common ground with our Government of Yukon counterparts on how to move successfully forward with healthcare, education and economic plans in light of the ongoing pandemic.

The changes will also support effective and efficient health care during this time. Under these temporary changes, pharmacists will have new options for extending prescriptions and also a limited ability to initiate prescriptions. The temporary changes support Health Canada’s March 2020 exemption under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act to maintain Yukoners’ access to controlled substances for medical treatments. Minor changes to pharmacists’ licensing requirements ensure pharmacists are supported in their work and Yukoners have better access to pharmacy services. During the pandemic, the Government of Yukon believes that relying on pharmacists’ expertise and discretion will better serve Yukoners. These temporary changes are effective immediately.                  Quick facts       Yukon’s Pharmacists Regulation came into effect in 2019. The regulations, standards of practice, the Health Professions Act as well as federal regulations such as the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, dictate how pharmacists in the territory practice.  Canada issued a temporary exemption under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act in March 2020. This exemption was made in the public interest to support access to certain medications during the pandemic. Yukon is amending its regulations and standards of practice, in part, to facilitate this exemption in Yukon.  See backgrounder for a list of the key temporary changes.          Backgrounder   The Government of Yukon has introduced temporary changes to how pharmacists can practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. These include changes to both pharmacists’ standards of practice and the Pharmacists Regulation. These short-term changes will ensure Yukoners can continue to safely access needed prescriptions. These new rules include: changes to how pharmacists can extend and initiate prescriptions; changes to support Health Canada’s temporary exemption to the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act; and changes to some licensing requirements. Pharmacists will use their professional discretion in deciding when to use the new practice options available to them. In making their decisions they will be guided by the need to ensure both public and patient safety.Changes to how pharmacists can extend and initiate prescriptions Pharmacists are now permitted to use their discretion to: extend prescriptions following phone or video consult if in-person is not advisable; initiate prescriptions for certain medical conditions; and extend prescriptions up to 30 days more than once. Changes to support exemptions under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act Pharmacists are now permitted to use their discretion to: transfer prescriptions for controlled substances to other pharmacies; arrange for delivery of controlled substances under certain circumstances; accept verbal orders from physicians for controlled substances; and extend prescriptions for controlled substances. Changes to licensing requirements The Government of Yukon has made temporary changes to a few licensing requirements to ensure pharmacists can continue to practice in Yukon despite the fact that some exams and services have been cancelled. These changes include changes to what documentation we require as well as changes to requirements for pharmacist provisional or intern licences. Provisional licences are conditional licences in which licensees practice under supervision. These will now be temporarily available to new graduates who have not completed their qualifying examinations due to COVID-19 cancellations. Timeline Changes related to Health Canada’s exemptions will remain in effect until Health Canada advises, or until September 30, 2020. Other changes will be in place until 30-days after Yukon’s state of emergency is lifted or as otherwise directed by the Registrar.

Last week, Community Services extended the deadlines for AGMs as an interim measure. A Ministerial Order under the Civil Emergency Measures Act (CEMA) issued today provides additional flexibility for groups wishing to hold annual general meetings (AGMs) right away. Depending upon organizations’ articles, bylaws and partnership agreements, the current COVID19 ban on gatherings of more than 10 people can impede businesses, societies and other organizations from holding AGMs as required by the current legislation governing them. This order broadens the options for organizations to hold AGMs, regardless of specific provisions in their bylaws or partnership agreements. This order is effective retroactively to March 17, 2020. It continues for 90 days past the end of the COVID-19 state of emergency for organizations governed by the Societies Act and Cooperative Associations Act. The order extends for 30 days after the end of the emergency for organizations governed by the Partnership and Business Names Act and the Business Corporations Act.             We continue to respond to the needs of Yukoners. The need for in-person meetings can be a significant barrier to businesses and societies during the COVID19 pandemic. They can now hold their regulated meetings, including annual general meetings, electronically or by teleconference. For instance, societies will be able to hold their mandatory annual general meetings and submit their approved year-end reports and financial statements to remain in compliance with the Societies Act and receive funding. We made the order retroactive to support any society or business, which has already held their AGM online in good faith.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker             Quick facts       Organizations and corporations can plan ahead to review and consider updating their bylaws to allow for the usage of technology during meetings, even after the expiration date of the interim order.  If organizations and corporations decide not to make these updates, they must follow the existing provisions set out by their respective statutes, regulations, articles, bylaws and partnership agreements.  The Minister of Community Services has issued a Ministerial Order (2020/24) under the Civil Emergency Measures Act. It empowers Deputy Ministers to adjust certain timelines for organizations affected by COVID-19 restrictions and orders. Under the authority of this Ministerial Order, the Deputy Minister of Community Services directed that, effective March 17, 2020, deadlines under the Cooperative Associations Act, Societies Act are extended for 90 days until after the end of the COVID-19 state of emergency. The deadline is extended for 30 days for the Partnership and Business Names Act and Business Corporations Act.

The report, Putting People First, presents a bold approach that would position Yukon as a national leader in the health and social care delivery. It would move Yukon toward a more holistic and person centred system. While there is still extensive analysis that must be done, I believe this is the right direction for our territory and I am very pleased to see such a progressive, modern approach to revitalizing health services in Yukon. This plan offers a holistic approach to providing health and social services. It aligns with our goal of ensuring that the individual receiving care is at the heart of the system and that all services are geared to support the individual in all aspects of their life. I would like to thank the independent expert panel for their diligent work completing this report. This panel was appointed in 2018 to review all programs and services delivered by the Department of Health and Social Services and the Yukon Hospital Corporation as well as those funded by the Department and delivered by non-governmental organizations. The panel was asked to look at how services are organized, managed and delivered. It was also asked to look for ways to better serve Yukoners. The panel undertook extensive engagement with Yukoners and service providers throughout the territory. I appreciate all those who provided input throughout this process. Health care services affect everyone and it is important to our government that Yukon voices are reflected in this report. I look forward to thoroughly reviewing the plan and working with Department of Health and Social Services staff to determine the feasibility of the suggested changes. Thank you again to all Yukoners who contributed to this report. It would not have been possible to fully review health and social programs and services without your input. Thank you again to the panel for your hard work, I appreciate your contribution to our territory’s healthy future.

The aim of the report, which is based on detailed data from a range of sources, is to provide direction that will help to reduce motor vehicle collision injuries in Yukon. The report includes seven key recommendations.            Motor vehicle collisions are one of the leading causes of avoidable death and injury in Yukon. It is my hope that this report will be the start of an important conversation about reducing the motor vehicle collision injuries in our territory.      Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley            Quick facts       In 2016, Yukon ranked the second highest for motor vehicle injury and fatality rates per capita in the country.  Between 2011 and 2015, the RCMP reported 3,789 motor vehicle collisions in Yukon, of which 746 (19.7 per cent) were reported to have resulted in an injury.  Yukon has some of the highest reported alcohol and drug impaired driving rates in Canada.  Inattentive/distracted driving was the most commonly reported contributing factor to motor vehicle collisions in Yukon between 2011 and 2017, and also resulted in some of the most severe injuries.

COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, May 12, at 2 p.m. the case count remains at 11 cases of COVID-19 in the territory. All of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered. There are no active cases in the territory and 1,106 individuals have been tested. We have traced each case in Yukon so far to its origin which means there continues to be no known community spread in the territory. We assume community spread has occurred when we can no longer trace how somebody became infected. Weekday case updates While the number of cases of COVID-19 remains low, we’ll update information about COVID-19 cases and tests every weekday on Yukon.ca rather than daily as we have been doing lately. The information we publish includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered. Keeping COVID-19 out of Yukon With no new cases announced since April 20, we must work together to keep COVID-19 out of the territory. We can do this by continuing to control our borders and maintaining the requirement for people arriving in Yukon to self-isolate for 14 days. Keeping these measures in place will enable us to start easing other restrictions. Under the current Border Control Measures Order, people can only enter Yukon if they can provide evidence that they are: Yukon residents; non-resident family members of Yukon residents; delivering a critical or essential service; travelling through Yukon to a neighbouring jurisdiction, which they must do with 24 hours; or exercising an Aboriginal or treaty right. Information about how to safely self-isolate is on Yukon.ca. National Nursing Week During National Nursing Week, May 11 to 17, we’re celebrating the vital contributions that nurses make to our lives and are grateful for all they’re doing to help keep our families and friends safe and well in Yukon and all across the country. This year’s particularly apt theme is Nurses: A Voice to Lead – Nursing the World to Health. The World Health Organization has designated 2020 the Year of the Nurse. Six steps to staying safe The six steps to staying safe and stopping the spread of COVID-19 are: physical distancing; regular hand washing; staying home when sick; not gathering in groups of more than 10; avoiding unnecessary travel to communities and self-isolating when required.

Tenants living in private non-subsidized market rental housing in Yukon who have lost 30 per cent or more of their income due to COVID-19 are eligible for a grant to help cover rent from April to June 2020. Eligible households can receive 50% of median market rent based on unit size using the Whitehorse median market rent: $415 per month for a bachelor, or room in a house; $500 per month for a 1 bedroom; $600 per month for a 2 bedroom; and $800 per month for a 3 bedroom or larger. The grant will be paid directly to landlords on behalf of tenants. This will ensure that landlords, who may also be experiencing lower income as a result of the pandemic, continue receiving partial income from their rental properties, and tenants who have had to defer paying rent will have less owing. In March, the Government of Yukon passed new regulations to prevent evictions for 90 days for residential tenants impacted by COVID-19, and allowed tenants to defer rent payments. The COVID-19 Rent Assist program application process will be available online at Yukon.ca shortly. Individuals interested in the program can contact the Yukon Housing Corporation at ykhouse@gov.yk.ca, or by calling 867-667-5759 in Whitehorse, or toll-free at 1-800-661-0408, extension 5759.            Many Yukon tenants and landlords are facing financial challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.   The COVID-19 Rent Assist Program will help mitigate the financial impacts on those whose situation may compromise their ability to pay their mortgage or rent during this public emergency. The Government of Yukon will continue to support Yukoners during these uncertain times as we work to keep our territory safe and healthy.      Minister responsible for the Yukon Housing Corporation Pauline Frost            Quick facts       To be eligible for the program tenants must have lost 30 per cent of more of their income due to COVID-19.  They must be a Yukon resident with a residential lease for a private market rental unit for at least three months.  Eligible households can receive 50% of median market rent based on unit size using the Whitehorse median market rent  They must have applied to other COVID-19 relief funds that they may be eligible for.  The short-term relief program is available retroactive to April 1 and ends on June 30, 2020.  Tenants who deferred rent for April and May are also able to apply to help cover their costs.

Yukoners are reminded to act responsible and remember that Recycling is a powerful attractant for bears. If you are storing it while the depots are closed, wash it thoroughly and keep it in a secure and enclosed space, ideally a garage. Bears that are attracted and rewarded with human-sourced food often become a threat to public safety. They no longer fear people, houses or vehicles and may become more aggressive in their search for food. Farmers and hobbyists with livestock should use electric fencing. It’s a safe and effective way to keep bears and other predators off your property. It can be used to prevent access to livestock pens, chicken coops, beehives, dog kennels, vegetable gardens, fruit trees, berry bushes, compost and garbage. Bears can show up at any time in Yukon. Be alert, travel in groups while adhering to physical distancing recommendations, keep children nearby, make noise and carry bear spray. Keep bear spray accessible and know how to use it. Yukoners can learn more about safety, awareness and bear ecology at the virtual bear fair event on the Conservation Officer Services Branch Facebook page @yukoncoservices, from May 11 to 15.            We share our wilderness home with a large and active bear population. As the weather draws more people outside to enjoy the land, it is a good time to remind all Yukoners of our role in reducing the potential for human-wildlife conflict. Let’s do our part to ensure the safety of the public and to keep our bears wild and alive by properly managing attractants.      Minister of Environment Pauline Frost            A coop full of chickens is an easy target for a hungry bear. WildWise Yukon is dedicated to reducing human conflict with wildlife. This summer we are helping food producers install electric fencing around these major attractants. Properly installed electric fencing is the best available tool for keeping livestock safe from bears and bears away from livestock.      Executive Director of WildWise Yukon Heather Ashthorn            Quick facts       The second annual Bear Fair has gone virtual in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Managing attractants, at home or while camping, is one of the most important things we can do to manage human-wildlife conflict. Keep attractants in secure waste containers, vehicles, hard-sided trailers, bear-proof canisters, locked buildings or behind electric fencing.

This is as long as people have the money or time to participate and activities are carried out safely. Run for Mom, for example, which takes place on Mother’s Day, Sunday, May 10, is inviting Yukoners to run, walk or cycle any route they choose while practising safe spacing rather than take part in the usual annual run around the 4.2 kilometre Millennium Trail in Whitehorse. Run for Mom is an annual event to raise awareness of breast health and money for breast imaging equipment at Whitehorse General Hospital. Six steps to staying safe The six steps to staying safe and stopping the spread of COVID-19 are: physical distancing; regular hand washing; staying home when sick; not gathering in groups of more than 10; avoiding unnecessary travel to communities and self-isolating when required.

160,2020-05-08,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/drug-use-reminder-issued-times-pandemic,Government Website,Drug use reminder issued in times of pandemic,"           Published 08/05/2020        The Yukon's Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley, and Yukon's Chief Coroner Heather Jones are cautioning Yukon residents around drug use after seven drug-related deaths since January 2020: three deaths in March and April are confirmed as fentanyl-related, while three deaths from January and February are still awaiting toxicology confirmation of drug content. The COVID-19 pandemic compounds the ongoing public health crisis related to high rates of illicit drug overdose and deaths, as well as acute harms from substance use. There are concerns that the street supply is becoming even more unpredictable as regular supply channels are disrupted, and supports for people who use drugs are difficult to access.            Each of these recent deaths mean another life extinguished too soon and another family left to grieve. These tragedies are a brutal reminder that fentanyl and other dangerous drugs remain within easy reach. We have no way of knowing if these deaths would have happened even without COVID 19 but it does offer us the opportunity to remind individuals to not use alone and to have a naloxone kit handy. It’s also an opportunity to remind Yukoners of the excellent Opioid Treatment Services available at the Referred Care Clinic. Anyone can access the OTS clinic, no referral is needed. Any drug death is a loss and at this time, when families cannot gather, it is doubly sad.      Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Brendan Hanley            Yukon Coroner’s Service has seen a significant increase in accidental illicit drug-related deaths over the past few months. The numbers have more than doubled from those seen in the same 2019 period. This is cause for real concern, which is shared by the Chief Medical Officer of Health.  We join him in reminding Yukoners to access the many resources available. Every death of a Yukoner has impact and together we can work to prevent unnecessary heartbreak and pain in our communities.      Yukon’s Chief Coroner Heather Jones            Ongoing enforcement efforts by the Yukon RCMP's Crime Reduction Unit continues to indicate that a variety of 'hard' drugs, including fentanyl, are making their way into the illicit supply chain. The RCMP is fully supportive of Yukon Health's harm reduction program and remains committed to working with Health Authorities and NGO's in the timely sharing of information impacting those most vulnerable to the illicit drug trade.      Chief Superintendent Scott Sheppard, Commanding Officer of the Yukon RCMP            Quick facts       Blood Ties, located at 405 Ogilvie Street, offers harm reduction services including fentanyl testing in Whitehorse, Monday to Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. While fentanyl testing can only happen at the Ogilvie location, outreach services can deliver harm reduction supplies to clients’ homes.  Opioid Treatment Services at the Referred Care Clinic, located at 210 Elliot Street, does not require a referral; anyone can access these services which include strong social supports. The Opioid Overdose Prevention Coordinator also works out of the RCC.  Don’t use drugs alone, and make sure you have a naloxone kit on hand. Kits are available at locations across Yukon: http://www.hss.gov.yk.ca/fentanyl.php. The Opioid Overdose Prevention Coordinator is still available for training: 867-332-0722   You can still social distance while doing drugs.

The Department of Highways and Public Works received the project evaluation report from YESAB on May 1, 2020. YESAB is also requesting effects monitoring once the project is complete including speed monitoring; usage analysis by vehicles and vulnerable road users; an audit of the department’s comprehensive and multi-sectoral approach to collision prevention; and a report detailing changes in the new Motor Vehicles Act aimed at improving safety for vulnerable road users. The Department of Highways and Public Works is committing to undertaking the requested effects monitoring, which will contribute to ongoing work to better understand who, how, and when our roads are used. This data will inform future project designs for all Yukoners.            The Alaska Highway is a critical route for all Yukoners and we are pleased to be making upgrades that will slow traffic and increase safety for all users in the Whitehorse area. YESAB’s evaluation report is a testament to the strong work of our design team and we look forward to sharing the monitoring results with Yukoners.       Minister of Highways and Public Works Richard Mostyn            Quick facts       Safety improvements on the Alaska Highway include two new signalized intersections between Lodestar Lane and Range Road, which will reduce speeds and give vulnerable road users a safe opportunity to cross.  New paved multi-use trails will connect to the city’s growing trail network and the closure of unsafe accesses will reduce the risk of collisions.   Construction on Phase 1 will start this summer.

162,2020-05-05,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/may-5-2020-yukons-chief-medical-officer-health-provides-update-covid-19,Government Website,"May 5, 2020: Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health provides update on COVID-19","           Published 05/05/2020        Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley has the following updates for the Yukon public on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, May 5, at 2 p.m. the case count remains at 11 cases of COVID-19 in the territory. All of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered. There are no active cases in the territory and 1,041 individuals have been tested. We have traced each case in Yukon so far to its origin which means there continues to be no known community spread in the territory. We assume community spread has occurred when we can no longer trace how somebody became infected. Daily updates The Government of Yukon publishes information about COVID-19 tests daily on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered. Yukon modelling Modelling shows that because Yukoners have followed the six steps to staying safe, we have successfully reduced the spread of COVID-19 in the territory. If we had not put restrictions in place when we did, our modelling shows we would have expected to have seen around 2,500 cases of COVID-19 by May 1. Instead we saw 11. We would also have expected approximately 150 people to be in a hospital by May 1. No one in Yukon infected by COVID-19 has had to go to a hospital and, on average, there are 28 unoccupied hospital beds every day. If we’d had 10 cases and no restrictions, we could have seen more than 7,000 cases, with close to 1,000 hospitalizations. We will provide a technical briefing about modelling in Yukon soon. Pandemic impact on Yukoners It’s vital that Yukoners continue to practise the six steps to staying safe. As a territory, we must take a long-term view of the pandemic and move gradually and in an evidence-based way that’s specific to Yukon circumstances towards easing restrictions so we can ensure we’re always prepared for any changes in our situation. The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting everybody in different ways, depending on our circumstances and vulnerabilities. We cannot always anticipate how each of us will be affected. Yukoners can play a role in supporting others through this difficult experience as well as making sure we seek help for ourselves when we need it. We must also balance our personal responses to the pandemic with the risks to other Yukoners’ health. Each safe action we take helps others who are vulnerable. Spartan Cube machines On April 17, 2020, we said we expected to receive the Spartan Cube machines we had ordered from the federal government around the end of May for portable, rapid testing around the territory. However, because of problems with the Spartan Cube’s performance, Health Canada will no longer be supplying the machines.

163,2020-05-04,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/new-support-available-yukons-aviation-industry,Government Website,New support available for Yukon’s aviation industry,"           Published 04/05/2020        Yukon’s aviation sector will receive $3.56 million in support to help compensate for lost revenues as a result of COVID-19.  The government will flow federal funding to aviation businesses to support critical and essential routes and the transportation of vital supplies. The $3.56 million in funding is Yukon’s portion of Government of Canada support announced on April 14. Of this funding, $1.1 million will be directed to Air North over three months to ensure the continued operation of critical routes to the North. These routes ensure scheduled delivery of medical samples, supplies and critical front line staff to Yukon.   Yukon aviation businesses will benefit from the waiving of commercial fees. When coupled with the previously announced waiver of aviation landing, parking and loading fees, these changes will save aviation businesses approximately $780,000. The new fee waivers include: * land lease and licence fees; 	* building lease and licence fees; 	* air terminal building concession fees; 	* aircraft fuel lease and licence fees; 	* aircraft fuel concession fees; 	* parking stall fees; and 	* service recoveries like charges for electricity. These fees are waived from April 1 until December 31, 2020.             Yukon’s airlines are critical to our northern lifestyle. They connect our communities, safely get us to medical services, transport much needed goods and support our economy. This funding will ensure critical medical cargo, including COVID-19 tests, continues to be sent to and from the territory. Airlines have been deeply impacted by this pandemic and we are glad to provide some support at this time.       Minister of Highways and Public Works Richard Mostyn            All Yukon businesses have been hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. With our year over year traffic down by 96% in April, we have had to reduce capacity drastically, while still maintaining a minimum level of essential service to the communities we serve. We have also had to slash our overhead costs in order to stem losses. We are very thankful for the help provided by both the Yukon Government and the Federal Government under the Commercial Fee Waiver Program, the Yukon Business Relief Program, the Northern Essential Air Services Relief Program, and the 75% Wage Subsidy Program. Together these programs will help see us through to better times.       Air North, Yukon’s Airline President Joseph Sparling            Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are looking at very low traffic this year which will have a dramatic impact on Yukon’s aviation industry. Our association represents aviation companies across the north and we are seeing firsthand the impact this pandemic is having on northern and remote aviation operators.  This government support will help businesses through this crisis so that we can continue to provide valuable transportation services in the future.       Northern Air Transportation Industry President Wendy Tayler            Quick facts       The aviation industry has been among the hardest hit by the COVID-19 public health crisis with passenger traffic dropping almost 90 per cent nationally.   Air North will be the primary beneficiary of this funding. This funding will support five weekly flights to Vancouver and three on their northern route that services Dawson and Old Crow.           Contact   Matthew Cameron 	Cabinet Communications 	867-393-7136matthew.cameron@gov.yk.ca  Brittany Cross 	Communications, Highways and Public Works 	867-332-4601brittany.cross@gov.yk.ca      News release #:   20-122    Related information:   Support for aviation industry         "

The John Howard Society is now providing clients with continuous support and advocacy as they navigate potential obstacles in their reintegration, and assist them to establish positive community connections. The new program provides 24/7 community supervised services and supports for justice-involved clients who are on conditional sentences, mandatory supervision and temporary absences and do not require high security custodial care, including individuals who were previously receiving services at the Yukon Adult Resource Centre. The new program is operating in a distinct and independent facility at the Whitehorse Correctional Centre (WCC) building to maximize services and better support justice-involved clients. The facility has a total of 40 beds and its location will allow for more effective program delivery at the supervised residential facility and the Whitehorse Correctional Centre. Individuals will continue to access the programming through an application process that results from a referral from the courts, corrections or the Justice Wellness Centre. The provision of services by the John Howard Society represents an important step towards ensuring the well-being and successful community reintegration of justice-involved clients. The Government of Yukon is looking forward to working with the John Howard Society, and thanks the Salvation Army for their many years of service.            The Government of Yukon knows that providing services and support to justice-involved clients while they make the transition back into our communities is critical to their rehabilitation. We are pleased to welcome the John Howard Society to Yukon, and look forward to our ongoing work together.      Minister of Justice Tracy-Anne McPhee            We are honoured to be delivering the new Supervised Residential Housing program, and for the opportunity to work closely with the Government of Yukon and other community partners and stakeholders to support the safety of the Whitehorse community and deliver services which meet the needs of individuals transitioning in the territory. We look forward to working as part of the local community and bringing our extensive experience with reintegration services, community-based residential facilities, innovative and person-centered program design and delivery, outreach, and community services to this exciting new program.

This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered. A personal message for Yukoners from the Chief Medical Officer of Health I recognize that people are getting tired of the restrictions that have been put in place. They see Yukon’s low number of cases of infection and wonder why we are keeping things locked down so tightly. They look to our neighbours to the south and the east and see that other parts of Canada are beginning to open up. Here in Yukon, while people feel we have taken drastic measures, we haven’t had to go as far as many of the provinces had to. When our neighbours to the south and east open up, their first phases will be catching up to where we are now in terms of restrictions. We want to take a calm and measured approach to reopening the territory. More details will be coming week by week. We want to take incremental steps and, if it’s fine and we don’t see more disease, then walk in a little deeper. The worst thing would be that if we open up, see a resurgence of the disease within the territory and have to shut down again, just after folks have tasted a little bit of freedom. Increasing non-urgent hospital services Yukon’s hospitals will on a limited basis increase some elective and non-urgent services that were temporarily suspended over the last month to help limit the spread of COVID-19. The services include elective surgeries and non-urgent bloodwork, x-rays, imaging tests, physiotherapy, occupational therapy and appointments with visiting specialists. Hospitals will provide all of these resumed services by appointment only so they can maintain physical distancing and ensure the safety of vulnerable populations and health care workers. The hospitals will contact people to let them know when their appointment is. They will continue screening all patients and visitors for risk of infection at all hospital entrances. Accessing mental health services Looking after our mental health is part of how we should respond to the pandemic whatever our situation or role, including people who have never accessed mental health services before. Feeling afraid, worried or stressed are normal in a crisis and with all the change that COVID-19 has brought to our lives, so is feeling we’re no longer in control and grieving for what we have lost. Reaching out for extra mental health support is a sign of strength. There are plenty of mental health professionals available to help and Yukoners are reminded they can call Mental Wellness and Substance Use Services at 867-456-3838 or toll free at 1-866-456-3838. People can also call the Canadian Mental Health Association for phone counselling appointments at 867-668-6429. The Child Development Centre at 867-456-8182 provides services for families with children under school age. Families with children or adults with disabilities can call Disability Services at 867-393-7464. We provide anyone coming into the territory with a list of resources and tools for self-care and mental wellness while they self-isolate. People can find free resources for supporting mental health at the Wellness Together Canada at ca.portal.gs.

The orders: Suspend limitation periods, under Yukon law, for civil and family actions that would have expired during the state of emergency or within the 30 days after the state of emergency ends. The limitation periods will now expire 90 days after the state of emergency ends. The same extension will apply to the initiation of prosecutions under Yukon law. Allow judges and other statutory decision-makers, operating under Yukon law, to waive, suspend or extend the time periods as they deem necessary; for up to 90 days after the state of emergency. Provide a 30-day extension on affidavits or statutory declarations required under Yukon law, where an affidavit or statutory declaration would have normally been due during or up to 10 days after the state of emergency ends. Deputy ministers will have authority to specify circumstances where the extension to affidavits or statutory declarations will not apply. Provide authority for deputy ministers to alter the terms of Government of Yukon contracts in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Provide deputy ministers with the authority to extend leases, licences, certificates, permits and other approvals issued under Yukon law for up to 90 days after the state of emergency ends. Enable deputy ministers to extend legislative timelines set out in Yukon laws for up to 90 days after the state of emergency ends. These orders are intended to reduce the burden on organizations, businesses, governments and individuals facing challenges meeting legislative timelines and contractual obligations as a result of COVID-19 related factors.            We recognize that individuals, businesses, governments and others may not be able to meet certain legislated timelines and contractual obligations in light of the current emergency for a variety of reasons such as illness, the requirement to self-isolate, employment or financial situations.

The First Ministers state that until there is a vaccine or effective treatment for COVID-19, strong measures must be in place for this new normal phase of living with COVID-19 to contain future waves or outbreaks and protect Canadians and economies across the country. A key objective shared by all First Ministers is to minimize the risk of another wave of COVID-19 that would lead governments to re-impose severe restrictions. The principles agreed to by the First Ministers to guide this process include: science and evidence-based decision making; continued coordination and collaboration across the country; accountability and transparency; and flexibility and proportionality. The criteria and measures agreed to by the First Ministers in order to restart the economy include: that COVID-19 transmission is controlled; sufficient public health capacity is in place to test, trace, and isolate all cases; expanded health care capacity exists for all patients; supports are in place for vulnerable groups/communities and key populations; workplace preventative measures are in place; measures are taken to avoid risk of importation; and governments will continue to engage and support.

The Ministerial Order specifies affected drivers will not be penalized or face licence suspensions if they cannot provide their medical examination certificate during the state of emergency. Commercial drivers can continue to provide their vital service to Yukon communities and drivers aged 70 years and older will not have restrictions placed on their mobility. The exemption period started on March 18 and will end 90 days after the end of the state of emergency declared by the government.             As we work to limit society’s exposure to COVID-19, we are uncovering real problems people face coping with this emergency. Commercial drivers need to provide their essential service and older Yukoners need to focus on their health as much as possible. This order accomplishes that.      Minister of Highways and Public Works Richard Mostyn            Quick facts       In mid-March, the Yukon Medical Association notified government that non-essential, in-person care would be postponed until further notice. Medical examinations for all classes of Yukon drivers were also postponed until after the COVID-19 public health crisis.  Affected drivers are still required to file their medical examination report with the Motor Vehicles office, but they will have until the end of the exemption period to provide it.

COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, April 28, at 2 p.m. the case count remains at 11 cases of COVID-19 in the territory. Eight of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered and all others are doing well at home. We can trace each case in Yukon so far to its origin which means there continues to be no known community spread in the territory. We assume community spread to have occurred when we can no longer trace how somebody became infected. Daily updates The Government of Yukon publishes information about COVID-19 tests daily on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered. Testing update We shared the new testing criteria we announced on Friday, April 24, with health care professionals over the weekend. They have now increased testing for people who have a broader range of symptoms and who have travelled outside Yukon. We’ve also opened up testing to people who have not travelled. This allows us to test people from vulnerable populations including residents in long-term care homes and marginalized citizens who struggle with housing and day-to-day living. As we move towards lightening the current restrictions we’re living under, we need to have the appropriate testing capacity in place to watch for community spread and to know where infection is and track where it’s been. National Immunization Awareness Week  April 25 to May 2 is National Immunization Awareness Week. We want Yukoners to keep routine immunizations for children up to date. Delaying or missing scheduled vaccines puts children at risk for common and serious childhood infections such as measles and whooping cough. Protecting babies and children through vaccinations and reducing the risk of an outbreak of a disease that’s preventable by a vaccine is a public health priority. We have strategies in place across all Yukon health care centres to continue to deliver these services safely. Don’t put your health on hold The government launched a new campaign this week to remind Yukon residents that if they’re ill, they can still call their doctor, visit the health centre or go to the Emergency Department. Numbers of physician, health centre and emergency visits have dropped in recent weeks and we’re concerned that people who may be really ill or have legitimate health concerns are putting off that call or visit because of COVID-19. Lifting of restrictions Work continues on developing a national, coordinated approach to how and when to gradually ease restrictions put in place in response to the pandemic. Recognizing the different situations in each jurisdiction, changes will be implemented locally based on local circumstances. Planning for Yukon’s opening up strategy is underway led by the Premier’s office and following a public health framework developed by the Chief Medical Officer of Health, in coordination with federal and jurisdictional counterparts. Some Yukon businesses have begun to reopen on their own initiative after changing their practices to comply with current public health advice. Retail operations may remain open as long as they have a plan in place to serve the public safely. Other establishments, such as bars, restaurants except for take out and delivery, recreation facilities and businesses offering personal services, remain closed under public health order. All closures and operating requirements will be reviewed as part of Yukon’s opening plan.   Businesses can view the cleaning guidelines that have been approved by the government’s environmental health services on Yukon.ca. Social gatherings The ban on gatherings of more than 10 people refers to social gatherings rather than work environments. People within a workplace must space themselves appropriately and take increased hygiene precautions. The maximum number of people in a work space depends on the size of the establishment and not the absolute number. Indoor gatherings should be limited to usual household members and close family members and should not exceed 10 people. Outdoor gatherings of 10 or fewer are allowed as long as people are appropriately spaced. Six steps to staying safe The six steps to staying safe and stopping the spread of COVID-19 are: physical distancing; regular hand washing; staying home when sick; not gathering in groups of more than 10; avoiding travel to communities and self-isolating when required.

This is a day to remember our friends, colleagues and family members who have died or been injured in the workplace. Everyday an individual goes to work to provide for themselves and their families, they should return home alive and in good health. No one should be faced with the prospect of going to work and never coming home. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. The Day of Mourning is a time to honour those who passed too early and those seriously injured while at work. It is also a reminder of our shared responsibility to make sure that each one of us gets home safe from work every day. We all have the spirit of safety within us, and we have the wisdom and experience to empower the next generation of workers to continue fostering that culture of safety. We owe it to those we have lost to continue to change workplace culture to ensure that safety comes first.

Currently, under Yukon’s Social Assistance Regulation the CERB would qualify as unearned income and result in a reduction in the total amount of Social Assistance benefits. Forthcoming changes under the Civil Emergency Measures Act will fully exempt CERB payments from April to June 2020. Additional support is also available for Yukoners receiving Social Assistance benefits who are waiting to receive their CERB payments. Individuals in need of emergency financial support are encouraged to contact Income Support Services at 867-667-5674 or by email at incomesupport@gov.yk.ca. Income Support workers are available to ensure the needs of individuals are met throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.            It is important that Yukoners are not placed in financial hardship as we respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. These changes, which align with recommendations from the Government of Canada, will make Yukon one of just two jurisdictions in Canada to fully exempt CERB payments from Social Assistance benefits.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Quick facts       The Government of Canada recommends that the provinces and territories work to ensure that Canadians who are receiving CERB payments are not penalized by seeing a reduction in overall benefits.

173,2020-04-27,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/yukon-receives-ventilators-federal-emergency-response-services,Government Website,Yukon receives ventilators from federal emergency response services,"           Published 27/04/2020        Yukon has received six ventilators from the Public Health Agency of Canada’s emergency response services, significantly increasing the territory’s capacity to provide acute care in response to COVID-19. Yukon now has a total of 15 ventilators distributed between the Yukon Hospital Corporation and Emergency Medical Services. Five of the new ventilators have been assigned to Whitehorse General Hospital, one intensive care unit Puritan Bennett 840 model and four of the portable Newport HT-50 models. One additional portable ventilator has been assigned to Emergency Medical Services.            We are very fortunate that there are currently no patients in our hospitals with COVID-19. With expanded ventilator capacity and a dedicated team of healthcare professionals, Yukon is well prepared in the event that we see a surge of patients in serious condition. We will continue to work with our partners at the local, regional and national levels to ensure our healthcare system has the resources necessary to manage COVID-19 in our territory.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Yukon has been able to receive critical pieces of equipment that will increase the territory’s capacity to respond to COVID-19. It is important to acknowledge that we have not just the equipment itself, but we also have a team which is trained and ready to use the ventilators if and when the time comes.      Yukon Hospital Corporation Board Chairman Brian Gillen            Quick facts       The Puritan Bennett 840 (Intensive Care Unit ventilator) and Newport HT50s (portable ventilator) arrived in Yukon on April 17.  They will be returned to Public Health Agency of Canada’s emergency response services after the pandemic.  Previously there were six ventilators at Whitehorse General Hospital, and one portable unit at each of the community hospitals in Dawson City and Watson Lake. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) also has a ventilator as part of their equipment.  Whitehorse General Hospital has 30 hospital nurses trained to operate a ventilator, with support offered by a group of seven anesthesia physicians.  EMS has 28 critical care paramedics who can intubate patients and run ventilators. Community Health Centre primary care nurses are trained in an intermediate airway which is similar to intubation but less technical.

COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, April 24, at 3 p.m. the case count remains at 11 cases of COVID-19 in the territory. Eight of the 11 people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered and all others are doing well at home. No one has had to go to a hospital. Daily updates Information about COVID-19 tests is published daily on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered. Changes to testing criteria From Monday, April 27, the criteria for who is tested for COVID-19 in Yukon will be expanded. People will be tested if they have any one of the following symptoms and if they have travelled outside the territory in the last 14 days or have had close contact with anyone who has travelled outside the territory. The symptoms for recent travellers include fever, chills, cough, difficulty breathing, a sore throat or hoarse voice, headache, runny nose or nasal congestion, unexplained vomiting or diarrhea, fatigue or muscle aches, or loss of smell or taste. People with no travel history but who are experiencing fever, cough, or difficulty breathing can also be tested. Testing will also be broadened in long-term care facility residents and the Whitehorse Emergency Shelter clients. The reasons for broadening the testing criteria are that due to being well past the peak of flu season we are seeing fewer people come forward for testing. We wish to continue with high rates of testing to detect any COVID as early as possible. We also are working to continue to protect vulnerable populations and to increase our ability to detect signals of community transmission. Community transmission means it is no longer possible to trace how somebody became infected. The origin of all 11 cases in Yukon so far has been traced back to travel outside the territory. Health care providers continue to have the discretion to make decisions about who is tested or not based on their clinical expertise. The self-assessment tool on Yukon.ca and the 811 Health Line will be updated with the new criteria on April 27. Doctor’s offices and community health centres  Yukoners are reminded they can call their doctor for their regular health needs such as renewing medication, dealing with chronic health conditions or to discuss new concerns. Doctor’s offices and community health centres remain open. Health support for Yukon communities  Information about health services support for communities during the pandemic has been added to Yukon.ca, including health care access, mental health services and the testing process.  Latest information To keep up to date with the latest information, Yukoners should visit Yukon.ca/COVID-19.

The order allows Yukon municipalities to extend their respective 2020 property tax payment deadlines. It also applies to any Local Improvement Charges that property owners are repaying.            We recognize that COVID-19 is having a financial impact on many Yukoners. Extending the property tax payment deadline is one way we are providing relief during these challenging times. We encourage those who are able to pay their property taxes this summer, to do so. Municipalities are working hard to continue providing essential services to citizens.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            The COVID-19 situation has had a significant impact on both our local and territorial economies. I want to thank Minister Streicker and the Government of Yukon for facilitating this measure for our residents, and for hopefully giving them a bit of breathing room in regard to their finances.       City of Whitehorse Mayor Dan Curtis             Quick facts       Yukon joins many other Canadian jurisdictions in providing a 60-day extension on their property tax deadlines to help property owners during this crisis.   If a municipality has already issued its tax notices, this deadline extension will apply.

Living with COVID-19 longer term Work is underway across Canada to plan a national, coordinated approach to how and when to gradually ease restrictions put in place in response to the pandemic. The slow transition to living longer-term with COVID-19 will be tailored to different contexts and implemented by each jurisdiction based on local circumstances.  Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health is a member of the federal, provincial and territorial Special Advisory Committee set up to guide this work and advise deputy ministers of health across the country on matters related to the pandemic. The committee’s work is based on data and evidence and includes developing criteria to assess readiness for loosening or altering public health measures and preparing a framework for guiding decisions. Smoking and vaping People who smoke and vape should be aware they are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 and of developing more severe health complications if they become ill. Smoking and vaping damage the lungs and weaken the immune system, making it harder to fight off COVID-19. This includes smoking cannabis as well as tobacco. Also, sharing cigarettes or vaping devices risks spreading COVID-19. Yukoners wanting to give up smoking can get help from the Quitpath program by calling 867-667-8393 in Whitehorse, 1-866-221-8393 toll free in communities or by visiting www.quitpath.ca.

Each person will be given direction according to their individual circumstances. Travellers returning to Yukon People returning to Yukon who are self-isolating for 14 days and who develop symptoms or whose symptoms worsen should call 811 or their family physician if they are in Whitehorse. People in communities who develop symptoms should call their local health centre. Mental health support Mental health should be a priority for Yukoners to help them manage their way through the pandemic. Reaching out for mental wellness support is proactive health care. Advice for mental health self-care includes being kind to yourself, getting outside for at least 15 to 20 minutes a day, appreciating nature, eating well and staying hydrated, monitoring your caffeine and alcohol intake, getting eight hours of sleep a night and taking medications as prescribed.

The new case is in Whitehorse and related to international travel. Contact tracing is underway. Seven of the nine people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered and no one has had to go to a hospital. Each case in Yukon so far can be traced to its origin and there continues to be no known community transmission in the territory.

This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered. Testing for COVID-19 Starting today, information about COVID-19 tests will be published daily on Yukon.ca. Yukon continues to have an aggressive strategy for testing for COVID-19 but as the incidence of influenza and other respiratory illnesses lessens in the territory, fewer individuals need to be tested. Also, with fewer people coming into Yukon than before due to border restrictions, the risk of imported COVID-19 has substantially decreased. The Chief Medical Officer of Health office is continually re-examining the testing strategy for Yukon to ensure there are mechanisms in place to protect the territory’s most vulnerable citizens as well as to look for signs of community transmission. Rapid test kits Within the next couple of weeks Yukon expects to have a GeneXpert rapid test kit set up and running.  This will be for testing within a  hospital setting rather than for general use and can provide results quickly on site. New Spartan Cube machines are also expected to arrive in Yukon around the end of May for portable, rapid testing in different health care settings around the territory. The Government of Yukon will also continue to send tests to the BC Centre for Disease Control by air transport. Communal living guidance The Government of Yukon has produced a new guide to help operators prevent and manage COVID-19 in communal settings such as homeless shelters, women’s shelters, youth shelters, transition homes, group homes and hostels. The guidance includes topics such as education, cleaning, personal protective equipment and monitoring and reporting. The document is called Guidance for the Prevention and Management of COVID-19 in Communal Living Settings and is now on Yukon.ca. Keeping COVID-19 at bay Yukoners have succeeded in creating an environment where COVID-19 has not spread and are strongly advised to keep it that way by following the six steps to staying safe.

Minister of Community Services John Streicker signed the Ministerial Order under the Civil Emergency Measures Act as a means to ensure that enforcement officers stationed at Yukon’s borders have the legal authority and tools needed to deny entry to non-essential travellers while still permitting essential and critical services and people to return home. The new orders specify whom and under what circumstances entry will be permitted and require travellers entering Yukon to produce appropriate identification, documentation and a detailed self-isolation plan. These orders will not impact the delivery of critical and essential services, or the ability of people to transit through Yukon to another destination within 24 hours. Access to Yukon will need to be justified, based on purpose of travel, and the ability to meet requirements set by Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health.

As a result, Yukoners whose occupations are not considered critical or essential are not permitted to use licensed child care spaces at this time. Licensed child care will continue to be available for children with parents or guardians that are employed as critical or essential service workers, and for vulnerable families. Yukon’s licensed child care centres and family day homes are receiving additional funding to provide care to children during the COVID-19 response and beyond it. Information about this funding can be found at Yukon.ca/child-care-centres-and-family-day-homes.            Child care is an essential service that enables workers to continue to do their jobs as we manage the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. At this time, we need to ensure that child care services are available to critical or essential workers who are performing the vital services that are needed by all Yukoners in a way that protects the health and safety of both staff and children.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Quick facts       In Yukon, critical services are defined as those considered critical to preserving life, health and basic societal functioning. Essential services are those required to maintain the reliable operation of infrastructure essential for the health, safety and economic well-being of Yukon’s population.  Several child care operators have space available for the children of critical and essential workers. A current list of operators with available spaces is available at Yukon.ca/child-care-information.    Details about Government of Yukon financial support for child care operators is also available at Yukon.ca/child-care-centres-and-family-day-homes.  Yukon Communicable Disease Control and Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health have provided child care operators with a public health guidance document called Enhanced measures at Yukon child care facilities during the COVID-19 crisis. It details measures to assist our centres and day homes in remaining open, to help maintain a safe and healthy environment and to minimize the risk of COVID-19 in Yukon.

182,2020-04-16,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/national-advance-care-planning-day-reminder-plan-ahead,Government Website,National Advance Care Planning Day a reminder to plan ahead,"           Published 16/04/2020        April 16 marks National Advance Care Planning Day.  Health and Social Services Minister Pauline Frost and Yukon’s palliative care physicians, Dr. Danusia Kanachowski and Dr. Alex Kmet, would like to remind people of the importance of having a care plan in place and talking to loved ones and health care providers about their personal care preferences and wishes. In Yukon, individuals can file advance directives. An advance directive allows an individual of any age to plan for an unexpected illness or accident that leaves them unable to communicate the kind of health care and support they want, or don’t want. An advance directive names a substitute decision maker who can speak on their behalf. It is a written statement of an individual's values and how they'd like to be cared for when acutely ill or near the end of their life.            On National Advance Care Planning Day, I encourage all Yukoners to make a plan for what they want to happen in the unfortunate event that they are unable to communicate their wishes. It is not a thought we want to entertain but it is important that we do so and plan appropriately. Today is also an important opportunity to highlight those who work in the area of palliative care for the quality care they provide.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Today gives us the opportunity to remind people of the importance of planning ahead. As physicians who work with palliative patients, we are most often there at the end. If a patient has a plan and their families are aware of that plan, it can be such a gentler end.  Family and caregivers should know what an individual’s wishes are.      Palliative care physician Dr. Danusia Kanachowski             Quick facts       The Care Consent Act deals with consent and substitute consent to health care and sets out the requirements for a valid advance directive.  Anyone over the age of 16 who is capable, can make a directive which appoints a proxy and sets out future health care wishes.

The Permit Hunt Authorization lottery application period will open on April 23. The deadline is May 21, 2020 at 4 p.m. Changes to the Permit Hunt Authorization include the following. Joint permit hunt authorization applications will now enter into the draw as the average of years applied for the two applicants. The number of Takhini elk permits available will increase from two to four. Successful applicants will be emailed before the end of June. Successful applicants now have the option to return their permit online, through their Department of Environment eServices account. Other hunting regulation changes in effect for the 2020–21 season include the following.  Youth under 12 years of age no longer require the Hunter Education and Ethics Development (HEED) course for small game licences. Subzones 7-13, 7-17, 7-20, 7-24 and 7-26 will be on permit for sheep hunting rather than having to select an individual subzone. Permits in the eastern portion of Game Management Zone 7 will be allocated by Sheep Management Units that reflect sheep populations and movements, which will provide sheep permit holders more flexibility. A portion of game management subzone 5-21 will be closed permanently to sheep hunting. This closure helps to protect the Kluane National Park sheep population. The Government of Yukon will reassess the feasibility of the Special Guide Licence in May. The application period is delayed due to travel restrictions in response to COVID-19. Hunters are encouraged to follow the advice from Yukon's Chief Medical Officer of Health regarding travel recommendations and restrictions as well as physical distancing practices when planning their hunts. The most up-to-date information is available online at Yukon.ca/hunting.            We are committed to continually improving the permit hunt authorization to ensure a transparent and modern process. I am pleased we were able to make the weighting change to joint applications, which Yukoners supported during a public review in 2019. In light of the ongoing response to COVID-19, I encourage all hunters to take extra time to plan their hunts with physical distancing and the wishes of our communities in mind. Have a successful and enjoyable season on the land.      Minister of Environment Pauline Frost            Quick facts       The Permit Hunt Authorization (PHA) underwent a comprehensive review in 2019, which included a public survey, stakeholder meetings, and a third-party technical review of the data and systems.  In 2019 the Department of Environment received more than 4,700 applications for 223 PHA permits covering six species.

COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, April 14, at 3 p.m. the number of cases of COVID-19 in Yukon remains at eight with seven cases in Whitehorse and one in a community. Six of the eight people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have recovered and no one has had to go to a hospital. Each case in Yukon so far can be traced to its origin and there continues to be no known community transmission in the territory. Community transmission is presumed to occur when it is no longer possible to trace how somebody became infected. Information about COVID-19 tests is published regularly on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered. Easter success Yukoners are thanked for following the pandemic orders and recommendations over the Easter weekend and staying close to home, staying safe and not putting unnecessary pressure on medical and emergency services. Six steps to staying safe Although community transmission is not known to have reached the territory yet, it is possible that it has already arrived. This is why the public should continue to act to limit potential infection. By following six steps to staying safe, Yukoners will help to stop the spread of COVID-19. Practise physical distancing – keep two metres or six feet away from everyone who’s not in your household. Wash your hands frequently. Stay home when you’re sick. Don’t gather in groups of 10 or more people. Don’t travel to communities unless it’s essential. Self-isolate when you’re required to – either because you’ve travelled into the territory or because you are a contact of someone diagnosed with or being investigated for COVID-19. Doctor appointments and immunizations People who would normally be visiting health centres for immunizations should carry on doing so despite the pandemic. Those with ailments or conditions not related to COVID-19 should call their doctors for appointments in the usual way. They will be able to talk to their doctor by phone and their doctor will determine whether they need a face to face appointment.

This Order represents the first implementation action of the approved Peel Watershed Regional Land Use Plan, developed and approved in partnership with the First Nation of Na-Cho Nyäk Dun, Vuntut Gwitchin Government, Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in, and Gwich’in Tribal Council. As of April 1, 2020, mineral staking in areas identified as Special Management Areas were withdrawn permanently. Wilderness Areas and Wilderness Areas-Boreal Caribou have an interim withdrawal in place until January 1, 2030, at which point the status of these Areas will be jointly reviewed by the Parties to the Peel Plan. The mineral staking withdrawals for the Integrated Management Areas were lifted April 1, 2020. However, anyone considering a project in the Peel must be aware that standards for environmental and cultural stewardship are higher in this area than they are on other Crown lands in Yukon. All mineral exploration and development proposals, including Class 1 notifications, will be subject to conformity checks to ensure compliance with the Plan. Proposals and notifications that do not comply with the Plan will not proceed until they are brought into conformity. The Parties to the Peel Watershed Regional Land Use Plan are committed to honouring the commitments they have made to each other and the people of Yukon.            The tremendous work to finalize the Peel Regional Land Use Plan was a high point in Yukon’s history, and the hard work to implement the plan is following in this same path of positive collaboration. The plan provides clarity for conservation and resource activity in the region, and we will continue to work together to ensure that the special values of the Peel are maintained forever.      Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources Ranj Pillai            The Peel Land Use Plan has been a long journey for all of us, and we are pleased to finally reach the first steps of implementation through a collaborative approach on activities for Integrated Management and Special Management Areas. Although the standards are robust, we need to ensure we leave a good legacy for future generations and the ability to use the Peel region in a way that we are able to use it today.      Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in Chief Roberta Joseph            We are happy to be working with the Government of Yukon and our fellow First Nations to introduce new standards for industrial development in the Peel that respect the values of our ancestors. One hundred years from now our great-great-grandchildren will be proud of what we’ve done.      First Nation of Na-Cho Nyäk Dun Chief Simon Mervyn             The Peel Watershed Regional Land Use Plan is the result of years of hard work by our people in collaboration with our neighbouring First Nations and the Yukon Government. It ensures our current and future generations would enjoy the same rights as we do today. Implementation is the next important step. The Gwich’in Tribal Council looks forward to continued collaboration in ensuring the Peel Watershed is managed with the respect for Gwich’in values.      Gwich’in Tribal Council Grand Chief Bobbie Jo Greenland-Morgan            Public support from Yukoners for the protection of the Peel has been substantial and unwavering. We saw this for years as Yukoners defended the preservation of its beautiful landscape and we saw it during the public signing ceremony of the Peel Watershed Regional Land Use Plan. We’ve made great strides in implementing the Plan, but we’re not at the finish line yet, and we know we have the support of the public to ensure the spirit and intent of the plan are implemented, fully and truly.      Vuntut Gwitchin Chief Dana Tizya-Tramm            Quick facts       Prior to these changes, the Peel Watershed planning region was withdrawn from mineral staking to varying degrees since 2010.  New withdrawal orders also apply to oil and gas dispositions.   The Governments of Yukon, Nacho Nyak Dun, Tr’ondëk Hwëch’in, Vuntut Gwitchin, and Gwich’in Tribal Council are committed to jointly implementing the recommendations in the Plan, and making land and resource decisions that are consistent with the goals and General Management Direction of the Plan. For example: 		Adequate baseline data, for example; heritage resource, fish, wildlife, waterbird, habitat, water quality, will be required prior to any development. New surface access will require sufficient bonding to achieve full reclamation. Public access on new roads will not be allowed. No development activities will be allowed in important subsistence harvesting and current community use areas, or in areas with important cultural and heritage resources. Any all-season infrastructure must be located a minimum of 100 meters from wetlands and lakes. Activities must not be carried out in sensitive over-wintering and spawning areas. Cumulative surface disturbance will be limited by predetermined thresholds. Activities will be monitored and limits to cumulative impacts established and enforced.

Eligible businesses can apply for a grant of up to $30,000 per month to cover fixed costs from March 23 to May 22, 2020. The program is in line with the recommendation from the recently established Business Advisory Council. The Government of Yukon is working with industry organizations and the local business community to support Yukon businesses and workers impacted by COVID-19. The Government of Yukon continues to work with the Government of Canada to assess economic impacts and support our economy. This program is the latest Government of Yukon initiative to support Yukon’s business sector and is anticipated to cost up to $10 million. This brings the government’s economic supports to as much as $21.7 million. Other supports include the Paid Sick Leave Program, the Temporary Support for Events Funding Program as well as changes to the Yukon Nominee Program previously announced.              Yukon businesses need support to manage through this difficult time. The measures necessary to protect the health and safety of Yukoners in response to COVID-19 are having a significant impact on Yukon’s businesses. This funding provides needed relief to businesses experiencing hardship and enhance their ability to rebound in the future.

Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley has the following updates for the Yukon public on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, April 8, at 3 p.m. the number of cases of COVID-19 in Yukon is eight. The eighth case is in a rural Yukon community. The patient is self-isolating and doing well at home. This case is linked to international travel. Four of the eight people who have contracted COVID-19 in Yukon have now recovered and no one has had to go to a hospital. Information about COVID-19 tests is published regularly on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered. Identifying rural communities where COVID-19 is present When a case is diagnosed in a rural community, the Office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health will not publicly identify the community. This commitment is made for several reasons including the need to protect the personal health information and privacy of the individual and anyone affected. Individual cases that are contained do not increase the risk to the public. There is concern that if communities are identified, the community or people who are affected may be stigmatized. If there are specific places where contact may have occurred and contacts are unknown, those locations may need to be posted regardless of the community. Easter weekend  Yukoners are reminded to do what they can to help stop the spread of COVID-19 over the Easter weekend so the territory remains free of known community transmission. This means staying close to home, avoiding activities that risk the need for emergency services to be called out and keeping a safe, two-metre distance from anyone who’s not a member of the same household. People should do grocery and other shopping alone as much as possible and not play sports or games with people who are not from the same household. However, Yukoners who are healthy and not self-isolating should not take this to mean they cannot see local family and friends who are not vulnerable to infection. Yukoners connecting with others should keep safely spaced at all times, practise greater hygiene and avoid gatherings of more than 10 people. As announced on March 22, people are strongly advised not to travel to Yukon rural communities unless their journey is essential. Playgrounds Healthy Yukoners are also reminded that they may go to local parks and playgrounds to get fresh air and play as long as they keep safely spaced from anyone who’s not in their household. As territorial campgrounds are closed, the playgrounds in these sites are also closed. Doctor appointments People with ailments or conditions not related to COVID-19 are encouraged to call their doctors for appointments in the usual way. They can talk to their doctor by phone and their doctor will determine whether a face to face appointment is necessary. Anyone who thinks they have COVID-19 symptoms should call Yukon HealthLine 811 or use the COVID-19 self-assessment tool on Yukon.ca. Schools With face-to-face classes suspended for the rest of the school year, parents and caregivers are encouraged to help children continue to learn but in the role of a guide rather than putting pressure on themselves to step into the role of a teacher.  Tips for supporting children at this challenging time include talking to them about COVID-19 while also restricting their access to online news about the pandemic, maintaining a regular daily structure and teaching children the basics of increased hygiene while not becoming upset if they forget.

The Government of Yukon has signed a contract with eSolutions Group to develop an online eProcurement system that will decrease paper bids, flag compliance errors for bidders, and improve spending analysis across government. The new online system will streamline the procurement process with features including: Electronic bidding that includes business registration, tender notifications and electronic submissions for suppliers; Contract creation that meets the standards of government financial systems; Spend analytics for reporting and planning, leading to more strategic procurement and greater transparency; and Vendor performance review program management that includes a two-way evaluation and tracking of contract performance. The eProcurement system will launch this summer with a phased implementation. Businesses currently registered on the Tender Management System will receive training as part of the transition to the new system.

Student learning will continue through alternative learning opportunities starting on April 16 for the remainder of the school year. Yukon Learning Continuity Requirements have been developed and shared with Yukon schools to inform plans for at-home learning throughout the territory. The Department of Education worked with the British Columbia Ministry of Education and a committee of educators and central administration staff to develop the new requirements. School principals and teachers are using these requirements to identify essential learning that needs to be covered for the remainder of the school year, develop learning plans to ensure continued learning and communicate with students and families. Schools are currently planning how to deliver at-home student learning with traditional and online resources. Learning plans are being tailored to the unique needs of each individual school community and will incorporate a variety of ways to provide learning opportunities, including for families who may not have access to technology. These plans may look different in each Yukon school. Each school will work with families before April 15 on how they will deliver at-home learning and complete the most essential learning starting April 16 through the remainder of the school year.            The health and safety of students, staff and communities is our first priority. The dedicated staff in Yukon schools are working diligently to adapt and ensure student learning continues during this unprecedented time. I want to acknowledge and thank the educators, principals and central administration staff for all their efforts to support student learning. I also want to thank and acknowledge the efforts of students, parents and families for their patience and understanding as we all adjust to new realities. Together we will continue to meet the learning needs of Yukon students.      Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee            I have worked closely with the Department of Education to reach the best decision for the protection of students and staff. Learning and health will always be partners. Even as face to face classes are suspended, the learning will continue.  It will be challenging for all, for teachers, students and parents and guardians, but by taking this step now, we are protecting the future.      Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley            Quick facts       Schools will prioritize essential learning for the remainder of the school year based on the following principles for each grade level: Learning Together and Early Kindergarten (K4): Provide opportunities and resources for students to engage in learning through play, inquiry and hands-on experiences while supporting gross and fine motor development, oral language and social skills. Assign about three hours for each student per week to engage in this type of learning.  Kindergarten to Grade 6:  Provide opportunities and resources for students to engage in building literacy and numeracy skills across the subject areas and the personal and social competencies of the curriculum. Assign about five hours of work per week for each student.  Grades 7 to 9:  Provide opportunities and resources for students to engage in building literacy and numeracy skills across the subject areas and the personal and social competencies of the curriculum. Assign about ten hours of work per week for each student.  Grades 10 to 12:  Provide activities, resources and supports for students to develop the learning standards’ competencies and understandings prioritized so students have the opportunity to be successful in all their current courses. Assign about three hours of work per course for each student each week. Work with Grade 12 students to identify those who need to complete the Grade 10 numeracy assessment and ensure they meet this requirement.

191,2020-04-06,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/parks-and-campgrounds-opening-delayed-until-june,Government Website,Parks and campgrounds opening delayed until June,"           Published 06/04/2020        The Government of Yukon is delaying the opening of territorial parks and campgrounds and sale of camping permits until June to protect the public, staff and communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. All campgrounds and facilities that were open, but un-serviced, are now closed until further notice. The Government of Yukon will continue to work with the office of the Chief Medical Officer of Health and reassess the situation in May to determine if opening parks and campgrounds is in the best interest of Yukoners’ health and safety. People may still use park trails and green spaces for recreation while practising physical distancing and following other requirements of the Chief Medical Officer of Health. Please use significant caution engaging in any activities that could put you at risk of not following physical distancing or put you in a position that requires outside assistance. Backcountry activities are strongly discouraged in order to keep rescue and safety resources available during this time. Yukoners are being asked to avoid popular recreation areas where physical distancing may not be possible or where people may find themselves in a gathering greater then 10 people. Yukoners are also reminded to remove all garbage when using trails and green spaces.            We know camping and being in our parks is beloved by Yukoners and delaying the opening is a tough decision to make. We need to put the health and safety of users and staff first and will carefully reassess the situation in the coming weeks. My hope is that the efforts being taken now to curb the spread of COVID-19 will put us in a position to open campgrounds later this year.      Minister of Environment Pauline Frost            Quick facts       Yukon’s system of territorial parks includes wilderness parks, campgrounds, recreation sites and others.  The Government of Yukon maintains 42 campgrounds with more than 1,000 campsites, 12 recreation sites and six larger wilderness parks like Tombstone. Campgrounds are normally fully serviced from May 15 to September 13, and 12 select campgrounds from May 8 to September 27.  The use of territorial parks has more than doubled in the past decade. Use of campgrounds increased 103 per cent and backcountry camping in Tombstone territorial park increased 137 per cent.    The Government of Yukon is working to finalize the Yukon Parks Strategy. The strategy will outline strategic actions and priorities for the next 10 years.

As of 8 a.m. on Monday, April 6, Civil Emergency Measures Act (CEMA) Enforcement Officers have been placed at Yukon borders and at the Whitehorse airport as a measure to ensure that all travelers have the information they need to keep themselves and Yukoners safe from the spread of COVID-19. These Government of Yukon enforcement officers will be collecting contact information of all travelers coming through Yukon or returning home, details of their 14-day self-isolation plans, and declarations of any symptoms of COVID-19. This information will allow CEMA Enforcement Officers to follow up and ensure that travelers are following self-isolation rules. CEMA Enforcement Officers will be stationed at: Weigh scales on the Alaska Highway south of Watson Lake Weigh scales at the junction of the Alaska Highway and the Stewart-Cassiar Highway Whitehorse airport The CEMA Enforcement Officers are also coordinating support for these measures with Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) and officials in the Northwest Territories (NWT) for the following border crossings: Fraser, BC border crossing Pleasant Camp, BC border crossing Beaver Creek border crossing Yukon-NWT border on the Dempster Highway Anyone traveling into or through Yukon is required to self-isolate for 14 days. People transiting through Yukon to Alaska, NWT or other parts of Canada are required to complete their transit in Yukon within 24 hours of their entry, and shall avoid unnecessary contact with others when they stop for food or fuel. All Yukoners are reminded to practice safe physical distancing and to stay two metres (six feet) away from people outside of their household, wash their hands regularly, and cough or sneeze into your elbow or a tissue.      Quick facts       The Beaver Creek boarder is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The Fraser boarder is open from 8 a.m. to midnight, seven days a week. The Pleasant Camp border is open from 8 a.m. to midnight, seven days a week.   Conservation Officers and Natural Resources Officers are being deployed at the Watson Lake border crossings to act as Civil Emergency Measures Act (CEMA) enforcement officers. These officers have the necessary training from their substantive duties and are also being trained on their additional authorities under the Civil Emergency Measures Act.   Other government officials are being utilized at Whitehorse Airport to meet incoming flights.  There will be no enforcement officers at the border between Atlin, BC and Yukon, as Atlin residents are exempted from the need to self-isolate, as long as they haven’t traveled outside of Yukon or Atlin in the past 14 days. The same exemptions also apply to residents of Lower Post, Fire Side, Jade City, Fraser and Pleasant Camp.  Plans are in place to make sure that services of Conservation Officers and Natural Resources Officers will also continue.

193,2020-04-06,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/april-6-2020-yukons-chief-medical-officer-health-provides-update-covid-19,Government Website,"April 6, 2020: Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health provides update on COVID-19","           Published 06/04/2020        Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley has the following updates for the Yukon public on measures being taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, April 6, at 3 p.m. the number of cases of COVID-19 in Yukon is seven. Four of the seven people who have contracted COVID-19 have now recovered and all others are isolating and doing well at home. No Yukon cases have required medical treatment. Information about COVID-19 tests is published regularly on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered. Contact tracing Whenever new cases of COVID-19 occur in the territory that can be traced to a particular person, the Government of Yukon will contact anyone who has had close contact with that individual. This is called contact tracing and is a normal, precautionary step in the response to any infectious disease, not just COVID-19. Yukoners who have had close contact with someone who is infected will be notified individually and the steps they need to take will be explained to them directly, such as monitoring themselves for symptoms and self-isolating. The risk of infection is determined case by case by Yukon Communicable Disease Control. COVID-19 transmission Yukon continues to have no known cases of community transmission. All identified infections in the territory so far are connected to travel outside Yukon or to known contacts. Community transmission occurs when it is no longer possible to trace how somebody became infected. Physical spacing measures are people’s best protection against unknown community transmission. With global information about COVID-19 growing each day there is now evidence that some infected people can transmit the virus before they develop symptoms and also that some people who never develop symptoms can also transmit the virus. Personal protective equipment Yukon is not facing a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). To help manage resources, PPE supplies in the territory have been centralized and health care workers are following protocols so that equipment is neither over-used nor under-used. Supplies of medical masks must continue to be given to health care workers so they can wear them during medical procedures and when they care for people who are infected. Wearing a non-medical mask such as a homemade cloth mask in the community has not been proven to protect the person wearing it. However, using non-medical mask or facial covering can be an additional measure people can take to protect others around them. It also helps people to be aware of not spreading infection and remember to not touch their face. Wearing a non-medical mask when in public or other settings is not a replacement for following proven measures such as hand washing and safe spacing. Safe Easter recreation Yukoners are strongly advised to choose less risky outdoor activities close to home this Easter weekend. The territory’s first responders and medical system workers need to be available to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic rather than attend to outdoor activity injuries. Latest information A range of information in response to people’s queries about the pandemic is being added today to Yukon.ca. To keep up to date with the latest information, Yukoners are encouraged to visit Yukon.ca/COVID-19.

The Government of Yukon will cover staff wages as well as eligible building expenses, including rent, utilities and cleaning costs. The funding will support child care operators and enable them to avoid charging parent fees as Yukon responds to the COVID-19 pandemic. If a child care centre remains open, the Direct Operating Grant will provide 100 per cent of eligible building costs for March, April, May and June 2020, as well as wages for all working staff, including the employer’s contribution for Employment Insurance, the Canada Pension Plan and the Yukon Workers’ Compensation Health and Safety Board. If a child care centre is closed, the grant will cover 100 per cent of eligible building costs for March, April, May and June 2020. Staff are encouraged to access supports from the Government of Canada. If a family day home remains open, its grant will increase by 50 per cent for March, April, May and June 2020 and it will receive full funding for all established spaces regardless of whether the spaces are full. If a day home is closed, the grant will suspend until it reopens. Owners are encouraged to access supports from the federal government until they can reopen. Child care operators may also be eligible for additional financial support for supplies or services they require to operate during the COVID-19 response. Operators are encouraged to work with their child care inspector to determine eligibility. At this time, parents and guardians who typically rely on child care services are asked to keep their children at home if possible. Parents who are working from home should keep their children with them. This will make spaces available for people who provide essential services or who cannot work from home.            Child care is an essential service for vulnerable children and families as well as the workers who must continue to do their jobs as we manage the spread of COVID-19. Our government is committed to supporting child care operators to continue to provide services during this challenging time in a way that ensures the health and safety of both staff and children.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Quick facts       Several child care operators have space available for Yukon families in need of child care services for essential workers only. Up-to-date information, including a list of operators with space for children, will be available online soon.  Yukon Communicable Disease Control and Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health have provided child care operators with a public health guidance document called Enhanced measures at Yukon child care facilities during the COVID-19 crisis. It details measures to assist our centres and day homes in remaining open, to help maintain a safe and healthy environment and to minimize the risk of COVID-19 in Yukon  Parents and guardians are being asked to complete a daily screening questionnaire before they take their children to a day care. If certain criteria are met, parents and guardians will be asked to keep their children at home.

The Government of Yukon will provide 325 phones with capability for voice and internet access to vulnerable women for the next four months. This will give women options to safely access the support they need. Physical distancing and self-isolation measures mean that individuals may be required to stay in close quarters with someone who is violent. The closure of some public spaces and community service agencies has limited the ability to access safe internet connections, which are key to getting support, contacting family and friends, accessing counselling and accessing financial support. Mobile phones with internet access will help address this need. The Yukon Status of Women Council will be working with other community partners to distribute the phones to women who do not currently have cell phone or internet access, with a focus on those who are experiencing violence or at risk of violence.            In light of COVID-19, people are acting responsibly by practising social distancing, staying home and self-isolating when needed. Although this is important, it may cause unsafe situations for people who are experiencing violence, are at risk or who need support. This program provides a way for women to access supports, connect with their loved ones and apply for emergency funding programs. I am so grateful for this partnership to make this program available to those in need.      Minister responsible for the Women’s Directorate Jeanie Dendys             It is imperative that Yukon women have access to the internet - especially those living in precarious situations. As the COVID-19 situation evolves, more stringent lockdown measures will have a disproportionate impact on marginalized women. One of the only access points to basic necessities and service like money, food, medication, information - and for some, safety itself - will be through an internet or phone connection.      Director of the Yukon Status of Women Council Aja Mason            Quick facts       Rates of violence against women in Yukon are three times higher than the national average.  One out of three women experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime. Women make up the majority of victims of domestic violence, with LGBTQ2S+ individuals also facing elevated rates of domestic violence. During times of crisis like COVID-19, risk of gender-based violence escalates.  Yukoners can drop off working cell phones that are no longer needed to the Yukon Status of Women Council office at 308 Hanson Street in Whitehorse.  Victims of sexualized violence can call the Sexualized Assault Support Line at 1-844-967-7275.  Anyone interested in donating a phone should contact the Yukon Status of Women Council at aja.mason@yswc.ca to make arrangements.

COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, April 3, at 3 p.m. the number of cases of COVID-19 in Yukon remains at six. Four of the six people who contracted COVID-19 have now recovered and all others are isolating and doing well at home. No Yukon cases have required medical treatment. Yukon continues to have no documented cases of community transmission. All identified infections in the territory so far are connected to travel outside Yukon or to known contacts.

Information about COVID-19 tests is published regularly on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered. Legal orders As announced by the Government of Yukon on April 2, 2020, Yukoners should be aware that all orders put in place by the Yukon Chief Medical Officer in response to the pandemic are enforceable by law. This announcement about enforcement measures was in recognition of the vulnerability of communities throughout Yukon and will help clarify the rules for anyone who is uncertain about what they and others can and cannot legally do. The enforceable orders require that: everyone who enters Yukon must self-isolate for 14 days; all essential services workers must self-isolate in a place other than a work camp or mine; all people entering Yukon must provide contact information and details of their self-isolation plan and declare they don’t have any COVID-19 symptoms; no more than 10 people can gather in the same place unless they live together; all restaurants that remain open must only provide take out; all bars must close; dental visits are limited to emergency only; and all personal service businesses such as hair salons, tattoo parlours and massage therapy must close. Special provisions and requirements are now in place for critical service providers, people travelling through Yukon and people who live in the BC-Yukon border area who haven’t travelled out of the territory or border area in the last 14 days. Travellers are only allowed to be in Yukon for 24 hours as they pass through. Recommendations To help protect Yukoners since the start of the pandemic, the Chief Medical Officer of Health has made several strong recommendations as well as orders. These recommendations include: not travelling to rural communities or outside the territory unless it’s essential; practicing greater hygiene and always keeping at least two meters apart from others unless they’re part of the same household; working from home when possible; and avoiding non-essential treatment at hospitals.  Hospital care Yukoners are reminded that hospitals are still very safe places to seek care. If people need to see a doctor for their illness, medical condition or injury they should call 811 first. If they’re advised to go to Emergency then they should do so. Yukoners should also be aware that no hospital visitors are allowed except in limited circumstances and that active screening is in place at the entrances to all hospitals. Screeners have the difficult but important job of ensuring people have access to urgent care and keeping everyone safe. This means they may have to redirect people to other health service or turn away visitors. This is not an easy measure to enforce and Yukoners are asked to be understanding that these steps are being taken to ensure everyone’s safety. Rural communities To help protect rural communities in Yukon from the pandemic, the Chief Medical Officer of Health also now strongly recommends that all service providers engage with local or municipal and First Nations governments before they enter any communities. A Government of Yukon team is being established to support this engagement. Work is also underway to help ensure that Yukoners across the territory are kept up to date with COVID-19 developments and advice in a range of ways, in recognition that not everyone has easy access to online information. Critical and essential services To support orders and recommendations made by Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health during the pandemic, the Government of Yukon has published guidelines that explain what critical and essential services are in the context of the pandemic and state the measures that businesses and workers must take to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the territory. Critical workers are defined as those whose services are necessary to preserve life, health and the basic running of society, such as health care, emergency services, energy, water and food. Essential workers are defined as those whose services support the infrastructure needed for the health, safety and economic wellbeing of Yukoners, such as transportation, construction, and information and communication technologies. The new guidelines also identify other services that are essential, for example, long-term care facility workers, child care workers, veterinarians and cleaning services. Guidance on self-isolating  Yukoners who are self-isolating are reminded that they may go outdoors for fresh air or exercise and to carry out urgent errands such as collecting medication if no one else can do this for them, as long as they keep a distance of at least two meters – or six feet – from other people. Safe spacing is not a law in Yukon but a strong recommendation and common sense during the pandemic. All Yukoners have a responsibility to help stop the spread of COVID-19 with the territory.

They have been negotiating through a joint settlement committee since August 2015. The two parties worked collaboratively through this committee to resolve issues that were raised during the court case about French First Language education in Yukon. The settlement committee was composed of six members, three nominated by each party. The Government of Yukon and Commission scolaire francophone du Yukon worked together to clarify the roles and responsibilities in managing French First Language education in Yukon in a way that respects the requirements of both the Yukon Education Act and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in regard to minority language education rights. A significant outcome of this process has been the agreement on building a new French First Language secondary school, which will provide additional learning spaces, including a gymnasium, and facilities for these programs and the community.            The settlement of this case is a very positive achievement. Our government worked with the Commission scolaire francophone du Yukon to make important changes for French First Language education in Yukon. I am proud of the renewed partnership and look forward to our work together to support French First Language students, and all students in Yukon.      Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee            We are very pleased to have reached a settlement with the Government of Yukon. Through the various agreements we have negotiated, we have created a made-in-Yukon solution and established a solid foundation for the partnership between the CSFY and the Government of Yukon for the provision of French First Language education programs in the territory. We look forward to continuing our collaboration to support our students and their learning while respecting minority education rights.      Commission scolaire francophone du Yukon President Jean-Sébastien Blais            Quick facts       The court case was filed in 2009 regarding the Government of Yukon’s obligations under s.23 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

This now ensures that orders given by the Chief Medical Officer of Health are enforceable under the Civil Emergency Measures Act. Today’s action also defines critical and essential services in a new set of guidelines. The guidelines will provide Yukoners and critical service providers the clarity needed to determine who can safely travel and work throughout the territory. To date, the Chief Medical Officer of Health has given several orders, including orders to self-isolate upon return to Yukon from travel, closing bars, defining gathering sizes and limiting restaurants to take-out service only. These and other orders issued are now enforceable under the Civil Emergency Measures Act which means government can issue fines and possibly jail time if individuals do not comply. The Government of Yukon will be requiring travellers who enter Yukon by land or air to stop upon entry and complete a travel declaration and check in with an enforcement officer before entering the territory. This will ensure that proper self-isolation measures and orders shared with every traveller and can be enforced if necessary. Non-residents who must transit through Yukon to Alaska or Northwest Territories or another part of Canada may do so but may only remain in Yukon for no more than 24 hours. Yukon’s Emergency Coordination Centre is preparing to implement enforcement at entry points to Yukon, which will be mobilized in the coming days. Also being released today is the Government of Yukon’s guidelines for critical, essential and non-essential service workers. This guidelines document will help local and non-local workers understand how to comply with the rules and protect themselves and Yukoners from COVID-19. The requirement for self-isolation applies to all essential services workers, with a limited number of exemptions for residents of specified BC-Yukon border communities and critical service workers who must cross the border, outlined within the orders issued under the Civil Emergency Measures Act.            Protecting Yukoners and Yukon communities from the spread of COVID-19 is our highest priority right now. The steps we are taking today enforce the orders made by the Chief Medical Officer of Health, and provide clearer guidance to Yukoners who are wondering how they should continue to do their jobs. We are taking tangible steps to protect Yukoners and Yukon communities while also continuing to offer the critical services Yukoners and our neighbours in BC-Yukon border communities need.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            Yukoners have been taking great strides to protect our communities and I thank them for all of the sacrifices they are making. That said, there will always be individuals who see themselves as exempt from these orders. Today’s action gives government the ability to enforce and penalize people who do not comply. We must all work to keep Yukon safe.      Minister of Justice Tracy McPhee            Quick facts       A full list of the Chief Medical Officer of Health’s orders and advice can be found on Yukon.ca/changes-legislation-covid-19. Orders are enforceable under the Civil Emergency Measures Act. Advice or recommendations are not enforceable. The Government of Yukon strongly encourages Yukoners to follow all recommendations from the Chief Medical Officer of Health to the best of their abilities.  Anyone entering Yukon will need to check in with an enforcement officer and fill out an information card that includes their destination, contact information and any stops along the way. This will allow enforcement officers to follow up to ensure self-isolation measures are properly taken.  An individual who is not a resident in Yukon may transit through the territory to their final destination, and may not remain in Yukon for more than 24 hours after entry.  Critical and essential service providers are those whose work is to offer the provision of healthcare, food, water, emergency services, infrastructure, utilities, transportation, communications, and government. Find a full list of critical and essential workers on Yukon.ca/essential-critical-services-covid-19  Critical and essential workers are required to follow orders from the Chief Medical Officer of Health as far as is practicable. Where that is not possible, workers and entities delivering critical services must adhere to strict health and safety protocols.  People in Atlin, Lower Post, Fraser, Jade City, Fireside or Pleasant Camp are exempt from the 14-day self-isolation period, provided they have not traveled outside of Yukon or their home community in the past 14 days.  Residents of rural Yukon communities are advised to limit their visits to Whitehorse if possible, and to work together with neighbours to coordinate picking up groceries or supplies.

COVID-19 cases and recoveries As of today, April 1, at 3 p.m. there are six cases of COVID-19 in Yukon. The new case is linked to international travel. The individual followed all proper protocols, self-isolated and is recovering at home. Three of the six people who contracted COVID-19 have now recovered and all others are doing well on home isolation. Information about COVID-19 tests is published regularly on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending, the total number of tests and how many people have recovered. Air travellers Air North staff are greeting all travellers arriving at Erik Neilson Whitehorse International Airport with any airline to give them guidance and instruct them that they must self-isolate for 14 days and monitor themselves for symptoms. Passengers also receive guidance before they deplane and COVID-19 information is displayed on airport screens. All people arriving in Yukon are ordered to go straight home and into self-isolation for 14 days. If they cannot safely self-isolate at home, they should contact COVID19info@gov.yk.ca to be linked with the team supporting people who cannot self-isolate at home. Support for vulnerable people Several measures are in place at the Government of Yukon’s Whitehorse Emergency Shelter to help keep guests and staff safe during the pandemic. This includes actively monitoring guests for symptoms of COVID-19 and reducing the number of people gathering in the shelter at the same time, while still providing essential services and prioritizing people who are most in need. Whitehorse Emergency Shelter staff are also carrying out safe spacing and additional cleaning to prevent the spread of infection and are educating guests about physical distancing, increased hygiene and coughing etiquette. Staff have accommodation ready for guests who may need to isolate and are helping people who don’t require additional support to find alternative, temporary accommodation. In addition, the Government of Yukon is sharing guidance and resources such as a screening tool with non-governmental organizations across the territory that provides services for homeless people and those at risk of homelessness so they can help protect clients, staff and volunteers. Work camp guidelines Guidelines have been issued for work camps during the pandemic, including how to help staff who have symptoms or who are required to self-isolate, how to practice safe spacing and enhanced hygiene, and how to handle food. It is recommended that employers pay staff who need to self-isolate as this will help ensure that staff report any COVID-19 symptoms and follow isolation protocols. Mining camp workers arriving in Yukon are reminded that they are required to self-isolate for 14 days before they start work.

Minister Pillai announced the Temporary Support for Events Funding Program, which will help businesses recover certain costs from the cancellation of major events due to COVID-19. Major events are those which would have had gatherings of more than 50 people, such as the Arctic Winter Games or Yukon Native Hockey Tournament. These costs relate specifically to perishable goods and the cancellation of accommodation and services. All eligible Yukon businesses and NGOs may apply. The Government of Yukon is taking a targeted approach to supporting Yukon businesses and workers impacted by COVID-19. We continue to work with all stakeholders, including the Government of Canada, to assess the economic impacts and support our economy.            The Government of Yukon continues to develop and implement measures to actively support Yukon businesses and NGOs during this challenging time. This support program targets losses around the cancellation of major events, such as the Arctic Winter Games. This is the latest in a series of measures our government has implemented to support Yukon’s economy, and we will continue to listen and act quickly to support our local economy during these unprecedented times.      Minister of Economic Development Ranj Pillai            Quick facts       This program is part of the stimulus package announced by the Government of Yukon on March 16 to support businesses and workers.

The Independent Expert Panel requested this extension, citing circumstantial challenges due to COVID-19 as the reason for this request.  Most members of the comprehensive review secretariat, including the director, have been called to work on a response to COVID-19 by various agencies including the Government of Yukon. Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost granted the panel’s requested extension, moving the deadline from March 31 to April 30, 2020.            We are all affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As we work together to mitigate the effects this will have on Yukoners, other projects may be impacted. This extension will allow key staff to continue important work to prevent the spread of COVID-19. We are thankful to the Panel for all the work they have done and are looking forward to reviewing their final report on April 30.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Quick facts       The comprehensive review is an assessment of Yukon’s health and social services systems, including key cost drivers and areas for improved coordination and integration of services.

COVID-19 cases and test results As of today, March 30, at 3 p.m. there are five cases of COVID-19 in Yukon. All five people are doing well at home. Information about COVID-19 tests is published regularly on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending and the total number of tests. Hospital preparedness Whitehorse General Hospital continues to prepare for the pandemic. They are planning now on how to potentially accommodate a high volume of COVID-19 patients, including identifying other facilities where care could be provided. They are also putting physical distancing measures in place and planning for the effective management of resources such as staff, equipment and supplies. Contact tracing People who test positive for COVID-19 may have a history of a flight or flights within the preceding 14 days. In such cases, the Government of Yukon will use information from the airline, when available, to contact only the people on that flight who were sitting specifically within the range of the infected individual. People identified within that range are directly contacted and required to monitor themselves for symptoms. If they develop symptoms they must immediately self-isolate and contact Yukon Communicable Disease Control. This is a precautionary approach to account for any possible transmission on flights and avoids the publication of flight information. When flight manifest information is not available, the public posting of flight information may be required. Safe spacing Keeping two metres apart from other people is one of the most effective ways to help stop the spread of COVID-19. This behaviour has been referred to as “social distancing” but this language is shifting to the phrases “physical distancing” and “safe spacing” as that wording is clearer and easier for people to visualize and act on. Yukoners are reminded that other powerful ways to help stop the spread of COVID-19 are frequent handwashing, covering coughs and sneezes, and avoiding face touching.

Where possible, we are asking the public to clean and store recycling until services resume. Alternatively, put your recycling in your household waste. E-waste drop-offs at Raven Recycling and rural recycling depots will remain open during this time. The introduction of tipping fees at the waste facilities in Carcross, Tagish, Mount Lorne, Marsh Lake and Deep Creek will be delayed until recycling services resume. Meanwhile, illegal dumping fines will increase on April 1, 2020. Increasing fines for offences under the Environment Act and the Solid Waste Regulations are needed because fines are out of date and too low to be a meaningful penalty.            Suspending recycling services is not something we would have hoped for. However, we all need to take every measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the territory. We encourage Yukoners to stay two metres apart from other people when they go to the dump, and to wash their hands thoroughly before and after their visit. Now is a great time to be creative about re-using your recyclables - for example, you could use egg cartons for seed trays as we get ready for spring gardening.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            The Government of Yukon has set significant penalties to discourage illegal dumping. There is no place for garbage and hazardous waste in our wild spaces, ditches or waterways. While these fines were planned to take effect before having to respond to COVID-19, we appreciate the extra diligence and effort from Yukoners to manage their waste legally and responsibly.        Minister of Environment Pauline Frost            Quick facts       Some rural depots may have already closed. Contact your local recycling depot to make sure they are open before you plan to drop off your recycling.  Unlawful handling/disposing of solid waste is going up from $200 to $1,000. Littering is going up from $50 to $500. Find a full list of fines on Yukon.ca/en/illegal-dumping  Whitehorse Blue Bin Recycling will continue to offer roadside collection of paper products only.  Raven Recycling closed their public drop off on March 25. P&M Recycling also closed their depot on March 23.  If you are choosing to store your recycling until services resume, make sure it is in a cool, dry, indoor location, secure from wildlife.  Do not leave your refundable bottles or beverage containers at the recycling depot. Choose to store them securely until recycling resumes or put them in your household garbage.

The money then went back into trust to support Yukon First Nations, in accordance to Skookum Jim’s will. The Daisy Mason Wellness Fund will be awarded on June 21, 2020 on National Indigenous Peoples day.            I am so happy that we are helping Skookum Jim’s vision come to life.

COVID-19 cases and test results As of today, March 27, at 3 p.m. there are four cases of COVID-19 in Yukon. All four people are doing well at home. Information about COVID-19 tests is published regularly on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many tests have been negative, how many results are pending and the total number of tests. Managing COVID-19 cases As new cases of COVID-19 occur, those who are connected to infected people will continue to be traced and informed so they can take the necessary measures of monitoring themselves for symptoms for up to 14 days. Yukoners are urged to behave as if COVID-19 is already in their community. They should continue to keep a physical distance of two meters or six feet from each other and practice greater hygiene. Yukoners are also strongly advised to avoid passing on inaccurate information they may hear about cases of infection. This creates additional anxiety at a time when many people are already struggling to maintain their mental health.  Federal quarantine measures As many Yukoners will know, the Government of Canada now requires mandatory 14-day self-isolation for everyone entering Canada even if they do not have COVID-19 symptoms. Yukoners flying into Canada with symptoms must quarantine at their arrival destination. Yukoners flying into Canada who do not have symptoms may travel home to the territory where they must then follow Yukon requirements and self-isolate for 14 days. Dental services The Chief Medical Officer of Health is from today ordering the territory’s dental practices to suspend all non-urgent treatment until further notice. This is to protect Yukoners as well as dental care providers from the spread of infection. Patients with queries should contact their dental clinic. Mining industry guidance  Everyone arriving in Yukon must self-isolate for 14 days, including workers at placer or hard rock mines, exploration camps or conducting any other business or duty associated with the mining and exploration industry. Workers cannot carry out their regular duties in a camp or at a mine while they’re self-isolating. Further guidance for the mining industry is on Yukon.ca.

This does not indicate a significant change in circumstances or an increased risk to Yukoners but prepares the government to take rapid action if needed. Declaring a state of emergency will make deploying resources to protect Yukoners and limit the spread of COVID-19 more efficient. This move is in line with many provinces and territories across Canada. Cooperation with all public health measures is critical to the response to COVID-19. Limiting the spread of COVID-19 by closely observing all self-isolation orders is essential to keep this disease from spreading in the territory. The most up to date information on COVID-19 in Yukon can be found at yukon.ca/covid-19.            This action should not alarm Yukoners, it is to prepare a government to respond quickly to their needs. This measure is an important step will give us the tools we need to protect Yukoners and fight against the spread of COVID-19 now and in the future. Yukoners, you must follow the direction of the Chief Medical Officer of Health to protect our territory from the further spread of this virus.      Premier Sandy Silver             Quick facts       The Civil Emergency Measures Act gives the Government of Yukon the ability to act in a fluid and uncertain emergency.  A declaration under the Civil Emergency Measures Act lasts for 90 days but may be terminated before then.          Backgrounder   The Civil Emergency Measures Act (CEMA), when invoked, provides for a very wide-range of potential solutions in an emergency by Ministerial Order, or by regulation, made under its authority.  In Yukon, non-routine Ministerial Orders are traditionally signed only after Cabinet has reached consensus that it wishes the empowered Minister to do so. The CEMA can be invoked by Cabinet if it is of the opinion that a disaster, real or apprehended, resulting from epidemic whereby injury or loss is or may be caused to persons or property in Yukon. The CEMA is deliberately structured to provide the power to act in a fluid and uncertain emergency. Essentially, the government would be empowered (primarily through the Minister of Community Services) to “do all things considered advisable for the purpose of dealing with the emergency”, including but not limited to: 		protect people and property; maintain, clear and control the use of roads and streets; requisition or otherwise obtain and distribute accommodation, food, clothing and other services; provide and maintain water supplies, electrical power and sewage disposal; assist in the enforcement of law; fight and prevent fires; protect the health, safety and welfare of local inhabitants; and, put into effect any civil emergency plans.  Orders or regulations under the CEMA can override all other YG Acts except those with a special paramountcy clause including the Financial Administration Act, the Human Rights Act, and the Health Information and Privacy Management Act.   A declaration under CEMA is for 90 days but may be terminated before then or continued as needed. CEMA allows for municipalities to also declare states of emergencies, either during or outside of a Government of Yukon emergency.  When a state of emergency is in place, there are specified limits of liability in respect to actions taken or not taken in an emergency. Specifically persons operating under the authority of the Act are not liable for damage caused by interference with the rights of others and cannot be subjected to legal proceedings because of actions taken or not taken in respect to the emergency.

This decision is in response to concerns related to COVID-19 and travel restrictions across the country. The feasibility of the special guide licence lottery will be reassessed in late May. The delay still provides the Department of Environment sufficient time to accept applications and run the lottery prior to hunting season opening in August. The permit hunt authorization is expected carry on as planned this year. Applications will be open from April 23 to May 21, 2020. Hunters are encouraged to visit Yukon.ca for ongoing updates and to follow the advice from Yukon’s Chief Medical Officer of Health regarding travel recommendations and restrictions as well as social distancing practices when planning their hunts.

The Advanced Artist Award is increased by $75,000. This one-time increase makes $150,000 available at the April 1, 2020 intake to support artists to enhance their artistic professional development. The increased funding will not affect the October intake, which will still have the standard $75,000 available. The Arts Fund is increased by $125,000 and the Government of Yukon will be offering a one-time special intake in April for that amount. The special intake criteria will suspend the current threshold and allow applicants to apply for 100 per cent of eligible project expenses. The regular June, September and December intakes for the Arts Fund have not changed. In addition, the department of Tourism and Culture’s longstanding On Yukon Time funding program will have a special focus for the 2020–21 fiscal year. This $75,000 fund will invite applications for artistic initiatives that can be presented without people gathering; are formed as a reaction or contemplation of COVID-19 and its impacts; demonstrate community innovation; and/or celebrate community kindness and support. Awards of up to $2,500 will be available for individuals and $5,000 for businesses, not-for-profit organizations or collectives for arts-related initiatives.              Yukon’s arts and culture sectors are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic given the loss of income from closures of venues and cancellation of shows and events. These funding program increases and modifications are a practical and immediate way to provide financial support to artists at this time of lost revenue. I am confident that these measures will spark ingenuity and imaginative new ways to engage and create; providing hope, inspiration and an understanding of our society in these challenging times.      Minister of Tourism and Culture Jeanie Dendys            Quick facts       Advanced Artist Award - April 1, 2020 intake is now $150,000.  Arts Fund increased to $625,000 total with an additional April intake for $125,000. Applicants can apply for 100 per cent of project costs. Deadline to apply is April 20, 2020.  For 2020–21, the On Yukon Time funding program will make $75,000 available to support a broad range of arts-related activities. Deadline to apply is April 15, 2020.  On March 17, 2020 Minister Dendys announced that the department will honour all existing funding agreements for organizations and projects that may be cancelled or postponed as a result of safety measures related to COVID-19. This applies to museums and cultural centres as well as arts facilities, individual artists and non-profit organizations.

To make it easier for Yukon businesses to receive support for their tourism marketing efforts, the funding enhancement will see the Government of Yukon contribute 100 per cent of the costs of approved marketing activities in 2020–21. Revised guidelines and application forms will be available beginning May 1, 2020 at Yukon.ca/tourism-cooperative-marketing-fund. Activities in approved applications will be eligible retroactive to April 1, 2020.            Yukon tourism operators know that part of recovery will involve adapting marketing initiatives locally, domestically and internationally when the time is right. The increased funding and expanded eligibility will allow for greater promotional opportunities from a wider cross-section of our tourism sector, and help facilitate a strong resurgence.      Minister of Tourism and Culture Jeanie Dendys            Quick facts       Established in 2003, the Tourism Cooperative Marketing Fund typically makes $700,000 available to assist businesses and organizations with the promotion and marketing of Yukon tourism experiences and services to prospective visitors from outside the territory.  The fund is currently available to market and trade-ready tourism businesses (businesses that understand how to administer sales policies direct to consumers and through third party distribution channels), municipalities, destination marketing organizations and First Nations governments featuring tourism experiences.  The funding framework typically uses a 50/50 cost share program, meaning that applicants must contribute 50 per cent of the costs of the project or activity. To assist businesses in this difficult time, the requirement for applicants to contribute 50 per cent has been dropped as a one-time measure for the 2020–21 fiscal year.  The broadened scope of eligible projects and activities will enable businesses to also promote their services and experiences in Yukon. Previously, the fund focused on supporting businesses to promote themselves to visitors who had not yet arrived in the territory.

As a precaution, any individuals who attended these places on these days are to monitor themselves for the following symptoms for up to 14 days and call 811 if they develop them: Fever Cough Difficulty breathing As long as these individuals remain healthy and do not develop symptoms, there is no need to self-isolate and they should continue with their daily activities. Risk assessments have been completed and the risk to individuals from both of these possible exposures is low. Bethany Church If you attended these specific gatherings at Bethany Church on March 8 or 15, you may have been exposed to COVID-19: March 8: Sunday morning gathering or the “Kids Zone” March 15: Sunday morning gathering A person has tested positive for COVID-19 who attended these gatherings. They are recovering at home. There is no ongoing risk to the community, nor any future risk associated with Bethany Church.

These regulations prevent evictions over the next 90 days for residential tenants who are self-isolating or unable to pay their rent on time due to COVID-19. The regulations will also allow tenants to pay their rent late if they are unable to pay it when it is due. This is to support individuals who have lost their jobs, are experiencing a reduction in income or because they are under a health protection measure. Landlords are not be able to evict if the tenant or a member of their household is subject to a health protection measure.            These are uncertain times. The Chief Medical Officer of Health has advised that home is the safest place for Yukoners during the COVID-19 pandemic. These regulations protect Yukon tenants who need to stay home or who have lost their income. We are also committed to supporting landlords; we recognize they are being impacted. Now that these regulations are in place, we will reach out to work with them immediately      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            Quick facts       A tenant who has lost their job or had their income reduced as a result of COVID-19, will be able to end the tenancy early without penalty. This would free up the rental unit to tenants who are able to cover rent.  The tenant will have to pay the unpaid rent as soon as they are able to pay or after the 90 days, whichever comes first.   Landlords will be able to apply to the Residential Tenancies Office for exemption if their property or the safety of others is threatened by the tenant.  A landlord will not be able to enter a rental unit if the residents are under a health protection measure, except for reasons of safety.  Other jurisdictions have introduced similar legislation.

As of April 1, the Government of Yukon will provide ongoing funding for continuous glucose monitoring to all Yukoners with Type 1 Diabetes from age 2 to 18. The decision to provide permanent funding follows an evaluation of a 2018 pilot program for Yukoners with Type 1 Diabetes up to age 25. The pilot provided participants with access to funded continuous glucose monitors (CGM) for a period of two years. Pilot participants reported the program helped them better manage their conditions, improve their quality of life and reduce their financial burden. Yukoners aged 19 to 25 who were part of the pilot program will continue to receive funding for continuous glucose monitoring until a program is available for adults. A program for Yukoners with Type 1 Diabetes over age 18 is currently being developed.            We recognize the challenges that Yukoners with Type 1 Diabetes and their families face on a daily basis. The pilot program helped us understand how we can best support these families to live happy, healthy lives.

COVID-19 cases and test results As of today, March 25, at 10 a.m. there are three cases of COVID-19 in Yukon. This third case is related to travel outside of Yukon. The individual was tested on Monday, March 23 and test results were received this morning. The individual is doing well at home and contact tracing has begun. Information about COVID-19 tests is published regularly on Yukon.ca. This includes how many confirmed cases there are in Yukon, how many test have been negative, how many results are pending and the total number of tests. Services for hospital outpatients Yukon hospitals are suspending all non-urgent or routine services from Thursday, March 26. This includes bloodwork and lab tests, x-rays, CT scans and other imaging services, physiotherapy and occupational therapy, and specialist appointments. Yukoners should not go to a hospital for a non-urgent service, treatment or exam at this time. The hospitals continue to provide urgent emergency care. These measures are being taken to help the hospitals make sure they have enough staff and resources to respond to the pandemic and ensure only those who need to be in hospital are in a hospital. These steps also support their efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19 – and practice physical distancing from each other. Health care insurance  Clarification: Temporary absences have been extended to allow clients until June 30, 2020 to sign in with Insured Health and Hearing Services. People registering for the first time will be able to register by phone but will still have to fulfill a waiting period before being eligible for Yukon Health Care Insurance. Respiratory assessment centre The respiratory assessment centre in Whitehorse is now open to support people with acute respiratory illness such as influenza or COVID-19 who need medical assessment. Yukoners will be referred to the centre from 811, a family physician’s office, Yukon Communicable Disease Control or a hospital emergency department. Self-isolation  Yukoners and any visitors are reminded they must self-isolate for 14 days as soon as they arrive in Yukon if they have travelled within Canada or internationally. People must not stop to get groceries or make visits but go straight home and then arrange the support they need. Yukoners should also self-isolate if they have been identified as a close contact of someone diagnosed with COVID-19. Self-isolation means staying at home for 14 days, monitoring for symptoms and avoiding close contact with other people when going outside for fresh air. The term “quarantine” is not used in Yukon, as it is used by the Public Health Agency of Canada to mean a mandatory restriction of movement in a location determined by that agency. Yukon.ca Yukon.ca continues to be the central place to find information about the territory’s response to COVID-19 and is regularly updated to provide support for Yukoners.

Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            As your doctors we are committed to ensuring your healthcare is ongoing through this crisis. We are committed to providing safe care by adhering to social distancing practices in our clinics. We are asking Yukoners to be honest with us when screened for symptoms and exposures.

The two cases were confirmed Sunday morning. The two Whitehorse residents are from the same household. They returned from the United States last week and went into self-isolation. When symptoms presented, they contacted Yukon Communicable Disease for testing. They have mild illness and are continuing to self-isolate at home. Yukon’s CMOH said this does not change the level of risk to Yukoners and these first cases demonstrate that the systems that have been put in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19 work. The individuals closely followed the advice of the CMOH. The couple self-isolated, they contacted the appropriate health authorities for testing, have continued to self-isolate, and their test results were back within three days. Cooperation with all public health measures is critical to the response to COVID-19. Limiting the spread of COVID-19 by closely observing all self-isolation orders is essential to keep this disease from spreading in our territory. The most up-to-date information can be found at yukon.ca/covid-19.            The fact that we have confirmed these cases in Yukon shows our system to test for and detect cases is working. We have been working diligently within Yukon’s health care system to ensure we are ready to manage cases and to assist those who are self-isolating at home. Prompt case detection, isolation, and contact tracing in combination with the difficult societal measures that we are all facing, will mean that we can manage COVID-19 in a way that both protects the public and provides high quality care to those who are infected.       Yukon Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley           Contact   Patricia Living Communications, Health and Social Services 	867-667-3673patricia.living@gov.yk.ca     News release #:   20-066        "

Bill No. 9 would ban the practice of conversion therapy on minors or adults that have a court appointed guardian or substitute decision-maker and also clarify that conversion therapy is not an insured service. It would also introduce penalties for practicing conversion therapy in Yukon. The Government of Yukon has been conducting broad public engagement to increase inclusiveness for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, Two-Spirit, plus (LGBTQ2S+) Yukoners in government legislation, policies, programs and services. Throughout the public engagement, Yukoners made it clear that banning conversion therapy is a top priority. The proposed ban is one of the items in the government’s LGBTQ2S+ Action Plan, currently being developed based on engagement with Yukon’s LGBTQ2S+ community.            It is vital that we ensure our territory is inclusive and free of discrimination. Yukoners have called for conversion therapy to be banned in our territory and our government is listening and taking action to prevent this harmful practice from ever happening in the territory. This is not only about protecting Yukoners today, but also protecting the generations to follow us.      Minister responsible for the Women’s Directorate Jeanie Dendys            Quick facts       Conversion therapy qualifies as practices, treatments or services that are provided with the intent of changing a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity.  Conversion therapy does not include a range of legitimate medical and psychological practices around coping, social support, identity exploration and development, or gender-affirming surgery and related treatments.  A guardian or substitute decision-maker is someone who has been appointed to manage an adult’s personal affairs.  The Government of Canada tabled legislation on March 8, 2020 to amend the Criminal Code in order to ban and criminalize conversion therapy.  There are no documented cases of conversion therapy being practiced in Yukon.

Prior to making this decision I took into account the advice of the Chief Medical Officer of Health (CMOH) and my attendance at the Prospectors & Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) annual conference earlier this month. 	The risk for COVID-19 in Yukon and Canada remains low and Yukon’s medical system is well prepared for this situation. 	In making this decision, the CMOH and I considered what might happen if I needed to self-isolate outside of the Yukon and the impacts that would have. At this time, I feel my efforts are needed here at home. 	Obviously, this is an extremely rare situation and this is a precautionary measure. We see great value in these meetings and merit in attending. Today I spoke directly with the Prime Minister and am confident Yukon priorities will be shared at the meeting. 	Also out of an abundance of caution following today’s announcement about the case at PDAC, Minister Pillai is being tested for COVID-19 and will self-isolate until the results are clear. I understand that the Public Service Commission is also reaching out to employees who attended this event to share relevant information. 	Yukoners, I urge you to remain calm and to follow the advice of credible medical professionals. Yukon’s CMOH has been providing updates on the virus and is sharing these through local media and the Yukon.ca website as well as the CMOH site. 	The most clear and constant advice about this virus is to remain vigilant. Wash your hands, cover your mouth if you cough, disinfect objects you touch frequently, avoid close contact with people who are sick and stay home if you are not feeling well. 	If you are presenting with symptoms, contact a health provider through 811.

The rate change is expected to save Yukon businesses approximately $2 million per year.  The Bill also expands the eligibility for the Business Investment Tax Credit to encourage additional investment in Yukon businesses. Proposed income tax changes would result in Yukoners saving roughly $2.4 million in taxes per year – up to $9.6 million total – by 2023. The changes are geared towards low and middle-income earners and would align with recent adjustments made by the Government of Canada. Bill No. 8 would also modernize and simplify the Insurance Premium Tax Act to bring rates in line with the rest of Canada.            Our government is working hard to make life more affordable for Yukoners. This Bill delivers on two significant commitments we made to Yukon businesses and puts more money in the pockets of those who need it most.

The Small Business Investment Tax Credit would undergo the following changes: New title: Business Investment Tax Credit. Per company limit would change from $800,000 in any year to $4 million in any rolling four-year period. Maximum company size limit would change from $25 million in assets to $100 million until 2023. Test of 50 per cent of payroll in Yukon reduced to 25 per cent. Test of 50 per cent of assets in Yukon replaced with headquarters test.

This leave would be available to victims of domestic violence perpetrated by intimate partners or family members and to victims of sexualized violence. The proposed leave provisions would also apply to employees if their child or person they care for is a victim of domestic or sexualized violence.            Domestic and sexualized violence is a tragic reality that we know is under-reported and can be experienced by anyone. These leave provisions provide the time, flexibility and economic security for victims to get the support they choose. This is part of our government’s efforts to help those who have experienced violence and sexualized assault. Safe and supported employees make for healthier workplaces in our communities.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            Offering paid and unpaid leave for victims of domestic and sexualized violence would remove a large barrier for victims of sexualized and domestic violence. This represents one more step we are taking to support victims and employees in our territory.      Minister responsible for the Women’s Directorate Jeanie Dendys            Quick facts       All ten provinces and the Northwest Territories have enacted some version of leave for domestic violence. Yukon would join the six jurisdictions that also provide leave for sexualized violence. 	The approaches vary in length of leave provided, and whether it is paid or unpaid.  Rates of domestic violence in Yukon are three times the national average. Rates of sexualized violence in Yukon is also higher than the national average.  Canadian employers lose $77.9 million annually because of direct and indirect impacts of domestic violence.

Proposed amendments to the act clarify the technical requirements for validating a will, provide powers for courts to correct common errors and enable the creation of a registry of wills in the regulations. The proposed amendments incorporate feedback received through public engagement as well as a review of the Act. The Wills Act has not been amended since first coming into force in 1954.

Today the Arctic Winter Games Host Society, with the support of the Yukon government and the City of Whitehorse, announced that the Whitehorse 2020 Arctic Winter Games have been cancelled following a recommendation from Yukon’s acting Chief Medical Officer of Health. Cancelling the 2020 Arctic Winter Games was determined to be the most responsible precautionary measure to address concerns around the spread of COVID-19 and is supported by the Arctic Winter Games International Committee. Yukon’s medical system has been and remains well prepared to manage suspected cases of COVID-19 that may arise in Yukon. While there are no cases of COVID-19 in Yukon and the risks low, other regions are experiencing unexpected community spread of the virus. With up to 2000 visitors anticipated to arrive in Whitehorse for the Arctic Winter Games, necessary steps must be taken to ensure the health and safety of Yukoners and visitors to the territory. The organizers and co-hosts are disappointed to have to make this unfortunate decision and express deep gratitude to all those involved in preparing for the Whitehorse 2020 Arctic Winter Games.            The decision to cancel the Whitehorse 2020 Arctic Winter Games was not made easily but while we are disappointed, we are acting responsibly by following the recommendation of the Chief Medical Officer of Health. We will be meeting with the Host Society’s Board of Management, our funding partners and stakeholders over the coming days to build a plan for decommissioning the Games.      2020 AWG Host Society President George Arcand            It is out of an abundance of caution that today, as the Chief Medical Officer of Health, responsible for public health in the Yukon, I have recommended the cancellation of the 2020 Arctic Winter Games that were scheduled to be held here in Whitehorse beginning next week. I am making this recommendation out of concern for the health and safety of Yukoners, of all athletes, staff, volunteers and families, and for their home communities throughout the circumpolar North. COVID-19 is a contagious disease that spreads from person to person rapidly through respiratory secretions. In a setting like the Arctic Winter Games, even a suspected case would be devastating. It is with a heavy heart that I have had to make this recommendation. It is the responsible recommendation, and it is very unfortunate.      Yukon acting Chief Medical Officer of Health Catherine Elliott            Our government supports following the Chief Medical Officer of Health’s recommendation. We believe this is the most responsible course of action in light of concerns around the spread of COVID-19. This is a precautionary measure that is in the best interests of our athletes, support staff, families, and communities across the circumpolar North. We know how much effort has gone into preparing for these games. We thank all those who have helped to organize and prepare for them.      Premier Sandy Silver            We support the difficult but responsible decision to cancel the Games. Our community really stepped up for this event and I want to thank the nearly 2000 volunteers for their efforts and preparation for these Games.

Victims of sexualized assault now have more services available thanks to this initiative, which offers clients wrap-around emotional, medical and legal support. Key components of SART include a 24-hour, confidential, toll-free, Yukon-wide support line for all victims of sexualized assault; victim support workers available for after-hours support on weekends; and a roster of on-call physicians specially trained to support victims of sexualized assault. With SART, the choice of how to deal with a sexualized assault is up to the individual. There is no pressure to contact the police or do anything the individual is uncomfortable with. SART provides the services the individual asks for, even if that just means talking to someone and receiving emotional support. With core components of the SART program in place, ongoing training and collaboration of SART agencies will continue to ensure the full network of services is responsive to the needs of victims. Work is also underway to better integrate SART services into communities in a way that meets their unique needs. Hospital services are currently available in Dawson City and Watson Lake.            Given the high rates of sexualized violence against women and girls, particularly Indigenous women and girls, in Yukon, the Sexualized Assault Response Team has been a long time coming. I am proud of the dedication and effort that went into the implementation of SART. We are not done. We know we need to strengthen partnerships with First Nations governments to make sure culturally relevant and informal support options are available to victims of sexualized violence. I’m looking forward to continuing this work.      Minister responsible for the Women’s Directorate Jeanie Dendys            The goal of the Sexualized Assault Response Team is to provide the services victims need, when they need them so that they feel believed and supported. SART is designed to meet victims where they are and will support all victims of sexualized assault, inclusive of all genders.      Minister of Justice Tracy-Anne McPhee            As women, mothers, sisters and aunties, we understand the importance of this support team. We know that medical and mental health supports for victims are critical in terms of addressing needs. I am confident that the work that has gone into the SART initiative will provide the strongest support possible when victims of sexualized assaults need it the most.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            The unfortunate prevalence of sexualized assault makes SART an especially timely and vital support network for victims. Yukon Hospitals’ staff and physicians are committed to providing safe, sensitive, victim-focused medical care as a key part of this network, and we’ll continue working closely with system partners to strengthen and expand this important program.      Yukon Hospital Corporation Chair Brian Gillen            We are pleased to see the culmination of over a decade of work by front line agencies for the creation of a Sexualized Assault Response Team. The creation of this team will allow organizations and agencies to work together increasing capacity and support for people who have experienced sexualized violence. Every day, we are confronted by the barriers to accessing support services for people experiencing violence. We are hopeful that the SART will deepen the accessibility, reliability and depth of supports available to survivors empowering them to make informed decisions in their journey.      Women’s Transition Home Executive Director Barbara McInerney            Quick facts       Yukon has one of the highest rates of sexualized violence in the country and many cases are not reported. Several populations experience disproportionately high rates of sexualized violence, including women and girls between 15 and 25 years old, Indigenous people and LGBTQ2S+ folks.  The Sexualized Assault Response Team provides integrated services from different agencies. Supports include help with navigating processes, hospital services, reporting to RCMP, the support line and mental health services.  As a result of the Sexualized Assault Response Team, victims of sexualized violence in Whitehorse and rural communities have priority access to mental wellness care through Mental Wellness and Substance Use hubs.  With SART, you can phone 1-844-967-7275 anywhere in the territory, to talk to a trained professional confidentially and anonymously about your options and to get support.

With a $4.1 million surplus, the 2020–21 Budget includes major funding for community infrastructure, housing, health and education. Building a prosperous Yukon continues to be a priority with a cut to the small business tax rate from two per cent to zero as well as an expansion of the Business Investment Tax Credit to better support Yukon businesses. Cutting the small business tax rate would save Yukon businesses $2 million per year. Proposed changes to the Yukon Basic Personal Amount under the Income Tax Act geared towards low and middle-income earners will also result in Yukoners saving around $2.4 million in taxes per year – up to $9.6 million total – by 2023. Investments in community recreation facilities throughout the territory will support healthy, active living for Yukoners. Highlights include money for the completion of the new Carmacks arena, upgrades to the arena in Mayo, new pools in Pelly Crossing and Ross River, and completion of the state-of-the-art track and field facilities at F.H. Collins Secondary School. Education highlights include funding to complete construction of the new French first language high school as well as planning for new schools in Whistle Bend and Burwash Landing. Major investments in Yukon’s health care system will support implementation of 1Health, a modern, integrated health information system for Yukon’s hospitals and health facilities. Permanent funding for Yukon’s new expanded orthopedic surgery program is also included in the budget to improve access to care for Yukoners and reduce the need for medical travel. Significant investments across Yukon’s housing spectrum include funding for a major mixed-use housing project in downtown Whitehorse as well as multi-unit housing projects in Old Crow and Carcross. Approximately $27 million is included to develop residential lots in Yukon communities, including Whitehorse. An additional $30 million is allotted for retrofits to help Yukoners and Yukon businesses make their homes and facilities more energy efficient. A Five-Year Capital Plan along with the Fiscal and Economic Outlook for Yukon accompany the 2020–21 Budget. The Capital Plan supports First Nations, municipalities, and the private sector to coordinate and plan to meet the needs of Yukoners in all communities. The Fiscal and Economic Outlook shows a territory experiencing the benefits of a strong, growing and diversified economy.            Our government has been working hard to put Yukon’s finances on a sustainable path and create an environment for Yukon’s people and economy to thrive. Returning to a surplus reflects our commitment to sound fiscal management and making responsible financial decisions for the benefit of all Yukoners. This budget builds on our recent progress and once again puts Yukoners first.       Premier and Minister of Finance Sandy Silver            Quick facts       Yukon’s total budget for 2020–21 is $1.62 billion. Operating and maintenance expenses will be $1.25 billion. Capital spending is almost $370 million.  The 2020–21 Main Estimates show an annual surplus of approximately $4.1 million.  The Government of Yukon will also table an Interim Supply Bill worth $338 million. The Bill will fund operations and maintenance spending for the first two months of the 2020–21 fiscal year while the full year of spending authority is debated in the legislature. Of that amount, $271 million is for operations and maintenance spending and $67 million is for capital expenditures.   The Government of Yukon will also table a Second Supplementary Estimates for the 2019–20 fiscal year with an additional $19 million in spending and a revised deficit of $18.5 million.

Following a motion brought forward in May 2017 by MLA Paolo Gallina, the government undertook public engagement on the possibility. After Yukoners adjust their clocks on March 8, the territory will remain on Pacific Daylight Saving Time. The recent seasonal time change survey drew more than 4,800 responses from Yukon people and organizations, with most in favour of putting an end to the practice. The What We Heard report released today shows that 93 per cent of Yukoners who participated want seasonal time changes to stop. Of those, 70 per cent are in favour of permanent Pacific Daylight Saving Time.            Yukoners clearly want to see an end to seasonal time change and we are listening. The response to this engagement speaks to the importance of this issue for people. Thank you to everyone who took the time to voice an opinion. This helped our government make an informed decision for Yukon.      Premier Sandy Silver            Quick facts       The spring 2020 seasonal time change will go ahead as planned this Sunday, March 8. After that, Yukon will remain on Pacific Daylight Saving Time.  The engagement ran from January 6 to February 16 of this year. Among other things, Yukoners were asked whether they want to keep the twice-annual time change or permanently adopt a single time.  More than 4,800 organizations and individuals responded to the online survey. That’s 1,500 more than 2017’s engagement on cannabis, which was previously the highest. The government also received over 35 written and emailed submissions from a broad group of organizations and individuals from across the territory.  Many jurisdictions in western North America are reviewing how they set and observe time for a number of reasons, including public health, energy and the economy.

This new partnership will increase focus on early intervention and support of independent dialysis options. A primary goal will be to work with patients early in their kidney disease process to help maintain kidney function without requiring dialysis. Yukoners identified as candidates for peritoneal or home dialysis will be supported to receive training in B.C., and provided with the home equipment, and where necessary, home supports to ensure a positive outcome. A review by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health recommends independent, home-based dialysis as the preferred first option for patients requiring dialysis. Home-based dialysis is just as effective as hemodialysis provided in a hospital setting. This release has been updated to clarify medical terminology.            We are committed to providing Yukoners with access to the care they need, where they need it. I am very pleased to announce that with the support of BC Renal Agency, Yukoners with Chronic Kidney Disease will now receive increased support here at home.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            BC’s Kidney care community is proud and privileged to continue to be able to support those living in the Yukon with kidney disease. This new initiative will formalize the range of services across the continuum to improve outcomes and ensure the sustainability of the best kidney care for people in the territory.      BC Renal executive director Dr. Adeera Levin            Quick facts       There are approximately 61 individuals in Yukon with diagnosed chronic kidney disease. None of them currently require dialysis.  As of October 2019, there were 10 Yukon patients on peritoneal dialysis in Yukon. There were none on home hemodialysis. That number has fluctuated between zero and two for the past six years; the peritoneal numbers have fluctuated between four and 10. 	   The Government of Yukon and BC Renal Agency are setting the framework to improve services and better support patients with kidney disease in territory. This is a first in the 30-year history of renal care delivery in the territory.   This framework includes exploring early intervention, prevention and localized navigational support to help prevent progression early. These are fundamental first steps to building capacity and sustainability of renal services and optimizing outcomes for Yukoners.  It is estimated it would cost between $2.5 and $3 million to establish an in-centre hemodialysis unit. Establishing a home dialysis program will cost less than $1 million and would permit the care of a larger number of individuals. As part of the agreement, government is working with B.C. Renal on actual costs to deliver a home dialysis program. Even with an in-centre dialysis unit, end stage kidney patients would still have to travel to B.C. or Alberta for this very specialized care.

The event includes a zero-emission car and trade show with local dealerships and local owners putting their electric vehicles on display. The Yukon Transportation Museum is also unveiling two new exhibits on the history and the future of electric vehicles in the North. The public can interact with zero-emission vehicles and speak to local owners about tips and tricks of owning and operating an electric vehicle in Yukon.            The Government of Canada is committed to getting more zero-emission vehicles on our roads, which is a practical and effective way for Canadians to do their part to fight pollution and create a more sustainable future. We are pleased to collaborate with the Government of Yukon to ensure Canadians can make informed decisions when choosing their next vehicle.      Canada’s Minister of Natural Resources Seamus O’Regan             We are proud to support the Government of Yukon’s effort to raise awareness of zero emission vehicles and their use in northern climates. Investments such as these will help Yukoners make greener choices — improving air quality, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and bringing us closer to a zero-emission future.      Member of Parliament for Yukon, Larry Bagnell            The interest in electric vehicles is high in Yukon. The Government of Yukon aims to increase the use of electric vehicles, as it significantly reduces our greenhouse gas emissions. This event will raise awareness and offer practical ways of learning about how electric vehicles perform in our cold climate.      Minister of Department Energy Mines and Resources Ranj Pillai            At the Yukon Transportation Museum we share the compelling stories behind Yukon transportation: planes, trains, trucks, dogs, horses, people. The underlying infrastructure and energy networks are complex, dynamic and equally engaging. How have Yukoners met their needs for transportation and energy in changing circumstances, technologies, seasons since time immemorial? The answer is, exactly as we are doing now, with thoughtfulness, ingenuity and self-sufficiency.      Executive Director of Yukon Transportation Museum Janna Swales            Quick facts       The Government of Canada’s Zero-Emission Vehicle Awareness Initiative is providing $48,500 to raise awareness about zero-emission vehicles in Yukon, including by supporting the Electric Vehicle Discovery Day. The Government of Yukon is investing $41,500 and the Yukon Transportation Museum is contributing $4,500 to this project.  There will be at least six zero-emission electric vehicles participating in the event.  According to Yukon Bureau of Statistics, there are currently 16 electric vehicles registered in Yukon.  Our Clean Future, Yukon’s draft strategy for climate change, energy and a green economy, proposes to have more than 6,000 zero-emission vehicles registered in the territory by 2030; provide a rebate to Yukon businesses and individuals who purchase eligible zero-emissions vehicles; and continue to install fast-charging stations across Yukon to make it possible to travel between all road-accessible Yukon communities by 2027.

The plan will see two tenants move in each week until the building is full. The 16-unit building is the first Housing First project in the territory and signifies the Government of Yukon’s commitment to addressing homelessness and poverty in Yukon. Housing First is a modern, progressive approach to addressing poverty that centres on providing immediate access to permanent homes with no ‘readiness’ requirements, such as needing citizens to be alcohol- or drug-free. It is recovery-oriented and focused on consumer choice, self-determination and community integration. The goal is to encourage housing stability and improved quality of life and foster self-sufficiency. It is a key part of the housing continuum in Whitehorse and provides an additional option for some of the most vulnerable homeless citizens in Yukon. The total project cost was $4.4 million, which included design, site and utilities preparation, and construction. Several non-government agencies provide outreach and ongoing client support services. This work will continue with shelter residents.            Knowing that people are moving into their new homes, and hearing they feel safe and secure lets me know that we have done the right thing to support those who are most in need. This is a critical part of the housing continuum, and I am pleased that our government is taking active steps towards addressing the housing and support needs of some of the most vulnerable members of our community.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Quick facts       Resident selection was done through the Coordinated Access partners using the By Name List and other sources to ensure that people who most need this type of housing can access it.

254,2020-02-28,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/second-wave-seasonal-flu-hits-yukon,Government Website,Second wave of seasonal flu hits Yukon,"           Published 28/02/2020        Yukon is seeing increasing numbers of influenza, with 75 cases confirmed in Yukon so far this flu season. In the last five weeks alone, 43 cases of influenza have been confirmed. In addition to the increase in influenza activity, there is also an increase in respiratory illness caused by other viruses. Yukoners are encouraged to receive their immunization against the seasonal flu, especially those with chronic medical conditions, as well as those over 65, pregnant women, and young children. The vaccine is free and available to everyone over the age of six months through local health centres in the communities and the Whitehorse Health centre. For more information on flu clinic location and times: https://yukonimmunization.ca/diseases-vaccines/influenza. If you think you have influenza and you are at high risk of severe influenza, seek early care from your health care provider. Seek medical care if you become very sick or are worried about your illness.            Influenza hit early, then waned and we are now seeing a second wave, with an increase in the number of confirmed cases in the past five weeks. The most effective way for Yukoners to protect themselves is to receive their seasonal influenza immunization. The vast majority of the cases of confirmed influenza in the territory are in those individuals who have not received their immunization.      Yukon’s Acting Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Catherine Elliott            Quick facts       The following everyday practices help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including influenza: wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available; avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands; avoid close contact with people who are sick; clean and disinfect objects and surfaces that are touched a lot; cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, then throw the tissue immediately into the trash; or cover your mouth and nose with your inner elbow when you cough or sneeze; and, stay home when you are sick to avoid spreading the virus to others.  Influenza can cause serious illness and hospitalization among those with chronic conditions.  Symptoms of influenza include rapid onset of high fever, cough, sore throat, aches, pains and chills.  Rest and treatment of symptoms are usually all that is needed. People who suspect they have the flu should avoid spreading it by staying home until they feel better.  People with severe symptoms, or who get the flu on top of underlying health conditions, should get medical advice by either calling the Yukon HealthLine at 811 or consulting with their health care provider.  The vaccine is safe and it takes about two weeks for the influenza vaccine to become effective.

Cultural practices, such as sweat ceremonies and drumming circles, have been incorporated into the correctional centre’s regular operations, along with cultural awareness training for staff, the hiring of a full-time First Nation liaison and a contribution of 30 books with First Nations content to the facility’s library. These projects support the Government of Yukon’s commitment to address 40 recommendations made by legal advisor David Loukidelis, following his independent inspection of the WCC, which began in January 2018. The report, released publicly August 15, 2018, made recommendations for cultural programming to improve outcomes for First Nations individuals in Yukon’s justice system. The outdoor sweat lodge was constructed at WCC in the fall, with the first sweat ceremony taking place in October 2019.            We have known for a long time that access to cultural activities, and the outdoors, is vital to inmates’ mental well-being and future successes. I am so pleased that we have been able to partner with First Nations to support inmates on this truly important project.      Minister of Justice Tracy-Anne McPhee            CYFN is committed to the task of improving the lives of all Yukon First Nations by facilitating a re-connection with culture.

The Dynamic Speed Display Sign Program will see mobile radar speed signs alongside targeted RCMP enforcement at 10 high-infraction locations in Whitehorse. The signs and RCMP enforcement will be established for up to four weeks per location. Radar signs are a proven road safety countermeasure and have been shown to have a significant impact on increasing compliance with posted speed limits.            Reckless drivers needlessly endanger the vast majority of citizens who follow the rules of the road. We are proud to partner with the City of Whitehorse and RCMP in this effort to reduce dangerous driving.      Minister of Highways and Public Works Richard Mostyn            We have heard from residents and understand that the safety of our roadways is a top issue.

The in-territory orthopedic program brings specialized care closer to home, improving access and continuity of care for patients, and reducing travel time and costs for families. It also reduces pressures on medical travel as well as demands on visiting specialists. With two surgeons, the program now provides emergency and on-call services and is better able to manage wait times for total knee replacements. Dr. Scott Westberg, who specializes in lower leg extremities, has joined Dr. Curtis Myden at the Surgeon’s Clinic at Whitehorse General Hospital. Dr. Westberg is originally from Yukon, and was a recipient of the Yukon Medical Education Bursary.  The name of the bursary has been corrected and updated.            We are excited to welcome Dr. Westberg to the orthopedics program at the Whitehorse General Hospital. Since we introduced the first resident orthopedic surgeon in 2017, more Yukoners have been getting the care they need, closer to home. We’ve reduced the number of Yukoners waiting for consultations and surgeries, and the addition of Dr. Westberg will help us continue this important work.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Expanding the orthopedic program means more Yukoners get the surgery they need, when they need it. Now, even more patients can prepare for, have, and recover from these important operations right here in Yukon. We are proud to partner with physicians and the Government of Yukon and confident this expansion will help us transform orthopedic care for years to come.      Chair of Yukon Hospital Corporation Brian Gillen            It’s exciting to have Dr. Westberg join me. He brings expertise in foot, ankle and knee replacement and trauma surgery. We plan to continue to improve and advance orthopedic care for Yukoners.

This summit is a great opportunity to share stories about the collaboration underway with Yukon First Nations in Yukon schools to support student learning and outcomes for all students, including examples of how Yukon First Nations ways of knowing, doing and being are included in Yukon’s curriculum and school programs.      Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee            We are honoured to be co-hosting the C21 CEO Academy Winter meetings with the Yukon Department of Education in Whitehorse. The Shifting Minds Acknowledgement is a token of our appreciation in recognition of our partnership, and leadership and innovative spirit demonstrated by the Yukon Department of Education.

The Government of Yukon’s Community Development Fund provided funding to the Whitehorse Firefighters Charitable Society to purchase the textile baler to help recycle clothing and divert it from Yukon’s landfills. The baler has been installed on location at Raven Recycling and will be operated and maintained by Raven Recycling staff. As a part of this initiative, recycling depots outside of Whitehorse are also accepting textiles. The Government of Yukon is transporting fabrics from rural depots back to Whitehorse, where Raven Recycling will process and ship them south for recycling.            We are proud to support this initiative through the Community Development Fund. This project is set to make an impact on waste diversion and the amount of textiles in our landfills. Thank you to the Whitehorse Firefighters Charitable Society and Raven Recycling for partnering on this exciting project.      Minister of Economic Development Ranj Pillai            Finding a way to repurpose and reuse clothing is always the best option, and we know Yukoners are great at coming up with creative solutions to reduce waste. It is also necessary, that as a territory, we have a viable option for recycling textiles. Thank you to Raven Recycling and the Whitehorse Firefighters Charitable Society, for expanding and improving recycling in the territory.      Minister of Community Services John Streicker            A growing problem of textiles was over burdening local second-hand clothing locations with costs, they were overjoyed when we said we would accept their clothing for free. Monetary value was not high enough to entice private industry to grapple with this growing problem. Our two organizations working together with common mandates to help their community were able to offset the pressure faced by second-hand organizations.      Whitehorse Firefighters Charitable Society Textile Program Director Nick O’Carroll            Recycling is the best option for textiles that can’t be reused or repurposed locally. In 2018, Raven diverted 117,000 lbs of textiles from local landfills. This recycled material displaces virgin material in the textiles economy, reducing the pollution, resource use and energy consumption associated with new products.      Raven Recycling Executive Director Joy Snyder            Quick facts       In June 2017, Raven Recycling and Whitehorse Firefighters Charitable Society created a social enterprise to divert, bale and sell re-usable textiles to a market in British Columbia.  In 2018, City of Whitehorse commissioned a study that estimated that 200,000 to 300,000 pounds of re-usable textiles enter the City of Whitehorse landfill each year.  Reusing or repurposing textiles locally is preferable to recycling. Examples of this include thrifting, clothing swaps or crafting.  To recycle your textiles, make sure they are clean and bagged and drop them off at Raven Recycling or at your local recycling depot. Dirty textiles will not be recycled. Shoes, belts and purses are not accepted for recycling.

Midwives will be employees of the Government of Yukon to ensure Yukoners have access to sustainable and integrated midwifery services. Development of a model of care was informed by extensive research, input from public engagement, the work of the Midwifery Advisory Committee, and a recommendation received from the Canadian Association of Midwives. The first action under the approved model will be to hire a Midwifery Consultant to coordinate the planning and program implementation. The position will be responsible for leading an Implementation Advisory Committee made up of a wide variety of stakeholders.

The Government of Yukon is currently working with the Midwifery Advisory Committee to review draft regulations. The final regulations are expected for 2020 and will come into force with the launch of the midwifery program.            We are very excited to move this initiative forward so that Yukoners can have another safe option that supports healthy pregnancies, childbirth and post-natal care. By working in partnership with all health care providers we are ensuring midwifery is integrated into Yukon’s healthcare system in a safe and sustainable way that provides Yukoners with access to the right care, at the right time and in the right place.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            We are committed to providing regulated and funded midwifery services for Yukon families. Draft regulations and the approved model of care both mark significant milestones. We look forward to working with the Midwifery Advisory Committee, stakeholders and communities as we create a sustainable path forward for midwifery in the Yukon.

The governments will be partnering with the agricultural sector, as well as academic and community leaders, to develop and share expertise specific to growing in northern latitudes. Topics of discussion will include limitations in temperature and duration of seasons, as well as supporting business relationships among different farmers, food processors and agriculture service suppliers in both areas. Targeted goals will include: Expanding local food and beverage production through a farmer/rancher forum that supports networking, knowledge transfer and business relationships.  Developing and sharing expertise around farm management in remote settings. Partnering with academic institutions to help northern growers and food processing sectors grow and commercialize products. Reducing barriers to agricultural trade between neighbouring jurisdictions. Increasing producers’ access to processing and retail markets and shared inspection services; for example, increasing access to meat inspections through shared inspection services or mobile abattoirs. The governments also committed to supporting a larger role for Indigenous peoples in northern agriculture and sustainable food production by working with Indigenous communities to develop business opportunities and traditional-food-based initiatives.            Yukon and British Columbia share common challenges and opportunities in our efforts to encourage local food production in northern communities. The new Memorandum of Understanding emphasizes that by working together and sharing expertise we can better promote food security, promote agricultural production, develop sustainably and grow market opportunities for northern farmers and ranchers.      Yukon Energy, Mines and Resources Minister Ranj Pillai            Working together is key to life in Canada’s North, and the partnership between farmers, Indigenous communities, experts and governments will help increase local food production and economic activity. Our cooperative efforts will encourage greater involvement and awareness of local food, and help more people in Yukon and Northern B.C. enjoy the flavours and benefits of products from their communities.       British Columbia Agriculture Minister Lana Popham           Backgrounder   Agriculture in Yukon Yukon’s agriculture industry is expanding. Recent census information reported an increase in the number of farms and farm receipts between 2011 and 2016, and Yukon farms are increasingly supplying vegetables, preserves, dairy, eggs, honey, jams, meats, fresh produce, sod and bedding plants into the local market. In 2019, there was a record number of inspected slaughters in Yukon. A total of 536 cattle, elk, sheep, goats, swine and rabbits were processed and inspected through abattoirs, and Yukon’s mobile abattoir added stops to two communities, broadening the access to inspected slaughter for farmers outside of Whitehorse. Graded egg production has also increased dramatically since 2016. The Local Food Strategy for Yukon, adopted in 2016, encourages the production and consumption of Yukon-grown food, supports local food producers and strengthens the relationship between Yukoners, Yukon farmers and food.  Since 2018, Yukon has committed over $1.3 million to 173 agriculture projects throughout Yukon in a bilateral agreement with the Government of Canada under the Canadian Agricultural Partnership. These programs provide funding for industry projects that further strengthen Yukon’s local food production. 		  Agriculture in British Columbia B.C. farmers, ranchers, seafood and processing workers contributed to a record-setting year in 2018, with annual revenue from businesses in those sectors reaching $15 billion for the first time. B.C. consumers and companies continue to be the main buyers of B.C. products, with an estimated $6.4 billion of purchases. The Ministry of Agriculture began a new mandate in 2017 to support B.C. farmers through a three-pronged approach: 		​  		Grow B.C., which creates a network of food hubs supporting entrepreneurs and food processors around the province, and has programs to increase production and support new farmers; Feed B.C., which encourages the use of local products in government-operated institutions and facilities; and Buy B.C., which is helping more than 200 local companies promote their products in B.C., as well as developing partnerships supporting local foods in retailers.

283,2020-01-06,Canada,Yukon,,https://yukon.ca/en/news/public-engagement-seasonal-time-change-launches,Government Website,Public engagement on seasonal time change launches,"           Published 06/01/2020        The Government of Yukon is opening a public engagement today on seasonal time change. Yukoners are being asked whether they want to keep the twice-annual time change or permanently adopt a single time. The public engagement also asks Yukoners whether they’d prefer Pacific Daylight Saving Time or Pacific Standard Time if the time change is dropped. Yukon currently observes Pacific Standard Time in the winter months and Pacific Daylight Saving Time in the summer. Yukoners can participate in an online survey, which is also available in print form, or share their views by email or mail. Other governments in Yukon as well as businesses, organizations and individuals are also invited to provide their written feedback by email or mail. Through the engagement, people can let the government know which option would best fit their lifestyle and why. The Government of Yukon will consider the input, as well as scientific research and the decisions of neighbouring jurisdictions, when it determines how Yukon should observe time in the future.            Jurisdictions across Canada and Pacific North America are re-examining the way they observe time and potential changes could impact our territory. We need to make a decision on what time regime works best for Yukon and we want to know what Yukoners think before we make that call.      Premier Sandy Silver            Quick facts       If Yukon permanently adopts Pacific Daylight Saving Time, summer time would be the same as it has for years, sunrises and sunsets would happen one hour later in the winter, and the territory would align with British Columbia when it makes its permanent time change.  If Yukon were to stay on year-round Pacific Standard Time, winter time would be the same as it is now, sunrises and sunsets would happen one hour earlier in the summer, the territory would permanently be behind British Columbia when it makes its permanent time change, and Yukon would be an additional hour away from other Canadian jurisdictions when they are on Daylight Saving Time (e.g., Alberta would be two hours ahead, Ontario would be four hours ahead).  Many jurisdictions in western North America are reviewing how they set and observe time for a number of reasons, including public health, energy, and the economy. Following their own public engagement, the Government of British Columbia introduced legislation in 2019 to get rid of the seasonal time change and adopt a new permanent Pacific Time equivalent to Pacific Daylight Saving Time.

There are now three resident psychiatrists working in the territory, based out of a new private practice in Whitehorse. A new model of care has also been introduced. General psychiatric services are being provided at the private clinic and at Whitehorse General Hospital. Treatment services are offered through Mental Wellness and Substance Use Services and the Referred Care Clinic. This model takes a holistic and multidisciplinary approach to mental healthcare. Over the coming year, the psychiatric group will also develop a plan to provide both in-person and virtual care to rural Yukon communities, as well as ensuring 24/7 on-call hospital coverage.            Improving the mental wellness of Yukoners is a priority of our government because we recognize that healthy minds are just as important as healthy bodies. This is yet another important step toward ensuring that Yukoners have the mental health supports they need, when and where they need them.      Minister of Health and Social Services Pauline Frost            Now that we have a critical mass of specialists, it should be easier to attract and keep new psychiatrists in Yukon in the future. We are starting a number of innovative programs aimed at improving access to psychiatric and addictions care in all of our communities. We are also actively recruiting other psychiatrists to help us on a part-time or full-time basis. We are after a long-term, sustainable solution for psychiatric services in the territory. Doctors Jill Boyd, Dorothy Kuk and I are happy to be providing patient-centred care in a supportive environment.      Dr. Leo Elwell, Psychiatrist            Quick facts       All three resident psychiatrists are Canadian-trained, fully qualified Fellows of the Royal College of Physicians of Canada.

These preliminary plans ensure schools follow the health and safety guidelines from the Chief Medical Officer of Health. Planning for the 2020–21 school year is an ongoing process. Yukon First Nations, school councils and education partners will continue to be engaged and their feedback incorporated as planning continues for the 2020–21 school year. School principals will share finalized school operational plans with school communities in August before the start of the 2020–21 school year. Rural school operations in the 2020–21 school year Rural schools have the flexibility in their learning spaces to safely bring back all students to the school while following health and safety guidelines. This is why all Kindergarten to Grade 12 students in rural schools return to full-day in-class instruction five days per week. Whitehorse school operations in the 2020–21 school year In Whitehorse, Kindergarten to Grade 9 students in Whitehorse will also return to full-day, in-class instruction five days per week. Grades 10 to 12 students will return to half-day in-class instruction and half-day learning away from school five days per week. This arrangement for Grades 10 to 12 students will be monitored and assessed as part of planning for the second semester of the school year. Resource programs for students with disabilities, transitions programs and other programs for students needing additional support will continue at school all day, five days per week. This approach ensures schools are following the health and safety guidelines from the Chief Medical Officer of Health and ensures all students have time and support from their teachers every day and regular routines for learning. The Department of Education will monitor the situation and advice on the pandemic over the first semester to assess the possibility of safely returning Grades 10 to 12 students to more usual class sizes and schedules in the second semester. Grades 10 to 12 students will continue to take four courses per semester and school staff will work with students and families to assign morning or afternoon classes in their school at the start of the school year. These students will also be able to access supports for learning away from schools through virtual or in-person study halls with teachers. Temporary school programming relocation To meet the health and safety guidelines for schools, support safe spacing, and manage traffic flows in schools, some school programming needs to be temporarily relocated for the 2020–21 school year. To support safe spacing at F.H. Collins Secondary, the Grade 8 classes from F.H. Collins Secondary will be moved to the Wood Street Centre for the 2020–21 school year. The Wood Street Centre programs will move into available space at Porter Creek Secondary for the school year.  No other groups of students or programs are expected to need relocation. Student learning in the 2020–21 school year As part of Yukon’s modernized curriculum, teachers and students will continue to use technology as part of learning to develop digital literacy and skills they will need for their lives and careers. For the 2020–21 school year, educators will continue to build these skills with students through blended learning, which combines: face-to-face teaching and learning, where students apply their knowledge, deepen their understanding and demonstrate their learning with their teachers, including teacher-led activities, on the land learning opportunities, workstations and labs; student-led learning where students use digital tools to gather information through inquiry, reading, research and work on assignments, including online tools, resources, and collaboration; teachers support, instruction and feedback both in person and online; and students learning skills for success to manage some of their own learning, including goal setting, organization, prioritizing and time management, with some flexibility for the time, place and pace of their learning. Students in Kindergarten to Grade 3 will have traditional direct instruction and support from teachers for their learning. Students in Grades 4 to 9 students will have both face-to-face activities with their teachers and classmates and digital activities with technology and online tools. Students in Grades 10 to 12 will learn for the half the day with face-to-face activities with their teachers and classmates in school and learn for the other half of the day away from school with digital activities with technology and online tools. More information about student learning in the coming school year is available in the Yukon Learning Continuity Requirements 2020–21. Student transportation School bus services for the 2020–21 school year are being adapted based on recommendations of the Chief Medical Officer of Health, including fewer students riding the bus to support safe spacing. The Chief Medical Officer of Health and the Department of Education encourage families to arrange for students to walk, cycle, drive or carpool to transport students between home and school this year if possible. Detailed school bus operational guidelines, including number of students per seat, loading and unloading procedures, and cleaning protocols will be released later in July. Further health and safety guidelines and planning details for the coming school year will be shared as they become available over the summer.            The wellbeing of students and staff is our priority. We are working to ensure Yukon schools are safe and healthy environments for returning to class and that all students have face-to-face opportunities to learn with their teachers and classmates while following the health and safety guidance from the Chief Medical Officer of Health. Plans for the 2020–21 school year include flexibility to adjust operations or reduce the number of students in schools if necessary. We continue to work with school communities, School Councils, Yukon First Nations and the Yukon Teachers’ Association on operational planning to meet the unique needs and context of each school community.      Minister of Education Tracy-Anne McPhee            Getting children back into schools is critical for their health and learning success. Keeping children out of school for too long can result in long lasting emotional, and mental health effects. Students rely on teachers, counsellors, support staff and fellow students for formal and informal mental wellbeing and support, while continued closures can expose children to social isolation and boredom. Much work has gone into our efforts between the Department of Education and my team to ensure we have the proper protective measures in place to get children and youth back into a familiar environment and to thrive in a renewed educational environment that also supports and protects teachers and staff.      Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Brendan Hanley            Quick facts       Planning for the 2020–21 school year is ongoing. Yukon First Nations, school councils and education partners will continue to be engaged and their feedback incorporated as planning continues for the 2020–21 school year.  The Commission scolaire francophone du Yukon is working with its school community to determine plans for operational plans at École Émilie-Tremblay and Académie Parhélie for the 2020–21 school year.  Finalized school operational plans will be shared with school communities in August before the start of the 2020–21 school year.  Learning time with teachers will focus on applying skills and developing understanding and learning time away from school will focus on independent reading, research and assignments.  Grades 10 to 12 students will be able to access additional support for learning away from school through virtual or in-person study halls with teachers.
